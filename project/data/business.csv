When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay?

Focus on simplification & lower compliance burden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/focus-on-simplification-lower-compliance-burden/articleshow/118230863.cms,"Representative image

Tax certainty and ease of paying taxes have been given consistent priority by govt in the last few years. In keeping with these principles, the new Income Tax Bill, 2025 sets out to achieve the fundamental objectives of simplification in language, reducing litigation, weeding out redundant provisions and lowering compliance burden . A preliminary study of the bill shows that it proposes many positive features to meet these goals.The bill offers a shorter legislation with section count reduced from over 800 to 536, and word count cut by 40-50%. New schedules are organised in a reader-friendly way and the proposed law will have sixteen schedules instead of the current fourteen. To maintain stability, the new bill continues with the current structure of twenty-three chapters and heads of income. The substantive provisions and the assessment and appeal procedures are also the same. Tax rates will be determined by the Finance Act each year.The bill has positive simplification aspects. It introduces the concept of 'tax year' of twelve months in place of complicated terms like 'previous year' and 'assessment year' to provide greater clarity about the period for tax payments, income tax return filing, and other tax compliances. Generally, the tax year will begin from April 1 and end on March 31 of the following year.The language has been simplified by removing the numerous 'provisos', 'explanations', and old legal jargons. For instance, the bill replaces the phrase 'notwithstanding anything contained' by 'irrespective of anything contained' to make it easier for taxpayers to read the law. Where required, formulas and tables have been introduced to crisply present the provisions. Especially for subjects like salary perquisites, presumptive taxation, and withholding tax rates and thresholds, this approach would be helpful in clearly understanding the requirements. The detailed/multiple sub-sections under main sections in the current law have been shifted to distinct schedules. For example, existing Section 10 that lists out all types of exempt incomes has been moved to seven different schedules in the bill. Removal of outdated sections, like provisions for investment allowances on new plant and machinery, has also helped clean out the legislation.The bill allows a taxpayer to apply for lower withholding tax certificate under all TDS/TCS provisions instead of only a select few under the current law. This will reduce compliance for taxpayers at large. In another positive, the bill proposes an option to non-resident shipping and airline companies to offer lower income than presumptive computation by maintaining tax audited books.The bill would be examined by a Parliamentary Committee. We hope, the opportunity would be used for consultation and debate on some aspects. The bill seems to withdraw the current deduction for inter-corporate dividends for companies that opt for concessional tax rate of 22%. This may bring back the cascading impact of tax on dividends, that the current law addresses. Surely, basis consultations some of these aspects will be reviewed now, and over time some other issues persisting in the existing Act would be dealt with.It is well-acknowledged that economies with simple and well-designed tax systems can incentivise compliance and boost businesses activity, ultimately resulting in higher economic growth, investments and employment. Income Tax Bill, 2025 reflects govt's sincere commitment towards creating a more transparent and conducive tax environment that will help save time and costs for both the tax administration and the taxpayers. It is an imperative step in govt's continuing focus on reforms, and the momentum must continue.(Gupta is India tax leader and Mathur is tax director, EY.

I-T Bill 2025 referred to Parliament's select committee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/i-t-bill-2025-referred-to-parliaments-select-committee/articleshow/118230790.cms,"Parliament

NEW DELHI: A select committee of the Parliament will vet the Income Tax bill, after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced it in Lok Sabha on Thursday, and urged the Speaker that it be referred for the parliamentary panel's scrutiny. The select committee will submit its report on the first day of the monsoon session.The bill was introduced after objections from MPs N K Premachandran, Manish Tewari and Saugata Roy were overruled. The three members had questioned the bill's introduction on various grounds.Sitharaman said Premachandran's objection that the proposed bill was increasing the total sections was incorrect. She said when the bill was enacted in 1961, it had 298 sections which, with time, went up to 819 sections, while the new bill was bringing them down to 536 sections. She said that the bill is half the size of the current law in terms of the word count - 2.6 lakh instead of 5.1 lakh.She said Premachandran should compare the proposed bill with where it stands at present, instead of where it was in 1961. She also dismissed Premachandran's claim that ""objects and reasons"" of the new bill were different from those of the original bill.The tax department said that it followed a detailed exercise with a team of 150 officers to draft the new bill over the last six months. The focus has been on making the law shorter and simpler by doing away with obsolete provisions, 900 provisos and close to 1,200 explanations and introducing tables and formulae.The tax department said the bill lays down the administrative framework, assigns roles and responsibilities for assessing officers, taxpayers, tax deductors and professionals. In addition, it sets out the framework for income determination, timelines, appellate procedures, enforcement, assessments, and penalties.""With the new Income Tax Bill, 2025 being tabled in Parliament, the process to repeal over-six-decades-old tax code is underway, which over the years had become complex, as tax laws were amended to keep pace with emerging business realities... Perhaps the expectations that the proposed bill would also herald a new era of dispute resolution mechanism may not have been addressed, however the door is not closed considering govt's repeated acknowledgement of the need to address burgeoning tax disputes,"" said Naveen Aggarwal, partner-tax at KPMG in India.","A select committee of the parliament will vet the income tax bill.

The most important takeaway from the new income tax rules for the upcoming financial year is that individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh will have to pay ZERO tax. For salaried individuals, once the standard deduction of Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime is counted, this income level goes up to Rs 12.75 lakh.Additionally, across the board income tax slab changes mean that individuals under the new tax regime, will now have to pay lower taxes, even at income levels above Rs 12 lakh. There is also the concept of marginal relief, which allows individuals earning just above Rs 12 lakh to not pay taxes more than their additional income.The total tax benefit of slab rate changes and rebate at different income levels can be illustrated with examples:Confused about the new income tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime?

Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs. 12 lakhs. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.Yes, the limit of total income for NIL tax payments in the new tax regime has been increased to Rs. 12 lakhs in this budget provided the taxpayer files ITR to avail the rebate.Earlier the limit of income for nil tax payment was Rs 7 lakh. By increasing this limit to Rs 12 lakh around one crore assessees who were earlier required to pay tax varying from Rs 20,000 to Rs 80,000 will be now paying nil tax.Yes, a standard deduction of Rs. 75,000 is available to a tax payer in the new regime. Therefore, a salaried tax payer will not be required to pay any tax where his income before standard deduction is less than or equal to Rs 12,75,000.Standard deduction of Rs 50,000 is available in old regime.Presently, for AY 2024-25, about 8.75 crore persons have filed their ITRs. All such assessees who were paying tax in the new tax regime will benefit from the change in rates and slabsApproximately Rs 1 lakh crore will be made available in the hands of the taxpayers by virtue of changes in slab, rates and rebate.In the new regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to only resident individuals who have income marginally above Rs 12 lakhs. For example, for a person having income of Rs 12,10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax, works out to be Rs. 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakhs + 10% of Rs 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10 thousand). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-.The tax liability on such tax payer by way of slabs only is Rs 61,500. How ever a person having Rs 12 lakh income pays nil tax. By providing marginal relief it has been ensured that the tax payable by a person having income marginally above Rs 12 lakhs is required to pay only marginal amount of tax equal to the amount of income above Rs 12 lakhs so that his carry home is also Rs 12 lakhs. In this case he will be required to pay a tax of Rs 10,000.The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-(i) First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. In the answer given to question no.15 above, tax on the total income of Rs 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:(ii) Tax payable on total income of Rs 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.(iii) Now the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs 61,500) shall be compared with amount exceeding total income upto which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs 12,10,000 - Rs 12,00,000](iv) The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs 10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs 61,500) as tabulated above.(v) Therefore, in the above case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/- = 51,500/-) is allowed.(vi) Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500 - Rs 51,500]Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh!

Clarity on crypto, agri income in new I-T Bill

NEW DELHI: FM Nirmala Sitharaman is set to move a 622-page Income Tax Bill , with 536 clauses, on Thursday to repeal the current 64-year-old law that runs into 823 pages and has 819 sections. The draft legislation, with simpler language, seeks to do away with ""assessment year"" and sets a definition of "" tax year "" that'll be aligned with financial year.There are no deep structural changes to overhaul existing provisions or a change in deadline for filing. Several experts said the focus is on making the law easier to grasp which will reduce litigation.At several places, the Bill has tables related to TDS provisions, presumptive tax rates and time limit for assessment, aimed at giving clarity. Besides, some formulas have been included. ""Notwithstanding"" has been replaced with ""irrespective of anything"" at several places, tax experts said. Archaic and convoluted language has been largely dropped.While the bill is likely to be referred to a parliamentary panel, the new law is proposed to be implemented from next April, although Sitharaman had said the process of consultation will be followed.""The language is simpler. One excellent change is replacement of the concept of assessment year and previous year with tax year. While innumerable provisos and explanations in the existing Act have been eliminated, various conditions attached to each exemption or deduction continue, but are couched in simpler language,"" said Gautam Nayak of CNK Associates, a Mumbai-based CA firm.The Income Tax Bill will seek to bring all provisions related to areas such as salaries and perquisites together, making it easier for taxpayers to understand.""In the earlier law, there were multiple cross references between sections and rules, which often led to complications for taxpayers. In the new bill, the number of proviso and explanations have been substantially reduced and the references to rules and other sections have been curtailed. This will ensure a taxpayer will be able to gain a sensible understanding of the section by reading the section itself and they do not need to refer to other rules and sections. Further, the old law was amended several times over 60 years and hence, there were ample references to redundant sections, previous dates and years, which have been removed now,"" said Amit Maheshwari, tax partner at consulting firm AKM Global.The bill proposes a taxpayer charter , something that has been rolled out but has failed to provide any firm commitments by the department. It will define crypto assets for the first time, while doing away with definitions such as ""fringe benefit"".Nayak pointed out there is a change in the definition of agricultural income with income derived from saplings or seedlings grown in a nursery also included now, accepting the judicial pronouncements in this regard. ""In quite a few places, the bill clarifies the position better than the existing law - for instance, in stating when a person would be not ordinarily resident in India,"" he added.Maheshwari said the new section mandating that the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) must provide detailed directions, explicitly stating the points of determination, its decision, and the reasons behind it marks a significant shift from the earlier provision, which lacked clarity on the manner of issuing DRP directions. ""DRP orders will now be well-reasoned and adequately explained, ensuring transparency and reducing reliance on past rulings. This will improve quality of dispute resolution.""""The bill's primary objective is to simplify the tax laws, ensuring these are more transparent, easier to interpret and taxpayer friendly. By replacing complex provisions with clearer provisions, it aims to reduce legal disputes and encourage voluntary tax compliance,"" said Rohinton Sidhwa, partner at Deloitte India.","Fm nirmala sitharaman is set to move a 622-page income tax bill on thursday.

By Parizad Sirwalla

Budget 2025 income tax : In the run up to the Budget 2025, individual taxpayers were eagerly looking forward to favorable tax reforms. The FM seems to have brought some cheer to them through her proposals.Recognizing the contributions of the middle class and with an objective to eventually phase out the old tax regime, various changes have been introduced in the new tax regime. The basic exemption limit has been increased from INR 3 lakhs to INR 4 lakhs. In a significant shift, the highest slab is increased from INR 15 lakhs to 24 lakhs. The other slabs and tax rates have been realigned and a new tax rate of 25% has been included. Income threshold for rebate under 87A available to resident taxpayers has been increased from INR 7 lakhs to INR 12 lakhs. For computing this threshold, special rate income (such as capital gains, lottery winnings etc.) has been specifically excluded, to also address certain ambiguities in the earlier interpretation.With these changes, all the taxpayers in the new tax regime have some reason to celebrate, irrespective of income levels. As an illustration, a person with income up to 12 lakhs can now enjoy annual tax savings of INR 80,000 (excluding cess). At the same time, an individual with income of 18 lakhs has a tax savings upto INR 110,000 (excluding cess). The savings would be higher for income levels where surcharge is applicable.Few amendments have been made with a view to simplify certain provisions. Earlier, in case of vacant properties, annual income could be considered as NIL for up to two self-occupied properties (SOP). While there is no change in above, to qualify as SOP, currently there is a condition that the taxpayer should not be able to reside therein due to his business or employment or profession and that taxpayer is staying in a premises not owned by him. This condition has now been done away with.NPS Vatsalya Scheme launched in September 2024, enabled parents and guardians to start a NPS for their minor children, which on attaining majority, would be transferred to the child's name with the accumulated corpus. As a welcome measure, the Budget has extended the deduction of INR 50,000 under section 80CCD (available in the old tax regime) to also include contributions towards this scheme. Further, it has been specified that partial withdrawals up to 25 per cent from the scheme, allowed for specified reasons, shall not be taxable.Currently, a deduction is allowed to an individual for any amount deposited in the National Saving Scheme (NSS), prior to 1 April 1992. Any withdrawals from the scheme are held as taxable. As a notification dated 29 August 2024 specified that the balances would not earn interest, this made the depositors keen to withdraw the NSS balance. Based on various representations received, the FM has now exempted the withdrawals done post 29 August 2024, for which deduction was allowed earlier, to provide them the much-required relief.Striking a balance between fiscal prudence and the theme of “Trust first, Scrutinize later”, the Government has enhanced timelines for filing updated returns by two more years by paying additional taxes of 60 and 70 percent respectively. This will help boost tax revenues through voluntary compliance.Consistency and clarity has been provided in the taxability of redemption proceeds of all un-exempted ULIPs, by including them in the definition of equity - oriented fund, which was earlier only with respect to certain unexempted ULIPs.There has been a rationalization of the various TCS/ TDS thresholds including on remittances under Liberalized remittance scheme (from INR 700,000 to INR 10,00,000 and NIL in the case of remittance for education financed by a specified loans) and interest income for senior citizens (from existing INR 50,000 to INR 100,000). This will positively impact their cash flows.The higher TDS is proposed to be continued on assesses having invalid PAN/ non-PAN holders. However, it is proposed to remove the higher TDS/TCS on non-filers of return of income with an attempt for ease of doing business and reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers.The FM has also promised to table the much-awaited New Income Tax Bill which aims at simplicity and reduced litigation, in the next week. All in all, the Budget endeavors to take steps to reinforce confidence and optimism in the taxpayers.",Income threshold for rebate under 87a available to resident taxpayers has been increased from inr 7 lakhs to inr 12 lakhs. The government has enhanced timelines for filing updated returns by two more years by paying additional taxes of 60 and 70 percent respectively.

'Budget's given comfort to monetary authority': Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budgets-given-comfort-to-monetary-authority-finance-secretary-tuhin-kanta-pandey/articleshow/117995724.cms,"In an interview to TOI,

Pandey, who is also in charge of the revenue department, said

Do you think the Budget has done enough to help accelerate growth against the backdrop of global uncertainties?

Is the time right for

monetary authorities to play a part in accelerating growth, for example with a rate cut?

So, has the Budget created conditions for a rate cut?

Is the tax relief largely to boost consumption and address some of the concerns of the middle class?

Have other levers of economy got required attention, apart from consumption and investment?

When do you expect I-T bill to be presented in Parliament? How will it make life of the taxpayer simple?

Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the 2025-26 Budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation .the Budget has enabled all levers of growth to accelerate. Excepts:It is a pro-growth Budget. We have headwinds and we also have internal challenges. We have addressed both. Although, we are still the fastest growing large economy in the world, not only we have to maintain this growth, but we have to push it up. We have addressed both the supply-side and demand-side and tried in a non inflationary way to maximise growth, accelerate growth.I think it's up to the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to take a call on that. But, on the fiscal side, we have done our bit. We have kept the promise of fiscal consolidation. FM had announced that it will be 4.9% in this year and we have been able to achieve 4.8%. FM had said fiscal consolidation path will mean we'll bring it to 4.5% next year. We are proposing 4.4% and there was also an announcement that thereafter we will have a glide path in terms of the debt-to-GDP level and a visibility would be given on how it will go forward. That has also been included in the FRBM statement.In a way, the Budget has provided whatever stimulations are required. We are not providing a stimulus at the cost of the deficit by increasing the deficit. So, we are giving sufficient sort of comfort to the monetary authority. However, they would have to take a call based on whatever.I would say consumption is one part. However, we are not really prescribing how taxpayers, who have got this money back in a way, how they will behave. Basically, the decision making is transferred to taxpayers, who have got this relief. They may choose to consume, save or invest directly in either of the three situations we have. It will have a salutary and good effect on the economy because if they choose to consume, it will boost demand. If they choose to invest indirectly, they are supporting the banks to extend more credit. Because, banks can give credit only when they have got increased deposits. And, if they choose to directly invest, for example in a house, they also participate in investments. In that case, it will work like an investment multiplier anyway. So, it will be a combination of consumption and investment multiplier, with a positive impact on savings. Overall, I would say it will be a growth-booster.A large economy like India has to have all engines firing. You cannot simply say we will only go for agriculture, not for manufacturing. Or, we will go for manufacturing and not for services. Therefore all three are required. If you see all the proposals on supply side, we have tried to see how we can speed up production, how we can speed up productivity and how we can spur employment. So, it is employment-led growth. In agriculture, we have taken steps to boost pulses productivity and increase credit limit for farmers. Everywhere we have said how we can boost production and productivity. We are saying let there be a growth path for MSMEs. Let there be more credit available for MSMEs. Let their participation in exports be more. Let there be more support for them in terms of innovation and research. Our tax policy is supporting labour intensive sectors.It is proposed to be done before Feb 13. We are not changing the policy through it. The same thing will be carried forward because after passing, this bill will be applicable from a future date. We wanted to reform right away. So, those reforms have been brought in this bill through amendments. There are so many redundant provisions. There are a number of changes. More than 4,000 changes have happened since 1962, when this act was enacted. In 63 years, the finance sector changed, plus there were many taxation laws and amendment bills. Things get complicated to read and they may also create interpretation problems. There could be many interpretation problems or litigations. If you have more readability, if you have clarity, there will be less litigation.","Finance secretary tuhin kanta pandey said the 2025-26 budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation. The budget has enabled all levers of growth to accelerate, he said. More than 4,000 changes have happened since 1962, when this act was enacted.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117996121,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-455300,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

He also said that although rupee depreciation increases inflation on imported inputs, it also adds to export competitiveness.Pandey said that govt has bettered its fiscal deficit projections for the current fiscal as well as the next. The fiscal deficit for FY25 has been pegged lower at 4.8% of GDP, lower than budgeted 4.9%, while for FY26 the deficit is projected to be 4.4%, lower than what was given in the consolidation road map.""It is very important to be very clear that we (govt) have to remain within a certain fiscal regime. We have, to that extent, aided the monetary authorities to say that if they (RBI) have to do what they have to do, we are supportive.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 post Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ZERO or NIL tax liability for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in the Union Budget 2025 under the new income tax regime. For salaried individuals, including the standard deduction, this limit is Rs 12.75 lakh under the new regime.But what about individuals with taxable income slightly above Rs 12 lakh? Will they have to pay more income tax than their additional earnings above Rs 12 lakh? Will someone earning Rs 12,10,000 face a Rs 61,500 tax burden versus an individual earning Rs 10,000 less who will pay nothing?There's good news! Here's where the concept of marginal relief comes us. Individuals with income slightly above Rs 12 lakh, which is the nil tax threshold, will receive fair treatment through marginal tax relief.For example, for a person having income of Rs 12, 10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax works out to be Rs 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakh + 10% of 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10,000). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-)Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-Marginal relief examples:It's important to note that rebate is offered to individuals with taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new tax regime.

GST reforms on the cards?

More tax relief coming soon? The Narendra Modi government , having provided substantial relief in personal income tax and customs tariff rationalisation in the Union Budget 2025 , is now expected to initiate efforts to streamline the goods and services tax (GST) framework for easier implementation and adherence, according to officials.The primary objective will be to restructure the tax slabs to ensure meaningful outcomes, they indicated.The GST structure comprises four slabs-5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, with special rates for certain items like precious metals and additional cess on sin goods.The 5% slab currently covers 21% of GST items, whilst 12% applies to 19%, 18% to 44%, and 28% to 3% of items.According to an ET report, the government intends to discuss simplification and rationalisation with the group of ministers (GoM) tasked with reviewing rates, according to a source close to the discussions.The source noted that whilst the GoM has primarily concentrated on slab adjustments for goods, a comprehensive simplification requires fundamental restructuring of the current system.The GST Council established the GoM for rate rationalisation in September 2021. Despite numerous meetings, the GoM has not yet presented its final recommendations.Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The GoM is considering proposals including elimination of dual rates for items like pens and sunglasses based on price thresholds. Specialists have noted these complexities create compliance challenges.The GST revenue-neutral rate (RNR) has decreased to 11.6% from 15.5% at its July 2017 implementation, due to various exemptions and reductions.Most experts advocate a three-rate structure for enhanced simplicity and effectiveness.","The primary objective will be to restructure the tax slabs to ensure meaningful outcomes.

For an annual income of Rs 13.7 lakh, with basic salary at 50% (Rs 6.85 lakh), the NPS contribution at 14% would amount to Rs 95,900. Combined with the Rs 75,000 standard deduction, this eliminates tax liability on the entire Rs 13.7 lakh.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 after Budget 2025: Zero income tax on Rs 13.7 lakh salary? Don’t rub your eyes! Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget 2025 speech announced that there will be NIL or zero income tax for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh. But did you know that for salaried individuals, the tax-free annual income can reach Rs 13.7 lakh, compared to Rs 12 lakh for others!“I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000,” FM Sitharaman announced in her Union Budget speech.This advantage of no tax till Rs 13.7 lakh income stems from the Rs 75,000 standard deduction and National Pension System (NPS) investments. Section 80CCD(2) allows tax deduction of up to 14% of basic salary invested in NPS, whilst the old tax regime offers 10%.According to an ET analysis, a salaried individual with Rs 13.7 lakh yearly income can achieve tax savings of approximately Rs 96,000 through NPS contributions. It’s important to note that this benefit requires employer participation in NPS as part of cost to the company, as employees cannot opt independently.It’s interesting to note that despite this opportunity existing for nearly a decade, only 2.2 million individuals have enrolled. ""Only a few corporates are interested in rolling out the NPS benefit, and even fewer employees are willing to enrol in it,"" said Sudhir Kaushik, chief executive of tax filing portal Taxspanner.com.Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? The extended NPS lock-in period and withdrawal limitations at maturity discourage many investors. Pre-retirement withdrawals are restricted to exceptional circumstances. Upon maturity, only 60% can be withdrawn, whilst 40% must be invested in an annuity for lifetime pension.Financial experts consider these restrictions beneficial. ""The lack of liquidity in NPS is not necessarily bad because the money is at the right place. Investment returns can be enormous if held for the long term,"" said Sriram Iyer, chief executive of HDFC Pension.NPS provides additional benefits, including asset mix selection, fund switching options, and pension fund manager changes without tax implications. It maintains the industry's lowest fund management charges at 0.09% annually, compared to 1-1.5% for the most economical mutual funds.

As a common man of India, I would like to compliment and thank Hon’ble Finance Minister (FM) for being considerate towards the middle class and salaried taxpayers who generally feel neglected. The projected fiscal deficit of 4.4% for the next year (as against revised fiscal deficit of 4.8% for the current year) reflects a well thought through approach. The 2025 budget presented by the FM strikes a perfect balance between maintaining fiscal responsibility and managing taxpayers’ expectations.To begin with, the FM is keen to sunset the Old Personal Tax Regime (OPTR) as all the tax benefits are now proposed under New Personal Tax Regime (NPTR). With the proposed changes, NPTR will now become far more appealing for individuals as it would mean availing beneficial tax rates and no tax declaration or providing/ maintaining tax deduction and exemption proofs. Just to share perspective, last year only 28% of taxpayers opted for OPTR which will substantially decline in coming years as OPTR will only be beneficial if you are in the 30% tax bracket with over INR 8 lakh of eligible deductions and exemptions.Even the slab rates are easy to remember, slab changes with every block of 4 lakh and corresponding tax rates changes 5% up to six blocks with highest slab being 30 percent. Salaried individuals with a gross salary of up to INR 12.75 lakh will have zero tax under NPTR. To illustrate further, an individual earning income of, say, INR 24 lakh per annum, who had previously opted for NPTR will now enjoy a tax saving of INR 114,400 and much more compared to OPTR.Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The FM has taken conscious effort to bring down administrative burden and tried to rationalize on various aspects like penalty will be in abeyance till the final order is passed by the tax department. Now taxpayers have an opportunity to file an Updated Income Tax Return (UITR) with applicable penalty slabs based on the period of delay, up to four years in case they have missed reporting any income. By extending the option of filing UITR, Government is further encouraging such suo-moto filings, thereby enhancing its revenue streams, and providing an opportunity for taxpayers to be compliant.Further, the FM has proposed increasing TDS threshold on interest paid to senior citizens from INR 50,000 to INR 100,000, benefiting those who rely on traditional savings like term deposits and post office schemes by allowing them to retain more interest income. Additionally, TDS on dividends will now apply only if the amount exceeds INR 10,000, resulting in higher disposable income for active investors and more opportunities for reinvestment.In 2020, the Government introduced foreign remittance tracking mechanism by levying Tax Collection at Source (TCS) under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). While foreign remittances up to USD 250,000 per annum is permitted under the LRS, currently, TCS is applied on remittances above INR 7 lakh. With the proposed increase in threshold from INR 7 lakh to INR 10 lakh, Government aims to alleviate the financial burden on individuals remitting funds for various purposes.Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? For families who are supporting their children to pursue higher education overseas by borrowing from banks, the current TCS requirement of 0.5% on remittances exceeding INR 7 lakh adds to their financial strain. With interest rates on education loans usually exceeding 8% per annum, additional TCS meant lesser funds. With the budget proposing to scrap TCS on education-related remittances funded through financial institutions, the Government is promoting access to global educational opportunities, aligning with the vision of ""Viksit Bharat” and contributing to a more skilled workforce.By introducing the National Pension Scheme (NPS) Vatsalya last year, the Government provided an initiative for parents or guardians to open NPS accounts for their minor children. The FM expanded tax benefits for NPS to include contributions of up to INR 50,000 in NPS Vatsalya under OPTR.Regarding Income from house property, the proposal allows taxpayers to claim up to two properties as self-occupied without any conditions. This change offers relief to those with a second property that may remain vacant for various reasons. This is again testimony to avoid ambiguity and litigation.While no change in the tax rates on crypto transactions, it is proposed to be included in the definition of Virtual Digital Assets and prescribed reporting entities will furnish information in a specified statement.Further, the ambiguity about taxing the redemption of unit-linked insurance with high premiums policies has now been clarified i.e., long term capital gains at 12.5%.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime For millions of middle-class taxpayers, this budget represents more than just a change in policy; it serves as a financial lifeline. This shift in focus towards the middle class is particularly significant in a time when rising costs and inflation have put pressure on their finances. As they navigate the challenges of daily life, the tangible benefits of this fiscal relief will enable them to participate more actively in the economy, ultimately contributing to a cycle of growth and stability.To conclude - As one said, “Income tax is the hardest thing in the world to understand”, the FM has taken the challenge seriously and is moving in the right direction to simplify the same. The budget has provided a preview of a simplified tax system in the country, serving as a teaser for the New Income Tax Bill set to be unveiled next week. If today's budget is any indication, we can anticipate a more tax-friendly and simplified compliance-oriented tax framework soon.",The 2025 budget presented by the fm strikes a perfect balance between maintaining fiscal responsibility and managing taxpayers’ expectations.
