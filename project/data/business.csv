Economic Survey 2025-26: Date, Time

What is the significance of the Economic Survey?

Economic Survey 2025-2026: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to table the Economic Survey ahead of her Union Budget speech. The Parliament’s Budget session began on January 28, 2026 and the first phase is expected to conclude on February 13, 2026. The Union Budget 2026 will be presented by FM Sitharaman on February 1, 2026 - likely the first time when the Budget is presented on a Sunday.Each year, the Economic Survey is closely seen by economists and policy analysts since it offers a very detailed assessment of the Indian economy’s performance over the past year, along with insights into the future growth prospects across various sectors.The Economic Survey is a very comprehensive annual economic review which is prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs under the Ministry of Finance. The Economic Survey bears the name of the Chief Economic Advisor, who at present is Dr. V. Anantha Nageswaran.The Economic Survey presents an in-depth analysis of macroeconomic parameters, key fiscal and financial indicators, and forward-looking assessments. The document also serves as an important reference point, often signalling the broad policy approach and priorities that will likely shape the forthcoming Union Budget for 2026-27.The Economic Survey 2025-2026 will be tabled before Parliament on Thursday, January 29, 2026, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, which will be followed by a media briefing by Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran.The Economic Survey usually takes stock of key macroeconomic trends. This year it may talk about growth resilience despite global headwinds, the threat from Donald Trump’s tariffs, the impact of artificial intelligence on the job market, and the weakening of the rupee against the US dollar.The analysis in the Economic Survey also suggests fresh policy ideas to tackle economic challenges, including poverty alleviation, climate action, improvements in education, infrastructure development, and strengthening the country’s financial system.The Economic Survey was first introduced in 1950-51 as part of the Budget papers, and has since then evolved into a separate document that is tabled ahead of the Union Budget. Each year, its overarching theme draws close attention from policymakers and observers alike.The Survey contains detailed sector-wise reviews along with dedicated chapters on economic concerns.","The economic survey 2025-2026 will be tabled before parliament on thursday, january 29, 2026, between 11:00 am and 12:00 pm.

(Kuldip Kumar is Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP)

As the Union Budget approaches, expectations of major tax giveaways appear muted. However, this Budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the Government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform amid a challenging economic environment.The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive US trade agreement, geopolitical tensions, and continued foreign institutional investor outflows are likely to influence policy decisions. Measures announced in this year’s Budget are therefore expected to align closely with the Government’s broader economic and reform framework.Accordingly, incentivising businesses particularly export-oriented sectors and accelerating employment generation are likely to receive focused attention in this Budget.Last year’s Budget delivered meaningful tax relief through revisions in personal income-tax slabs and enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, leaving limited headroom for further concessions.These changes were introduced under the new tax regime, while the old tax regime was left unchanged.This approach was intended to encourage taxpayers still following the old regime to transition to the simpler new tax system.For FY 2023–24, nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime, and this proportion is expected to increase further in the current year.Does this mean the old tax regime could be phased out entirely? Perhaps not immediately, especially since the new tax regime has also been incorporated into the Income Tax Act, 2025.However, given the continued instances of misuse and claims of incorrect deductions under the old regime, it would not be surprising if the Government eventually considers doing away with it altogether.In the 2024 Budget, the Government made significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including revisions to holding periods and tax rates, with the objective of simplification. While some asset classes benefited, tax rates on listed securities both short-term and long-term and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), were increased.Given the growing participation of retail investors in Indian capital markets, there is a case for reviewing these measures. While challenging from a revenue perspective, the Government could consider moderating capital gains tax rates on listed securities or enhancing the basic exemption limit for long-term capital gains, currently set at ₹1.25 lakh. Further, permitting set-off of long-term capital losses against short-term capital gains in Budget 2026 would improve tax equity and align treatment of capital assets.Fiscal Discipline Remains an Important ConsiderationThe Government is expected to adhere firmly to its fiscal consolidation path, leaving limited scope for aggressive fiscal expansion. That said, carefully calibrated policy measures particularly those aimed at stimulating consumption and job creation could strengthen growth momentum and improve tax buoyancy. As with most fiscal initiatives, the benefits of such measures are likely to become visible only after a time lag.Tax simplification remains an ongoing journey. While significant progress has been achieved through digitisation and pre-filled data, several pain points persist:Clubbing provisions continue to complicate joint ownership of assets between spouses, despite the sound financial logic behind such arrangements. Introducing an option for joint tax filing, as practiced in countries like the United States, could significantly ease compliance.Notional taxation on vacant properties is often perceived as inequitable and warrants reconsideration.TDS and TCS mechanisms, though effective for tracking transactions, frequently result in excessive deductions and cash-flow strain for taxpayers, especially where final tax liability is substantially lower.Pre-filled tax returns could be further expanded, particularly for salaried taxpayers without business income, reducing manual intervention and errors.Despite the delegation of appellate powers to Joint Commissioners, a substantial backlog of tax appeals continues to persist. Introducing clearly defined timelines and enhancing accountability would help restore taxpayer confidence.Similarly, the practice of adjusting refunds against disputed demands often for several years requires urgent reform.Refunds granted in favour of taxpayers should be released automatically, without the need for repeated follow-ups or grievances.Trust as the Cornerstone of ComplianceRecent initiatives where tax authorities proactively alert taxpayers to potential mismatches mark a positive shift towards a trust-based compliance framework. The Government has already introduced the Taxpayers’ Charter; effective enforcement of its principles on the ground would benefit both sides in improving compliance for the Government while offering peace of mind to the taxpayers.While Budget 2026 may not be about headline-grabbing tax cuts, it is likely to outline how the Government intends to navigate uncertainty, sustain growth, reinforce fiscal discipline, and deepen structural reforms.In that sense, this Budget may prove to be less about immediate relief and more about building long-term economic resilience.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations appear muted.

Dalal Street might be headed for its worst beginning in a decade and now all eyes are on what the government will announce in the upcoming Budget. With equities, the rupee and bonds all under strain, more and more investors are looking to the Union Budget 2026 for measures that could restore confidence and boost economic growth.So far this year, Indian equity benchmarks have tumbled almost 4%, marking the NSE Nifty 50 Index’s worst start since 2016. Foreign investors continued to pare their exposure to local shares, while a heavy supply of bonds has weighed on debt markets. The sell-off has wiped out roughly $360 billion in market value this month, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg.Now, the focus is on whether the government opts to raise defence spending and push ahead with stake sales in state-run enterprises to strengthen revenues, following income-tax cuts and lower consumption levies announced last year. Market participants see these moves as potential levers to lift sentiment across asset classes.“The budget is likely to aim at stimulating the economy, which means additional measures to boost consumption and push domestic manufacturing,” Abhishek Banerjee, chief executive of LotusDew Wealth and Investment Advisors told Bloomberg.This Budget, the focus will be on what measures the government will undertake for faster sale of shares from the upcoming financial year.The government needs to cut down it shareholding in Life Insurance Corp, the country’s largest insurer, to meet public float norms and has already obtained regulatory relief. With timelines tightening, a stake sale could be weighed in the fiscal year ending March 2027. IDBI Bank Ltd. is also set to remain in focus as progress is made on its long-awaited privatisation.Defence has emerged as a another important segment amid the broader market weakness. India’s drive to expand domestic defence manufacturing has lifted select stocks, with the NSE defence index more than tripling over the past three years. The sector budget is close to 7 trillion rupees for fiscal 2026 and is projected to grow between 10% and 15%, according to Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. Shares of Bharat Electronics Ltd. have climbed more than fourfold during this period, while Solar Industries India Ltd. and MTAR Technologies Ltd. are also being closely tracked by investors.Infrastructure spending, particularly on roads and railways, is expected to remain a priority in the budget. Both segments have already absorbed a large share of last year’s allocations and are widely anticipated to receive higher funding. Continued investment in modernising the railway network, with an emphasis on safety, speed and passenger comfort, is likely to feature prominently. Larsen & Toubro Ltd. and state-owned BEML Ltd. are among the companies seen as key beneficiaries.Capital market-linked stocks are another area under watch. Shares of brokerages, exchanges and market service providers fell last year amid overall market weakness. Therefore, any changes to capital gains taxation in the budget could have immediate implications for trading activity, Citigroup Inc., according to strategists.","Investors are looking to the union budget 2026 for measures that could restore confidence and boost economic growth.

Budget 2026: What does state-level GST data tell us ahead of FM Sitharaman's speech?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-what-does-state-level-gst-data-tell-us-ahead-of-fm-sitharamans-speech/articleshow/127782883.cms,"By Lalitagauri Kulkarni and Bhushana Karandikar

Revenue pattern across states shaped by differences in economic structure

Shift in India’s Tax Culture

(Lalitagauri Kulkarni is Faculty Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics. Bhushana Karandikar is an Independent Researcher)

The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax GST ) in 2017 was one of India’s most significant tax reforms, aimed at simplifying indirect taxation and creating a common national market. Seven years on, the overall picture is encouraging. The constant effort to rationalise the classification of goods services and the latest reforms, show sincere effort to create a harmonised tax system for a national market. GST revenues have risen steadily, reflecting economic expansion, improved digitization, and the growing maturity of the tax system. Proposed in 2000 by the Dasgupta Committee on indirect tax reforms, GST rested on three objectives: creating a unified indirect tax framework, building a common national market, and improving tax buoyancy so that revenues would rise in step with economic expansion. Has it achieved its objectives? A look into the state-wise data on GST revenue from 2017 to 2024 provides some insights on the cusp of Union Budget 2026.The constant effort to rationalise the classification of goods and services, and the latest reforms, show sincere effort to create a harmonised tax system for a national market. Evidence from nano to large-size enterprises suggests that compliance and digital payments are easier than under the earlier multi-layered indirect tax regime.According to official data, gross GST collections reached a record ₹22.08 lakh crore in 2024–25, a 9.4 per cent increase over the previous year, with average monthly collections of ₹1.84 lakh crore. Headline numbers are encouraging.A central objective of the GST is also to harmonise India’s fragmented tax system so that tax buoyancy improves across the states meaning GST tax revenues would grow in line with, ideally faster than, the State incomes.In India, GST is split between different levels of government. For sales that take place within a state, the tax is shared between the Centre (CGST) and the state government (SGST), replacing earlier state levies such as VAT and entertainment tax. For sales that occur across state borders, as well as imports, the Centre collects Integrated GST (IGST).GST collections have strengthened across the country, although at different paces. Average GST-to-GSDP ratios across states range from about 3 per cent to 13 per cent, a variation that has remained broadly stable over time. Importantly, absolute GST collections have increased in almost all states, including through periods of economic disruption, underscoring the resilience of the GST framework.Economic structure plays an important role in shaping these outcomes. States with higher levels of urbanisation and a larger services base, such as Haryana and Maharashtra, have recorded particularly strong increases in GST collections relative to output. In Haryana, the GST-to-GSDP ratio has risen from around 7.6 to 17.6 per cent, while in Maharashtra it has increased from 5.6 to 13.8 per cent. These gains highlight the effectiveness of GST in capturing value addition in service-oriented, digitally connected economies.Other states have also shown meaningful progress. Odisha, for instance, has seen its GST-to-GSDP ratio rise from about 4.1 to 10.9 per cent over the same period, reflecting improved formalisation and better integration into the GST system.GST has changed how taxes are paid and administered in India. GST, has shifted the system toward more transparent, simpler to understand, and harder to evade. In short, GST represents a cultural shift in taxation, not just a change in tax rates. The earlier system relied heavily on physical paperwork, multiple overlapping taxes, and discretionary enforcement, which created scope for complexity, inefficiency, and rent-seeking. Timely filing of GST returns has improved significantly across states, reflecting stronger procedural compliance and familiarity with the digital system.Going forward, further improvements in GST revenues are likely to come from deepening compliance by supporting registered businesses, strengthening verification, and leveraging digital data more effectively to expand registrations.With the GST compensation mechanism having concluded in 2022, the steady growth in state-level GST collections is a positive sign for fiscal stability. As GST enters a more mature phase, its contribution to public finances will increasingly depend on how well tax administration aligns with underlying economic structures across states.GST cannot be judged in simple binary terms as either a success or a failure, it is an evolving institutional reform. It has improved transparency and stabilised indirect taxation, while it operates within an uneven economic landscape. The next phase of GST is less about changing rates and more about aligning the system with underlying economic structure and state capacity, as state revenue outcomes depend less on tax design and compliance and more on economic fundamentals and administration.","The introduction of the goods and services tax gst in 2017 was one of india’s most significant tax reforms.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

New Delhi: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Thursday said India’s macroeconomic fundamentals are stronger than ever and the economy has successfully navigated global headwinds to be on a high-growth trajectory, improving potential GDP growth to 7%.“Amid a global environment in which many emerging markets struggled, India stood out for its effective management of inflation without compromising growth. Our govt’s proactive supply-side management has driven inflation down to historic lows,” she said in a series of social media posts. Inflation has moderated to 1.3% as food prices have fallen, also creating headroom for higher consumption spending amid a cut in income tax and GST last year.The survey noted that consumption has soared, while investment has held steady, helping sustain the growth momentum. The Indian economy is estimated to grow 7.4% this year and the survey has projected 6.8-7.2% growth during the next financial year.Citing numbers from the 687-page document she reasserted govt’s commitment to fiscal consolidation without compromising on growth. Ahead of her ninth consecutive budget to be presented on Sunday, Sitharaman said the fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP “is well on track”, reassuring market players amid a slowdown in tax collections.She also re emphasised the focus on deregulation, which she had flagged in her last budget. “The Economic Survey mentions that a progression from ‘swadeshi’ to ‘strategic resilience’ to ‘strategic indispensability’ will ensure the world moves from ‘thinking about buying Indian’ to ‘buying Indian without thinking’. It is in this context that our govt has been focusing on deregulation and strengthening the manufacturing sector in the country through various measures. ”The finance minister also said that the efforts to strengthen human capital have also helped sustain India’s growth, which can be seen from the gains made in education and health outcomes.“The survey underscores that these investments are converting India’s demographic dividend into a durable development dividend driven by healthier, quality-educated citizens,” she said.The budget comes at a time when the economy is resilient but global challenges have increased, which may prompt govt to unleash deep reform measures.",Finance minister nirmala sitharaman said india’s macroeconomic fundamentals are stronger than ever.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Economic Survey notes the paradox of 2025 is that India’s strongest macroeconomic performance in decades has collided with a global system that no longer rewards macroeconomic success with currency stability, capital inflows, or strategic insulation.

Scenario 1: The best-case for the world in 2026

According to the Economic Survey, this scenario is less about continuity and more about managed disorder, with countries operating in a world that remains integrated yet increasingly distrustful.

Scenario 2: Multipolar breakdown

In such a scenario, the policy will become more nationalised, and countries will face sharper tradeoffs between autonomy, growth, and stability. The survey sees a probability of around 40% to 45% to this scenario as well.

On the eve of Christmas 2025, the Financial Times wrote, “Tech companies have moved more than $120bn of data centre spending off their balance sheets using special purpose vehicles funded by Wall Street investors, adding to concerns about the financial risks of their huge bet on artificial intelligence.”

Scenario 3: Systemic shock cascade

While this remains a lower-probability scenario, its consequences would be significantly asymmetric. The macroeconomic consequences could be worse than those of the 2008 global financial crisis

What do these scenarios mean for India?

Running a marathon and sprint at the same time!

“The external environment will require India to prioritise both domestic growth maximisation and shock absorption, with a greater emphasis on buffers, redundancy, and liquidity. Put differently, India must run a marathon and sprint simultaneously, or run a marathon as if it were a sprint,” the survey says.

Economic Survey 2025-26: India stands tall in the global economic order - as the world’s fastest growing major economy that is exhibiting resilience in the face of global economic turmoil and Donald Trump’s tariff threat. Post the imposition of 50% tariffs on India, most economists revised India’s GDP growth forecasts downwards. But surprising, the economy not only held firm, its growth pace actually picked up!“In reality, growth accelerated due to a slew of structural reforms and policy measures,” the Economic Survey 2025-26 tabled in the Parliament on Thursday says. “Fast forward five months, and India is now anticipating a fullyear real growth rate of over 7%, with another year of real growth at or near 7%,” the survey says.Yet, as theAnd even though global growth and trade have held up better than expected, few are certain why this is the case. Hence, there is a lingering concern that the negative effects of the ongoing global political and economic turmoil may manifest with a lag.Also Check | Economic Survey 2026 Highlights “Fragility, uncertainty and episodic shocks are increasingly structural features of the system, and the balance of risks has shifted perceptibly over the past year. Geopolitical competition has intensified, the security environment in Europe has become increasingly complex, and financial vulnerabilities associated with leveraged technology investments are looming,” the Economic Survey warns.Fundamentally, factors that shape the trade policy are changing. It is now majorly about security and political considerations rather than efficiency or multilateral rules.Taken together, these developments suggest a world that is less coordinated, more risk-averse, and more exposed to non-linear outcomes with a narrower margin of safety, the Economic Survey cautions.In this background, it envisages three scenarios for the global economy in 2026, explaining what they in turn would mean for India’s growth story:This is the ‘best-case’ scenario shared by the Economic Survey - which for the world in 2026 would mean ‘business as in 2025. However, it is increasingly less secure and more fragile.“In this setting, with the margin of safety being thinner, minor shocks can escalate into larger reverberations. Financial stress episodes, trade frictions, and geopolitical escalations do not lead to systemic collapse, but they do create volatility and require governments to intervene more actively to stabilize expectations,” the Economic Survey explains.“One could attach a subjective probability of around 40% to 45% to this scenario unfolding in 2026. Reflecting this is the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which is near its worst readings of 2020, excluding the sharp spike in April 2025 at the introduction of the reciprocal tariffs. Fear lingers,” the survey says.In this scenario, the probability of a disorderly multipolar breakdown rises materially and cannot be treated as a tail risk.“Under this outcome, strategic rivalry intensifies, the Russia–Ukraine conflict remains unresolved in a destabilising form, and collective security arrangements unravel. Trade becomes increasingly explicitly coercive, sanctions and countermeasures proliferate, supply chains are realigned under political pressure, and financial stress events are transmitted across borders with fewer buffers and weaker institutional shock absorbers,” the Economic Survey cautions.The Economic Survey points out:It also notes that the IBM CEO openly questioned the economics of Large Language Models (LLM)-based AI. This has reinforced concerns about the financial risks of this huge bet.” Given the leverage involved, a correction could have cascading effects across financial markets and the real economy. The sharp rise in the yields of Japanese Government Bonds is another warning sign,” the survey says.Also Read | How rupee became a victim of geopolitics & a strategic power gap in 2025: Economic Survey explains The final scenario is the bleakest and has a residual probability of 10%-20%. It involves the risk of a systemic shock cascade - this will mean that the financial, technological, and geopolitical stresses amplify one another rather than unfolding independently.“The recent phase of highly leveraged AI-infrastructure investment has exposed business models that are dependent on optimistic execution timelines, narrow customer concentration, and long duration capital commitments. A correction in this segment would not end technological adoption, but it could tighten financial conditions, trigger risk aversion and spill over into broader capital markets,” the survey says.In case these developments were to coincide with any geopolitical escalation or trade disruption - it would lead to a sharper contraction in liquidity, a sudden weakening of capital flows, and a shift toward defensive economic responses across regions.,” the Economic Survey warns.While the Economic Survey is confident of India’s economic resilience in each scenario, it notes that India’s economy is not free from these external risks.“In all three scenarios, India is relatively better off than most other countries due to its strong macroeconomic fundamentals, butthis does not guarantee insulation,” it says.What works for India? It’s the advantage of a large domestic market, a less financialised growth model, and strong foreign exchange reserves, and a credible degree of strategic autonomy!“These features provide buffers in an environment where financial volatility is imminent and geopolitical uncertainty is permanent,” the survey says.However, the Economic Survey is quick to caution that either of the three scenarios deal a common a risk for India: disruption of capital flows and the consequent impact on the rupee.“Only the degree and the duration will vary. In a world of geopolitical turbulence, this may not be confined to a year but could be a more enduring feature,” the survey warns.So what should India’s response be? According to the Economic Survey, India needs to generate sufficient investor interest and export earnings in foreign currency to cover its rising import bill, as, regardless of the success of indigenisation efforts, rising imports will invariably accompany rising incomes.The survey points out that this has been the historical global experience. “Economic policy must focus on the stability of supply, the creation of resource buffers, and the diversification of routes and payment systems. 2026 may mark the point at which policy credibility, predictability and administrative discipline cease to be mere virtues and instead become strategic assets in their own right, with lasting relevance,” the survey predicts.Hence the survey advocates an approach where India looks at ‘strategic sobriety’, rather than ‘defensive pessimism’.","India’s strongest macroeconomic performance in decades has collided with a global system that no longer rewards macroeconomic success. “the external environment will require india to prioritise both domestic growth maximisation and shock absorption, with a greater emphasis on buffers, redundancy, and liquidity,” economic survey says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127778413,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-103100,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Prioritising efficiency-linked incentives (ELI) and promoting compliance with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are among key asks from Union Budget 2026-27 to help realise the country’s vision of transforming into a global maritime power.The Maritime India Vision (MIV) 2030 and Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision (MAKV) 2047 serve as a navigational chart for the vision. The MIV focuses on port modernisation and efficiency, while the MAKV sets a long-term agenda for a sustainable, green and technologically advanced maritime sector.Ports in the country handled 1,593.04 million tonne per annum traffic in fiscal 2025, clocking a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~4% over last five fiscals. Meanwhile, port capacity increased to 2,762 million tonne.The MIV aims to increase port capacity to 3,000 million tonne by fiscal 2030.To increase the port capacity and also, cater to the advancements in shipping, development of mega ports (greater than 300 MTPA capacity with 18+ meter draft) is on the agenda. Planning and execution of greenfield ports at Vadhavan and Galathea Bay has started. Outer harbour developments at Paradip, Chennai, Tuticorin are expected to bring the existing ports to mega ports category.State governments such as Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Karnataka are also in the process of developing greenfield ports which will add to overall port capacity in the country.The port capacity utilisation is at 57.7% at an overall level. Non-major ports are maintaining 65-68% capacity utilisation whereas major ports are at 50%.Increase in capacity utilisation by way of enhancing efficiency is required. This can happen by way of implementing multi-fold approach towards modernisation, use of technology, improvement in systems and processes etc., which would enhance traffic, leading to increase in capacity utilisation and revenue. The government can stimulate this by incentivising those ports which show result.While shipbuilding and allied infrastructure projects are seeing uptake across coastal states with the Maritime Development Fund set to provide long-term financing to expand shipbuilding capacity and tonnage, port connectivity infrastructure projects require greater push. The government has launched several policy initiatives for the port sector, including:The government has also come up with Harit Sagar Green Port Guidelines for ports to align with SDGs. However, for implementation of green and sustainability initiatives, the ports would require government support.While asset monetisation to boost income is underway, improvement in efficiency can aid traffic growth and, in turn, increase revenue.Ports are working towards it. At major ports - their average turnaround time (TRT) almost halved from 96 hours in fiscal 2015 to 49.5 hours in fiscal 2025, pre-berthing detention (PBD) time (on port account) declined from 5.02 hours to 3.8 hours, and average output per ship berth day (OSBD) rose from 12,458 tonne to 18,304 tonne.To encourage efficiency at all ports, the budget could introduce an ELI scheme that offers financial rewards to ports and port operators for efficiency gains, such as lower TRT and PBD time and higher OSBD, with incentives tied to improvements over a base year.For the effective implementation of this scheme, a framework can be established to assess ports’ parameters at the end of each fiscal. This would enable the evaluation of improvements in key indicators and efficiency, leading to growth in port traffic and income.Indian ports are aligning with SDGs through initiatives such as ‘Harit Sagar: Green Port Guidelines.’They are focusing on decarbonisation (30% emission cut by 2030), renewable energy (over 60% by 2030), electrification, biodiversity and circularity, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2035 and net-zero by 2047.The country’s port sector seeks to comply with the following SDGs:Achieving these goals requires substantial investment, and ports will need financial support.Non-compliance with these goals risks severe environmental damage, negative socio-economic impacts on coastal communities, loss of global trade competitiveness, and failure to meet national climate commitments.This makes budget allocation crucial to support ports in taking up sustainability and green port initiatives quickly.Thus, together, the twin steps—ELI and alignment with SDGs—can go a long way to catalyse growth and help the sector sail into a brighter future.",India to grow 6 to 8% in real terms in next 5 years: ashwini vaishnaw at davos.

Expectations of limited big-bang changes

NRI concerns also in focus

The common thread

As more Indians participate in a widening range of investments, from financial instruments to property, the question of how gains are taxed is becoming increasingly relevant to middle-class taxpayers too. Whether it is selling shares after a market rally, redeeming mutual fund units, or transferring a house or plot of land, long-term capital gains or LTCG, tax now touches far more people than it once did.What was earlier seen as a concern mainly for seasoned investors or large asset holders is turning into a middle-class compliance issue. With rising retail participation in markets and continued activity in real estate, many taxpayers are finding that understanding how long an asset must be held, what tax rate applies, and how gains can be adjusted against losses is not always straightforward.Against this backdrop, and with the Union Budget just around the corner alongside the rollout of the new Income-tax Act, 2025, in April, tax experts believe the government has an opportunity to further simplify the LTCG framework, reduce interpretational disputes and make compliance less burdensome.As Budget day approaches, Times of India Online conducted a survey asking tax experts: How can the Budget look to make the LTCG regime less complicated?Many believe the immediate priority should be smoother implementation rather than sweeping structural overhauls.At the same time, there is a clear call for further rationalisation of asset classifications, holding periods and loss set-off rules that continue to puzzle taxpayers.Let’s dive deeper into the topic and what can be expected from Budget 2026.Long-term capital gain, or LTCG, refers to the profit earned when a person sells a capital asset after holding it for a specified minimum period. Capital assets include financial investments such as shares, equity mutual funds and bonds, as well as physical assets like land, houses and buildings. If the asset is held beyond the prescribed holding period, the gain is treated as long term and taxed under LTCG provisions.LTCG tax is levied on the difference between the sale price of the asset and its cost, after adjusting for certain allowable expenses and deductions.A key shift in the capital gains regime followed changes announced in Finance Bill 2024. Many long-term capital gains are now taxed at a base rate of 12.5 per cent, but the way this rate applies depends on the type of asset sold. In the case of listed equity shares, equity-oriented mutual funds, and units of business trusts, LTCG is taxed at 12.5 per cent without indexation. Only gains exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh in a financial year are taxable, and gains up to this threshold are effectively exempt, provided conditions such as payment of Securities Transaction Tax, where applicable, are met.One notable exception is when it comes to land and buildings. The Finance (No. 2) Act, 2024, removes the indexation benefit for all long-term capital assets and introduces a uniform tax rate of 12.5 per cent. However, the government has included a grandfathering provision to protect certain taxpayers. Under this provision, resident individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) can still apply indexation on land or buildings acquired before 23 July 2024. They may choose to pay tax at the rate of 20 per cent (with grandfathering) if the tax computed under the new 12.5 per cent rate, without indexation, turns out to be higher. This move ensures that taxpayers who purchased property prior to the amendment are not disadvantaged by the LTCG framework.The holding period that determines whether a gain is long term depends on the type of asset. Whether your profit is treated as short-term or long-term depends on how long you held the asset before selling it.For sales made on or after 23 July 2024, most assets become long-term if held for more than 24 months. However, listed shares, equity-oriented mutual funds, and certain listed securities like debentures, government securities, UTI units and zero-coupon bonds qualify as long-term much earlier, after being held for more than 12 months.For sales made before 23 July 2024, the older rules applied. Under those rules, most assets had to be held for more than 36 months to become long-term. The exceptions were the same special financial assets mentioned above, which needed only more than 12 months, and unlisted shares and immovable property (land or building), which became long-term after more than 24 months.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India, said the spotlight should be on easing the shift to the new law.“As the new Income-tax Act, 2025 will shortly come into effect, the focus is likely to be on ensuring a smooth transition with clear FAQs, practical guidance and easy-to-apply rules. Recent steps such as consolidating asset classes, rationalising tax rates and simplifying holding periods have already provided a strong base for streamlining the regime,” she said.“Further clarity on valuation rules and reporting, supported by pre-filled information, can ease compliance and help reduce interpretational challenges,” she added, sharing her views on the budget expectations when it comes to capital gain taxation.Too many categories, too many conditionsThe maze of asset-wise distinctions that still define how LTCG is taxed and how it can be confusing, was also raised.Sundeep Agarwal, Partner, Vialto Partners, noted that while Budget 2023 rationalised several aspects, the system remains layered. “Union Budget 2023 rationalised capital gains taxation with respect to tax rates, indexation and holding period, but some aspects of LTCG regime still remain complicated. At present, the classification of a financial asset into long-term or short-term (12 or 24 months holding period) is quite complex, it depends on multiple factors, including whether the asset is listed or unlisted or market linked, whether it is a share, mutual fund, ULIP, bond, or debenture, whether the investment is equity or debt oriented, and whether Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has been paid etc. ”He further detailed various expectations from the budget to be presented this Sunday.He said, “It is expected that the FM may further simplify and standardise the assets category, thereby enhancing ease of understanding, reducing disputes, and improving overall tax compliance.”Adding his 2nd expectation, he added, “from the Budget is to simplify the provisions related to set-off of losses. Current capital gains set-off rules are governed by the classification of gains and losses into long-term or short-term. While both long-term and short-term gains can be set off against short-term losses, long-term gains can be set off only against long-term losses. Where the long-term and short-term capital gains and losses arising in the current year as well as carried forward from earlier years co-exist, then the computation becomes highly complex. Simplifying set-off rules would ease compliance and make the provisions more taxpayer-friendly.”Agarwal gave his input on the third expectation saying, “Another key expectation from the Budget concerns expanding the scope of the section 87A rebate. Currently, only the long-term capital gains from specified assets such as listed equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds, etc., are eligible for rebate, rest other asset classes and all short-term capital gains are excluded. To ensure parity and provide meaningful relief to small taxpayers, the rebate provisions could be broadened to cover all capital gains, regardless of asset type or holding period. ”Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director, Deloitte India, shed light on how different rules apply depending on the asset and the taxpayer’s profile.“LTCG has divergent rules on holding period, reinvestment relief, tax rates and computation methodology based on residential status, and nature of the underlying asset. Having multiple rulesets makes it challenging to comprehend and comply for individual taxpayers. While the last Budget addressed inconsistencies in holding periods, a further rationalisation and simplification would significantly improve ease of compliance,” she said.Further voicing his opinion on simplification of categories she said, “Greater flexibility in setting off capital losses across asset classes and the introduction of a common, simplified reinvestment relief framework together with lock-in provisions could meaningfully reduce complexity and minimise litigation. Additionally, enhanced and appropriate disclosures in Form 26AS/AIS and enabling pre-filled tax return forms that accurately capture data for LTCG would enhance voluntary compliance. ”Some financial experts, however, believe the government may largely stay the course after major changes in recent years.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India, said, “The Finance Act (No. 2), 2024 has already rationalized capital gains tax rates and asset classifications to a large extent. Therefore, no major changes are anticipated in this area at least from an individual tax perspective.”Tanu Gupta, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP, echoed this view while suggesting targeted relief. “The government has already undertaken substantial simplification of the capital gains framework in recent years. Key measures such as the streamlining of holding periods across asset classes (listed securities, unlisted shares, and immovable property), greater uniformity in tax rates, and the removal of indexation in certain cases have significantly reduced complexity and interpretational issues,” she said.However, she did suggest the possibility for some minor changes saying, “Given these reforms, there may be limited scope for further structural simplification of the capital gains regime at this stage. However, from a taxpayer-relief perspective, the Budget could consider a modest enhancement of the exemption threshold under section 112A. Increasing the current exemption limit of Rs 1.25 lakh on long-term capital gains from listed equity and equity-oriented funds to Rs 1.5 lakh or Rs1.75 lakh could provide incremental relief to retail investors without adding complexity to the regime. ”Compliance challenges for non-resident Indians are another area flagged for attention.Richa Sawhney, Partner, Tax, Grant Thornton Bharat, said, “TDS of 1% is applicable in case of transfer of immovable property (other than agricultural land) in case of transactions exceeding INR 50 lakh, where the seller is resident India. This provision is not applicable in case the seller is a NRI. NRIs at times face a lot of delays and challenges in obtaining lower withholding certificates, during property sales. Similar provisions should be considered for NRIs as well.”Across views, the message to the Finance Minister was primarily less about rate cuts and more about simplifying the rulebook. Fewer asset-based distinctions, simpler loss set-off rules, broader rebates for small taxpayers and smarter pre-filled returns could turn LTCG from a technical thicket into a more navigable path for ordinary investors.Experts also shared that predictability and consistency in interpretation are just as important as tax reliefs or rate cuts. Simplified definitions, standardised reporting formats and better alignment of provisions with the tax department data could reduce disputes and confusions. The next phase of reform should make compliance feel routine rather than intimidating for the growing number of taxpayers now dealing with capital gains.","As more indians participate in a widening range of investments, the question of how gains are taxed is becoming increasingly relevant to middle-class taxpayers. Tax experts believe the government has an opportunity to further simplify the ltcg framework, reduce interpretational disputes and make compliance less burdensome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127777842,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1446067,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Role of the President in the Budget

NEW DELHI: The Union Budget for the 2026–27 fiscal year is set to be presented on February 1, Sunday, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman poised to table her ninth consecutive Budget in Parliament. The Budget will lay out the Centre’s statement of accounts, economic priorities, fiscal strategy and policy direction, offering key signals on which sectors may receive greater support and which could face tighter scrutiny this year.Beyond numbers, the Budget will chart the Union government’s economic roadmap and outline its approach to optimal resource allocation, providing a broader blueprint for the country’s growth trajectory.This will be the first time in recent history that the Union Budget is presented on a Sunday. The Budget Session of Parliament began on January 28 and is scheduled to continue until April 2.February 1, however, was not always the designated date for the Budget. Until 2017, it was traditionally presented on the last working day of February. The change was introduced under the Modi government, with then-finance minister Arun Jaitley advancing the date to ensure faster implementation of budgetary measures within the same financial year.The first budget of independent India, meanwhile, was presented on November 26, 1947, by the country’s first finance minister, R K Shanmukham Chetty.The buzz around the Budget gained momentum with the start of the Parliament session and President Droupadi Murmu’s address to the joint sitting of both Houses. In her speech, the President outlined the government’s vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"" and highlighted achievements in social justice, economic growth, infrastructure development, national security and global engagement.A day later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his pre-Budget remarks, underlined India’s growth momentum, describing the country as self-confident and a “ray of hope for the world today.”The Union Budget is a yearly record of the government’s accounts and financial transactions for a “fiscal year”, a 12-month period used for financial reporting. In India, the fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31. Prepared by the finance ministry, the Budget sets out the government’s financial roadmap and policy priorities for the year.The Union Budget shows how much money the government expects to earn and how it plans to spend it during a financial year. The meaning of the Union Budget is given in Article 112 of the Constitution, which requires the government to present its estimated income and expenditure for the year.This document is also called the annual financial statement. In India, the financial year runs from April 1 to March 31, and the Budget is prepared by the finance ministry.The Revenue Budget deals with the government’s regular income and daily expenses. Revenue receipts include money earned through taxes such as income tax and GST, as well as non-tax income like fees and interest.Revenue expenditure includes spending on salaries, pensions, subsidies, welfare schemes, and public services. When the government’s revenue spending is higher than its revenue income, it results in a revenue deficit.The Capital Budget focuses on long-term finances of the government. Capital receipts mainly include loans taken from the public, foreign governments, and institutions such as the Reserve Bank of India.Capital expenditure is money spent on long-term development projects like roads, railways, hospitals, schools, and other infrastructure. When the government’s total expenditure is more than its total income, it leads to a fiscal deficit.The Union Budget is a key part of the government’s functioning and is presented every year. It sets the economic direction of the country by showing the government’s priorities and financial goals. The Budget explains how resources will be allocated across sectors such as health, education, defence, infrastructure, and welfare. It also signals which industries may receive support and which may face tighter controls, helping businesses and investors plan their decisions.The Budget directly affects people’s daily lives. It announces changes in income tax slabs, tax rates, deductions, and how income tax is calculated. These decisions influence household finances, savings, and spending, helping people plan better for the coming year.In years when Lok Sabha elections are held, the government presents an Interim Budget instead of a full Budget. After the elections, the new government presents the complete Union Budget. This happened in the 2024–25 financial year due to the Lok Sabha elections.The Budget process starts with the President.. Under Article 87 of the Constitution, the President addresses a joint sitting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha at the beginning of the Budget Session. This address outlines the government’s policies, achievements, and plans for the year ahead. Although the speech is delivered by the President, it is prepared by the Union Cabinet.After the President’s address, a Motion of Thanks is moved in both Houses of Parliament. Members debate the speech and vote on it, formally approving the government’s roadmap. With the new Parliament building, this joint sitting now takes place in the new chamber.The President plays an important constitutional role in the Budget process. As the head of the executive and the legislature, the President’s recommendation is required for Money Bills, including the Union Budget. This makes the President’s approval a necessary step before the Budget is presented in Parliament.","The union budget for the 2026–27 fiscal year is set to be presented on february 1, sunday.

School education, when it appears, is usually framed through access: new classrooms, higher enrolment, more coverage. What is discussed less often is the harder question: whether learning quality, teacher capability and institutional depth are keeping pace with the scale of the system itself.The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 recognised this imbalance early. Its emphasis on outcomes, pedagogy, assessment reform and teacher capacity marked a deliberate shift away from enrolment-first thinking. But policy architecture, however well-designed, does not execute itself.The next phase of reform depends not on fresh intent, but on whether public investment is willing to stay the course—patiently, predictably and at scale.It is this translation gap, between policy ambition and classroom reality, that education leaders are now urging the Budget to confront.Articulating this concern, Ms. Arti Dawar, CEO, Shiv Nadar School, says,“As India advances the goals of the NEP 2020, school education requires sustained investment in teacher training, leadership development, and institutional capacity-building to translate policy intent into classroom impact…”One of the recurring gaps in India’s education-to-employment pipeline is the late introduction of workplace exposure. According to Dawar, the Budget must recognise that employability does not begin in college—it is shaped much earlier. “Early integration of industry partnerships and skill-based training will be instrumental in preparing students for evolving workforce demands. We need structured internship programs, mentorship initiatives, and investments in technology-driven solutions,” she notes.She adds that such collaborations are not peripheral to schooling, but directly linked to national goals. “Such collaboration aligns with both the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) enhancement goals and India’s broader economic competitiveness objectives,” Dawar says.While digital learning infrastructure expanded rapidly during the pandemic, access remains uneven—creating new hierarchies between connected and disconnected classrooms. For Dawar, Budget priorities must explicitly address this divide. “Digital infrastructure has become foundational to equitable school education. Universal access to devices, reliable connectivity, and high-quality, locally relevant content are essential to bridging the urban–rural divide,” she says.The risk, she argues, is that technology could deepen exclusion if left to market forces alone. “Budgetary focus on digital equity will ensure that technology serves as an enabler of inclusion rather than a differentiator, allowing students across geographies to participate meaningfully in modern learning ecosystems,” Dawar adds.With automation and generative AI reshaping industries, education experts increasingly warn against treating future skills as an “add-on” subject. Dawar argues that foundational skills—critical thinking, digital literacy and problem-solving—must be embedded early in schooling. “The foundation of employability is often built early in schools. Early exposure to critical thinking, digital literacy, and real-world problem-solving must be prioritised,” she says.She points to curriculum reform as a key lever. “Increased support for curriculum modernisation and industry-aligned learning frameworks can help schools prepare students for evolving skill demands shaped by technology, automation, and generative AI,” Dawar adds.Across policy debates, one consensus remains unchallenged: No education reform outpaces its teachers. Dawar argues that Budget allocations must reflect this reality more clearly.“Transforming India’s education system depends on empowering our educators with contemporary pedagogical skills and subject expertise,” Dawar says.Calling for structured, continuous professional development, she adds, “The budget must prioritise comprehensive professional development programs that encompass digital pedagogy, competency-based teaching methods, and the integration of emerging technologies.”The return on this investment, she notes, is unusually high. “Teacher training is an important investment, as every trained educator impacts thousands of students throughout their careers, making it a critical multiplier for achieving NEP 2020’s transformative vision,” Dawar says.","Union budget 2026 is being pitched around growth, skills and competitiveness. Education leaders argue the real test now is outcomes.

Against the backdrop of global challenges and heightened uncertainty, the Survey has backed reforms, including regulatory entities, and called for “creating a cadre of professionals”, who are adept in regulatory design and implementation, to improve the ease of doing business.“Policy reforms do matter. Process reforms arguably more so. Processes define the interaction between govt and governed. So, they make all the difference to success or failure of policy intent and reforms. The signs are very promising,” said V Anantha Nageswaran, chief economic adviser and author of the Survey.“The deregulation and smart regulation initiatives undertaken by states in the last year, in particular, provide ample grounds for optimism that the state machinery is capable of reinventing itself and its mission, shifting from regulation and control to enabling. Together with Union govt’s economic reforms and other policy initiatives, this signals that the state understands significance of the challenge and the need to rise to it,” said Nageswaran in the preface to the report card, which backed the “need to reimagine state capacity in all its dimensions. ”The Survey says a significant gap persists in the availability of human resources capable of ensuring the efficient functioning of a market economy and recommends that schools of regulatory studies could be established either as new stand-alone institutions or as additions to existing institutions.It also says that to build sustained expertise, regulators and regulatory tribunals should attract professionals at a younger age to pursue dedicated careers.The survey calls for a streamlined, single-tier approval process, coupled with institutional accountability for any lapses, and says this is essential for an economy aspiring to be a developed country.","The survey has backed reforms, including regulatory entities.

If you are looking at the Economic Survey for clues to the Budget, you need not look beyond the cover showing how trade may be the dominant theme. Within that the annual economic report card makes no bones about the need to push manufacturing, going beyond the usual policy prescription to call it a strategic imperative.“Manufacturing competitiveness and exports are important for maintaining long-term currency stability and strength. Moreover, when the security of supply of essential and infrastructure goods is no longer assured, manufacturing takes on a far greater strategic dimension,” says the 687-page document.The policy trajectory was not limited to swadeshi but underlined the need for a “calibrated shift” from import substitution to scale, competitiveness and innovation, all with a view to be part of the global value chain. “Rather than seeking complete self-reliance in every segment, India needs to build strategic resilience through diversification and creating depth of capabilities,” signalling a change in tenor.The survey cautions against high protection in sectors, such as steel, aluminium and textile fibre, arguing that costs rise for export-oriented businesses. While taking note of the strong growth in services, especially IT, the report flags that there can be no substitute for manufacturing exports.“Services have done much of the heavy lifting, creditable and macro-stabilising, but not a substitute for the goods-based export ecosystems that ultimately underpin durable external and currency stability… ”","The annual economic report card makes no bones about the need to push manufacturing.

Blame current a/c deficit for high cost of capital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/blame-current-a/c-deficit-for-high-cost-of-capital/articleshow/127786694.cms,".

India’s high cost of capital is a macroeconomic outcome rather than a financial-sector flaw. Borrowing is expensive not because malfunction in market, but because the economy saves too little and relies on foreign capital to fund its investment gap. Persistent current account deficits force India to pay a risk premium to global investors, which is then embedded in domestic interest rates and equity returns. The result, the Survey says, is a cost of capital that acts as a tax on growth.For the first time, the blame of high interest rates is placed outside the financial system. As the Survey notes, “Empirical analysis suggests that improving the Current Account Balance (CAB) is nearly twice as effective in lowering long-run interest rates compared to simple financial deepening (private credit to GDP)”. External balance matters more than credit expansion. Fiscal structure reinforces this pressure.“Weak fiscal discipline at the state level, driven by revenue deficits and unconditional cash transfers, affects sovereign borrowing costs as investors increasingly assess consolidated general-govt finances,” pushing up the risk premium across economy.High capital costs also shape industrial behaviour. Capital-intensive upstream sectors struggle to scale, nudging firms towards protection and policy shelter rather than productivity gains. When capital becomes costly, efficiency gives way to negotiation and resilience is sought through insulation rather than competitiveness.","India’s high cost of capital is a macroeconomic outcome rather than a financial-sector flaw.

The Economic Survey frames insurance as a growth problem disguised as a coverage problem. To close India’s protection gap and deliver “Insurance for All by 2047,” it says the sector must outpace nominal GDP, not inch alongside it. The binding constraint is not demand but distribution.“The escalating cost of acquisition is not merely an operational friction, it acts as a structural constraint on the sector’s evolution, creating distortions that limit inclusion, erode consumer value, and threaten long-term stability.”Acquisition costs for insurance companies include commissions and fees that they pay to distributors for selling policies. According to industry persons, the incentives to bankers to sell insurance vis-a-vis bank deposits is one of the triggers for mis-selling of insurance.That cost drag has produced what the Survey calls a penetration–density paradox. Insurers extract more revenue from existing customers, yet fail to widen base. Penetration has slipped to 3.7%, even as density rose to $97 in FY25, a sign that overhead-heavy distribution is shrinking risk pool rather than broadening it. Acquisition costs are no longer an operational irritant but a structural brake on stability and consumer value.The proposed fix is a policy-led reset. Legislative changes under Sabka Bima, Sabki Suraksha Act, 2025, aim to pull in long-term capital.","The economic survey frames insurance as a growth problem disguised as a coverage problem.
