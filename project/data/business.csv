"Driven by state-run utilities, distribution companies post Rs 2,700cr profit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/driven-by-state-run-utilities-distribution-companies-post-rs-2700cr-profit/articleshow/126661081.cms,"From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: Power distribution companies in the private and public sectors have staged a smart turnaround, reporting a combined profit of over Rs 2,700 crore in 2024-25, as against losses of Rs 25,553 crore in the previous year, govt said on Sunday.Power ministry officials attributed this to improved performance by state-run power utilities.""If we look at the last three financial years, private distribution companies have been posting profits, which went up further in the last financial year. The positive profit after tax in 2024-25 is the result of a sharp decline in losses of state-run power discoms,"" said a senior power ministry official.The Centre said infrastructure modernisation and accelerated smart metering, prudent tariff structures and the transparent accounting of subsidies to ensure full recovery had aided the performance of discoms. Providing for subsidies is seen to be critical as state after state is announcing free power for consumers up to a certain level, and in the absence of money being set aside in the budget, discoms have to bear the burden.Additional measures - such as introducing uniform accounting and greater transparency across distribution utilities to improve financial governance, enforcing legal contracts through timely payments to support investment in new renewable energy projects and incentivising states to implement critical power sector reforms by linking borrowing limits to performance metrics under the additional borrowing scheme - also contributed to the improved financial performance, govt said.The impact of these reforms is evident not only in the bottom lines but also in other performance indicators, including a reduction in aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses and a narrowing gap between the average cost of supply and the average revenue realised, the ministry said.AT&C losses, a key parameter of efficiency, have reduced from 22.6% in 2013-14 to 15% in 2024-25, an official statement said. Reforms such as late payment surcharge rules led to a 96% reduction in outstanding dues to generating companies, from Rs 1.4 lakh crore in 2022 to Rs 4,927 crore by Jan 2026, while reducing payment cycles from 178 days in 2020-21 to 113 days in 2024-25, it added.Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner at consulting firm PwC India, said the return of some state discoms to profitability should be seen as a structural inflection point rather than an accounting exercise, driven by improved billing efficiency, lower AT&C losses, better subsidy discipline and selective tariff rationalisation.Yet, there is a long way to go for the discoms, which had accumulated losses of Rs 6.8 lakh crore in 2022-23.Besides, regulatory assets, due to insufficient pass-through of costs, were estimated at over Rs 3 lakh crore, mainly in states such as Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi and West Bengal.Anujwsh Dwivedi, partner at Deloitte India, said from a financial sustainability perspective, resolving the outstanding debt pile of over Rs 7 lakh crore in state-owned discoms is the most significant challenge facing the sector.","Power distribution companies in the private and public sectors have staged a smart turnaround.

‘Can’t Stay Two Days In Delhi’: Gadkari On Severe Pollution, Transport Sector Role

Under the leadership of Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, the Delhi Government has taken a major decision to further expand the capital's Metro network. The Government has released its share of funds for the remaining three corridors of Phase IV of the Delhi Metro Rail Transit System (MRTS).According to an official release, the Chief Minister stated that these projects will provide improved Metro connectivity to various parts of Delhi and further strengthen the public transport system. The corridors are expected to be completed within four years. Efficient metro operations will also play a significant role in controlling pollution.The three Phase-IV Metro corridors will have a combined length of 47.225 kilometres. The projects are estimated to cost approximately Rs 14,630.80 crore, of which Rs 3,386.18 crore will be met by the Delhi Government.The first corridor is proposed from Lajpat Nagar to Saket G-Block, with a length of 8.385 kilometres and eight elevated Metro stations. The second corridor is proposed from Inderlok to Indraprastha, with a length of 12.377 kilometres. This line will have a total of ten Metro stations, one elevated and nine underground.This corridor has been included under a combined financial framework with the Lajpat Nagar- Saket G-Block corridor. The combined project cost of these two corridors is Rs 8,399.81 crore, of which the Delhi Government's share will be Rs 1,987.86 crore.The third and longest corridor is proposed from Rithala to Kundli, extending connectivity to the neighbouring state of Haryana. This corridor will be 26.463 kilometres long and will include 21 stations. The total cost of this project has been estimated at Rs 6,230.99 crore, with the Delhi Government's share amounting to Rs 1,398.32 crore. Of the total cost, Rs 5,685.22 crore will be spent for Delhi and Rs 545.77 crore for Haryana, the release noted.These three corridors will provide better travel facilities to residents across several parts of Delhi. The Lajpat Nagar-Saket G-Block corridor will pass through Lajpat Nagar, Andrews Ganj, GK-1, Chirag Delhi, Pushp Bhawan, Saket District Centre and Pushp Vihar.The Inderlok-Indraprastha corridor will connect areas such as Inderlok, Dayabasti, Sarai Rohilla, Ajmal Khan Park, Jhandewalan, Nabi Karim, New Delhi Railway Station, Delhi Gate, and Delhi Secretariat-IG Stadium.The extensive Rithala-Kundli corridor will pass through Rithala, Rohini Sectors 25, 26, 31, 32, 36, Barwala, Rohini Sectors 35 and 34, Bawana Industrial Area-I (Sectors 3-4 and 1-2), Bawana JJ Colony, Sanoth, New Sanoth, Bhorgarh village, Narela Anaj Mandi, Narela DDA Sports Complex, Narela, Narela Sector-5, Kundli and Nathupur.The tendering process for these corridors is underway, and basic work has already begun on some of them. All three corridors are expected to be completed within four years. The construction of these metro corridors will enhance connectivity across northern, central and southern parts of Delhi, as well as the Delhi-NCR region. This will reduce traffic pressure on roads, save commuters' time and promote the use of public transport.According to a release, Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said that the three Phase-IV corridors will provide Delhi with a modern and robust public transport system aligned with future requirements. She said the project will ensure safe, convenient and time-efficient travel for commuters, reduce dependence on private vehicles and contribute to pollution control. The Chief Minister added that the Delhi Government is continuously taking concrete steps towards making the capital a world-class city, and the expansion of the Metro network is a key part of this commitment.","The government has released its share of funds for the remaining three corridors of phase iv of the delhi metro rail transit system.

Infrastructure as a catalyst for industrial growth

‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

Translating policy intent into global manufacturing competitiveness

(Arnab Basu is Partner and Chief Industries Officer, PwC India)

As India advances towards achieving the government’s vision of Viksit Bharat, Budget 2026 arrives at a poignant moment in the country’s economic journey. Over the past decade, public policy has laid strong structural foundations through reforms, infrastructure expansion and a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing which has collectively reshaped India’s growth trajectory. The task before the upcoming Budget is not to reset direction, but to consolidate gains, deepen execution and ensure that public investment continues to crowd in private capital at scale.At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure. Sustained public CapEx has been one of the most defining features of recent budgets, supporting growth even amid global uncertainty. Investments in roads, railways, ports, airports and digital infrastructure have improved connectivity, reduced logistics costs and strengthened India’s competitiveness across sectors.The Union Budget FY26 has the opportunity to build further on this momentum by continuing a high level of CapEx allocation, while sharpening focus on project execution, asset monetisation and state-level capacity building. The next phase of infrastructure growth must prioritise outcomes related to productivity gains, faster completion cycles, and stronger linkages between physical and digital networks.Equally important is the role of infrastructure in enabling India’s manufacturing ambitions. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, announced over successive Budgets, have begun to yield tangible results across electronics, pharmaceuticals, automotive components and renewable energy equipment. As India seeks to position itself as a trusted manufacturing partner in global value chains, this year’s Budget can focus on refining these schemes—shifting from capacity creation to deeper supply-chain integration, technology adoption and MSME participation. Simplifying compliance, improving access to long-term finance, and strengthening industrial clusters will be critical to sustaining manufacturing competitiveness beyond initial incentives.The manufacturing opportunity in India is both cyclical and structural. While geopolitical realignments and supply-chain diversification are creating near-term openings, domestic demand, urbanisation, and rising incomes provide a long-term anchor. Policy continuity will therefore be key. Measures such as stable customs regimes, faster approvals, and coordinated centre-state frameworks can reinforce investor confidence. Targeted investments in logistics parks, warehousing and multimodal transport can further reduce the cost of manufacturing and exports which has been a long-standing constraint for India’s manufacturing industry.While infrastructure and manufacturing form the core of Budget expectations, the role of technology (especially AI) cannot be overlooked. AI is increasingly becoming a horizontal enabler, enhancing productivity in design, operations, maintenance and supply chain planning across infrastructure and industrial sectors. Budget 2026 can support this transition through targeted incentives for digital adoption, investments in data infrastructure, and skilling programmes that prepare the workforce for technology-enabled manufacturing. The focus should be on practical application rather than experimentation alone, ensuring that AI investments translate into measurable productivity gains.Skilling and human capital development remain another critical lever. Large-scale infrastructure and manufacturing expansion will require a workforce equipped with both technical and digital skills. Building on initiatives such as Skill India and recent efforts to align skilling with industry needs, the Budget can further strengthen public-private partnerships in vocational training, apprenticeships, and continuous upskilling. Ensuring that India’s demographic dividend is absorbed into these sectors will be central to achieving inclusive and sustainable development.From an investor's perspective, policy predictability and fiscal discipline will be crucial. In the past, India has demonstrated that growth-oriented spending can coexist with a credible fiscal consolidation path and the Union Budget FY26 will have to continue this balancing act by maintaining CapEx while managing deficits and debt prudently. According to PwC’s 28th Annual Global CEO Survey: India Perspective, a majority of Indian CEOs remain confident about the country’s economic growth, underpinned by reform stability and sustained public investment. Preserving this confidence will depend on the Budget’s ability to reinforce continuity while addressing emerging execution challenges.Beyond numbers and allocations, this year’s budget will be read as a signal of intent. For global investors, it will indicate how firmly India is committed to strengthening its role in global manufacturing and infrastructure-led growth. For the domestic industry, it will shape decisions on capacity expansion, technology adoption, and long-term investment, while for the states, it will define the contours of cooperative federalism in delivering large-scale projects.The Union Budget FY26 represents an opportunity to reinforce the foundations of Viksit Bharat through steady, purposeful policy action. By sustaining infrastructure investment, deepening manufacturing capabilities and enabling technology-led productivity, the Budget can help ensure that India’s growth story remains resilient and inclusive. As the economy navigates an evolving global landscape, it is this consistency of direction and execution that will preserve momentum and translate ambition into enduring economic outcomes.","At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure.

Budget 2026: Will tax provisions ease for crypto assets?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-will-tax-provisions-ease-for-crypto-assets/articleshow/126525033.cms,"Losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.

Key concerns flagged:

Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities.

Use of offshore exchanges, private wallets, and decentralised platforms complicates enforcement and obscures transaction trails, hindering accurate tax assessment and recovery.

Jurisdictional limitations add to the challenge, as many transactions occur outside India’s regulatory reach, making compliance and enforcement “virtually impossible.”

A tax framework that bites:

Non-residents and the unresolved ‘situs’ question:

Reporting income from VDAs:

Suggestions for

Budget 2026

:

Allowing set-off of losses between different VDAs, even if not against other income

Providing statutory guidance on the situs of VDAs, especially for non-residents

Reviewing the impact of 1% TDS on market liquidity

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has raised fresh concerns about the risks posed by virtual digital assets (VDAs) such as cryptocurrencies, aligning its stance with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The tax department’s warning presented recently to a Parliamentary Standing Committee of Finance underscores regulatory agencies' growing scepticism about cryptocurrencies fit within India’s financial and taxation framework. It highlights revenue risks, enforcement gaps and potential misuse for evasion or illicit finance.The tax regime in India, for VDAs can be considered as one of the most stringent in the world.The Finance Act, 2022, ushered in a bespoke tax regime for VDAs by inserting section 115-BBH into the Income-tax Act, 1961 (I-T Act). Income from the transfer of VDAs is taxed at a flat 30%, plus surcharge and cess, regardless of the holding period. The law allows only the cost of acquisition as a deduction, barring transaction fees, exchange charges or other expenses.More critically, losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.Losses also cannot be carried forward. A parallel provision mandates 1% tax deduction at source (TDS) on transfers beyond specified thresholds, further tightening liquidity. To illustrate: For a salaried individual, a 1% TDS is applicable on transfer of the VDAs if the transaction amount exceeds ­10,000.Various associations have in their pre budget submissions, argued that disallowing set-off of losses between VDAs is economically distortive and ultimately counterproductive for tax revenues.The argument is simple: when losses are ring-fenced, but gains are fully taxed, risk-taking is penalised asymmetrically. This has reportedly contributed to trading volumes migrating offshore, exchanges shifting operations overseas and Indian investors being pushed into cross-border structures that raise FEMA and compliance complexities.The result is a tax structure that treats crypto trading far more harshly than equities, real estate or even speculative assets, despite its growing mainstream adoption.While section 115-BBH of the I-T Act, applies equally to residents and non-residents, tax provisions are not clear on a crucial issue: where is a VDA located? For non-residents, taxability hinges on whether income accrues or arises in India (the provisions of sections 5 and 9 of the I-T Act and the relevant tax treaty provisions come into play).Unlike shares or immovable property, VDAs lack a clearly identifiable physical or legal location. In the absence of legislative clarity on the situs of crypto assets, non-resident taxation risks becoming a fertile ground for disputes particularly where trading occurs on global exchanges, assets are held in offshore wallets and sale proceeds are received outside India.Experts point out that clarity is essential to avoid avoidable litigation. Jurisdictions such as the UK offer guidance by linking the situs of crypto assets to the residential status of the beneficial owner, an approach India could adapt.Individuals dealing in cryptocurrencies are required to disclose income from virtual digital assets in Schedule VDA of their annual income tax returns — typically ITR-2 or ITR-3, depending on their income profile. The schedule seeks granular information, including the date of acquisition and transfer, cost of acquisition and sale consideration. Accurate reporting is crucial, as any under-reporting or misreporting of VDA income can attract penalties, apart from interest on unpaid tax.Possible reforms being discussed in policy circles include:Ashish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch said, ""India’s VDA ecosystem is at a pivotal stage, with growing adoption across the country. However, the current tax framework presents challenges for retail participants by taxing transactions without recognising losses, creating friction rather than fairness. A reduction in TDS on VDA transactions from 1% to 0.01% could improve liquidity, ease compliance, and enhance transparency while preserving transaction traceability. Raising the TDS threshold to ₹5 lakh would help protect small investors from disproportionate impact.""""Introduced in 2022 as a stand-in for regulation at that time, VDA taxation has since been complemented by strong oversight from FIU-IND and improved compliance. This Budget presents a great opportunity to revisit the framework in a manner beneficial to both investors and the government. We remain hopeful that the government will recognize this gap and consider reviewing the current framework soon,"" he concluded.","Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities.

Budget 2026 for taxpayers: Five fixes that can make taxes less taxing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-for-taxpayers-five-fixes-that-can-make-taxes-less-taxing-explained/articleshow/126666769.cms,"The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe.

By Nishant Khemani

One return, one choice

Cut the sting in foreign remittance TCS

NPS withdrawals: clarity needed on taxability

Level the NPS field under the new regime

Time for

joint tax returns

(Nishant Khemani is a chartered accountant and Managing Partner of the Saturn Consulting Group)

Every Union Budget comes with its share of grand announcements, but for ordinary taxpayers, the real test lies in the fine print. As Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are modest yet meaningful: simplify compliance, nudge long-term savings, and stop treating convenience as a luxury. Here are five changes that could make the tax system smarter, softer and more sensible.The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe. Form 10-IE, required to opt in or out of the new regime, is a classic case of procedural overkill. Many taxpayers either forget to file it or file it incorrectly, losing out on the more beneficial regime. The fix is simple: embed the option directly into the ITR. A single return, a clear choice, no extra forms. Ease of doing business should also mean ease of filing taxes, especially for salaried individuals who neither game the system nor enjoy paperwork.A 20% TCS on foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme was introduced to plug tax leakages. The intent is understandable, but the dosage is excessive. For genuine remittances for family support the high TCS blocks liquidity and creates avoidable stress.A more balanced approach would be to reduce TCS to 10%, or introduce a slab system: lower rates up to, say, ₹50 lakh, and higher rates thereafter. Compliance should be encouraged, not coerced.Recent changes to NPS withdrawal rules are a welcome step. Subscribers can now withdraw up to 100% of the corpus if it is within ₹8 lakh, and 80% if it exceeds that limit. This adds flexibility and makes NPS more attractive.But there’s a catch—or rather, a question mark. Till now, only 60% of the corpus was tax-free on maturity. How will the additional 20% be taxed? The Budget should clarify this and remove the ambiguity. Ideally, the extra withdrawal should also be tax-free, reinforcing NPS as a credible retirement pillar rather than a tax puzzle.Under the new tax regime, deductions are scarce, making Section 80CCD(2), the employer contribution to NPS, a rare oasis. However, the additional ₹50,000 deduction under Section 80CCD(1b) is still unavailable in the new regime. Extending this deduction, and enhancing it to ₹1 lakh under the new regime, would send a strong signal. Global evidence is clear: tax incentives drive long-term savings. A stronger NPS today means lower old-age dependency and reduced fiscal pressure tomorrow.India’s tax system still treats married couples as financial strangers. Introducing joint tax returns, with a higher exemption threshold for married couples, would recognise modern household economics—especially double-income families. Such a move would put more disposable income in the hands of families, improve tax equity and align India with global best practices. After all, if households plan together, why shouldn’t they file together?In sum, Budget 2026 doesn’t need fireworks. It needs fine-tuning. Fewer forms, fairer taxes, clearer rules, and smarter incentives could go a long way in making taxation less intimidating—and more humane.","The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers.

An evolving path

NEW DELHI: The Budget is not just an economic document or an annual statement of accounts of the central government - it’s the road map that sets the tone and direction of economic reforms and growth. It also signals policy direction to citizens, businesses and investors, shaping confidence and long-term economic outcomes. Over the last few decades, several Union Budgets in India have stood out for being reformist, transformational and path breaking.From Manmohan Singh ’s landmark 1991-92 Budget that opened up the Indian economy and Chidambaram’s ‘Dream Budget’ to Jaswant Singh’s 2003–04 Budget and Nirmala Sitharaman’s new income tax regime measures, we take a look at some Union Budgets that stood out in the last few decades:On February 28, 1983, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee stood before Parliament and announced what he called ""the somewhat unconventional step"" of allocating Rs 300 crore to states based not on population or political negotiation, but on measured performance in implementing specific programmes.""Another Rs 125 crore would be distributed among the States on the basis of their performance in implementing programmes in identified areas of high priority.""Mukherjee told Parliament.The budget documents specified the mechanism: states would receive funding only after demonstrating capacity to achieve targets above those implied in their approved plans. This was outcome-based federalism a decade before the phrase entered policy discourse.Beyond allocation mechanisms, the 1983-84 budget introduced what Mukherjee termed a ""minimum tax"" on corporate profits. His solution was structural. ""I therefore propose to provide that fiscal incentives and concessions shall not absorb more than 70 per cent of the profits. This would secure that companies pay a minimum tax, on at least 30 per cent of their profits."" he said.The 1983-84 budget received limited attention at the time. India was emerging from drought, international attention was focused elsewhere, and the changes appeared technical. But the principles embedded in that budget—performance-based allocation, minimum taxation regardless of incentives, mandatory investment norms for tax-exempt entities—would recur in subsequent reforms.Two years later, V.P. Singh presented a budget that addressed what he termed the ""counter-productive"" nature of India's personal income taxation. In his February 16, 1985 speech, Singh outlined a comprehensive approach to tax reform.The changes were substantial. Singh raised ""the exemption limit for personal income taxation from Rs 15,000 to Rs 18,000"" which, he noted, would result in ""around 10 lakh"" assessees being removed from the tax net entirely. He restructured the rate schedule, reducing the number of slabs ""from eight to four.""""The maximum marginal rate of income-tax on personal incomes will stand reduced from 61.875 per cent to 50 per cent,"" Singh announced.On corporate taxation, Singh adopted the minimum tax principle from Mukherjee's earlier budget, noting: ""There are companies which are flourishing, but are paying no tax at all."" But he went further on depreciation policy. Recognizing that ""the internal funds available with the corporate sector are inadequate"" for modernization, he announced: ""I propose to increase the general rate of depreciation in respect of plant and machinery from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. ""For energy efficiency, the approach was more aggressive: ""I propose to go farther and allow 100 per cent depreciation on devices and systems for energy saving.""The budget also began dismantling the industrial licensing system. ""It is proposed to notify a list of industries for delicensing so that procedural delays are cut to a minimum,"" Singh stated.When Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi presented the 1987-88 budget on February 28, 1987, his focus was not merely fiscal but institutional. For education, the commitment was substantial. ""To give a good start to the new Policy, I have allocated as much as Rs 800 crore for education as compared with Rs 352 crore in 1986-87,"" he said. This represented more than a doubling of education expenditure in a single year.This decision led to the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, which received statutory powers through legislation in 1992. Prior to SEBI, the Controller of Capital Issues regulated securities markets through the Capital Issues (Control) Act of 1947—a wartime measure designed for a controlled economy, not a liberalising one.Gandhi also announced expansion of the mutual fund industry beyond the monopoly of Unit Trust of India. ""The State Bank of India will set up a Mutual Fund"" to provide investors with additional options, he said. This was the first step toward creating a competitive mutual fund industry.The Union Budget presented on July 24, 1991 marked a decisive break in India’s economic policy, which was later commonly called LPG or Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation. The strategy was framed explicitly as a response to the balance of payment crisis. Addressing Parliament, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh argued that “over centralisation and excessive bureaucratisation of economic processes have proved to be counter productive,” leaving the economy less productive, less competitive, and acutely vulnerable to shock.The scale of the crisis was laid out in blunt terms. “The fiscal deficit of the Central Government… is estimated at more than 8 per cent of GDP in 1990–91,” Singh said, while “external debt… is estimated at 23 per cent of GDP.” Foreign exchange reserves had fallen to “Rs 2500 crores,” sufficient to finance “imports for a mere fortnight.” India, he warned, stood “at the edge of a precipice.”The policy response was structural rather than incremental. Industrial licensing was dismantled across most sectors as the government moved to “bring about a significant measure of deregulation in the domestic sector.” Trade policy shifted “from a regime of quantitative restrictions to a price based mechanism,” reinforced by exchange-rate adjustment and export promotion, while monopoly controls were relaxed to intensify domestic competition.Privatisation and globalisation as they were later referred to followed as complementary pillars of reform. Fundamentally it was about disinvestment and restructuring. Public enterprises were to be refashioned into “an engine of growth rather than an absorber of national savings,” through equity dilution, greater managerial autonomy and clearer accountability.To cushion the social impact of restructuring, Singh announced “a National Renewal Fund, with a substantial corpus,” ensuring that “the cost of technical change and modernisation… does not devolve on the workers.”Foreign investment, long viewed with suspicion, was recast as essential to recovery and competitiveness. India would “welcome, rather than fear, foreign investment,” permitting up to 51 per cent foreign equity in priority industries. The reforms, Singh concluded, were no longer a matter of choice: “no power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come”.P. Chidambaram's 1996-97 budget, presented on July 22, 1996, addressed a fundamental structural problem: India's financial system was unable to provide long-term finance for infrastructure projects.""Infrastructure needs long-term finance, typically 15-20 year financial instrument"" Chidambaram stated.The IDFC was designed as ""a direct lender, as a refinancing institution and as a provider of financial guarantees"" to infrastructure projects. This created institutional capacity for long-term infrastructure financing that had not previously existed in India's financial architecture.The budget also strengthened highway development. ""I have decided to provide a sum of Rs 200 crore to strengthen the capital base of the National Highway Authority of India.""On disinvestment, Chidambaram announced the establishment of a Disinvestment Commission. ""Any decision to disinvest will be taken and implemented in a transparent manner. Revenues generated from such disinvestment will be utilised for allocations for education and health and for creating a fund to strengthen public sector enterprises.""P. Chidambaram’s 1997–98 Union Budget, presented on February 28, 1997, came to be known as the “dream budget” for its sweeping tax reforms and its explicit recognition of the information technology revolution. Chidambaram framed his proposals around the logic of the Laffer Curve, arguing that an optimal tax rate exists at which revenue is maximised, and that pushing rates beyond this point reduces collections by discouraging work and investment.On personal income tax, he made a clear break with past practice. “If we look at comparative income-tax slabs in other developing Asian countries, it will be evident that tax rates in India are still high and constitute an important reason for tax evasion,” he said.""I have, therefore, decided to lower the rates of personal income-tax across-the-board in a significant manner. The current rates of 15, 30 and 40 per cent are being replaced by the new rates of 10, 20 and 30 per cent."" Chidambaram announced.On capital markets, Chidambaram introduced five structural reforms to the Companies Act. ""Over 20 million Indians have invested their savings in the capital market. The establishment of the first Depository was an important step taken to bring the Indian capital market upto world standards and to protect the interests of the investors,"" he said.The reforms included introducing the principle of buy-back of shares by companies subject to certain conditions; merging provisions of Sections 370 and 372 of the Companies Act with an overall ceiling of 60 per cent for inter-corporate investment and loans; providing for nomination facilities for holders of securities; requiring companies raising funds from the capital market to give an annual statement disclosing the end-use of such funds; and giving one-time permission to stockbrokers to corporatise their business without attracting tax on capital gains.The budget also announced comprehensive legislative reform. ""I had set up an expert group to draft a new Companies Bill and another expert committee to prepare a new Direct Taxes Bill."" Chidambaram said.Perhaps most significantly for India's future trajectory, Chidambaram explicitly recognized information technology as a transformative force. ""Information Technology has radically altered conventional wisdom on growth strategies. I propose several measures to encourage this industry and to reduce costs,"" he stated.When Yashwant Sinha presented the 1999-2000 budget on February 27, 1999, he signaled a fundamental shift in how the state would manage public sector enterprises. For the first time after Independence, with the enthusiastic support of all political parties in Parliament, it had been possible to discard the long standing tradition of presenting the budget at 5 PM—a break with colonial practice that symbolized the broader reforms to come.""Government's strategy towards public sector enterprises will continue to encompass a judicious mix of strengthening strategic units, privatising non-strategic ones through gradual disinvestment or strategic sale and devising viable rehabilitation strategies for weak units,"" FM Yashwant Sinha said.The disinvestment programme drew primarily upon the recommendations of the Disinvestment Commission, which had submitted eight reports containing recommendations for 43 public sector enterprises. ""In 1999-2000, I propose to raise Rs.10,000 crore through the disinvestment programme. This will help the Government to fund the requirements of social and infrastructure sectors"" he announced.The budget also addressed a fundamental governance challenge. ""The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act has become obsolete in certain areas in the light of international economic developments relating to competition laws.""This recommendation led to the Competition Act of 2002 and the establishment of the Competition Commission of India.On expenditure management, Sinha announced two institutional innovations. ""We will constitute an Expenditure Reforms Commission headed by an eminent and experienced person,"" he stated. He also proposed to initiate a system of zero base budgeting in preparation for the next budget.When Jaswant Singh presented the 2003-04 budget on February 28, 2003, India had recovered from the 1991 crisis but fiscal discipline remained elusive. FM Jaswant Singh's diagnosis was clear: ""Interest payments in 2002-03 are estimated at Rs 1,15,663 crore, equivalent to 48.8 per cent of the Government's revenue receipts.""The solution was to bind future governments through legislation. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, passed in August 2003, set legally enforceable targets to reduce fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, end automatic monetization of the deficit by the Reserve Bank of India, and cap annual government guarantees at 0.5 per cent of GDP.The Act also mandated transparency. Every budget would now include a Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement, a Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, and a Macroeconomic Framework Statement. The government would have to publicly explain deviations from targets.""The Government has nurtured macroeconomic stability—held inflation low, and maintained a strong balance of payments position while promoting growth,"" Singh stated.The one-page tax return was introduced. ""I propose to introduce a one-page only return form for individual tax payers, having income from salary, house property and interest, etc. This has already been devised, and will come into operation from April 1 onwards."" he said.Tax clearance certificates were abolished. ""Henceforth, only expatriates who come to India in connection with business, profession or employment, would have to furnish a guarantee from their employer, etc. in respect of the tax payable before they leave India. An Indian citizen, before leaving India, will only have to give his/her permanent account number.""On search and seizure operations, new protections applied. ""Stocks found during the course of a search and seizure operation will not be seized under any circumstances. Second, no confession shall be obtained during such search and seizure operations. Third, no survey operation will be authorized by an officer below the rank of Joint Commissioner of Income Tax.""On July 8, 2004, P. Chidambaram returned as Finance Minister and introduced a budgetary innovation that would be replicated across multiple sectors: earmarked taxation.""I propose to levy an education cess of 2% on the aggregate of all Central government taxes,"" Chidambaram stated.The cess was not additional spending—education allocations continued from the general budget. Rather, it created visible linkage between taxation and social investment. Citizens paying income tax, corporations paying corporate tax, importers paying customs duty—all would see 2 per cent of their tax bill designated specifically for education.The innovation was transparency. Unlike general taxation where revenues disappeared into the Consolidated Fund, earmarked cesses made the social contract visible: you pay this specific amount, it funds that specific purpose.The budgets presented by Pranab Mukherjee between 2009 and 2012 coincided with the rollout of digital identity infrastructure that would transform benefit delivery.In his 2009-10 budget, presented in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Mukherjee stated: ""The challenge before us is to revive the economy without compromising medium-term fiscal sustainability.""Budget documents during this period referenced the Unique Identification Authority of India, established in January 2009 through executive order. The UIDAI was mandated to issue unique identification numbers—Aadhaar—to all residents.Subsequent Mukherjee budgets referred to pilot programs for Aadhaar-based beneficiary identification and direct benefit transfers. Though not fully implemented during his tenure, the budgetary provisions and pilot programs laid groundwork for the JAM trinity that would later enable direct benefit transfers at scale.Arun Jaitley's February 1, 2017 budget came months before the July 1, 2017 rollout of the Goods and Services Tax—India's most complex tax reform since independence.""The GST Council has held nine meetings and taken decisions on the basis of consensus,"" Jaitley stated.The GST replaced 17 central and state indirect taxes with a unified framework. But the institutional innovation was the GST Council itself—a constitutional body comprising the Union Finance Minister, Union Minister of State for Revenue, and Finance Ministers of all states.The Council operated on consensus. Each state had one vote; the Centre had one-third of total votes. Decisions required three-fourths majority. This forced negotiation, compromise, and federal cooperation on tax rates, exemptions, thresholds, and compliance procedures.For the first time in Indian fiscal history, tax policy for a major revenue source was made not by the Union government alone, not by Parliament alone, but by a federal body requiring agreement between Centre and states.The Union Budget for 2020-21 was presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2020. In her speech, Sitharaman referred to the National Infrastructure Pipeline, which identified infrastructure projects across sectors over a multi-year horizon.A Project Preparation Facility was announced to support the appraisal and design of infrastructure projects. The budget documents referred to the involvement of technical and professional expertise in project preparation. The formulation of a National Logistics Policy was also referred to, with the objective of clarifying roles across ministries and reducing duplication.“In continuation of the reform measures already taken so far, the tax proposals in this budget will introduce further reforms to stimulate growth, simplify tax structure, bring ease of compliance, and reduce litigations” she said.The budget increased capital expenditure and outlined plans for asset monetisation through a structured pipeline. The National Monetisation Pipeline was referred to in the budget documents as a mechanism for leasing public assets.But the 2020-21 budget's most consequential institutional reform was in personal income taxation. Sitharaman announced a fundamental restructuring of the tax regime itself.The Union Budget for 2025-26 was presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The budget referred to Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0, which proposed the decriminalisation of specified provisions across multiple laws. The objective, as stated in the budget documents, was to reduce compliance burden and improve ease of doing business.Under the new tax regime, the Finance Minister said no income tax will be payable on incomes up to Rs 12 lakh, excluding income taxed at special rates, with the limit rising to Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers after the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.A high-level committee was announced to review non-financial sector regulations, licences, and permissions. The budget proposed the introduction of a new Income Tax Bill. ""The new bill will be clear and direct in text so as to make it simple to understand for taxpayers and tax administration,"" Sitharaman stated.Thresholds for tax deduction at source and tax collection at source were revised. The budget also announced revisions to thresholds for certain categories of taxpayers, including senior citizens and small enterprises.Four decades separate Mukherjee's performance-based grants from Sitharaman's compliance rationalisation. Yet the trajectory is consistent: budgets have served as instruments of institutional adaptation, responding to the evolving challenges of the Indian state.India's budgetary reforms have not followed a predetermined blueprint. They have emerged from negotiation between continuity and change—preserving the state's redistributive role while dismantling mechanisms that stifled growth.What remains unresolved is whether these frameworks can keep pace with emerging challenges. Digital taxation, climate financing, and the fiscal implications of changing demography require a budget as an anchor of reform and evolution. The budget, once again, may need to serve as more than an accounting exercise.","The budget is not just an economic document or an annual statement of accounts of the central government. It’s the road map that sets the tone and direction of economic reforms and growth. It also signals policy direction to citizens, businesses and investors, shaping confidence and long-term economic outcomes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126620895,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-663350,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
Budget 2026: The urgent need to tackle long-pending and long drawn-out tax litigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-the-urgent-need-to-tackle-long-pending-and-long-drawn-out-tax-litigation/articleshow/126556471.cms,"As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals).

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Here are top five issues that

Budget 2026

should tackle:

1. Reduce pendency before CIT(A) and allow refund of taxes collected during pendency of appeal

2. Rationalise provisions to facilitate obtaining full stay of demand during pendency of appeals

3. Reducing administrative inconvenience and hardship

4. Avoiding repetitive appeals by the Revenue

5. Strengthening the advance ruling mechanism

As the Union Budget 2026 draws closer, industry bodies and tax professionals are urging the government to shift part of its reform focus from tax rate rationalisation to the far more structural problem of long-pending direct tax litigation. On the ground, businesses argue that predictability, timeliness and administrative efficiency in dispute resolution matter as much as headline tax rates—particularly for capital-intensive sectors such as manufacturing.The scale of the problem is substantial. As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals), involving disputed demands of about ₹18.16 lakh crore. Protracted disputes result in working capital being locked up for years, management attention diverted from productive activity, and depressed valuations when Indian promoters seek foreign investment.Industry body FICCI has flagged the mounting backlog at the CIT(A) level as a critical bottleneck in the dispute resolution framework.The first appellate authority, meant to serve as an effective corrective forum, has instead become a point of prolonged delay.FICCI points out that pendency increased sharply after the faceless appeal regime was rolled out in 2021. While faceless appeals were introduced to eliminate physical interface and improve transparency, the absence of effective monitoring and the unfamiliarity of both officers and taxpayers with the technology have led to repeated notices, duplication of submissions and delayed disposals. Even where taxpayers have filed detailed responses on the portal, they are often asked to resubmit information without clarity on what additional inputs are required. Virtual hearings, when sought, are not granted liberally, and even when conducted, limitations in document presentation weaken effective representation.A key procedural gap, according to FICCI, is the absence of any time limit for assessing officers to submit remand reports called for by the CIT(A), coupled with ambiguity over whether jurisdictional officers or faceless units are responsible for such reports. Meanwhile, parallel penalty proceedings are routinely initiated while quantum appeals remain pending, resulting in both quantum and penalty matters piling up at the first appellate stage.The industry body warns that the litigation lifecycle—already 12 to 15 years before Covid—has now lengthened by another five years. This not only delays revenue collection for the government but also forces companies to carry disputed tax demands as contingent liabilities, adversely impacting share valuations during fund-raising or stake sales.To address this, FICCI has recommended prioritised disposal of appeals involving high-pitched assessments, scrutiny cases, matters where detailed submissions have already been filed, issues covered by High Court or Supreme Court rulings, and appeals pending for over five years. It has also called for filling nearly 40% vacancies at the CIT(A) level and introducing a dual-track system, with fast-track disposal for simple, low-value cases and a detailed track for complex, high-value disputes, backed by differentiated timelines and targets.Tax professional Sandeep Bhalla, Partner at Dhruva Advisors, notes that appeals pending before the CIT(A) for more than two years cause serious hardship, particularly where disputed demands continue to remain outstanding. He argues that in such cases, taxpayers should not be compelled to wait indefinitely and should be allowed to approach the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) directly.Bhalla suggests a structured mechanism under which the assessee could approach the Range Head (Additional or Joint Commissioner), who would prepare a concise factual and legal factsheet. This, along with the appeal records, could then be placed directly before the Tribunal for adjudication. Such a process, he believes, would help decongest the CIT(A) level while ensuring quicker resolution of long-pending disputes.At the same time, Bhalla emphasises that institutional accountability must be built into the system so that appeals remaining undisposed beyond two years without taxpayer fault are treated as a measurable performance failure rather than an administrative inevitability.FICCI has also called for a rethink of the current framework governing stay of disputed tax demands. Although CBDT instructions provide that a stay may be granted on payment of 20% of the disputed demand, taxpayers are often required to make this payment even when the issue has been decided in their favour in earlier years.Compounding the problem, refunds for subsequent years are routinely adjusted by the Central Processing Centre (CPC) against demands that are formally stayed, because stay orders are not digitally integrated with CPC systems. According to FICCI, this defeats the very purpose of a stay and intensifies liquidity stress for businesses.To resolve this, the industry body has suggested creating a real-time interface enabling assessing officers to upload stay orders so that stayed demands are automatically excluded from refund adjustments. It has also proposed allowing alternative forms of security—such as bank guarantees or indemnities—in appropriate cases instead of insisting on a cash pre-deposit, noting that international tax administrations adopt similar risk-based approaches without compromising revenue protection.Bhalla highlights that even after taxpayers succeed in appeals, delays in passing Orders Giving Effect (OGEs) often render appellate relief meaningless. Refunds remain on paper for months, or even years, resulting in continued cash-flow strain.He recommends that OGEs be system-driven and mandatorily passed within three months, with interest payable for departmental delays made personally recoverable from the concerned assessing officer. Mandatory uploading of scrutiny and compliance reports on the tax portal, he argues, would enhance transparency and accountability.Bhalla also points to the largely mechanical nature of rectifications under section 154 against CPC adjustments under section 143(1). He suggests that taxpayers should be allowed to file detailed reconciliations, that CPC orders rejecting rectification must give clear reasons, and that a virtual hearing should be provided wherever adjustments are proposed to be confirmed.Despite settled judicial precedents, the Revenue continues to litigate recurring issues, adding to the backlog. Bhalla recommends that the CBDT issue authoritative position papers on key settled matters, particularly those affecting specific industries, and hold field officers accountable for filing appeals contrary to binding rulings.Bhalla also flags concerns around the functioning of the Board for Advance Rulings, which replaced the Authority for Advance Rulings in 2021. More than four years on, the mechanism has failed to deliver the certainty it was meant to provide, especially for cross-border and high-value transactions, underscoring the need for corrective measures in Budget 2026.As India positions itself as a preferred investment destination, the credibility of its tax dispute resolution system will be closely watched by both domestic and global investors. Meaningful reforms that reduce pendency, ensure timely refunds and curb avoidable litigation could significantly improve confidence on the ground. Budget 2026, therefore, has a chance to signal that tax certainty and administrative efficiency are central to the government’s growth strategy.","As of april 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the commissioner of income-tax (appeals) industry body ficci has flagged the mounting backlog at the cit(a) level as a critical bottleneck.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Budget 2026 outlook: ICRA flags focus on debt consolidation; capital expenditure push to continue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-outlook-icra-flags-focus-on-debt-consolidation-capital-expenditure-push-to-continue/articleshow/126641391.cms,"Representative image

The government is expected to prioritise medium-term debt consolidation while continuing a strong push for capital expenditure in the Union Budget for 2026-27, according to pre-Budget expectations outlined by rating agency ICRA.ICRA said the upcoming Budget assumes added significance as it will be the first to align with the recommendations of the 16th Finance Commission, which will decide fiscal transfers between the Centre and the states for the next five years.The agency expects the Centre’s fiscal deficit to be capped at around 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2026-27, slightly lower than the 4.4 per cent budgeted for 2025-26, supported by an estimated 9.8 per cent growth in nominal GDP.On this trajectory, the Centre’s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to ease from 56.1 per cent in 2025-26 to about 55.1 per cent in 2026-27, in line with the medium-term consolidation path.However, in absolute terms, the fiscal deficit is expected to rise to Rs 16.9 trillion in 2026-27 from Rs 15.7 trillion in 2025-26, mainly due to higher capital expenditure.ICRA said the government is likely to front-load infrastructure spending before fiscal rigidities increase from 2027-28 onwards, when the implementation of the 8th Central Pay Commission is expected to raise salary and pension liabilities.“We believe that the GoI will push up capital expenditure by ~14% (to Rs 13.1 trillion), before fiscal rigidities in the form of higher committed expenditure set in from FY2028,” the agency said.Capital expenditure is projected to rise to Rs 13.1 trillion, or 3.3 per cent of GDP, from an estimated Rs 11.5 trillion in 2025-26, supporting investment activity and improving the quality of government spending.On the revenue side, gross tax revenues are expected to grow by around 7 per cent in 2026-27, led by an 11 per cent rise in direct taxes, while indirect tax growth may remain muted at about 2 per cent following GST rate cuts from September 2025.After devolution to states, net tax revenues are projected to increase by 5.2 per cent to Rs 28.5 trillion.Revenue expenditure growth is expected to stay contained at around 4 per cent, helping the revenue deficit narrow to Rs 4.7 trillion, or 1.2 per cent of GDP, the lowest in nearly two decades.At the same time, gross market borrowings are projected to rise by 15–16 per cent to Rs 16.9 trillion in 2026-27 due to higher capital spending and increased debt redemptions.The Union Budget for 2026-27 is scheduled to be presented in Parliament on February 1, 2026.",Icra said the upcoming budget assumes added significance as it will be the first to align with the recommendations of the 16th finance commission.

Budget 2026: India's crypto sector calls for clarity and tax relief; seeks 1% TDS rationalisation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-indias-crypto-sector-calls-for-clarity-and-tax-relief-seeks-1-tds-rationalisation/articleshow/126610560.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

As the Union Budget approaches, India’s cryptocurrency sector is seeking clear rules for digital assets. It is also seeking for a rationalisation of the 1% TDS on crypto transactions to boost investor confidence and encourage onshore participation.In the Union Budget 2025, the finance minister left the existing tax framework for VDAs unchanged, despite repeated appeals from the industry, which has argued that the current rules discourage investors and traders. India formally recognised cryptocurrencies as Virtual Digital Assets in Budget 2022, introducing a defined tax regime.Under the Income Tax Act, Sections 115BBH and 194S govern the taxation of VDAs such as cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital tokens. Gains from VDAs are taxed at a flat 30 per cent, along with a 1 per cent TDS on transactions, while non-trading income is taxed as per an individual’s income slab, according to ET.Industry leaders said that the upcoming budget is a key moment for course correction. Raj Karkara, Chief Operating Officer at ZebPay, said Budget 2026 comes at a pivotal time for India’s crypto ecosystem.“The Union Budget 2026 comes at a pivotal moment for India’s crypto ecosystem, with the industry hopeful for long-awaited regulatory clarity that can bring greater direction and confidence to the investors and a clear and consistent framework for digital assets would help strengthen trust among investors, institutions, and market participants, while enabling business to operate responsibly within well-defined boundaries,” he said.Karkara added that from a taxation standpoint, rationalising the current 1 per cent TDS could improve liquidity and encourage stronger onshore participation. He also called for a review of the flat 30 per cent tax on VDA gains, aligned with other asset classes and allowing loss set-offs, to create a more balanced investment environment.“Greater policy clarity could unlock innovation, help India’s Web3 ecosystem scale responsibly, and strengthen the country’s role in the global crypto economy,” he said.Nischal Shetty, founder of WazirX, said the budget offers an opportunity to refine the existing framework.“This budget is a clear opportunity to fine-tune a framework which supports transparency and compliance while fostering innovation,” he said. He added that the lower transaction-level TDS and allowing loss set-offs could revive onshore liquidity and improve compliance.Shetty highlighted that clear rules on reporting would boost investor confidence and support a sustainable digital asset ecosystem aligned with India’s $5 trillion economy goal.Pankaj Balani, CEO and co-founder of Delta Exchange, said India’s strong global crypto adoption should be matched with a clear ‘Make in India’ approach.“India’s leadership in global crypto adoption reflects strong grassroots participation from both retail users and sophisticated market participants, the upcoming Union Budget is an opportunity to match that momentum with a clear ‘Make in India’ approach to the digital assets industry,” he said.Balani stressed the need to support compliant domestic platforms that follow Indian KYC and anti-money laundering norms, capital controls and data protection rules, while acting decisively against unauthorised entities. He said policy should clearly differentiate between compliant Indian platforms and non-compliant offshore operators.Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX, said the sector is looking for measured relief, especially as it has been four years since the current tax framework was introduced.“The virtual digital asset sector is naturally looking for measured relief, especially since it has been four years since the current taxation framework was introduced and the decisions taken now can meaningfully accelerate innovation and help India emerge as a global Web3 and VDA leader,” he said.Gupta highlighted the need for clear rules and uniform implementation of TDS across all crypto exchanges, saying this would improve compliance and enhance consumer protection by curbing non-compliant operators.SB Seker, Head of APAC at Binance, said India’s rapid adoption of blockchain and VDAs reflects the scale of its digital economy and growing retail participation.“The forthcoming budget presents an opportunity to strengthen the VDA ecosystem through measured regulatory and tax refinements that protect users, maintain financial stability, and support responsible market development,” he said.","India formally recognised cryptocurrencies as virtual digital assets in budget 2022, introducing a defined tax regime.

Industry leaders said that the upcoming budget is a key moment for course correction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126610828,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1651150,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
"Union Budget 2026: FY27 fiscal deficit likely to peg at 4.3% of GDP, says ICRA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2026-fy27-fiscal-deficit-likely-to-peg-at-4-3-of-gdp-says-icra/articleshow/126586801.cms,"‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

The government is likely to peg the fiscal deficit at 4.3 per cent of GDP in the next financial year beginning April 2026, while continuing with double-digit growth in capital expenditure, rating agency ICRA said in its pre-Budget expectations on Friday.ICRA said it expects a shortfall of about Rs 1.3 lakh crore in net tax revenues in the current fiscal, while non-tax receipts are likely to exceed the 2025-26 Budget target by around Rs 80,000 crore.“Fiscal slippage unlikely in FY2026, if shortfall in receipts is matched by expenditure savings,” it said.According to ICRA, the FY2027 Union Budget will be significant as the government’s focus is expected to shift towards medium-term debt consolidation rather than annual fiscal deficit targets, alongside the rollout of the 16th Finance Commission’s recommendations for the next five years.The agency expects the fiscal deficit to be capped at 4.3 per cent of GDP in FY2027, assuming nominal GDP growth of 9.8 per cent. This would be marginally lower than the Budget Estimate of 4.4 per cent for FY2026.ICRA said the government is likely to raise capital expenditure by 14 per cent to Rs 13.1 lakh crore in FY2027, before fiscal rigidities begin to intensify from FY2028 onwards due to higher committed expenditure linked to the recommendations of the 8th Central Pay Commission on salary and pension revisions for Central government employees and pensioners.Despite the expected moderation in the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio, the agency said gross dated market borrowings are projected to rise sharply by 15–16 per cent to Rs 16.9 lakh crore in FY2027. This increase would be driven mainly by higher redemptions, although it could be partly offset through switching of government securities, ICRA added.","Icra said it expects a shortfall of about rs 1.3 lakh crore in net tax revenues in the current fiscal. Non-tax receipts are likely to exceed the 2025-26 budget target by around rs 80,000 crore. The agency expects the fiscal deficit to be capped at 4.3 per cent of gdp in fy2027.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126586997,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1084787,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
