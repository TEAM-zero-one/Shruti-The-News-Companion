(Kuldip Kumar is Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP)

As the Union Budget approaches, expectations of major tax giveaways appear muted. However, this Budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the Government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform amid a challenging economic environment.The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive US trade agreement, geopolitical tensions, and continued foreign institutional investor outflows are likely to influence policy decisions. Measures announced in this year’s Budget are therefore expected to align closely with the Government’s broader economic and reform framework.Accordingly, incentivising businesses particularly export-oriented sectors and accelerating employment generation are likely to receive focused attention in this Budget.Last year’s Budget delivered meaningful tax relief through revisions in personal income-tax slabs and enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, leaving limited headroom for further concessions.These changes were introduced under the new tax regime, while the old tax regime was left unchanged.This approach was intended to encourage taxpayers still following the old regime to transition to the simpler new tax system.For FY 2023–24, nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime, and this proportion is expected to increase further in the current year.Does this mean the old tax regime could be phased out entirely? Perhaps not immediately, especially since the new tax regime has also been incorporated into the Income Tax Act, 2025.However, given the continued instances of misuse and claims of incorrect deductions under the old regime, it would not be surprising if the Government eventually considers doing away with it altogether.In the 2024 Budget, the Government made significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including revisions to holding periods and tax rates, with the objective of simplification. While some asset classes benefited, tax rates on listed securities both short-term and long-term and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), were increased.Given the growing participation of retail investors in Indian capital markets, there is a case for reviewing these measures. While challenging from a revenue perspective, the Government could consider moderating capital gains tax rates on listed securities or enhancing the basic exemption limit for long-term capital gains, currently set at ₹1.25 lakh. Further, permitting set-off of long-term capital losses against short-term capital gains in Budget 2026 would improve tax equity and align treatment of capital assets.Fiscal Discipline Remains an Important ConsiderationThe Government is expected to adhere firmly to its fiscal consolidation path, leaving limited scope for aggressive fiscal expansion. That said, carefully calibrated policy measures particularly those aimed at stimulating consumption and job creation could strengthen growth momentum and improve tax buoyancy. As with most fiscal initiatives, the benefits of such measures are likely to become visible only after a time lag.Tax simplification remains an ongoing journey. While significant progress has been achieved through digitisation and pre-filled data, several pain points persist:Clubbing provisions continue to complicate joint ownership of assets between spouses, despite the sound financial logic behind such arrangements. Introducing an option for joint tax filing, as practiced in countries like the United States, could significantly ease compliance.Notional taxation on vacant properties is often perceived as inequitable and warrants reconsideration.TDS and TCS mechanisms, though effective for tracking transactions, frequently result in excessive deductions and cash-flow strain for taxpayers, especially where final tax liability is substantially lower.Pre-filled tax returns could be further expanded, particularly for salaried taxpayers without business income, reducing manual intervention and errors.Despite the delegation of appellate powers to Joint Commissioners, a substantial backlog of tax appeals continues to persist. Introducing clearly defined timelines and enhancing accountability would help restore taxpayer confidence.Similarly, the practice of adjusting refunds against disputed demands often for several years requires urgent reform.Refunds granted in favour of taxpayers should be released automatically, without the need for repeated follow-ups or grievances.Trust as the Cornerstone of ComplianceRecent initiatives where tax authorities proactively alert taxpayers to potential mismatches mark a positive shift towards a trust-based compliance framework. The Government has already introduced the Taxpayers’ Charter; effective enforcement of its principles on the ground would benefit both sides in improving compliance for the Government while offering peace of mind to the taxpayers.While Budget 2026 may not be about headline-grabbing tax cuts, it is likely to outline how the Government intends to navigate uncertainty, sustain growth, reinforce fiscal discipline, and deepen structural reforms.In that sense, this Budget may prove to be less about immediate relief and more about building long-term economic resilience.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations appear muted.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Incentives for the debt market

Social security—Retirement and insurance

(Jiju Vidyadharan is Senior Director, Crisil Intelligence)

The Union Budget 2026 provides the government an opportunity to accelerate India’s economic transformation in the wake of prolonged global uncertainties and higher tariffs imposed by the United States.Crisil has projected India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7% for fiscal 2026, driven by consumption support, government’s infrastructure thrust and policy initiatives.According to the forecast by the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook Report of April 2025, India is the world’s fourth-largest economy and could surpass Germany to become the third-largest in the next three years, with GDP projected to reach $7.3 trillion by 2030.Rationalisation of the goods and services tax rates and strong balance sheets of corporates and financial institutions, coupled with supportive monetary and fiscal policies, are expected to bolster economic activity.The next phase of India’s growth will not only be driven by government spending or corporate capital expenditure but also household participation in the financial markets. India has relatively higher savings rates 1 among top economies.Within gross financial savings, we see increased allocation to capital market instruments like mutual funds and insurance.Indian households have traditionally favoured fixed-income products. Globally, there are two avenues of funding growth—loan and capital markets. The domestic mutual fund industry’s assets under management (AUM) clocked a CAGR of over 20% in the past five fiscals to reach Rs 80.23 lakh crore as of December 2025. The mutual fund folio count rose 16.11% on-year to 26.12 crore. Systematic investment plan (SIP) assets stood at Rs 16.63 lakh crore, accounting for 20.7% of the overall mutual fund assets, driven by the highest ever monthly inflow of Rs 31,002 crore. While retail participation in equity markets has seen strong growth, largely driven by SIPs and market-linked returns, debt remains underrepresented in household portfolios, with savings still skewed toward traditional fixed deposits. Debt AUM as a percentage of total AUM declined to 22.6% from ~45% in December 2020.Against this backdrop, we have two key expectations from the budget from a personal finance standpoint:Deepening the debt market is critical from an issuer’s perspective to ensure access to long term, cost-effective funding and an investor’s perspective, offering liquidity, transparency and risk diversification.Asset allocation plays a critical role in building long-term financial stability and the growth of the debt market is central to this balance. Strengthening the debt market through targeted incentives such as tax efficiency, product innovation and greater awareness can encourage a gradual shift from plain fixed deposit products to diversified debt instruments. This will not only improve risk-adjusted outcomes for investors through better asset allocation but also channel a larger pool of household savings into the formal debt market, enhancing liquidity, deepening market depth and supporting the overall financial system.1.Tax incentives for investors: Restore indexation benefits for long-term debt investments, lower capital gains tax on debt mutual funds held beyond a defined period.2. Incentives for greater participation in market-linked debt instruments: Promote and encourage higher retail participation through online bond platform providers with simplified know your customer norms and lower ticket sizes. In addition, provide budgetary support for financial literacy on debt products and asset allocation.Social security in India continues to have significant scope for deeper penetration, especially across the vast unorganised sector where formal retirement and protection mechanisms remain limited. While salaried participation in structured retirement products has improved, a large segment of the workforce still lacks access to pension and insurance cover, underscoring the need for wider inclusion. Over the past year, the National Pension System has seen meaningful refinements in the form of greater flexibility, improved choice architecture and efforts to enhance ease of participation, strengthening its position as a core retirement product. With a broader product basket now in place, there is an opportunity to introduce targeted incentives and policy measures to widen retirement coverage in the unorganised sector.To widen the social security net, a mutual fund voluntary retirement account (MF-VRA) scheme can be rolled out, which aims to provide a voluntary, employer-linked retirement product, managed by mutual funds, similar to the US’ 401(k) plan.The MF-VRA scheme could build on the long-term policy laid out by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, enhancing reach and promoting financial inclusion. It could ride on the growth of mutual funds in India, which has crossed assets worth Rs 80 lakh crore as of December 2025.Personal finance and economic growth are intricately linked. Put simply, when individuals invest wisely through diversified equity and debt instruments, their financial security improves and the economy benefits from long-term capital.A well-crafted budget has the potential to unlock new opportunities for growth and with careful planning and foresight, individuals can make the most of it.",Crisil intelligence has projected india’s gross domestic product (gdp) growth at 7% for fiscal 2026. The next phase of india's growth will not only be driven by government spending or corporate capital expenditure but also household participation in the financial markets.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127803313,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-77998,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

The Union Budget 2026 comes at an important moment, as taxpayers prepare for a major shift—the introduction of the Income-tax Act, 2025 (ITA 2025), effective April 1, 2026. This is one of the most significant updates in decades, and many individuals are hoping that the Budget will ease the transition with clarity and stability.With the new system ahead, households are likely to be looking for measures that offer predictability and simpler compliance so families can plan taxes with confidence.In recent years, India’s personal tax framework has steadily moved towards simplification. The concessional new tax regime became the default structure, with reduced slab rates and fewer exemptions. Capital-gains rules were also made more uniform across asset classes. For households, this shift meant ease of filing with lesser documentation to be maintained, clearer choices between regimes and lower chances of inadvertent errors.These reforms appear to have encouraged wider participation: ITR filings rose from 8.13 crore in FY 2023-24 to 8.68 crore in FY 2024-25, a 6.72% increase, and around 72% of taxpayers opted for the new regime in FY 2023-24.The ITA 2025 reduces the number of sections from 819 to 536 and cuts the overall word count nearly in half—from 5.12 lakh to 2.60 lakh. While this represents meaningful structural simplification, individuals will still need help interpreting what has changed. A plain-English FAQ, along with an “old-to-new” comparison and simple illustrations for salary, rent and capital gains, could convert this statutory rewrite into practical time saved for families.Digital ease continues to be a key expectation. Filing has already become smoother with prefilled returns, enhanced dashboards and faster processing. Strengthening these systems further, especially through more comprehensive prefill of capital-gains, dividend and interest information, would help individuals adapt to the new law with fewer follow-ups and less filing-related stress.Investments in Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) seem to have grown, and more streamlining around loss set-off and cross-category VDA movements would be helpful especially for the younger investors who may dabble more in these asset classes. Likewise, retail participation in Futures and Options has risen, and many small investors face audit requirements designed for business traders. Simpler, more practical guidance in both areas would help individuals avoid misreporting and unnecessary compliance burdens.For many families, funds being blocked due to taxes being collected at source (TCS) on foreign remittances remains a routine challenge. While salaried taxpayers are now allowed to set-off the TCS against their salary withholding tax (TDS), not all taxpayers are able to avail this benefit especially where the taxpayer has only other sources of income like interest and dividend. This clubbed with backlog of tax disputes results in taxpayers having to wait for longer durations for refunds to be issued.Faster hearings, clearer procedures and more efficient disposal mechanisms would provide meaningful relief to individuals stuck in long pendency. Quicker closure of small-value appeals (on any issue), in particular, could significantly reduce household stress and unnecessary out-of-pocket costs.Households may also look for targeted relief at the lower end of the income spectrum. Under the new tax regime, the current rebate ensures that individuals with income up to Rs 12 lakh face no tax liability. For salaried taxpayers, the Rs 75,000 standard deduction effectively extends this relief to those with gross income up to Rs 12.75 lakh. A further calibrated enhancement, if considered, could help families manage inflationary pressures while keeping the system simple and aligned with the Budget’s broader focus on stability and taxpayer experience.A related development ahead of the Budget is the ICAI’s recommendation to introduce optional joint taxation for married couples, similar to systems in the US and Germany. Under the current law, each spouse files separately, which can disadvantage single-income households that cannot utilise the second spouse’s unused exemptions. Allowing couples to file a joint return could offer meaningful relief to families that pool incomes and plan finances together, particularly where income distribution between spouses is uneven.Overall, as households prepare for this major legislative transition, what they are seeking most is clarity, simplicity and stability. Straightforward rules, easy-to-understand guidance and stronger digital support can help individuals adjust to the new framework with confidence. Addressing administrative challenges, such as TDS/ TCS complexity and delays in dispute resolution, would further ease the transition.","The income-tax act, 2025 (ita 2025), effective april 1, 2026, is one of the most significant updates in decades.

Growth, Inflation, Jobs Improve, But Risks Loom: What CEA’s Economic Survey Briefing Really Reveals

Revenue pattern across states shaped by differences in economic structure

Shift in India’s Tax Culture

(Lalitagauri Kulkarni is Faculty Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics. Bhushana Karandikar is an Independent Researcher)

The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax GST ) in 2017 was one of India’s most significant tax reforms, aimed at simplifying indirect taxation and creating a common national market. Seven years on, the overall picture is encouraging. The constant effort to rationalise the classification of goods services and the latest reforms, show sincere effort to create a harmonised tax system for a national market. GST revenues have risen steadily, reflecting economic expansion, improved digitization, and the growing maturity of the tax system. Proposed in 2000 by the Dasgupta Committee on indirect tax reforms, GST rested on three objectives: creating a unified indirect tax framework, building a common national market, and improving tax buoyancy so that revenues would rise in step with economic expansion. Has it achieved its objectives? A look into the state-wise data on GST revenue from 2017 to 2024 provides some insights on the cusp of Union Budget 2026.The constant effort to rationalise the classification of goods and services, and the latest reforms, show sincere effort to create a harmonised tax system for a national market. Evidence from nano to large-size enterprises suggests that compliance and digital payments are easier than under the earlier multi-layered indirect tax regime.According to official data, gross GST collections reached a record ₹22.08 lakh crore in 2024–25, a 9.4 per cent increase over the previous year, with average monthly collections of ₹1.84 lakh crore. Headline numbers are encouraging.A central objective of the GST is also to harmonise India’s fragmented tax system so that tax buoyancy improves across the states meaning GST tax revenues would grow in line with, ideally faster than, the State incomes.In India, GST is split between different levels of government. For sales that take place within a state, the tax is shared between the Centre (CGST) and the state government (SGST), replacing earlier state levies such as VAT and entertainment tax. For sales that occur across state borders, as well as imports, the Centre collects Integrated GST (IGST).GST collections have strengthened across the country, although at different paces. Average GST-to-GSDP ratios across states range from about 3 per cent to 13 per cent, a variation that has remained broadly stable over time. Importantly, absolute GST collections have increased in almost all states, including through periods of economic disruption, underscoring the resilience of the GST framework.Economic structure plays an important role in shaping these outcomes. States with higher levels of urbanisation and a larger services base, such as Haryana and Maharashtra, have recorded particularly strong increases in GST collections relative to output. In Haryana, the GST-to-GSDP ratio has risen from around 7.6 to 17.6 per cent, while in Maharashtra it has increased from 5.6 to 13.8 per cent. These gains highlight the effectiveness of GST in capturing value addition in service-oriented, digitally connected economies.Other states have also shown meaningful progress. Odisha, for instance, has seen its GST-to-GSDP ratio rise from about 4.1 to 10.9 per cent over the same period, reflecting improved formalisation and better integration into the GST system.GST has changed how taxes are paid and administered in India. GST, has shifted the system toward more transparent, simpler to understand, and harder to evade. In short, GST represents a cultural shift in taxation, not just a change in tax rates. The earlier system relied heavily on physical paperwork, multiple overlapping taxes, and discretionary enforcement, which created scope for complexity, inefficiency, and rent-seeking. Timely filing of GST returns has improved significantly across states, reflecting stronger procedural compliance and familiarity with the digital system.Going forward, further improvements in GST revenues are likely to come from deepening compliance by supporting registered businesses, strengthening verification, and leveraging digital data more effectively to expand registrations.With the GST compensation mechanism having concluded in 2022, the steady growth in state-level GST collections is a positive sign for fiscal stability. As GST enters a more mature phase, its contribution to public finances will increasingly depend on how well tax administration aligns with underlying economic structures across states.GST cannot be judged in simple binary terms as either a success or a failure, it is an evolving institutional reform. It has improved transparency and stabilised indirect taxation, while it operates within an uneven economic landscape. The next phase of GST is less about changing rates and more about aligning the system with underlying economic structure and state capacity, as state revenue outcomes depend less on tax design and compliance and more on economic fundamentals and administration.","The introduction of the goods and services tax in 2017 was one of india’s most significant tax reforms.

By Yellapu Santosh

Budget 2026: Defence stocks in focus

Solar Industries

India Ltd

Solar Industries has emerged as one of the most visible private defence manufacturers, with products like loitering munitions (e.g., Nagastra) and advanced explosive systems gaining traction. Its subsidiary has signed MoD contracts (e.g., for Nagastra loitering munitions) under emergency procurement routes, demonstrating responsiveness to urgent capital allocations.

The company’s defense order book exceeds Rs175bn, with repeat orders for UAVs, grenades, and specialized ammunition.

Additionally, Solar Industries has secured international defense export contracts (~Rs14bn), highlighting both domestic and global demand for its products.

Implication: A higher capital budget and expansion of ammunition, loitering munitions, and counter-drone procurement strengthens Solar’s growth runway. A renewed focus on scale orders for guided rockets, precision munitions, and loitering systems directly feeds into Solar’s manufacturing portfolio.

Bharat Electronics Limited (

BEL

)

BEL benefits from sustained systems and electronics integration spending, with a strong order pipeline in radar, tactical communications, counter-drone systems, and C4ISR. A recent DAC package saw key approvals for BEL’s radars and communication systems.

The company is also expanding capability via new system integration facilities to capture complex defence electronics work, a strategic fit amid rising network-centric warfare spend.

Implication: BEL is positioned as a principal beneficiary of growth in C4ISR/ EW budgets, secure communications, and other electronics/system-integration heavy programs.

Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (

HAL

)

HAL remains central to aviation and aerospace modernisation, driven by fighter sustainment, upgrade packages, and helicopter inductions. While platform projects have long lead times, DAC approvals feed multi-year pipelines.

A higher capital pool can not only accelerate LCA and fighter support packages but also reinforce allocations for engine upgrades and sustainment for legacy fleets.

Mazagaon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL)

The Navy’s focus remains on submarines (e.g., Project-75(I)) and other surface platforms where long-lead commitments dominate. Project-75(I) aimed at procuring diesel-electric submarines, underscores MDL’s central role in the warship/submarine build pipeline.

Earlier DAC meetings (and defence stock market reactions) have reflected investor optimism around MDL as procurement approvals ripple through sector valuations.

Implication: A higher capital outlay supports staged awards for submarine and amphibious vessel projects, while steady allocations flow through extended execution horizons.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Budget 2026: We expect an inflection in India’s upcoming defence budget cycle, with core message being, capital outlay likely to grow faster than the overall defence budget, and the incremental funding would be channeled toward domestic procurement and modernisation-heavy programmes.The Defence Secretary in a FICCI forum recently highlighted that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is asking for a ~20% increase in capital acquisition budget for FY27e, described as the steepest single-year jump, explicitly prioritising domestic procurement.MoD has walked its talk by ensuring that majority of the domestic procurement is driven by DPSU’s + private players (YTD procurement from domestic players account for more than 65-70% threshold levels) rather than depending on imports.In parallel, the budget mechanics increasingly matter as much as the topline. Parliamentary scrutiny has highlighted that “Committed Liabilities” (payments due in a year for contracts signed earlier) take first charge on capital allocation, while “New Schemes” are fresh projects likely to be approved and contracted during the year, yet both are funded from the same Capital Acquisition (Modernisation) head.This is important because when committed liabilities are high, they “crowd out” new contracting even in a growing budget. Conversely, if MoD meaningfully raises the capital pool, then the system can service committed liabilities and accelerate new orders. If one looks at the funnel of projects that got cleared by the Defense Acquisition Council (DAC) in last 2-4 years, it reinforces our view that capital outlay will be on an increasing trend (and is often a key swing factor at the RE stage) and remains the principal lever for modernisation outcome.Who would get most of the highest allocation? Like previous years, expect the Indian Air Force (IAF) to get the highest allocation, followed by Indian Navy (IN).What does this mean for awarding in the next 12-24 months cycle? If the “capital-heavy + domestic-first” posture holds, then the awarding pipeline should be broad-based across the platforms, munitions, network-centric capabilities. Expect the biggest contracting momentum in (1) aircraft and helicopter fleets, (2) missiles/ rockets/ ammunition, (3) C4ISR / EW / space-enabled ISR, and (4) drones and counter-drone systems, segments where India has both urgency and growing domestic industrial base.On the aviation side, likely contracting themes include, sustainment-linked packages around fighter induction and upgrades, including LCA-related procurement (fighters, spares, support), aircraft/engine upgrade work, and rotary-wing inductions for Indian Army/ IAF/ IN (where indigenous content is rising). Given the urgency, won’t be surprised if awarding of the 114 Rafale order also forms part of the ‘New Schemes’ in FY27.On the missile and munitions side, the budget thrust should continue to favor scale orders for guided rockets, long-range rockets, air defence missiles, precision munitions, loitering munitions, and artillery ammunition, because these deliver immediate combat power, have relatively faster contracting cycles than major platforms, and fit the indigenisation narrative.From the IN point of view, while large shipbuilding programmes are multi-year and heavily “committed-liability” dominated, capital uplift can still translate into steady awards for P-75 (I) Submarine order, further platform upgrades, sensors, weapons fits, select new-build approvals.A particularly important “budget-to-orders” bridge in this cycle would be ISR and network-centric warfare. With contested borders, maritime chokepoints, and the need for rapid kill-chains, India is likely to keep prioritising C4ISR projects, covering satcom, surveillance satellites, ISTAR/ AEW&C enabling systems, tactical communications, electronic warfare, and secure data links, because these are force multipliers and align with domestic electronics and systems champions.The committed-liabilities framework supports this outlook as the big-ticket platform contracts (aircraft, ships) create multi-year payment obligations, MoD will typically seek a portfolio of “new schemes” that are modular, scalable, and can be ramped based on annual headroom, precisely how many ISR, EW, and drone programmes are structured. In short, implied signal of a higher capital allocation (and explicit emphasis on domestic procurement) makes it more plausible that multiple mid-to-large awards can be run in parallel, rather than serially queued behind legacy commitments.On the whole, the upcoming Indian defence budget outlook, would see “capital step-up” with at least a 15% increase. Where the structural reality of committed liabilities, would support of a multi-year award cycle, where the largest, fastest beneficiaries may likely be seen in missiles/ munitions, defence electronics (C4ISR/ EW), drones/ C-UAS, and select aviation/ helicopter procurement and upgrade packages, with shipbuilding likely to remain steady, constrained by long-duration payment schedules.","Budget 2026: we expect an inflection in india’s upcoming defence budget cycle.

The National Mission on Manufacturing (NMM) has set ambitious targets to double the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP to 25 per cent by 2035 from 12.9 per cent, while generating 143 million jobs, according to the Economic Survey.The mission was announced in the Union Budget 2025-26.It represents the foundational policy blueprint for accelerating India's industrial growth and global competitiveness over the next decade.The mission ""sets ambitious targets for 2035, aiming to double the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP from 12.9 per cent (2023) to 25 per cent and generate 143 million jobs, along with boosting merchandise exports to USD 1.2 trillion by deepening integration into GVCs (global value chains)"".The NMM has a strategic two-pronged approach, dedicating major focus to sector-specific interventions across 20-30 prioritised industrial clusters.This would, it said, entail identifying industrial clusters based on parameters, such as demand potential, employment generation capacity, and the presence of natural endowments, and classifying sectors into three archetypes.It includes scale (automotive and pharmaceuticals) for rapid expansion; fix and transform (Electronics and Capital Goods) for structural reform; and seed (semiconductors and electric vehicles) for strategic, innovation-led growth.The other core activities are expected to address vital, cross-cutting challenges essential for competitiveness, including enhancing the Ease of Doing Business, strengthening plug-and-play infrastructure, and improving workforce productivity through targeted skilling, empowering MSMEs, prioritising technology and provisions for industrial housing.""The NMM is thus expected to act as the central facilitator to align efforts across the Centre, states, and clusters, ensuring unified direction and convergence,"" it added.Commenting on the country's manufacturing sector, Rumki Majumdar, Economist, Deloitte India, said the country is moving from low-value shipments to electronics, engineering goods, complex pharma and auto components, which reflects that manufacturing is climbing the value chain.""The survey is clear - India's next leap is from import substitution to strategic resilience and ultimately strategic indispensability.

Growth, Inflation, Jobs Improve, But Risks Loom: What CEA’s Economic Survey Briefing Really Reveals

New Delhi: Economic Survey’s recommendation to amend the Companies Act to lower govt shareholding floor to 26% in state-owned companies, can help govt mop up higher non-tax capital receipts (revenues from disinvestments), the Centre’s top economist said Friday.“In all these years, govt was very clear that the markets are performing very well and it wanted to let the market capitalisation rise. The public sector’s stocks were doing even better than the general market indices and govt was also collecting dividends from good operating performance of the public sector entities. So, there was no immediate impulse from a revenue perspective (to disinvest),” chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran told TOI, elaborating on his suggestion to reduce govt stake in PSUs.“We are advocating this in future for the sake of augmenting non-tax capital receipts and also to look at the way we can impart some managerial efficiency in these sectors. So, it’s a solution we have put forward,” Nageswaran said.The suggestion came amid a poor privatisation record of the NDA govt, despite its policy to exit non-core areas and if accepted it can help the Centre dilute its stake in several listed entities where it currently holds just above 51%.There are at least half-a-dozen PSUs, where govt shareholding is just above the 51% threshold, with Centre’s hands tied in case of BPCL and Concor too (see graphic).There are suggestions from NITI Aayog as well as industry bodies such as CII for govt to step up disinvestment, especially privatisation, and use the resources for infrastructure development through further capital expenditure.Asked about private sector capex, which has been sluggish, CEA said visibility of demand and certainty of demand are important considerations for the private sector to invest and having a gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) to GDP ratio of 30-31% in the current scenario isn’t low. “How can pace (of private capex) be the same as it was between 2003 to 2008, when the world’s a different place right now? Data indicates that the private sector did invest reasonably well in 2024-25. ”Nageswaran also clarified that algorithms used by platform aggregators in the gig economy ecosystem have to take “human elements” into consideration. “We need to make sure that the way workers are assigned duties will have to take into consideration the human element, and it cannot be formulaic,” he said, while answering a query on the meaning of the algorithmic transparency that he has advocated in the Survey to promote worker-friendly practices in a bid to boost gig economy.","Economic survey’s recommendation to amend the companies act to lower govt shareholding floor to 26% in state-owned companies can help govt mop up higher non-tax capital receipts (revenues from disinvestments), top economist says.

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

GST Reforms: Supporting Working Capital, Export Facilitation, Procedural Clarity

Customs Reforms: Rate Rationalization, Amnesty scheme and Procedural Reforms

Conclusion

(Harpreet Singh is Partner, Deloitte India. With contribution from Gagan Gugnani, Director, Deloitte India)

As Union Budget 2026 approaches, economic policymaking has been unfolding against a challenging global backdrop. Slowing trade growth, supply chain realignments, inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainty continue to influence investment and production decisions worldwide. In this environment, India’s fiscal and tax policy choices will play a crucial role in sustaining growth momentum and enhancing resilience of the domestic economy.Indirect tax measures are central to this effort. Beyond revenue considerations, they directly affect cost structures, operational efficiency, and the ability of businesses to operate seamlessly across domestic and international markets. Expectations from the forthcoming Budget therefore center on simplification, certainty, and targeted relief measures that actively support economic activity.The 56th GST Council meeting marked an important milestone on the simplified two-rate structure, signaling the government’s intent to make the GST regime more stable and transparent. Building on this, Budget 2026 is expected to advance structural reforms to strengthen liquidity, reduce compliance bottlenecks, and improve the overall business environment.Working capital pressures have intensified, particularly for sectors impacted by rate rationalization. There is a strong expectation that the inverted duty structure (IDS) refund mechanism will be extended to input services and capital goods. Further, permitting provisional sanction of up to 90% of eligible IDS refund would significantly alleviate liquidity constraints. This is crucial as several goods have migrated to the 5% GST slab, resulting in accumulation of input tax credit where procurements attract higher tax rates.Cross-border service providers have also faced uncertainty on intermediary services, with divergent interpretations of the place of supply provisions triggering litigation, estimated at over INR 3,357 crore as per the 55th GST Council meeting. A legislative amendment aligning the intermediary framework with the general place of supply rules would help curtail disputes and offer much needed clarity to service exporters.Process rationalization is another cornerstone of GST reforms. Post-supply discounts continue to pose interpretational challenges. Aligning GST provisions to recognize commercial discount arrangements, irrespective of whether they are agreed before or after the time of supply and dispensing with the requirement of invoice-wise correlation for post-supply discounts have been a long-standing demand of India Inc. Legislative amendments to address these concerns is awaited.Customs policy continues to play a defining role in India’s trade and manufacturing ecosystem. In the prevailing global environment, characterized by muted demand and rising cost pressures, calibrated reductions in input tariffs can provide immediate cost relief and support manufacturing competitiveness, particularly for export-oriented industries.Although incremental rationalization has been initiated, the Customs tariff structure remains intricate, with multiple duty rates and frequent amendments contributing to classification disputes and elevated compliance costs. Further simplification of duty slabs would enhance certainty and reduce administrative complexity.Resolution of legacy Customs disputes is another critical area of focus. Introduction of a structured amnesty or dispute resolution scheme could help unlock blocked capital, reduce litigation, and enable businesses to redirect resources towards expansion and investment. Complementary procedural enhancements such as expeditious Special Valuation Branch clearances, deeper digitization, and time-bound adjudication would further strengthen trade facilitation and lower transaction costs.Budget 2026 offers an opportunity to strengthen India’s trade and tax framework through targeted, practical reforms. Streamlined Customs duties, resolution of legacy disputes, expanded IDS refunds, and procedural clarity in GST can collectively reduce costs, ease working capital pressures, and improve predictability. These measures would enhance domestic competitiveness, support exports, and signal India’s intent to be a reliable and business-friendly destination in a challenging global environment.","Budget 2026 offers an opportunity to strengthen india’s trade and tax framework through targeted, practical reforms.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

The Big Picture

As India approaches the Union Budget 2026, expectations are converging on a common theme: clarity, predictability and reform-driven stability.In recent times, there has been a reduction of exposure to Indian equities by institutional investors, which is considered as a critical source of liquidity for India’s capital markets. The reasons can be attributed to rising global geopolitical tensions and stretched valuations in domestic markets. Returns for overseas investors have been eroded due to strong U.S. dollar and volatile rupee. On the other hand, higher U.S. bond yields have made American assets more attractive. Indian equity markets, after a prolonged rally, are now trading at significant premiums compared to other emerging markets. As a result, this has triggered profit-taking by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs), amid the increasing availability of global investment opportunities. Market analysts have observed that valuations in sectors such as IT and financial services have outpaced earnings growth, adding to caution.From a corporate standpoint, businesses are looking for greater tax clarity, simplified compliance and operational ease along with measures that support liquidity. As economic growth remains closely linked to the efficiency of the capital markets, the forthcoming Budget is expected to address key structural challenges, while maintaining fiscal discipline.Tax policy remains one of the determinant factors for investment decisions by the institutional investors. Investors are expecting a definitive assurance against retrospective amendments which is a practice that has previously dented their confidence. They would also like to see a rollback of long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on listed equities from 12.5 percent to 10 percent as well as rationalisation or abolition of the Securities Transaction Tax, which inflates transaction costs especially for high-frequency participants. Investors are also hoping for simplification of the capital gains regime by way of harmonising holding periods and tax treatment across asset classes. Wider tax exemptions, currently available to sovereign wealth funds should be extended to pension and endowment funds, particularly for infrastructure investments.Recent changes that eliminated indexation benefits for debt mutual funds have increased concerns among FPIs, thereby prompting a stable tax regime on interest income from bonds. With India’s inclusion in global bond indices, measures such as clarity on withholding tax rates, ease in fund registration processes and automated trading workflows are crucial to attract sustained inflows.The banking sector has a focused wish list from Budget 2026. A key demand is a reasonable increase in the tax deduction available for provisions made for Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from the current 8.5 percent to 15 percent, which would provide tax relief to offset the potential credit losses. In addition, the banks demand introduction of tax incentives for depositors such as higher deduction limits on interest earned from bank deposits and reduction in tax deduction. As a result, this could help banks attract stable, low-cost funding, which is vital to address the widening credit-deposit ratio and ensuring funding stability, especially in a tight liquidity environment.NBFCs continue pushing for parity with banks on several dimensions. Key demands include exemption from TDS on interest income and increase in the deduction threshold for provisions made for NPAs to at least 8.5 percent, aligning with banks. A specific deduction for individuals on interest paid for education loans is also expected to provide a meaningful boost to the education financing ecosystem.For the IFSC, clarity and simplicity in taxation top the list of critical priorities. Industry stakeholders recommend a one-layer taxation system for retail schemes in case of resident investors and family investment funds, along with a blanket exemption from deemed dividend provisions for entities dealing with corporate treasury centres.On the mutual fund segment, key recommendations include revision in the definition of equity-oriented funds to include FOFs investing predominantly in equity funds and inclusion of the term ‘specified mutual fund’ in consolidation provisions. This would aim at eliminating structural mismatches and ensuring tax neutrality.Beyond taxation, measures such as restoration of the due date for filing revised returns to March 31 and enabling tax payments / refunds through overseas bank accounts, would significantly ease operational difficulty. Rationalisation of TDS and TCS provisions is another key demand. Industry also demands enabling foreign tax credit at the TDS stage, introducing uniform TDS rates to eliminate classification disputes and reinstating the six-year rectification window for TDS returns. A reduction in the TCS rate on Liberalised Remittance Scheme transactions is also expected to provide relief from working capital constraints.FPIs also seek streamlined compliance norms which include simplified KYC processes, digitised registration and reduced cumbersome information requirements.India needs a stable and transparent framework to drive long-term growth. A forward-looking tax regime streamlined compliance processes and rational policies can boost market confidence and attract long-term investments. These measures will strengthen India’s financial resilience and pose as an appealing destination for growth and opportunity.","As india approaches the union budget 2026, expectations are converging on a common theme: clarity, predictability and reform-driven stability.

From stability to strategic indispensability: What the Economic Survey sets up for Budget Sunday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/from-stability-to-strategic-indispensability-what-the-economic-survey-sets-up-for-budget-sunday/articleshow/127798473.cms,"Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

The Economic Survey 2025-26 arrives with an unusual degree of calm. Inflation, it says, is likely to remain muted in the medium term. Growth prospects remain healthy, though revised. Banks are stable, balance sheets are stronger, and domestic demand continues to hold up even as the global economy grows more uncertain.That calm matters. It changes the nature of the conversation as India heads into the Union Budget that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present on Sunday, February 1. This is no longer a Budget framed by crisis management; rather one framed by choice.The Survey revises India’s potential growth rate upwards to 7 percent, reflecting years of sustained public investment, infrastructure expansion, logistics reform and financial sector clean up. High frequency indicators show firming investment momentum and resilient consumption. Core inflation remains subdued, signalling that supply side improvements are finally anchoring prices rather than monetary tightening alone.Yet the document is careful not to confuse macro stability with strategic security. The global environment has shifted. Trade is no longer governed primarily by efficiency or multilateral rules.It is shaped by geopolitics, security considerations and fragmented supply chains. Capital flows are volatile. Currency markets are unforgiving. Even economies with strong fundamentals are discovering that stability no longer guarantees insulation.India is not immune to this shift. Despite solid growth and contained inflation, the rupee has underperformed. The underlying reason is structural. India continues to run a goods trade deficit and depends on foreign capital inflows to finance it. Services exports and remittances provide a cushion, but they do not fully offset the imbalance. In a world of heightened geopolitical risk, this dependence becomes a strategic vulnerability.This is where the Economic Survey pushes the debate beyond self reliance. Building domestic capability is necessary, but it is no longer sufficient. The larger ambition, it argues, must be to make India strategically indispensable to the global economy.Manufacturing sits at the centre of this argument. Services have powered India’s rise for two decades, delivering growth, jobs and foreign exchange. But manufacturing does something more fundamental. It forces institutional discipline. It exposes weaknesses in logistics, energy pricing, regulation and skills. It ties export competitiveness to currency stability and state capacity in ways services often do not.Countries with durable strategic influence and stable currencies, the Survey notes, have almost always built that strength on manufacturing depth. India’s own export data underlines the challenge. Services exports have grown faster than merchandise exports in recent years. While creditable, this divergence also explains why external vulnerability persists.Recent trade agreements, including the concluded free trade agreement with the European Union, signal intent. They expand market access for labour intensive exports and integrate India more closely with advanced manufacturing ecosystems. But agreements alone do not confer competitiveness. They merely test it. Producing at scale, at predictable cost and with reliable delivery remains the harder task.That task places a premium on state capacity. The Survey’s idea of an entrepreneurial state is not about replacing markets or commercialising governance. It is about credibility, execution and regulatory discipline. Mission mode platforms in semiconductors, green hydrogen and digital public infrastructure offer early signals of what this approach can achieve.The private sector, too, is called upon to rethink its role. Seeking negotiated protection may offer short term comfort, but it raises input costs and weakens downstream competitiveness. In a contested global system, corporate competitiveness becomes part of national strategy whether firms acknowledge it or not.As Budget Sunday approaches, the Survey frames a clear choice for policymakers. Stability has been earned. Inflation is anchored. Fiscal consolidation has credibility. The temptation is to prioritise visible short term relief. The harder, more consequential path is to invest further in capacity, manufacturing competitiveness, cost of capital reduction, energy pricing reform, logistics efficiency and skills.The Budget, then, is not just a fiscal exercise. It is a signal of intent. The Economic Survey makes clear that India is running a marathon in a world that increasingly demands sprinting. The coming Budget will show whether the country is prepared to do both, deliberately and with an eye firmly on the decade ahead.","The economic survey 2025-26 arrives with an unusual degree of calm.

1955: When Hindi entered the Budget

From print to paperless

As finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Union Budget for FY 2026-27 on February 1, the exercise also draws attention to how India’s most important economic document has evolved – from a colonial-era English text to a more accessible public instrument.India’s first Union Budget was presented on April 7, 1860, by James Wilson, the finance member of the Indian Council and founder of The Economist. Drafted entirely in English, the Budget reflected the priorities of the British administration and was aimed at a limited, English-speaking audience.After Independence, the budgetary process began to take a more indigenous shape.The first Union Budget of independent India was tabled on November 26, 1947, by finance minister RK Shanmukham Chetty, marking a shift from colonial fiscal practices to national economic planning.A major milestone came in 1955 under then finance minister CD Deshmukh, when the Union Budget was printed in both English and Hindi for the first time, according to ICAI. The move reflected a growing recognition that key policy documents needed to reach a broader cross-section of citizens and not remain confined to a narrow administrative elite.During his tenure, Deshmukh played a key role in strengthening India’s financial institutions.He helped establish the Reserve Bank of India as a strong monetary authority and was closely associated with the formulation of India’s first Five-Year Plans, which laid the foundation for industrial growth and infrastructure development.The Budget’s evolution has continued in recent years. Nirmala Sitharaman, who has presented the Budget since 2019, introduced India’s first paperless Budget in 2021, delivering it on a digital tablet carried in a traditional bahi-khata style pouch.She is set to present her ninth consecutive Budget on February 1, the second most number by any finance minister, just behind former PM Morarji Desai.From its colonial beginnings to linguistic inclusion and digital presentation, the Union Budget’s journey mirrors broader changes in governance and public communication in India.","India’s first union budget was presented on april 7, 1860, by james wilson, the finance member of the indian council.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

BENGALURU: Indian cities will not become more liveable by fixing footpaths alone. That, in essence, is the argument running through the Economic Survey’s chapters on urbanisation and governance. While better pavements are necessary, the Survey makes clear that liveability emerges from how cities function as systems, not from standalone infrastructure projects.Liveability, it argues, emerges when cities are designed around people’s time, choices, and creativity, not just around infrastructure delivery. “Globally, the most liveable cities are not necessarily the richest or newest; they are the ones that organise urban life to reduce friction, enable expression, and reward everyday participation,” it notes.For example, it argued, US’ Detroit made massive investments in highways, factories, stadia, but ultimately did not keep up with the scale of investments in terms of economic output and yet the population collapsed. On the other hand, Boston is infrastructure-light, with old housing styles, narrow lanes, and limited road and flyover construction, but it is swarming with educational institutions and a high concentration of universities.“This has ultimately led to a shift towards modern and emerging sectors like education, finance, and biotech. In India, Bengaluru, arguably with insufficient physical infrastructure compared to Delhi or Mumbai, is almost the Silicon Valley of India, reaping the dividends of the agglomeration benefits of an entrepreneurial ecosystem,” the Survey reads.Bengaluru, it points out, grew primarily due to the concentration of engineering talent and institutions, and to wage growth and the creation of a modern city.The Survey argues that urban design must prioritise ease, safety, and predictability in everyday movement, rather than assuming speed and private vehicles as the default.“Streets as social infrastructure, not just traffic corridors: Street design can be guided by Guillermo Penalosa’s “8-80” philosophy that good streets must work equally well for an eight-year-old and an eighty-year-old in order to prioritise safety, comfort and accessibility,” the Survey reads.Pointing out that footpaths are undermined without reliable public transport, predictable enforcement, and civic norms, it cites global examples like Barcelona's superblocks show reclaiming streets for pedestrians boosts play and culture, but India's fragmented governance dilutes such efforts.One of the Survey’s central observations is that Indian cities suffer from a governance and coordination deficit. Urban residents lose time not just because of broken footpaths, but because work, housing, schools, healthcare, and public services are poorly aligned in space and time. Long commutes, fragmented public transport, and mismatches between jobs and housing impose daily friction on households. Footpaths may improve the last few hundred metres of a journey, but they cannot compensate for cities that are spatially and economically misaligned.Mobility, the Survey notes, must be understood as a city-wide problem rather than a street-level one. Indian cities rely heavily on informal and intermediate transport modes because formal systems do not adequately cover where people live and work.Without reliable, affordable public transport that integrates walking, cycling, and mass transit, pedestrian infrastructure alone remains underused or unsafe. The Survey stresses that liveable cities reduce the need for travel in the first place by bringing opportunities closer to people.Another recurring theme is the informal nature of urban India. A large share of economic activity, housing, and service delivery operates outside formal planning frameworks. Vendors spill onto pavements, utilities are laid without coordination, and streets become sites of competing claims. In this context, footpaths are quickly encroached upon or repurposed.The Survey suggests liveability requires managing informality through design and regulation, rather than treating footpaths as isolated engineering assets. It also links liveability to the quality of basic urban services: Water supply, sanitation, waste management, and drainage shape daily life far more directly than cosmetic improvements.","Indian cities will not become more liveable by fixing footpaths alone, says economic survey.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

NEW DELHI: High railway freight rates arising from cross-subsidisation are distorting competition with road transport, pushing up commodity prices, consumer inflation, and overall logistics costs, the Economic Survey 2025–26 highlighted.Reiterating the proposal in the Electricity Amendment Bill, 2026, the Survey recommended the complete elimination of cross-subsidies for railways and the manufacturing sector within the next five years. It noted that rationalising freight rates could improve revenue buoyancy and encourage a shift of freight movement from roads to rail.At present, lower electricity tariffs for domestic and agricultural consumers are subsidised through higher charges on industrial and commercial users, including railways. Despite the Electricity Act, 2003 mandating state electricity regulatory commissions to progressively reduce such cross-subsidies, the survey pointed out that the average billing rate for manufacturing enterprises and railways continues to exceed the average cost of power supply.The Survey said the Electricity Amendment Bill, expected to be tabled in Parliament during the Budget session, aims to introduce much-needed reforms by promoting cost-reflective tariffs and rationalising cross-subsidies.“Going forward, a balanced approach could include phased tariff increases and quotas for subsidised categories, along with voluntary and category-based exclusions,” it said.The Survey also highlighted several govt measures to strengthen the financial health of power distribution companies, leading to a cumulative profit after tax of Rs 2,701 crore—the first since their corporatisation. This came alongside a reduction in overall losses, from Rs 6.9 lakh crore in 2023–24 to Rs 6.5 lakh crore in FY25.Key reforms included stricter payment discipline through revised late payment surcharge rules, formula-based monthly tariff adjustments to avoid cash-flow gaps, pass-through of prudent power procurement and network costs, timely release of state subsidies, and a reduction in aggregate technical and commercial losses. Power quality and reliability also improved following fund releases under the revamped distribution sector scheme.The Survey further said state regulatory commissions should allow a reasonable return on equity to boost investor confidence, ensure cost-reflective tariffs aligned with approved revenue requirements, and facilitate liquidation of accumulated revenue gaps.","High railway freight rates are distorting competition with road transport, the economic survey 2025–26 highlighted.

Budget 2026 expectations: What the highways sector should focus on,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-what-the-highways-sector-should-focus-on/articleshow/127807329.cms,"India’s infrastructure planning has always been capital heavy.

By Manish Sharma and Devayan Dey

Some of the key expectations from the upcoming budget are:

1. Quality: Invest in people and mechanisation, not just in building pavements

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

2. OpEx: Move beyond the ‘build, neglect and rebuild’ model

Ring-fencing maintenance allocations for critical corridors

Expanding performance-based O&M contracts.

Creating incentives for states and concessionaires to invest in long-term maintenance rather than short-term fixes.

3. The

Bharatmala Pariyojana

4. Rethinking L1: Reform procurement to reward sustainability and innovation

At least for large projects, organisations need to go beyond simple pass/fail criteria-based qualification and focus more of conducting adequate due diligence checks for bidders.

Create mechanisms to disincentivize aggressive bidding, which could lead to false starts and delay the service delivery to citizens.

5. Financial products and credit enhancements: Unlock capital beyond traditional banks

Expanding guarantee and insurance instruments to de-risk projects

Facilitating cost-effective currency hedging products

Encouraging innovative credit enhancement mechanisms that goes beyond promoter guarantees.

Over the last decade, India’s highways sector has transformed at an unprecedented pace. Budget allocation in roads crossed ₹2.8 lakh crore in FY25 and is likely to remain elevated for FY26 as well.Quality and timely delivery is the most visible test of efficiency. Technical specifications, stricter codes, and contractual penalties are necessary but not sufficient. Today, the real challenge lies in availability of talent, skilled workmanship and the ability of the industry to scale up mechanisation. Talent and skill development in the construction industry is likely to be one of the critical areas of concern by 2030.The budget, therefore, should support industry-wide capability building with training programmes linked to highway projects, fiscal incentives for mechanisation and modern construction technologies (equipment pooling and leasing organisation), and structured skilling initiatives for operation and maintenance (O&M). Without this, stricter specifications will only translate into claims and disputes.India’s infrastructure planning has always been capital heavy. Operating expenditure (OpEx) takes up only a small fraction of the total outlay. While NHAI’s performance rating system take right steps towards incentivising concessionaires to prioritise maintenance, similar metrics need to be implemented in NHAI-managed network.A more efficient investment system would focus on higher lifecycle spending, with a clear target: increase the share of OpEx to about 20–25% of total highway outlay by 2030 to minimise rebuilding and preserve existing infrastructure.The budget can accelerate this shift by:Every rupee spent on timely maintenance can not only save millions in reconstruction and logistics cost but could also create an entirely new industry with employment opportunities.The Bharatmala Pariyojana is a well-conceived transformational, corridor-based programme. By focusing on the completion of the projects by creating a dedicated task-force and prioritising projects that are more than 80% complete for targeted funding and fast-tracking processes such as land acquisition and clearances, the programme can unlock great value.Today, we celebrate kilometres awarded or constructed. It may also be beneficial to add another priority to completion-centric metric, for instance, projects commissioned, corridors fully operational, and economic benefits realised.L1 bidding has long defined the highways sector. While competition is encouraged, having excessive competition could be counterproductive.This makes bids primarily a contest of supply-chain leverage and speculative risk-taking rather than design ingenuity or productivity improvements. It also raises the ‘transaction cost of trust’ which entails extensive documentation, micro-level specifications, and adversarial contracting which impacts both public and private stakeholders.There is a need to move away from being ‘price conscious ‘to becoming ‘value conscious’. This entails shifting from input to output/performance specifications wherever possible, encourage innovation and bring accountability through thorough monitoring.Reforming procurement need not be about making projects expensive. It is about paying for durability, reliability and innovation rather than unsustainable low bids that often lead to delays, disputes and renegotiations.Infrastructure financing in India still leans heavily on domestic banks and conventional project finance structures. These institutions, constrained by sectoral caps and risk aversion, are understandably cautious, especially on models with demand risk such as build-operate-transfer (BOT) and other traffic-linked concessions. At the same time, international project finance and long-term capital remain under-tapped, partly due to currency risk, limited credit enhancement mechanisms, and insufficient depth in domestic bond and guarantee markets.Though the establishment of the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) is a major step, it cannot meet the financing needs of a rapidly expanding infrastructure pipeline alone. Therefore, the budget should focus on enabling a broader ecosystem of financial products, without the government itself becoming a direct lender of first resort. This includes incentivising the market for:Such instruments can draw in both domestic and international capital at scale by enabling risk mitigation.If the budget can pivot the sector in these directions, our investments over the next decade will be far more productive and sustainable.",India’s infrastructure planning has always been capital heavy.

How will a person who has an income Rs 12 lakh benefit from new rates?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said.

With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden.Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.",Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: faqs answered. Finance minister nirmala sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime.
