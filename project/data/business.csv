Why reform is required

For a country that prides itself on a thriving middle class, India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. Over the past few years, a series of amendments—presented as “rationalisations”—have quietly created a minefield for salaried employees who believed they were doing the right thing by saving for their future.Three provisions stand out for the burden they impose: taxation of employer contributions to provident and superannuation funds beyond ₹7.5 lakh; yearly taxation of accretions on such excess contributions; and taxation of interest earned on the employee’s own PF contributions above ₹2.5 lakh. In isolation each may appear technical. Together, they are reshaping retirement planning in ways that leave employees with little clarity, greater financial anxiety, and a rising tax bill on income they do not even receive today.The first shock for employees came with the Finance Act, 2020, which capped employer contributions to recognised PF, approved superannuation funds and NPS at ₹7.5 lakh per year. Anything above that—common for senior professionals, mid-level employees in high-cost cities, and those in organisations with generous retirement policies—became taxable as a perquisite.But what stings more is that annual accretion—interest, dividend or similar growth—on this “excess contribution” is also taxed. This is a tax on notional income, long before the employee sees a rupee of it.Many describe this as an upfront penalty on saving. Unlike bonuses or cash payments, retirement contributions are locked in for the long term. Yet tax is now collected today on money that may only be received decades later. That mismatch betweenandhas become a major pain point.When exemption isn’t really exemptionThe hardship intensifies when the National Pension System comes into play. While the government justified taxing excess employer contributions by calling PF, superannuation and NPS an “EEE regime”, the law doesn’t fully support that claim.Under Section 10(12A), up to 60% of the NPS corpus can be withdrawn tax-free upon closure of the account or opting out of NPS. The remaining 40% must be used to purchase an annuity plan from a life insurance company, and the pension received from this annuity is fully taxable. Employees therefore argue that the premise of an entirely exempt regime is not accurate.The Finance Act, 2021 introduced another hit: PF interest earned on the employee’s own contribution beyond ₹2.5 lakh per year is taxable.For many mid-career employees, PF is the only disciplined savings instrument they rely on. A high PF contribution isn’t a luxury; it is a way to secure the future in the absence of universal social security.Yet the law now characterises high contributions—even when mandatory or part of salary structure—as an attempt to “enjoy full exemption”. The sting is sharper for those whose basic salary is high enough that the statutory 12% PF contribution itself may cross the ₹2.5 lakh threshold, triggering tax on interest even when the employee never intended to “over-contribute”. This change is seen as especially harsh in a country where inflation erodes purchasing power and pension adequacy is already a concern.“Also, these changes all appear to be part of the ultimate aim of the government to do away with all deductions and exemptions and make the ‘new tax regime’ the only regime available for all taxpayers,” says Ameet Patel, partner, Manohar Chowdhry & Associates.Across these provisions, a consistent theme emerges:India now taxes retirement savings more aggressively. Employees who save diligently, especially mid- to senior-level workers, face:The result is that long-term savings face multiple tax points.There is growing consensus across industry bodies that these provisions need urgent review. The argument is not about giving employees a windfall—it is about ensuring fairness and a safety net. With an ageing population, lack of a universal social security system applicable to all citizens, and rising cost of living, the existing provisions are detrimental . India’s salaried class feels squeezed—not because they don’t want to pay taxes, but because the system increasingly treats retirement savings as a luxury rather than a necessity. What was once a predictable, trusted savings pathway is now layered with caps, tax triggers, and compliance complications.“And this compounds the problems that the ageing population faces when insurance companies either refuse to issue new health policies to senior citizens or charge such high premia on the policies that having a Mediclaim policy becomes extremely expensive for such retired persons. As and when such a person needs large amounts to be paid to hospitals for medical treatments, the depleted savings are often inadequate and the entire family is put under huge financial stress,” concludes Patel.",India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality.

Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the central excise act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from rs 2,050 to rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

A section 54F style Income Tax provision for physical asset monetisation

Why this reform matters now?

Far-reaching impact across economy

A Budget reform that could signal a maturing economy

(Navneet Munot is MD & CEO of HDFC Asset Management Company)

India is a country of enormous diversity, with languages, customs and beliefs varying widely across regions. Yet one financial habit cuts across income levels and geography. Most households have grown up buying physical gold or silver every year on Akshaya Tritiya, Dhanteras or on other auspicious days. This was not driven by price charts or return calculations but because Gold was trusted as a store of value that could be passed down across generations. For many families, Land served a similar purpose as a tangible, secure asset. In the absence of a wide range of formal investment avenues, this instinct served Indian households well and helped India build a reputation as a ‘Nation of Savers’. The downside however was that a large share of this wealth remained idle.That is now beginning to change owing to sustained efforts of policymakers and industry to build confidence in India’s capital markets. As of FY25, Indian households had ~7% of their total assets in Equities vs only ~3% in FY15. Since January 2021, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) have infused over $250 billion into equity markets, providing stability even as Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pulled out approximately ~$20 billion during the same period.Retail participation through mutual fund SIPs has been critical, with monthly SIPs rising to ~Rs 29k Cr in November 2025 from ~Rs 8k Cr in November 2019. Even so, financialization of savings has barely begun, with households still holding approx. two third of wealth in physical assets.Today, with numerous avenues available to invest savings more productively and with the economy in need of enormous financial capital to meet its growth objectives, the next phase of reforms must focus on monetising these assets in a productive way. The Union Budget could consider introducing a new provision in the Income Tax Act, modelled on Section 54F. If introduced, it should provide an exemption from long-term capital gains tax when proceeds from the sale of physical gold, silver or Land are reinvested into Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS), with a lock-in of 5 years. Section 54F currently allows tax-free reinvestment of gains from any asset into a residential house. Extending a similar principle to financial assets would encourage households to rebalance a part of their portfolios in a tax-efficient manner.Indian households are among the largest holders of precious metals in the world, with an estimated holding of ~25,000 tonnes of gold accumulated over generations. The recent surge in gold and silver prices has significantly increased the financial worth of families across India. At the same time, for a large number of households, this wealth remains largely notional.Secondly, most working Indians remain outside formal pension systems, even as life expectancy rises and healthcare costs increase. As ELSS’ provide transparency, professional management and potential inflation-beating returns in the long term, this reform could go a long-way in creating a credible retirement security.For households, the benefits could be tangible if the reform is introduced. Families that have seen the value of inherited gold or under-utilised land rise over time could monetise a portion and reinvest it into ELSS without immediate taxation. Over 10–20 years, such investments can materially strengthen retirement security or fund other financial goals.For the financial system, even a modest shift of household portfolios from physical to financial assets could translate into substantial, stable inflows. The 5-year lock-in would create a pool of patient domestic capital. Such flows help deepen market liquidity and crucially, cushion the market and the economy during bouts of FPI selling. A stronger domestic investor base is the best insurance against external volatility.From the Government’s perspective, the revenue risks appear limited. Many of these Gold and Land holdings are not being sold today and are being passed on through generations. When these get monetised, the Government can generate revenues from securities transaction tax, Stamp duty and GST on transactions/associated services that would not have occurred otherwise. Without requiring budgetary allocation, it uses the tax benefit to gently change behaviour, encouraging savers to become long-term investors. This should also aid Government’s efforts for formalisation of the economy.Every festive season, India’s cultural affinity for gold expresses itself in strong demand. This festive season, robust festival-driven purchases contributed to higher gold imports ($9.6Bn in Oct’25, $14.7Bn in Nov’25 vs Average of $3.3Bn for other months of CY25) adding to the current account deficit at a time when trade landscape is challenging. At the macro level, recycling household gold can gradually reduce dependence on incremental imports and ease current account pressure. More importantly, it would free up much needed financial capital needed to finance India’s growth ambitions.Union Budgets are often considered a statement of Government’s intent. A section 54F-style exemption for reinvestment of proceeds from physical assets into financial products like MFs would signal confidence in India’s capital markets to the rest of the world. With emphasis on investor protection and investor education, such a measure can advance financial inclusion, macroeconomic resilience and the realisation of Viksit Bharat in the decade ahead.","Navneet munot: a section 54f style income tax provision for physical asset monetisation could have a far-reaching impact across the economy.

Budget 2026: The Narendra Modi government is looking to revamp the customs duty slabs and tariff structure in the Union Budget 2026. FM Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the Budget on February 1, 2026. The government is weighing a plan to streamline the customs duty framework by cutting the number of tariff slabs to five or six from the existing eight.The proposed overhaul is aimed at simplifying the duty structure, lowering disputes and aligning import tariffs more closely with India’s industrial strategy and trade objectives. The review is likely to prioritise the settlement of classification-related disputes, address inverted duty anomalies and reduce the scope of discretionary exemptions. These changes are also intended to support the government’s broader effort to modernise customs operations.As part of a wider overhaul, the government is also looking to revisit and recalibrate the duty structure governing transactions between special economic zones and domestic tariff areas, the sources said, adding that this forms a key element of the ongoing SEZ reform process.The initiative is being pursued in the context of recently finalized trade agreements, ongoing negotiations with key partners and the push towards a paperless and frictionless customs system.Over the past two years, the Centre has steadily worked to rationalise customs duties by pruning slabs and withdrawing exemptions.“The last budget customs duty structure saw a major rationalisation. There is room for further rationalisation of customs slabs to five-six,” a senior official told ET. The official added that groundwork for the changes has been underway for the past three to four months and a formal announcement is likely in this year’s budget.The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs is working towards aligning the customs duty framework with the restructured goods and services tax system to create a more integrated and consistent tax regime, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials quoted by the financial daily said efforts are underway to address operational bottlenecks highlighted by industry participants.Those involved in the discussions noted that curbing disputes over tariff classification, a leading cause of prolonged litigation, remains a central objective of the exercise. The scale of the issue is reflected in data from a parliamentary standing committee on finance, which showed that as of December 2024, as many as 75,592 customs-related cases were pending, with recoverable dues totalling Rs 24,016.20 crore.Industry bodies have argued for the introduction of an amnesty mechanism in cases where disputes arise without any intent to evade duties, as a way to ease the litigation burden. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had indicated last month that rationalising and simplifying customs duties would be the next major focus area in the government’s reform agenda.","The proposed overhaul is aimed at simplifying the duty structure, lowering disputes and aligning import tariffs more closely with india’s industrial strategy and trade objectives.

It noted that decarbonisation poses both a challenge and an opportunity, and targeted policy support could accelerate the shift to sustainable production.Assocham further advocated incentivising scrap collection and recycling, underlining that strengthening domestic recycling infrastructure through skilling initiatives is essential to reduce India’s dependence on imported raw materials.Despite India being the world’s second-largest steel producer after China and recording a healthy growth rate of 8–9 per cent, the sector is facing mounting pressures, the industry body said. Elevated input costs, a depreciating rupee and heavy reliance on imported coking coal — due to negligible domestic mineable reserves — continue to weigh on producers.The chamber also flagged concerns over iron ore availability, noting that production has remained stagnant and several auctioned mines are yet to commence operations.Rising steel demand and continued exports of iron ore are tightening domestic supply, pushing up costs for local mills, it said.Assocham said the upcoming Budget presents an important opportunity to position India as a global manufacturing hub for steel and value-added products under the ‘Make in India’ initiative. To support this goal, it has called for promoting iron ore beneficiation, removing import duties on critical raw materials and rationalising royalty calculations to address issues of double taxation.The body also stressed the need to incentivise research and development in steel recycling, alloy innovation and process digitisation, saying this would improve productivity and reduce dependence on imports of speciality steel.","Assocham has urged the government to roll out incentives for hydrogen-based direct reduced iron (dri) production.

With more than Rs 1.52 lakh crore of customs duty locked in litigation, the government may consider introducing an amnesty scheme in the Union Budget for 2026–27 to bring closure to long-pending disputes and provide certainty to businesses, Price Waterhouse & Co LLP said on Thursday, PTI reported.The government could also look at further rationalising customs duty rates by reducing the number of slabs to five or six from the current eight, as part of efforts to address the inverted duty structure arising from India’s expanding network of free trade agreements (FTAs), said Gautam Khattar, Principal, Price Waterhouse & Co LLP.“Today, in Customs, we have 8 slabs; the idea is to reduce it to 5–6 slabs with rate rationalisation. Within rate rationalisation, another area which should be looked at is the inverted duty structure vis-a-vis FTAs,” Khattar told PTI.He noted that free trade pacts have made several finished goods cheaper than the raw materials used to manufacture them domestically, creating duty inversion issues. “So it will be apt to look at this duty inversion and consider raw material duty rate reduction vis-a-vis the finished products,” Khattar said.India has signed FTAs with countries such as New Zealand, the UK and Oman, while negotiations are ongoing with the EU and the US. In the Union Budget for 2025–26, the government had already rationalised the customs duty framework by bringing down the number of Basic Customs Duty (BCD) slabs to eight, including a zero-rate slab.On litigation, Khattar said industry has been pushing for an amnesty scheme to resolve legacy disputes. “Expectation is to provide certainty so that historic disputes are closed,” he said.As of March 2024, around 38,014 cases involving customs duty of Rs 1.52 lakh crore remain under litigation, PTI reported.Apart from dispute resolution and rate rationalisation, faster customs clearances and improved trade facilitation are also expected from Budget 2026–27, Khattar added.",The government may consider introducing an amnesty scheme in the union budget for 2026–27 to bring closure to long-pending disputes and provide certainty to businesses.

NEW DELHI: The budget for 2026-27 is likely to be presented on February 1, the first, in recent memory, to be presented on a Sunday.The budget session may start from Jan 28 with the President’s speech. Though the final call on the date will be taken by the cabinet committee on parliamentary affairs (CCPA) on Wednesday, TOI has learnt that govt may continue with the tradition of presenting the budget on February 1.Since 2017, govt has been presenting the budget at 11 am on February 1 and former FM Arun Jaitley had unveiled it for the first time on the first day of Feb after govt decided to advance the budget presentation. Prior to 2017, the budget was presented on February 28.This year Feb 1 falls on a Sunday. It is also Guru Ravidas Jayanti, a restricted holiday. Being a holiday, govt offices and the stock markets are closed on Sunday.People aware of the development said that the Economic Survey would be presented on January 29. The next two days — January 30 and 31 — would be holidays. The first part of the budget session is likely to be for three weeks and the second part will last for four weeks.In 2025, February 1 fell on a Saturday and govt presented the interim budget that day. The Union budget had been presented on a Saturday before too, including in 1999 when then finance minister Yashwant Sinha, who read out the budget on February 27, a Saturday. This also marked the beginning of budget speech at 11 am instead of 5 pm, a departure from colonial practice.The 2026-27 budget is keenly awaited as it comes at a time of geopolitical tensions and under the shadow of Trump’s tariffs. Government is expected to unleash reform measures to shield growth and the country’s standing as one of the fastest growing major economies in the world .They added that the themes have been chosen considering govt’s focus to achieve the goal of a developed nation by undertaking major reforms to push growth against the backdrop of global challenges.TOI has also learnt that getting rid of the “mentality of slavery” and the thrust on “reform, perform and transform” are likely to be the central themes of the President’s address at the joint sitting of Parliament on Jan 28. Different ministries have been asked to give their inputs based on these themes for the President’s speech.Removing traces of colonialism has become the talking point for the govt since August 15, 2022, when PM Narendra Modi spoke about it from the ramparts of the Red Fort. This was also one of the five pledges (Panch Pran). “When we see even the smallest thing related to colonialism in us or around us, we have to be rid of it...

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is likely to present the Union Budget 2026 on February 1, which falls on Sunday, marking a significant milestone as she delivers her ninth consecutive Budget. This will be the second full Budget of the Modi 3.0 government, following the first full Budget presented in 2025.Notably, Budget used to presented on February 28 until 2017, when the modi government decided to shift the date to 1st of the month, to ensure quicker implementation.The Budget is expected to focus on sustaining economic momentum while offering relief to the middle class, which continues to grapple with high taxes, elevated living costs, and tightening household finances.With Budget 2026, Sitharaman moves closer to the all-time record of 10 Union Budgets presented by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai. Having already presented eight consecutive Budgets, including the interim Budget in February 2024, she will now become the only finance minister to have delivered nine consecutive Budgets under a single prime minister.So, here's a breakdown of India's history with regards to budgetIndia’s first Union Budget after Independence was presented on November 26, 1947, by the country’s first finance minister, R.K.Shanmukham Chetty.For decades, the Budget was presented at 5 pm on the last working day of February, a colonial-era practice that aligned announcements with UK working hours. India’s time zone, our hours and 30 minutes ahead of British Summer Time, ensured the Budget reached London during business hours.In 1999, then finance minister Yashwant Sinha, under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government, moved the Budget presentation to 11 am, a convention that continues today.In 2017, the government advanced the Budget date from February 28 to February 1 to enable faster Parliamentary approval and ensure implementation from the start of the financial year on April 1. Earlier, procedural delays often pushed implementation to May or June.Before becoming Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh served as finance minister under Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao and presented five consecutive Budgets between 1991 and 1995. His 1991 Budget remains historic for ushering in India’s economic liberalisation.Nirmala Sitharaman holds the record for the longest Budget speech. Her February 1, 2020 address lasted 2 hours and 40 minutes, before she concluded with two pages still unread.The shortest Budget speech was delivered by Hirubhai Mulljibhai Patel in 1977, when his interim Budget speech ran to just 800 words.","India’s first union budget after independence was presented on november 26, 1947.

Return Filing: An archaic requirement

Challenges relating to furnishing a

Tax Residency Certificate

Recommendations:

A threshold limit for seeking the TRC would help ease this burden.

Or allow non-resident taxpayers to submit TRCs from previous years (for example, the past one or two years) along with Form 10F.

Alternatively allow submission of documents other than TRC to substantiate residency of a particular country.

Challenges relating to online furnishing of Form 10F

Recommendation:

Offline furnishing of Form 10F should be permitted, as was allowed earlier.

Practical Pain Points

India’s economic footprint extends far beyond its borders. Millions of Indians living abroad continue to hold property, investments, and financial interests back home. Foreign nationals and global investors, too, increasingly engage with Indian businesses. Yet, for all the cross-border activity, India’s tax system still places a disproportionately heavy compliance burden on those who qualify as non-residents under tax law.As Budget 2026 approaches, industry bodies, tax experts, and non-resident taxpayers are urging the government to rationalize the rules. Their central message is simple: when income is minimal, passive, or already subject to tax deducted at source (TDS), compliance should be simple and easy.At present, non-resident individuals must file an Indian tax return if their total income exceeds Rs. 2.5 lakh — even when every rupee of that income has already suffered TDS and there is no additional tax liability arising in India. This includes small interest earnings, or dividend income.Tax experts point out that this leads to return filings with no additional tax payable, clogging the system and adding cost and effort for taxpayers who may have no other financial connection to India.Recommendation: Perhaps Budget 2026 provisions could provide some leeway and exemption in filing a tax return, if no tax is required to be paid and the non-resident has no business income in India.A non-resident taxpayer can claim the benefit of a tax treaty, which often provides a lower tax rate — for instance, on dividend income from shares held in India. Under section 90(2) of the Income-tax Act, the provisions that are more favourable to the taxpayer prevail. Thus, if the treaty prescribes a lower rate than domestic law, the treaty rate applies.However, section 90(4) requires the taxpayer to furnish a Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) in order to access treaty benefits, regardless of the nature or quantum of income. When the amounts involved are very small, the requirement to obtain a TRC can create unnecessary hardship for both the non-resident recipient and the resident payer, as the process involves time and cost.Mahesh Nayak, tax partner at CNK & Associates points to several other challenges. “In addition, non-resident taxpayers must currently file Form 10F electronically on the e-filing portal to claim tax treaty relief. They are also required to provide a TRC from foreign tax authorities covering the entire financial year to establish residency in the other country. In practice, many foreign tax authorities do not issue TRCs certifying future residency. Further, in certain jurisdictions, obtaining a TRC involves incurring a significant cost to the individual taxpayer and hence, asking for multiple TRCs for recurring payments becomes a costly affair, he says.Nayak points out that submission of documents other than TRC to substantiate the tax residency of a particular jurisdiction (country) should be permitted. The objective of a TRC is only to determine that the taxpayer is a resident of a particular country and therefore, if one can substantiate the tax residency through some other document, it should suffice, as held by Tribunals. “For example, in the US, a citizen is considered as a tax resident. Therefore, in such a situation, if one can provide a copy of the passport, clearly demonstrating US citizenship, that should suffice the eligibility of the taxpayer to claim the benefit of the India – US tax treaty. Copies of the passport can also be used to help determine the number of days stay in a particular jurisdiction, which can help determine tax residency in jurisdictions which determine tax residency based on number of days stay in that particular year,” he explains.If the TRC provided by the tax authorities of the relevant jurisdiction does not contain all the information as required under the Indian tax rules, the non-resident is required to provide the said details in a declaration in Form 10F, which is to be furnished electronically.“There are practical challenges for a non-resident taxpayer, who does not have a PAN in India, to furnish Form 10F as at times, the OTP is not sent to the foreign mobile number of the taxpayer. This creates an unnecessary hassle for a mere filing of a declaration along with the TRC,” states Nayak.Non-residents must maintain a bank account in India to pay taxes and to receive tax refunds, even when they reside abroad and hold no other Indian assets. The final step in income-tax return filing — e-verification — is linked to Indian bank accounts, Aadhaar-linked mobile numbers, or certain digital signatures. Non-residents without Indian mobile numbers often struggle to complete filings within the stipulated deadline.Budget 2026 provides the perfect moment to modernize India’s approach — and to acknowledge that, for millions of global Indians and foreign nationals, “ease of compliance” is a reality.","At present, non-resident individuals must file an indian tax return if their total income exceeds rs. 2.5 lakh.

By Sriram Iyer

1. Re-introducing tax incentives for the self-employed under the new tax regime can provide a much-needed nudge towards retirement planning.

2.

Formalising retirement savings for gig and platform workers through mandatory contributions deserves priority.

3.

Revisiting the ₹7.5 lakh cap on tax-exempt employer contributions can materially improve retirement adequacy for salaried employees.

4.

Making NPS tie-up mandatory for private sector employers can significantly expand coverage.

5.

Enabling interoperability between EPF and NPS would provide flexibility and empower individual choice.

(Sriram Iyer is Managing Director & CEO, HDFC Pension)

As India aspires to become a developed economy by 2047, one of the most critical yet under-discussed pillars is retirement security. Despite rapid financialisation of household savings, India’s pension assets stand at only about 14% of GDP, significantly lower than comparable economies. The upcoming Union Budget offers an opportunity to accelerate India’s journey towards becoming a ‘pensioned society’ by strengthening and widening the National Pension System (NPS).Nearly 58% of India’s workforce is self-employed, as per the Economic Survey 2024-25. Unlike salaried employees—who benefit from EPF, corporate NPS and superannuation—the self-employed largely remain outside formal retirement systems. Section 80CCD(1B), which allowed an additional deduction of ₹50,000 for NPS contributions, acted as a strong behavioural trigger for this segment under the old tax regime. Its absence in the new tax regime has diluted that incentive.Re-introducing 80CCD(1B) under the new regime, with a higher limit of up to ₹1.2 lakh annually, would encourage early participation in retirement savings.Global experience shows that upfront tax incentives play a decisive role in driving adoption of long-term products like pensions. Over time, this would reduce old-age dependency and fiscal pressures on the State.India’s gig workforce—estimated at nearly 1 crore today and projected to reach 2.35 crore by 2029-30 —represents a fast-growing but vulnerable segment. While the Code on Social Security, 2020 recognises gig and platform workers and provides for insurance and health benefits, structured retirement savings remain absent.A modest mandatory contribution of 2–3% by digital platforms into NPS can meaningfully address this gap. Given the nature of gig work, voluntary retirement savings often take a back seat to immediate income needs. A default, system-driven contribution mechanism would help these workers build a long-term corpus without affecting their day-to-day liquidity. This step would also align well with the Government’s broader inclusion and social security agenda.Currently, the combined employer contribution to EPF, superannuation and NPS is capped at ₹7.5 lakh per annum. In practice, a significant portion of this limit is consumed by EPF and superannuation, leaving limited headroom for NPS contributions - even though NPS allows up to 14% of basic salary as employer contribution. As a result, senior management and key decision-makers often find NPS less attractive, which in turn affects adoption across organisations.Removing NPS from this overall cap—or creating a separate sub-limit for NPS—would enhance retirement replacement rates, potentially increasing them to around 65% when combined with other retirement instruments. This would also encourage leadership within corporates to actively champion NPS adoption.While EPF is mandatory, NPS remains optional, despite its low cost, transparency and market-linked returns. Today, only about 21,000 corporates offer employer NPS, compared to nearly 8 lakh establishments registered with EPFO. Making NPS tie-up mandatory for companies above a certain workforce threshold - say, 100 employees - would substantially widen coverage among private sector employees. A blended approach combining EPF, superannuation and NPS can meaningfully enhance long-term retirement outcomes, while still preserving choice and diversification.India’s workforce is young, mobile and increasingly financially aware. While EPF offers fixed returns and capital protection, NPS provides market-linked growth, low costs and the flexibility to customize asset allocation based on age and risk appetite. Although policy intent to allow tax-neutral transfers from recognised provident funds to NPS was articulated earlier, operational enablement - especially for EPF - remains incomplete.Allowing seamless, tax-neutral transfers between EPF and NPS would give employees the freedom to design retirement solutions aligned to their life stage and financial goals, while also channelising long-term savings into productive capital formation.The Union Budget has a unique opportunity to place retirement security firmly at the center of India’s economic agenda. Targeted tax incentives, inclusion of emerging workforce segments, rationalisation of contribution limits, and greater system flexibility can collectively deepen NPS adoption. These measures would not only strengthen household financial resilience but also support long-term capital formation-creating a virtuous cycle for both citizens and the economy.",The union budget has a unique opportunity to place retirement security firmly at the center of india’s economic agenda.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.

Read LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman’s complete post here



Rep. Khanna reached out to me to discuss the proposed California wealth tax; and while I am against the proposed tax, I'm always open to dialogue with our elected leaders.

The proposed CA wealth tax is badly designed in so many ways that a simple social post cannot cover all of the massive flaws. One well-documented example is the horrendous idea to tax illiquid stock in the proposal. Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue.

Some of my takeaways from my conversation with Rep. Khanna are that he believes (1) that Silicon Valley is a massively important creation of the future, and (2) that he wants to preserve and evolve capitalism through creating a contribution loop from the massively wealthy to helping the rest of the people in the state.

It is true that we need to preserve and grow the incredible creation and generativity of Silicon Valley. It is also true that we must figure out how to help people who have not benefited from the wealth, jobs, and company creation engine of Silicon Valley thus far.

I, along with many others, have expressed to Rep. Khanna that this wealth tax proposal is not the best way to achieve those objectives.

California's billionaire tax sparks tech exodus



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on California wealth tax







LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and one of the one of the Democratic Party’s biggest donors, has now joined the list people opposing the proposed California wealth tax. Hoffman has strongly opposed California’s proposed 5% wealth tax on billionaires. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Hoffman said that the California’s Billionaire tax is ‘badly designed’ and comes with ‘massive flaws’ and there are chances that it will become ‘horrendous’ for innovation. Hoffman further revealed that Rep. Ro Khanna had reached out to discuss the proposal and Hoffman made his opposition clear. “One well‑documented example is the horrendous idea to tax illiquid stock in the proposal,” Hoffman wrote. “Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue.”Despite his criticism of the California wealth tax, Hoffman said he appreciated Khanna’s willingness to engage. He noted that the congressman sees Silicon Valley as a massively important creation of the future and wants to “preserve and evolve capitalism” through the tax. Hoffman agreed on the need to balance innovation with broader inclusion, writing:n“It is true that we need to preserve and grow the incredible creation and generativity of Silicon Valley.It is also true that we must figure out how to help people who have not benefited from the wealth, jobs, and company creation engine of Silicon Valley thus far.”Khanna responded in a separate post, thanking Hoffman for the “excellent dialogue” and saying, “You summarized my goal and aspiration correctly!”The mass restructuring comes as California debates a controversial ballot measure that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth over $1 billion. If voters approve the measure in November 2026, it would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026. For Page—currently ranked the second-richest person globally by Bloomberg's Billionaires Index—that could mean a tax bill exceeding $12 billion.The New York Times reported in December that Page told associates he was considering relocating to Florida specifically because of this proposal. He's not alone in his concerns. Fellow tech billionaire Peter Thiel has opened a Miami office for his investment firm, Thiel Capital, while venture capitalist David Sacks launched operations in Austin, Texas.The proposed tax, backed by healthcare union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, aims to raise $100 billion over five years from California's approximately 200 billionaires. Supporters argue the revenue would offset anticipated federal budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance programs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he is not worried about a proposed tax on billionaires in his home state of California. Even though the tax could cost him over $7 billion, Huang stated that he is “perfectly fine with it” because he and his company chose to live in Silicon Valley for its talented workforce. He explained that he values the region and is willing to accept the taxes that come with staying there.","Linkedin co-founder reid hoffman has strongly opposed california's proposed 5% wealth tax on billionaires.
