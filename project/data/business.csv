As India pushes towards the $5-trillion economy milestone, the Union Budget 2026 has a pivotal opportunity to fuel this growth. Consumption remains the most reliable engine of the Indian economy. Yet, rising inflation, higher EMIs and mounting compliance costs have steadily eroded disposable incomes, especially for the salaried class and MSMEs.If Budget 2026 is to accelerate growth meaningfully, it must leave more money in the hands of taxpayers while making compliance simpler and fairer. Against this backdrop, the following measures can pump money into the economy and support the salaried class and small businesses:The 30% tax bracket now applies from ₹24 lakh onwards—a threshold that no longer reflects urban living costs or salary inflation. To restore purchasing power and reward upward mobility, the highest slab should begin at ₹36-40 lakh. This adjustment would immediately increase discretionary spending among middle and upper-middle income earners, translating into higher consumption and tax buoyancy over time. With prices rising across essentials, the basic exemption limit must move up to at least ₹5 lakh. The Section 87A rebate should also be accordingly recalibrated.The housing sector has a strong multiplier effect across several sectors, including steel, cement, labour and financial services. However, with property prices and EMIs soaring, the ₹2 lakh cap under Section 24(b) has become outdated. Doubling it to ₹4 lakh would provide a meaningful incentive for homebuyers, revive housing demand and support the broader economy.Healthcare inflation far outpaces headline CPI. Yet, deductions for medical insurance under Section 80D remain constrained. Raising the limit to ₹1–1.25 lakh would encourage adequate insurance coverage and reduce households’ dependence on savings during medical emergencies—strengthening financial resilience.The standard deduction under Section 16(ia) should be raised to ₹1 lakh and made uniform across both tax regimes. This would account for rising employment-related expenses such as commuting, technology and skill upgradation. To manage fiscal impact, the benefit could be withdrawn for salaries exceeding ₹1 crore, ensuring progressivity without diluting relief for the mass salaried class.While companies enjoy a 25% corporate tax rate, LLPs and partnership firms continue to be taxed at 30%. This disparity discourages small business formation and scale-up. Aligning their tax rate with corporate entities would promote entrepreneurship, expansion and job creation—without distorting the tax base.Formalisation cannot rely solely on penalties. To widen the tax base, GST-compliant businesses should receive tangible income-tax incentives or rebates. Such a carrot-based approach would encourage voluntary compliance, expand registrations and improve revenue sustainability.Service providers under the GST Composition Scheme are barred from inter-state trade, severely limiting growth opportunities. Allowing inter-state supply of services would open national markets to small service providers, boost incomes and strengthen economic integration—without undermining revenue.","If budget 2026 is to accelerate growth meaningfully, it must leave more money in the hands of taxpayers.

In a pre-Budget 2026 survey, most tax experts who spoke to Times of India Online said that the government may look to eventually do away with the old income tax regime, though the transition is likely to happen in a phased manner.

New Vs Old Income Tax Regime

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2026 on February 1, 2026 and like every year common man and taxpayers, especially salaried are watching out for possible changes on the income tax front. One big factor when it comes to income tax is the regime under which you choose to file your income tax return.Ever since the new income tax regime was introduced a few years ago, one question that has played in the minds of taxpayers is: will the old income tax regime cease to be an option soon?The new and old income tax regimes differ on one basic fundamental: the former has lower tax rates at higher levels of income compared to the old tax regime and fewer deductions and exemptions.For example; the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime is higher. With the Section 87A rebate, the level of tax free income for salaried taxpayers goes to Rs 12.75 lakh (including standard deduction)! Simply put; an individual earning Rs 1 lakh a month needs to pay ZERO tax!On the other hand, the option to avail deductions and exemptions under the old income tax regime work in its favour, though over the last few years the government has increasingly made the new income tax regime more lucrative.Some of the common income tax exemptions and deductions available under the old income tax regime are: Section 80C benefits (up to Rs 1.5 lakh for popular investments such as Provident Fund, PPF), Section 80D for medical insurance, NPS contributions, House Rent Allowance (HRA), Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), Section 80 TTA (interest on bank deposits etc.), home loan benefits.To get a better understanding of the future of the old income tax regime, let’s understand why the new income tax regime was introduced. Fundamentally, the government wants to move towards an income tax return regime with minimal deductions and exemptions to simplify the filing process and reduce the need for maintaining records and paperwork.In her Budget 2020 speech FM Nirmala Sitharaman had introduced the new income tax regime saying, “Currently the Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and deductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and administration of the Income Tax Act by the tax authorities a burdensome process. It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Income-tax law without taking help from professionals. In order to provide significant relief to the individual taxpayers and to simplify the Income-tax law, I propose to bring a new and simplified personal income tax regime wherein income tax rates will be significantly reduced for the individual taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and exemptions. ”As Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax at KPMG in India explains: When the new tax regime was introduced for the first time from FY 2020-21 it was then indicated by the government that there was a long-term intent to phase out the plethora of exemptions/deductions.Over the years, the government has in fact made the new tax regime - which disallows many widely claimed exemptions/ deductions under the old tax regime - increasingly more lucrative for individual taxpayers over the years.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India points out: recent data shows that for Assessment Year 2024‑25, around 72% of filers opted for the new tax regime, indicating broad acceptance of the simplified framework.“Given this trajectory, any move to retire the old regime, if considered, would likely be phased, allowing a cooling‑off period to support a smooth transition for taxpayers,” she tells TOI.The past two Budgets have reinforced the trends of trying to make the new income tax regime more popular, through more favourable new personal tax regime changes, including higher basic exemption and rebate limits in 2025, and increased standard deduction and NPS employer-contribution benefits in 2024.What’s interesting to note is that if 72% of taxpayers had opted for the new income tax regime by FY2025, the number will likely go up for FY 2025-26 after FM Nirmala Sitharaman tweaked tax slabs under the new income tax regime in last year’s Union Budget, and also made income up to Rs 12 lakh tax free.Some experts are of the view that exemptions and deductions are important especially when it comes to encouraging savings and providing home loan related tax benefits. However, a gradual phasing out of the old tax regime, with stagnation is seen.Preeti Sharma, Partner – Tax and Regulatory Services at BDO India told TOI, “The government has clearly shown its preference for the new income tax regime and has made it the default tax regime. However, an immediate abolition of the old tax regime is unlikely.”Why is the old income tax regime still relevant for many? The old tax regime continues to be beneficial for a certain group of taxpayers, particularly those who claim deductions such as House Rent Allowance (HRA), home-loan interest and benefits under Sections 80C and 80D, and especially for salaried taxpayers who claim deductions under Chapter VI-A.“As a result, the government is expected to follow a gradual approach, continuing with both tax regimes while nudging taxpayers towards the new tax regime,” she said.As Parizad Sirwalla of KPMG points out: many of the deductions (allowed under old regime) are basis long term commitment (e.g., renting a house/ buying a house, PPF, Life Insurance premium etc.) and hence complete deletion of old tax regime may have an impact on these long-term savings/ investment/ expenditure by the common man.“Additionally, prior to the New Income Tax Act being published there was expectation that the new Act may be a signal to do away with the old regime – however the final Act that has been passed continues the old tax regime as optional,” she says.Chander Talreja, Partner at Vialto Partners says that the government has given flexibility to the taxpayers to choose the best regime applicable for their case depending upon their personal situation and individual circumstances.“Few may find the old regime beneficial as a lot of deductions and exemptions help them to save tax and also ensure that they don’t hit the income ceiling where the surcharge becomes applicable,” he tells TOI.“Moreover, the government would also factor that there is a huge market for housing loans, various investments etc. which qualify for section 80C benefit and not allowing tax benefits for these may hamper their market demand. Hence, the flexibility to opt between the regimes would continue for some time,” he adds.On the other hand, Tanu Gupta, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP finds merit in ending the old income tax regime to avoid confusion.She notes that while the government may not completely eliminate the old tax regime from the law, it is already moving toward making the new regime so attractive that the old regime could automatically become redundant.“Although the old regime still finds a place in the newly enacted Income Tax Act 2025, the changes introduced in last year’s budget—such as tweaking the slabs, raising the Section 87A rebate to Rs 12 lakh, and capping the surcharge at 25% for incomes above Rs 5 crore, while leaving the old regime unchanged—represent a significant step toward making the new tax regime beneficial for most taxpayers,” she told TOI.“For FY 2023–24, 72% of taxpayers opted for the new regime, and this percentage is expected to be significantly higher for FY 2025–26,” she adds.Tanu Gupta is of the view that two income tax regimes cause confusion, beating the purpose of simplification of tax filing. “Evaluating options by comparing the old and new regimes, and for business income taxpayers being allowed to switch only once in a lifetime, only adds to the confusion, contrary to the tax policy objective of simplification,” she says.“There have even been instances where tax officers, while processing returns under Section 143, inadvertently applied the old regime despite the taxpayer choosing the new regime, causing inconvenience and additional administrative burden. Therefore, there is merit in putting a final end to the old tax regime rather than letting it fade naturally by becoming redundant,” she explains.Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director, Deloitte India sees a gradual stagnation of the old income tax regime. This is evident from the fact that one has to not only explicitly opt for the old income tax regime, it has not seen periodic updates to its slab rates and standard deduction.“The introduction of the Income Tax Act 2025 aims for simplicity. Keeping two parallel systems forever contradicts the goal of simplification. Hence, we may expect the old regime to remain for another 2-3 years to allow long-term investors (with 15-year PPF accounts or longer period home loans) to transition smoothly. However, it is increasingly becoming a legacy option unattractive for most taxpayers,” she tells TOI.Akhil Chandna, Partner and Global People Solutions Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat anticipates a gradual phase-out of the old regime over time.“Recent budget announcements have consistently enhanced the attractiveness of the new regime—through higher rebate limits and inclusion of standard deductions—while leaving the old regime unchanged. Consequently, the old tax regime is expected to become redundant in the coming years,” he says.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present the union budget 2026 on february 1, 2026.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to explore the possibility of assured payout under the National Pension System (NPS), pension regulator PFRDA on Tuesday constituted a 15-member high-level committee, chaired by M S Sahoo, former IBBI chairman.Among the primary mandate of the panel, which will include actuarial, finance, insurance and capital market experts, is to develop a framework for creating regulations for assured payouts, including exploring the pension schemes.Besides, the committee will formulate a framework for ensuring a smooth end-to-end transition for subscribers moving from the accumulation phase to the payout phase.It will also define terms such as lock-in periods, withdrawal limits, pricing mechanism and fee structures for providers along with establishing robust risk management (capital and solvency requirements) and examining tax implications for payouts that do not require a subscriber to exit the NPS architecture.""The committee is tasked with formulating guidelines and regulations to enable a framework for assured payouts under the NPS. This move aligns with the provisions of the PFRDA Act and aims to enhance the security of retirement income for subscribers,"" said the pension regulator in a statement.Earlier in the day, PFRDA chairman S Ramann launched Pensionbazaar - a dedicated platform by PB Fintech.""It is essential that every citizen has access to pension products, as long-term financial security cannot be left to chance.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Budget 2026: FACSI urges tax & credit relief for MSEs; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-facsi-urges-tax-credit-relief-for-mses-heres-why/articleshow/126503427.cms,"Union budget 2026 (ANI image)

The Federation of Associations of Cottage and Small Industries (FACSI) has requested the central government to provide tax, credit and regulatory relief measures for micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in the 2026-27 Union Budget, aiming to sustain growth and strengthen their role in India’s industrial ecosystem.In a pre-budget letter to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, FACSI president H K Guha said the recommendations were framed after consultations with various associations of entrepreneurs and MSE groups across the country, according to PTI.Among the key demands, the industry body called for the constitution of an exclusive council for small and micro enterprises under the Ministry of MSME, a higher exemption threshold under the GST regime and a single, simplified GST return for small units.FACSI also proposed statutory collateral-free lending of up to Rs 1 crore for MSEs at an interest cap of 6-7 per cent, interest subvention during financial stress and automatic renewal of working capital limits for compliant units.Highlighting liquidity concerns, the federation demanded GST refunds within 15 days with statutory interest for delays and complete decriminalisation of procedural lapses under GST, labour and local laws.For export-oriented units, FACSI suggested the creation of an Export Risk Equalisation Fund to support small exporters affected by sudden tariff hikes, alongside higher lending targets by SIDBI and public sector banks.The letter also sought a reduction in fees for MSEs submitting tenders through the GeM portal and stronger functioning of State Facilitation Councils to address delayed payments. FACSI observed that some measures would require amendments to the MSMED Act, 2006.Guha emphasised the need for closer coordination with state governments to extend subsidies on renewable energy installations, electricity charges and local levies and to provide special facilities for units in industrial estates managed by state development corporations.“These measures will be a significant enabler for the growth of MSEs in India,” Guha said.","The federation of associations of cottage and small industries (facsi) has requested the central government to provide tax, credit and regulatory relief measures for micro and small enterprises in the 2026-27 union budget.

Budget 2026: Need for an overhaul of the TDS framework,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-need-for-an-overhaul-of-the-tds-framework/articleshow/126488694.cms,"The requirement to issue TDS and TCS certificates is increasingly seen as redundant. (AI image)

For transactions involving the purchase of tangible/material goods and for transactions undertaken through an electronic medium/platform (if not subject to GST), a withholding tax rate of 0.1 percent can be prescribed without any threshold limit.

For transactions involving the supply of any type of services (if not subject to GST), a withholding tax rate of 2 percent can be prescribed without any threshold limit.

For residuary transactions, such as withholding tax on interest and dividends (if not subject to GST), a withholding tax rate of 10 percent can be prescribed.

India’s tax deduction at source (TDS) framework, originally designed as a mechanism to ensure steady revenue inflows and improve tax compliance, has over the years become a source of complexity, cash-flow stress and litigation for businesses. With the scope of TDS expanding almost every year, tax experts argue that the time is ripe for a comprehensive rationalization of withholding tax provisions.At present, the withholding tax system is marked by a multiplicity of rates and thresholds. TDS and TCS rates range from as low as 0.1 per cent to as high as 30 per cent, depending on the nature of the transaction. This fragmented structure increases the risk of compliance errors, often leading to disputes, interest and penalties.“The current withholding tax framework involves multiple TDS and TCS rates, which creates significant complexity and an increased risk of compliance errors. Excessive withholding also results in liquidity constraints for taxpayers and additional administrative effort to seek refunds,” said Rohinton Sidhwa and Amit Bablani, partners at Deloitte India, in their pre-budget booklet.Data released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) underlines the scale of the problem.Income-tax refunds have risen sharply from Rs. 1.92 lakh crore in FY21 to Rs. 4.76 lakh crore in FY25. A substantial portion of these refunds is attributed to excess TDS and TCS, resulting in blocked working capital for businesses and higher interest outgo for the government.The Finance Act, 2024 took some steps towards simplification by reducing several 5 per cent TDS rates to 2 per cent and aligning the TDS rate to 0.1% on e-commerce transactions with that on purchase and sale of goods. However, tax professionals point out that the underlying structure remains cumbersome with lack of uniformity.One key reform proposal is to leverage the nationwide GST framework to reduce duplication. Since GST already provides a robust, invoice-level reporting mechanism, experts suggest that TDS and TCS should be eliminated for transactions where GST is applicable.Deloitte India recommends:Using GST to reduce TDS/TCS compliance: With the implementation of a Pan-India GST framework, a unified tax reporting system already exists. This can be effectively used to reduce TDS/TCS compliance. It is recommended that TDS/TCS be eliminated on all transactions where GST is applicable (per the invoice). The Income-tax Department can obtain information and track these transactions as needed by mandating an appropriate information return from suppliers. Suppliers are already filing such returns (GST returns), so there will not be any additional compliance.Simplified categorization of withholding tax provisions: Withholding tax provisions should be consolidated into three broad categories, as follows:Experts also flag the need to ease procedural burdens. The requirement to issue TDS and TCS certificates, for instance, is increasingly seen as redundant in an era where tax credits are reflected electronically through Form 26AS and AIS. Removing this obligation could significantly reduce compliance costs, especially for small and mid-sized businesses.Perhaps most contentious is the continued use of stringent prosecution provisions (Three months up to seven years) for delays in depositing TDS and TCS, even where taxes have been paid voluntarily along with interest. While the law provides for relief in cases of reasonable cause, industry feedback suggests that prosecution is often initiated mechanically, causing undue hardship.As India’s tax administration becomes increasingly data-driven, experts argue that the emphasis should shift from excessive withholding and penal action to trust-based compliance. A simpler, more predictable TDS regime could ease cash-flow pressures, reduce litigation and ultimately make tax compliance less adversarial—benefiting both taxpayers and the exchequer.","India’s tax deduction at source (tds) framework has over the years become a source of complexity, cash-flow stress and litigation for businesses.

By George Alexander Muthoot

Enabling financial inclusion through

Priority Sector Status

(PSL)

Gold-linked Credit Line

via

UPI

This idea came to me during a recent visit to one of our branches in Kochi, I met an old customer who is also an acquaintance. Our conversation ranged from everyday household needs to how deeply UPI has become part of daily financial life.

One simple question stayed with me: why should access to credit remain disconnected from the way people actually transact today?

That interaction led me to think about the possibility of a gold-linked credit line via UPI. Gold loans are already a trusted, secured product for households and small businesses. If such credit can be seamlessly linked to UPI, customers could access funds instantly when required, backed by idle gold jewellery, and at interest rates far lower than those charged by credit cards. We believe this can significantly improve access to affordable credit once NBFCs are enabled to integrate with the UPI ecosystem.

Rationalising exposure limits for Gold Loan NBFCs

Creating a Fair Framework for Retail NCD Investors

(George Alexander Muthoot is MD of Muthoot Finance)

Union Budget 2026 comes at a critical juncture for India’s growth journey. With political stability, resilient macro fundamentals and strong domestic demand, the government has an opportunity to deepen financial inclusion while accelerating credit-led growth. For the NBFC sector, particularly those focused on last-mile lending, the Budget can play a catalytic role in expanding access to affordable credit and strengthening household balance sheets.Targeted policy and regulatory interventions can significantly enhance the ability of formal financial institutions to serve small borrowers and micro-entrepreneurs. Our budget wishlist focuses on four key areas: enabling priority sector recognition for eligible gold loan NBFCs, leveraging digital public infrastructure to democratise credit, rationalising exposure limits and creating a fair and efficient framework for retail debt investors.We strongly advocate for granting PSL status to eligible gold loan NBFCs. Gold loans are mostly availed by small borrowers, often with ticket sizes below Rs 50,000, who rely on them to meet short-term liquidity needs such as medical expenses, education costs, agricultural inputs or working capital for micro-businesses.Currently, while banks enjoy PSL recognition for similar lending, gold loan NBFCs do not. This asymmetry limits the sector’s ability to scale responsibly and offer competitively priced credit.Granting PSL status would create a level playing field, lower the cost of funds and encourage NBFCs to expand outreach in semi-urban and rural markets.UPI has transformed the way individuals and small businesses transact. However, access to credit has not kept pace with this transformation. We propose the introduction of a gold-linked credit line via UPI, enabled for NBFCs. Under this framework, customers could monetise idle gold jewellery and access a revolving, secured credit line directly through UPI-enabled platforms. Such a facility would allow instant, need-based access to funds at interest rates in the range of 12-18%, significantly lower than what is charged by unsecured credit cards.The rationale is simple: gold loans are a trusted and well-understood product, while UPI is deeply embedded in daily financial life. Bringing the two together can dramatically improve access to affordable credit for households and small business owners, reduce dependence on high-cost borrowing, and promote responsible credit usage. In the short term, this could boost consumption and liquidity; over the medium term, it would strengthen household financial resilience and formalise borrowing behaviour.We also seek alignment of single counterparty exposure limits for gold loan NBFCs with those applicable to other NBFCs, set at 20% of Tier-1 capital. The current disparity constrains lending capacity despite gold loans being fully secured and historically demonstrating strong asset quality. Rationalising these limits would enable well-capitalised, regulated NBFCs to extend credit more efficiently, without compromising prudential safeguards.Retail investors play an important role in diversifying NBFC funding sources. However, current TDS provisions on listed NCDs mandates 10% TDS on interest - this creates avoidable compliance burdens, particularly when NCDs are traded on stock exchanges. Given that listed securities already provide a transparent audit trail of ownership and interest payments, simplifying or rationalising TDS norms would ease friction and improve market participation.Additionally, we recommend allowing a higher interest rate for retail investors, pensioners and senior citizens in public issues of secured NCDs, over and above rates offered to institutional investors. Retail investors often have different risk-return expectations and limited access to alternative fixed-income instruments. Offering appropriate incentives would encourage household participation in capital markets and support long-term savings.","Budget 2026 should introduce a gold-linked credit line via upi, enabled for nbfcs. Under this framework, customers could monetise idle gold jewellery and access a revolving, secured credit line. Such a facility would allow instant, need-based access to funds at interest rates in the range of 12-18%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126485572,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-62694,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.

"One of the biggest Democratic donor, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman calls Billionaire tax that made some of America's richest leave California …",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-of-the-biggest-democratic-donor-linkedin-founder-reid-hoffman-calls-billionaire-tax-that-made-some-of-americas-richest-leave-california-/articleshow/126413192.cms,"Reid Hoffman’s dialogue with Ro Khanna



Read LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman’s complete post here



Rep. Khanna reached out to me to discuss the proposed California wealth tax; and while I am against the proposed tax, I'm always open to dialogue with our elected leaders.

The proposed CA wealth tax is badly designed in so many ways that a simple social post cannot cover all of the massive flaws. One well-documented example is the horrendous idea to tax illiquid stock in the proposal. Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue.

Some of my takeaways from my conversation with Rep. Khanna are that he believes (1) that Silicon Valley is a massively important creation of the future, and (2) that he wants to preserve and evolve capitalism through creating a contribution loop from the massively wealthy to helping the rest of the people in the state.

It is true that we need to preserve and grow the incredible creation and generativity of Silicon Valley. It is also true that we must figure out how to help people who have not benefited from the wealth, jobs, and company creation engine of Silicon Valley thus far.

I, along with many others, have expressed to Rep. Khanna that this wealth tax proposal is not the best way to achieve those objectives.

California's billionaire tax sparks tech exodus



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on California wealth tax







LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and one of the one of the Democratic Party’s biggest donors, has now joined the list people opposing the proposed California wealth tax. Hoffman has strongly opposed California’s proposed 5% wealth tax on billionaires. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Hoffman said that the California’s Billionaire tax is ‘badly designed’ and comes with ‘massive flaws’ and there are chances that it will become ‘horrendous’ for innovation. Hoffman further revealed that Rep. Ro Khanna had reached out to discuss the proposal and Hoffman made his opposition clear. “One well‑documented example is the horrendous idea to tax illiquid stock in the proposal,” Hoffman wrote. “Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue.”Despite his criticism of the California wealth tax, Hoffman said he appreciated Khanna’s willingness to engage. He noted that the congressman sees Silicon Valley as a massively important creation of the future and wants to “preserve and evolve capitalism” through the tax. Hoffman agreed on the need to balance innovation with broader inclusion, writing:n“It is true that we need to preserve and grow the incredible creation and generativity of Silicon Valley.It is also true that we must figure out how to help people who have not benefited from the wealth, jobs, and company creation engine of Silicon Valley thus far.”Khanna responded in a separate post, thanking Hoffman for the “excellent dialogue” and saying, “You summarized my goal and aspiration correctly!”The mass restructuring comes as California debates a controversial ballot measure that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth over $1 billion. If voters approve the measure in November 2026, it would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026. For Page—currently ranked the second-richest person globally by Bloomberg's Billionaires Index—that could mean a tax bill exceeding $12 billion.The New York Times reported in December that Page told associates he was considering relocating to Florida specifically because of this proposal. He's not alone in his concerns. Fellow tech billionaire Peter Thiel has opened a Miami office for his investment firm, Thiel Capital, while venture capitalist David Sacks launched operations in Austin, Texas.The proposed tax, backed by healthcare union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, aims to raise $100 billion over five years from California's approximately 200 billionaires. Supporters argue the revenue would offset anticipated federal budget cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance programs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he is not worried about a proposed tax on billionaires in his home state of California. Even though the tax could cost him over $7 billion, Huang stated that he is “perfectly fine with it” because he and his company chose to live in Silicon Valley for its talented workforce. He explained that he values the region and is willing to accept the taxes that come with staying there.","Linkedin co-founder reid hoffman has strongly opposed california's proposed 5% wealth tax on billionaires.

Billionaire David Friedberg on why taxing California rich won't fix the real problem: ‘the uncomfortable truth is…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-david-friedberg-on-why-taxing-california-rich-wont-fix-the-real-problem-the-uncomfortable-truth-is/articleshow/126505277.cms,"‘ Taxing billionaires will not solve the problem’







Billionaire investor David Friedberg has criticised the narrative that taxing the ultra-wealthy will help the government to address massive projected funding shortfalls for healthcare (Medi-Cal) and education, arguing that while tax loopholes exist, the math simply doesn't add up to save California’s budget. Friedberg, in a conversation with AI czar David Sacks and venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, said explained how billionaires avoid taxes: the “Buy, Borrow, Die” strategy.“It’s totally reasonable to say billionaires aren’t paying their fair share — but the uncomfortable truth is why. Ultra-wealthy individuals don’t live on income, they live by borrowing against assets. No sale, no capital gains, no tax. That’s the loophole nobody wants to say out loud,” he said in a video, shared by Ian Miles Cheong, on X (formerly Twitter).He argued that if policymakers were interested in closing this gap they would have to take a different approach: Implement a tax on borrowed funds that are secured by unrealised gains.“The issue isn’t income tax — it’s asset-backed borrowing. When someone can live tax-free by borrowing against billions in untaxed assets, the system is broken.If policymakers were serious, the fix is simple: tax borrowed money tied to unrealized gains,” he added.He pointed out that the state is facing an estimated $1.5 trillion in long-term obligations and one-time tax income of $100 billion would barely be a solution.“California has ~200 billionaires worth $2 TRILLION combined. A 5% one-time tax raises $100B — sounds big until you realize the state is staring at a $1.5 TRILLION liability hole. Taxing billionaires doesn’t solve the problem. Spending does,” he added.“Even if you confiscated billions from every billionaire, it wouldn’t fix government debt. This debate pretends revenue is the issue — it’s not. The real crisis is uncontrolled spending and liabilities already baked into the system,” he noted.Rrecently, Sacks said, ""California has become a hostile work environment for founders.""","‘ taxing billionaires will not solve the problem’ says billionaire investor david friedberg. ‘when someone can live tax-free by borrowing against billions in untaxed assets, the system is broken,’ he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126505263,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-14754,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
