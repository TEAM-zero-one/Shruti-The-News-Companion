NEW DELHI: Travelling by Delhi Metro will become costlier starting Monday (August 25), as the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has announced a revision in ticket fares. This is the first hike in eight years, with the last increase implemented in 2017.According to DMRC, the fare adjustment is nominal, with ticket prices set to rise by Rs 1 to Rs 4 across most lines. The Airport Express Line, however, will see a slightly higher increase of up to Rs 5.The fare hike is expected to impact lakhs of daily commuters across Delhi-NCR.In an official post on social media platform X, DMRC confirmed: ""The passenger fares of the Delhi Metro services have been revised with effect from today, that is, 25th August 2025 (Monday) onwards. The increase is minimal, ranging from Rs 1 to Rs 4 only depending on the distance of travel (upto Rs 5 for the Airport Express Line). The new fare slabs, effective from 25th August 2025.""Commuter Sonia says, ""A middle-class family cannot afford the metro fares. Some people can, but some cannot. I believe that the fares should not be increased so that the middle class can also afford them.The fares should not be increased, they should stay as they are.""Another commuter Armaan says, ""The government should work on making the payment more convenient for us. The Metro Card does not work everywhere. That is a major issue. Other than that, if 2-4 rupees are increased, that is not a problem.""Even with the fare increase, commuters using smart cards will still enjoy a 10 percent discount on every trip, plus an extra 10 percent off during off-peak hours (before 8 AM, between 12 PM and 5 PM, and after 9 PM","Ticket prices set to rise by rs 1 to rs 4 across most lines.

"Budget: Budget proposes 30% TDS on net winnings in online games, removes threshold for TDS levy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-proposes-30-tds-on-net-winnings-in-online-games-removes-threshold-for-tds-levy/articleshow/97527935.cms,"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS .In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

By Parizad Sirwalla

Budget 2025 income tax: In the run up to the Budget 2025, individual taxpayers were eagerly looking forward to favorable tax reforms. The FM seems to have brought some cheer to them through her proposals.Recognizing the contributions of the middle class and with an objective to eventually phase out the old tax regime, various changes have been introduced in the new tax regime. The basic exemption limit has been increased from INR 3 lakhs to INR 4 lakhs. In a significant shift, the highest slab is increased from INR 15 lakhs to 24 lakhs. The other slabs and tax rates have been realigned and a new tax rate of 25% has been included. Income threshold for rebate under 87A available to resident taxpayers has been increased from INR 7 lakhs to INR 12 lakhs. For computing this threshold, special rate income (such as capital gains, lottery winnings etc.) has been specifically excluded, to also address certain ambiguities in the earlier interpretation.With these changes, all the taxpayers in the new tax regime have some reason to celebrate, irrespective of income levels.As an illustration, a person with income up to 12 lakhs can now enjoy annual tax savings of INR 80,000 (excluding cess). At the same time, an individual with income of 18 lakhs has a tax savings upto INR 110,000 (excluding cess). The savings would be higher for income levels where surcharge is applicable.Few amendments have been made with a view to simplify certain provisions. Earlier, in case of vacant properties, annual income could be considered as NIL for up to two self-occupied properties (SOP). While there is no change in above, to qualify as SOP, currently there is a condition that the taxpayer should not be able to reside therein due to his business or employment or profession and that taxpayer is staying in a premises not owned by him. This condition has now been done away with.NPS Vatsalya Scheme launched in September 2024, enabled parents and guardians to start a NPS for their minor children, which on attaining majority, would be transferred to the child's name with the accumulated corpus. As a welcome measure, the Budget has extended the deduction of INR 50,000 under section 80CCD (available in the old tax regime) to also include contributions towards this scheme. Further, it has been specified that partial withdrawals up to 25 per cent from the scheme, allowed for specified reasons, shall not be taxable.Currently, a deduction is allowed to an individual for any amount deposited in the National Saving Scheme (NSS), prior to 1 April 1992. Any withdrawals from the scheme are held as taxable. As a notification dated 29 August 2024 specified that the balances would not earn interest, this made the depositors keen to withdraw the NSS balance. Based on various representations received, the FM has now exempted the withdrawals done post 29 August 2024, for which deduction was allowed earlier, to provide them the much-required relief.Striking a balance between fiscal prudence and the theme of “Trust first, Scrutinize later”, the Government has enhanced timelines for filing updated returns by two more years by paying additional taxes of 60 and 70 percent respectively. This will help boost tax revenues through voluntary compliance.Consistency and clarity has been provided in the taxability of redemption proceeds of all un-exempted ULIPs, by including them in the definition of equity - oriented fund, which was earlier only with respect to certain unexempted ULIPs.There has been a rationalization of the various TCS/ TDS thresholds including on remittances under Liberalized remittance scheme (from INR 700,000 to INR 10,00,000 and NIL in the case of remittance for education financed by a specified loans) and interest income for senior citizens (from existing INR 50,000 to INR 100,000). This will positively impact their cash flows.The higher TDS is proposed to be continued on assesses having invalid PAN/ non-PAN holders. However, it is proposed to remove the higher TDS/TCS on non-filers of return of income with an attempt for ease of doing business and reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers.The FM has also promised to table the much-awaited New Income Tax Bill which aims at simplicity and reduced litigation, in the next week. All in all, the Budget endeavors to take steps to reinforce confidence and optimism in the taxpayers.","Income threshold for rebate under 87a available to resident taxpayers has been increased from inr 7 lakhs to inr 12 lakhs.

'Budget's given comfort to monetary authority': Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budgets-given-comfort-to-monetary-authority-finance-secretary-tuhin-kanta-pandey/articleshow/117995724.cms,"In an interview to TOI,

Pandey, who is also in charge of the revenue department, said

Do you think the Budget has done enough to help accelerate growth against the backdrop of global uncertainties?

Is the time right for

monetary authorities to play a part in accelerating growth, for example with a rate cut?

So, has the Budget created conditions for a rate cut?

Is the tax relief largely to boost consumption and address some of the concerns of the middle class?

Have other levers of economy got required attention, apart from consumption and investment?

When do you expect I-T bill to be presented in Parliament? How will it make life of the taxpayer simple?

Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the 2025-26 Budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation.the Budget has enabled all levers of growth to accelerate. Excepts:It is a pro-growth Budget. We have headwinds and we also have internal challenges. We have addressed both. Although, we are still the fastest growing large economy in the world, not only we have to maintain this growth, but we have to push it up. We have addressed both the supply-side and demand-side and tried in a non inflationary way to maximise growth, accelerate growth.I think it's up to the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to take a call on that. But, on the fiscal side, we have done our bit. We have kept the promise of fiscal consolidation. FM had announced that it will be 4.9% in this year and we have been able to achieve 4.8%. FM had said fiscal consolidation path will mean we'll bring it to 4.5% next year. We are proposing 4.4% and there was also an announcement that thereafter we will have a glide path in terms of the debt-to-GDP level and a visibility would be given on how it will go forward.That has also been included in the FRBM statement.In a way, the Budget has provided whatever stimulations are required. We are not providing a stimulus at the cost of the deficit by increasing the deficit. So, we are giving sufficient sort of comfort to the monetary authority. However, they would have to take a call based on whatever.I would say consumption is one part. However, we are not really prescribing how taxpayers, who have got this money back in a way, how they will behave. Basically, the decision making is transferred to taxpayers, who have got this relief. They may choose to consume, save or invest directly in either of the three situations we have. It will have a salutary and good effect on the economy because if they choose to consume, it will boost demand. If they choose to invest indirectly, they are supporting the banks to extend more credit. Because, banks can give credit only when they have got increased deposits. And, if they choose to directly invest, for example in a house, they also participate in investments. In that case, it will work like an investment multiplier anyway. So, it will be a combination of consumption and investment multiplier, with a positive impact on savings. Overall, I would say it will be a growth-booster.A large economy like India has to have all engines firing. You cannot simply say we will only go for agriculture, not for manufacturing. Or, we will go for manufacturing and not for services. Therefore all three are required. If you see all the proposals on supply side, we have tried to see how we can speed up production, how we can speed up productivity and how we can spur employment. So, it is employment-led growth. In agriculture, we have taken steps to boost pulses productivity and increase credit limit for farmers. Everywhere we have said how we can boost production and productivity. We are saying let there be a growth path for MSMEs. Let there be more credit available for MSMEs. Let their participation in exports be more. Let there be more support for them in terms of innovation and research. Our tax policy is supporting labour intensive sectors.It is proposed to be done before Feb 13. We are not changing the policy through it. The same thing will be carried forward because after passing, this bill will be applicable from a future date. We wanted to reform right away. So, those reforms have been brought in this bill through amendments. There are so many redundant provisions. There are a number of changes. More than 4,000 changes have happened since 1962, when this act was enacted. In 63 years, the finance sector changed, plus there were many taxation laws and amendment bills. Things get complicated to read and they may also create interpretation problems. There could be many interpretation problems or litigations. If you have more readability, if you have clarity, there will be less litigation.","Finance secretary tuhin kanta pandey said the 2025-26 budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation. The budget has enabled all levers of growth to accelerate, he said. More than 4,000 changes have happened since 1962, when this act was enacted.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117996121,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-455300,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Latest Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 after Budget 2025: The income tax slabs and income tax rates under the new tax regime have been revised for FY 2025-26. The revised income tax slabs were announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in her Union Budget 2025 speech. The most important takeaway from the new income tax rules for the upcoming financial year is that individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh will have to pay ZERO tax. For salaried individuals, once the standard deduction of Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime is counted, this income level goes up to Rs 12.75 lakh.Additionally, across the board income tax slab changes mean that individuals under the new tax regime, will now have to pay lower taxes, even at income levels above Rs 12 lakh. There is also the concept of marginal relief, which allows individuals earning just above Rs 12 lakh to not pay taxes more than their additional income.The total tax benefit of slab rate changes and rebate at different income levels can be illustrated with examples:Confused about the new income tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime?

Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.Yes, the limit of total income for NIL tax payments in the new tax regime has been increased to Rs. 12 lakhs in this budget provided the taxpayer files ITR to avail the rebate.Earlier the limit of income for nil tax payment was Rs 7 lakh.

However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-.The tax liability on such tax payer by way of slabs only is Rs 61,500. How ever a person having Rs 12 lakh income pays nil tax. By providing marginal relief it has been ensured that the tax payable by a person having income marginally above Rs 12 lakhs is required to pay only marginal amount of tax equal to the amount of income above Rs 12 lakhs so that his carry home is also Rs 12 lakhs. In this case he will be required to pay a tax of Rs 10,000.The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-(i) First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. In the answer given to question no.15 above, tax on the total income of Rs 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:(ii) Tax payable on total income of Rs 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.(iii) Now the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs 61,500) shall be compared with amount exceeding total income upto which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs 12,10,000 - Rs 12,00,000](iv) The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs 10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs 61,500) as tabulated above.(v) Therefore, in the above case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/- = 51,500/-) is allowed.(vi) Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500 - Rs 51,500]Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh!

It is available only on the tax payable as per slabs under section 115BAC.Rebate is the deduction from tax which is available to tax payers having income upto Rs 12 lakhs in the new regime.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/latest-income-tax-slabs-2025-26-how-much-tax-do-individuals-earning-slightly-above-rs-12-lakh-have-to-pay-marginal-relief-calculations-explained/articleshow/117911656.cms,"Budget 2025 income tax: The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs. 12,75,000/-.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

For salaried individuals, including the standard deduction, this limit is Rs 12.75 lakh under the new regime.But what about individuals with taxable income slightly above Rs 12 lakh? Will they have to pay more income tax than their additional earnings above Rs 12 lakh? Will someone earning Rs 12,10,000 face a Rs 61,500 tax burden versus an individual earning Rs 10,000 less who will pay nothing?There's good news! Here's where the concept of marginal relief comes us. Individuals with income slightly above Rs 12 lakh, which is the nil tax threshold, will receive fair treatment through marginal tax relief.For example, for a person having income of Rs 12, 10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax works out to be Rs 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakh + 10% of 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10,000).

GST reforms on the cards?

More tax relief coming soon? The Narendra Modi government, having provided substantial relief in personal income tax and customs tariff rationalisation in the Union Budget 2025, is now expected to initiate efforts to streamline the goods and services tax (GST) framework for easier implementation and adherence, according to officials.The primary objective will be to restructure the tax slabs to ensure meaningful outcomes, they indicated.The GST structure comprises four slabs-5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, with special rates for certain items like precious metals and additional cess on sin goods.The 5% slab currently covers 21% of GST items, whilst 12% applies to 19%, 18% to 44%, and 28% to 3% of items.According to an ET report, the government intends to discuss simplification and rationalisation with the group of ministers (GoM) tasked with reviewing rates, according to a source close to the discussions.The source noted that whilst the GoM has primarily concentrated on slab adjustments for goods, a comprehensive simplification requires fundamental restructuring of the current system.The GST Council established the GoM for rate rationalisation in September 2021. Despite numerous meetings, the GoM has not yet presented its final recommendations.Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The GoM is considering proposals including elimination of dual rates for items like pens and sunglasses based on price thresholds.

For an annual income of Rs 13.7 lakh, with basic salary at 50% (Rs 6.85 lakh), the NPS contribution at 14% would amount to Rs 95,900. Combined with the Rs 75,000 standard deduction, this eliminates tax liability on the entire Rs 13.7 lakh.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget 2025 speech announced that there will be NIL or zero income tax for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh. But did you know that for salaried individuals, the tax-free annual income can reach Rs 13.7 lakh, compared to Rs 12 lakh for others!“I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000,” FM Sitharaman announced in her Union Budget speech.This advantage of no tax till Rs 13.7 lakh income stems from the Rs 75,000 standard deduction and National Pension System (NPS) investments. Section 80CCD(2) allows tax deduction of up to 14% of basic salary invested in NPS, whilst the old tax regime offers 10%.According to an ET analysis, a salaried individual with Rs 13.7 lakh yearly income can achieve tax savings of approximately Rs 96,000 through NPS contributions. It’s important to note that this benefit requires employer participation in NPS as part of cost to the company, as employees cannot opt independently.It’s interesting to note that despite this opportunity existing for nearly a decade, only 2.2 million individuals have enrolled.

The extended NPS lock-in period and withdrawal limitations at maturity discourage many investors. Pre-retirement withdrawals are restricted to exceptional circumstances.

""The lack of liquidity in NPS is not necessarily bad because the money is at the right place.

As a common man of India, I would like to compliment and thank Hon’ble Finance Minister (FM) for being considerate towards the middle class and salaried taxpayers who generally feel neglected. The projected fiscal deficit of 4.4% for the next year (as against revised fiscal deficit of 4.8% for the current year) reflects a well thought through approach. The 2025 budget presented by the FM strikes a perfect balance between maintaining fiscal responsibility and managing taxpayers’ expectations.To begin with, the FM is keen to sunset the Old Personal Tax Regime (OPTR) as all the tax benefits are now proposed under New Personal Tax Regime (NPTR). With the proposed changes, NPTR will now become far more appealing for individuals as it would mean availing beneficial tax rates and no tax declaration or providing/ maintaining tax deduction and exemption proofs. Just to share perspective, last year only 28% of taxpayers opted for OPTR which will substantially decline in coming years as OPTR will only be beneficial if you are in the 30% tax bracket with over INR 8 lakh of eligible deductions and exemptions.Even the slab rates are easy to remember, slab changes with every block of 4 lakh and corresponding tax rates changes 5% up to six blocks with highest slab being 30 percent. Salaried individuals with a gross salary of up to INR 12.75 lakh will have zero tax under NPTR. To illustrate further, an individual earning income of, say, INR 24 lakh per annum, who had previously opted for NPTR will now enjoy a tax saving of INR 114,400 and much more compared to OPTR.Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The FM has taken conscious effort to bring down administrative burden and tried to rationalize on various aspects like penalty will be in abeyance till the final order is passed by the tax department. Now taxpayers have an opportunity to file an Updated Income Tax Return (UITR) with applicable penalty slabs based on the period of delay, up to four years in case they have missed reporting any income. By extending the option of filing UITR, Government is further encouraging such suo-moto filings, thereby enhancing its revenue streams, and providing an opportunity for taxpayers to be compliant.Further, the FM has proposed increasing TDS threshold on interest paid to senior citizens from INR 50,000 to INR 100,000, benefiting those who rely on traditional savings like term deposits and post office schemes by allowing them to retain more interest income. Additionally, TDS on dividends will now apply only if the amount exceeds INR 10,000, resulting in higher disposable income for active investors and more opportunities for reinvestment.In 2020, the Government introduced foreign remittance tracking mechanism by levying Tax Collection at Source (TCS) under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). While foreign remittances up to USD 250,000 per annum is permitted under the LRS, currently, TCS is applied on remittances above INR 7 lakh. With the proposed increase in threshold from INR 7 lakh to INR 10 lakh, Government aims to alleviate the financial burden on individuals remitting funds for various purposes.Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? For families who are supporting their children to pursue higher education overseas by borrowing from banks, the current TCS requirement of 0.5% on remittances exceeding INR 7 lakh adds to their financial strain. With interest rates on education loans usually exceeding 8% per annum, additional TCS meant lesser funds. With the budget proposing to scrap TCS on education-related remittances funded through financial institutions, the Government is promoting access to global educational opportunities, aligning with the vision of ""Viksit Bharat” and contributing to a more skilled workforce.By introducing the National Pension Scheme (NPS) Vatsalya last year, the Government provided an initiative for parents or guardians to open NPS accounts for their minor children. The FM expanded tax benefits for NPS to include contributions of up to INR 50,000 in NPS Vatsalya under OPTR.Regarding Income from house property, the proposal allows taxpayers to claim up to two properties as self-occupied without any conditions. This change offers relief to those with a second property that may remain vacant for various reasons. This is again testimony to avoid ambiguity and litigation.While no change in the tax rates on crypto transactions, it is proposed to be included in the definition of Virtual Digital Assets and prescribed reporting entities will furnish information in a specified statement.Further, the ambiguity about taxing the redemption of unit-linked insurance with high premiums policies has now been clarified i.e., long term capital gains at 12.5%.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime For millions of middle-class taxpayers, this budget represents more than just a change in policy; it serves as a financial lifeline. This shift in focus towards the middle class is particularly significant in a time when rising costs and inflation have put pressure on their finances. As they navigate the challenges of daily life, the tangible benefits of this fiscal relief will enable them to participate more actively in the economy, ultimately contributing to a cycle of growth and stability.To conclude - As one said, “Income tax is the hardest thing in the world to understand”, the FM has taken the challenge seriously and is moving in the right direction to simplify the same. The budget has provided a preview of a simplified tax system in the country, serving as a teaser for the New Income Tax Bill set to be unveiled next week. If today's budget is any indication, we can anticipate a more tax-friendly and simplified compliance-oriented tax framework soon.",The 2025 budget presented by the fm strikes a perfect balance between maintaining fiscal responsibility and managing taxpayers’ expectations.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.

New Income Tax Bill 2025 : Representing a historic milestone in India’s tax landscape, Hon. Finance Minister – Madam Nirmala Sitharaman has presented the Income Tax Bill, 2025 (Bill) in the Parliament on 13 February 2025.The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago. With passage of time there were multiple amendments made to the law. Many believed this resulted in the current Act becoming difficult to read, complex to interpret and resulted in unwarranted litigation as well. Hence, it was indeed an opportune time to embark on an exercise to simplify the same. While an attempt was made to this effect a decade ago with the draft Direct Tax Code (DTC) – it never became legislation.Globally as well, countries like the UK, Australia etc., had undertaken similar exercises to enhance clarity and compliance in their taxation laws. Hence, a new simplified income tax law in India was definitely the need of the hour.Also Read | ITR filing with latest income tax slabs post Budget 2025: Will taxpayers with income below Rs 12 lakh have to file tax return? The Bill is prepared by investing more than 60,000 man-hours and has 23 chapters and 2.6 lakh words in comparison to 46 chapters and 5.12 lakh words respectively when compared with the Current Act. The number of Sections has also dramatically reduced from 800 plus sections to 536 Sections only.Secondly the language used in the Bill at many places is extremely lucid and is reader friendly as it has tables and formulas as against the traditional verbose style.One of the most significant aspects of the Bill is the elimination of the concepts of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. India is trying to join the league of comparable tax jurisdictions by using one single term ‘tax year’. The current terms of previous year and assessment year was apparently leading to mistakes by taxpayers while filing forms/ challans etc. With now only one term “tax year” it will hopefully avoid confusion.Largely, there are no changes to the definition of residency or even salary related provisions for that matter. In fact the choice of the two tax regimes continues to be available to individual taxpayers. There is no change to the tax rates and capital gains tax regime also remains the same.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: Top 30 FAQs every taxpayer should check TDS and TCS provisions have been made easier to comprehend by providing tables instead of the existing provisions which have lengthy texts that are open to interpretation issues and quite often difficult to understand. The Bill now also gives the ability for individuals to apply for a Lower or NIL rate of TCS while they purchase a car, pay for foreign tour, or make remittance abroad under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the Reserve Bank of India.It is also interesting to note that elaborate provisions have been enunciated for dealing with transition from the current Act to the new law.There is a clear focus on encouragement of compliance with the mantra of “Trust first, scrutinize later” – as stated by Hon. FM in her recent Feb 2025 Budget speech.As and when the Bill is enacted, the administrative measures for implementing them will be made operational (e.g., publishing of rules, IT infrastructure revamp etc.), keeping in mind the convenience of taxpayers and all stakeholders. For the common man, it is anticipated that the Bill will help in easy understanding of law and smoother tax compliances.","New income tax bill: largely, there are no changes to the definition of residency or even salary related provisions for that matter.
