NEW DELHI: Over 30,000 taxpayers have declared foreign assets of more than Rs 29,000 crore after Central Board of Direct Tax ( CBDT ) launched a campaign nudging taxpayers to come clean. Besides, 6,734 taxpayers have revised their status from residents to non-residents.While the additional foreign income disclosed was Rs 1,090 crore, each taxpayer declared an average asset of around Rs 1 crore overseas.The disclosures are a result of information-sharing arrangements between nearly 125 countries with India being one of the early adopters, which has been since 2018 receiving data, including details of bank accounts overseas and the balance in them, dividends, interest received, and gross payments.Tax authorities, however, found that not everyone was making the required disclosures, resulting in CBDT launching a campaign last Nov urging taxpayers to declare their foreign assets and income through updated tax returns.I-T department sent emails and text messages to 19,500 taxpayers with significant assets overseas and high balances in their accounts, while also conducting outreach sessions with some 8,500 individuals.","Over 30,000 taxpayers have declared foreign assets of more than rs 29,000 crore.

Budget 2025 income tax: Personal tax announcements from the Budget and their impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2025-income-tax-personal-tax-announcements-from-the-budget-and-their-impact/articleshow/118009640.cms,"All the taxpayers in the new tax regime have some reason to celebrate, irrespective of income levels.

By Parizad Sirwalla

(The author is Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India)

Budget 2025 income tax : In the run up to the Budget 2025, individual taxpayers were eagerly looking forward to favorable tax reforms. The FM seems to have brought some cheer to them through her proposals.Recognizing the contributions of the middle class and with an objective to eventually phase out the old tax regime, various changes have been introduced in the new tax regime. The basic exemption limit has been increased from INR 3 lakhs to INR 4 lakhs. In a significant shift, the highest slab is increased from INR 15 lakhs to 24 lakhs. The other slabs and tax rates have been realigned and a new tax rate of 25% has been included. Income threshold for rebate under 87A available to resident taxpayers has been increased from INR 7 lakhs to INR 12 lakhs. For computing this threshold, special rate income (such as capital gains, lottery winnings etc.) has been specifically excluded, to also address certain ambiguities in the earlier interpretation.With these changes, all the taxpayers in the new tax regime have some reason to celebrate, irrespective of income levels. As an illustration, a person with income up to 12 lakhs can now enjoy annual tax savings of INR 80,000 (excluding cess). At the same time, an individual with income of 18 lakhs has a tax savings upto INR 110,000 (excluding cess). The savings would be higher for income levels where surcharge is applicable.Few amendments have been made with a view to simplify certain provisions. Earlier, in case of vacant properties, annual income could be considered as NIL for up to two self-occupied properties (SOP). While there is no change in above, to qualify as SOP, currently there is a condition that the taxpayer should not be able to reside therein due to his business or employment or profession and that taxpayer is staying in a premises not owned by him. This condition has now been done away with.NPS Vatsalya Scheme launched in September 2024, enabled parents and guardians to start a NPS for their minor children, which on attaining majority, would be transferred to the child's name with the accumulated corpus. As a welcome measure, the Budget has extended the deduction of INR 50,000 under section 80CCD (available in the old tax regime) to also include contributions towards this scheme. Further, it has been specified that partial withdrawals up to 25 per cent from the scheme, allowed for specified reasons, shall not be taxable.Currently, a deduction is allowed to an individual for any amount deposited in the National Saving Scheme (NSS), prior to 1 April 1992. Any withdrawals from the scheme are held as taxable. As a notification dated 29 August 2024 specified that the balances would not earn interest, this made the depositors keen to withdraw the NSS balance. Based on various representations received, the FM has now exempted the withdrawals done post 29 August 2024, for which deduction was allowed earlier, to provide them the much-required relief.Striking a balance between fiscal prudence and the theme of “Trust first, Scrutinize later”, the Government has enhanced timelines for filing updated returns by two more years by paying additional taxes of 60 and 70 percent respectively. This will help boost tax revenues through voluntary compliance.Consistency and clarity has been provided in the taxability of redemption proceeds of all un-exempted ULIPs, by including them in the definition of equity - oriented fund, which was earlier only with respect to certain unexempted ULIPs.There has been a rationalization of the various TCS/ TDS thresholds including on remittances under Liberalized remittance scheme (from INR 700,000 to INR 10,00,000 and NIL in the case of remittance for education financed by a specified loans) and interest income for senior citizens (from existing INR 50,000 to INR 100,000). This will positively impact their cash flows.The higher TDS is proposed to be continued on assesses having invalid PAN/ non-PAN holders. However, it is proposed to remove the higher TDS/TCS on non-filers of return of income with an attempt for ease of doing business and reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers.The FM has also promised to table the much-awaited New Income Tax Bill which aims at simplicity and reduced litigation, in the next week. All in all, the Budget endeavors to take steps to reinforce confidence and optimism in the taxpayers.",Income threshold for rebate under 87a available to resident taxpayers has been increased from inr 7 lakhs to inr 12 lakhs. The government has enhanced timelines for filing updated returns by two more years by paying additional taxes of 60 and 70 percent respectively.

'Budget's given comfort to monetary authority': Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budgets-given-comfort-to-monetary-authority-finance-secretary-tuhin-kanta-pandey/articleshow/117995724.cms,"In an interview to TOI,

Pandey, who is also in charge of the revenue department, said

Do you think the Budget has done enough to help accelerate growth against the backdrop of global uncertainties?

Is the time right for

monetary authorities to play a part in accelerating growth, for example with a rate cut?

So, has the Budget created conditions for a rate cut?

Is the tax relief largely to boost consumption and address some of the concerns of the middle class?

Have other levers of economy got required attention, apart from consumption and investment?

When do you expect I-T bill to be presented in Parliament? How will it make life of the taxpayer simple?

Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the 2025-26 Budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation .the Budget has enabled all levers of growth to accelerate. Excepts:It is a pro-growth Budget. We have headwinds and we also have internal challenges. We have addressed both. Although, we are still the fastest growing large economy in the world, not only we have to maintain this growth, but we have to push it up. We have addressed both the supply-side and demand-side and tried in a non inflationary way to maximise growth, accelerate growth.I think it's up to the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to take a call on that. But, on the fiscal side, we have done our bit. We have kept the promise of fiscal consolidation. FM had announced that it will be 4.9% in this year and we have been able to achieve 4.8%. FM had said fiscal consolidation path will mean we'll bring it to 4.5% next year. We are proposing 4.4% and there was also an announcement that thereafter we will have a glide path in terms of the debt-to-GDP level and a visibility would be given on how it will go forward. That has also been included in the FRBM statement.In a way, the Budget has provided whatever stimulations are required. We are not providing a stimulus at the cost of the deficit by increasing the deficit. So, we are giving sufficient sort of comfort to the monetary authority. However, they would have to take a call based on whatever.I would say consumption is one part. However, we are not really prescribing how taxpayers, who have got this money back in a way, how they will behave. Basically, the decision making is transferred to taxpayers, who have got this relief. They may choose to consume, save or invest directly in either of the three situations we have. It will have a salutary and good effect on the economy because if they choose to consume, it will boost demand. If they choose to invest indirectly, they are supporting the banks to extend more credit. Because, banks can give credit only when they have got increased deposits. And, if they choose to directly invest, for example in a house, they also participate in investments. In that case, it will work like an investment multiplier anyway. So, it will be a combination of consumption and investment multiplier, with a positive impact on savings. Overall, I would say it will be a growth-booster.A large economy like India has to have all engines firing. You cannot simply say we will only go for agriculture, not for manufacturing. Or, we will go for manufacturing and not for services. Therefore all three are required. If you see all the proposals on supply side, we have tried to see how we can speed up production, how we can speed up productivity and how we can spur employment. So, it is employment-led growth. In agriculture, we have taken steps to boost pulses productivity and increase credit limit for farmers. Everywhere we have said how we can boost production and productivity. We are saying let there be a growth path for MSMEs. Let there be more credit available for MSMEs. Let their participation in exports be more. Let there be more support for them in terms of innovation and research. Our tax policy is supporting labour intensive sectors.It is proposed to be done before Feb 13. We are not changing the policy through it. The same thing will be carried forward because after passing, this bill will be applicable from a future date. We wanted to reform right away. So, those reforms have been brought in this bill through amendments. There are so many redundant provisions. There are a number of changes. More than 4,000 changes have happened since 1962, when this act was enacted. In 63 years, the finance sector changed, plus there were many taxation laws and amendment bills. Things get complicated to read and they may also create interpretation problems. There could be many interpretation problems or litigations. If you have more readability, if you have clarity, there will be less litigation.","Finance secretary tuhin kanta pandey said the 2025-26 budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation. The budget has enabled all levers of growth to accelerate, he said.

Latest Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 after Budget 2025: The income tax slabs and income tax rates under the new tax regime have been revised for FY 2025-26. The revised income tax slabs were announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in her Union Budget 2025 speech. The most important takeaway from the new income tax rules for the upcoming financial year is that individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh will have to pay ZERO tax. For salaried individuals, once the standard deduction of Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime is counted, this income level goes up to Rs 12.75 lakh.Additionally, across the board income tax slab changes mean that individuals under the new tax regime, will now have to pay lower taxes, even at income levels above Rs 12 lakh. There is also the concept of marginal relief, which allows individuals earning just above Rs 12 lakh to not pay taxes more than their additional income.The total tax benefit of slab rate changes and rebate at different income levels can be illustrated with examples:Confused about the new income tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime?

Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.Yes, the limit of total income for NIL tax payments in the new tax regime has been increased to Rs. 12 lakhs in this budget provided the taxpayer files ITR to avail the rebate.Earlier the limit of income for nil tax payment was Rs 7 lakh.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/latest-income-tax-slabs-2025-26-how-much-tax-do-individuals-earning-slightly-above-rs-12-lakh-have-to-pay-marginal-relief-calculations-explained/articleshow/117911656.cms,"Budget 2025 income tax: The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs. 12,75,000/-.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

GST reforms on the cards?

More tax relief coming soon? The Narendra Modi government , having provided substantial relief in personal income tax and customs tariff rationalisation in the Union Budget 2025 , is now expected to initiate efforts to streamline the goods and services tax (GST) framework for easier implementation and adherence, according to officials.The primary objective will be to restructure the tax slabs to ensure meaningful outcomes, they indicated.The GST structure comprises four slabs-5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, with special rates for certain items like precious metals and additional cess on sin goods.The 5% slab currently covers 21% of GST items, whilst 12% applies to 19%, 18% to 44%, and 28% to 3% of items.According to an ET report, the government intends to discuss simplification and rationalisation with the group of ministers (GoM) tasked with reviewing rates, according to a source close to the discussions.The source noted that whilst the GoM has primarily concentrated on slab adjustments for goods, a comprehensive simplification requires fundamental restructuring of the current system.The GST Council established the GoM for rate rationalisation in September 2021. Despite numerous meetings, the GoM has not yet presented its final recommendations.Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The GoM is considering proposals including elimination of dual rates for items like pens and sunglasses based on price thresholds.

But did you know that for salaried individuals, the tax-free annual income can reach Rs 13.7 lakh, compared to Rs 12 lakh for others!“I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000,” FM Sitharaman announced in her Union Budget speech.This advantage of no tax till Rs 13.7 lakh income stems from the Rs 75,000 standard deduction and National Pension System (NPS) investments. Section 80CCD(2) allows tax deduction of up to 14% of basic salary invested in NPS, whilst the old tax regime offers 10%.According to an ET analysis, a salaried individual with Rs 13.7 lakh yearly income can achieve tax savings of approximately Rs 96,000 through NPS contributions.

As a common man of India, I would like to compliment and thank Hon’ble Finance Minister (FM) for being considerate towards the middle class and salaried taxpayers who generally feel neglected. The projected fiscal deficit of 4.4% for the next year (as against revised fiscal deficit of 4.8% for the current year) reflects a well thought through approach. The 2025 budget presented by the FM strikes a perfect balance between maintaining fiscal responsibility and managing taxpayers’ expectations.To begin with, the FM is keen to sunset the Old Personal Tax Regime (OPTR) as all the tax benefits are now proposed under New Personal Tax Regime (NPTR). With the proposed changes, NPTR will now become far more appealing for individuals as it would mean availing beneficial tax rates and no tax declaration or providing/ maintaining tax deduction and exemption proofs. Just to share perspective, last year only 28% of taxpayers opted for OPTR which will substantially decline in coming years as OPTR will only be beneficial if you are in the 30% tax bracket with over INR 8 lakh of eligible deductions and exemptions.Even the slab rates are easy to remember, slab changes with every block of 4 lakh and corresponding tax rates changes 5% up to six blocks with highest slab being 30 percent. Salaried individuals with a gross salary of up to INR 12.75 lakh will have zero tax under NPTR. To illustrate further, an individual earning income of, say, INR 24 lakh per annum, who had previously opted for NPTR will now enjoy a tax saving of INR 114,400 and much more compared to OPTR.Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The FM has taken conscious effort to bring down administrative burden and tried to rationalize on various aspects like penalty will be in abeyance till the final order is passed by the tax department. Now taxpayers have an opportunity to file an Updated Income Tax Return (UITR) with applicable penalty slabs based on the period of delay, up to four years in case they have missed reporting any income. By extending the option of filing UITR, Government is further encouraging such suo-moto filings, thereby enhancing its revenue streams, and providing an opportunity for taxpayers to be compliant.Further, the FM has proposed increasing TDS threshold on interest paid to senior citizens from INR 50,000 to INR 100,000, benefiting those who rely on traditional savings like term deposits and post office schemes by allowing them to retain more interest income. Additionally, TDS on dividends will now apply only if the amount exceeds INR 10,000, resulting in higher disposable income for active investors and more opportunities for reinvestment.In 2020, the Government introduced foreign remittance tracking mechanism by levying Tax Collection at Source (TCS) under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). While foreign remittances up to USD 250,000 per annum is permitted under the LRS, currently, TCS is applied on remittances above INR 7 lakh.

For families who are supporting their children to pursue higher education overseas by borrowing from banks, the current TCS requirement of 0.5% on remittances exceeding INR 7 lakh adds to their financial strain.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven’t paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can “break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle” or “gain access by overriding the access code” to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates “authorised officers” as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints. As this provision takes effect, it raises questions about privacy and the balance between tax enforcement and individual rights.","Income tax bill 2025 will give income tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces.
