"Draft NEP 2026 proposes indexed power tariffs, curbs cross-subsidies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/draft-nep-2026-proposes-indexed-power-tariffs-curbs-cross-subsidies/articleshow/126954708.cms,"'Stanford Ranks Us Third': Ashwini Vaishnaw Fires Back At IMF For Callinf India Second Tier In AI

New Delhi: The ministry of power on Wednesday released the draft National Electricity Policy (NEP) 2026, proposing automatic annual tariff revisions linked to a suitable index if state regulators fail to issue tariff orders, exemption of cross-subsidies for the manufacturing sector and railways, renewable energy capacity addition through market-based mechanisms and captive power plants, and a strong regulatory framework to prevent collusion, gaming and market dominance.Inviting stakeholder feedback, the ministry said the proposed policy aims to transform the power sector in line with the government’s vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047. Once finalised, the policy will replace the existing NEP notified in 2005.According to the ministry, the first National Electricity Policy, issued in February 2005, addressed core challenges such as demand-supply gaps, limited electricity access and inadequate infrastructure. Since then, the sector has seen transformational change, with installed generation capacity rising fourfold alongside significant private sector participation. Universal electrification was achieved by March 2021, a unified national grid became operational in December 2013, and per capita electricity consumption rose to 1,460 kWh in 2024–25. Power markets and exchanges have also enhanced flexibility and efficiency in power procurement, the ministry said.“Despite these achievements, persistent challenges remain, particularly in the distribution segment, including high accumulated losses and outstanding debt. Tariffs in several segments remain non-cost-reflective, and high cross-subsidisation has resulted in elevated industrial tariffs, adversely impacting the global competitiveness of Indian industry,” the ministry said in a statement.The draft NEP 2026 sets ambitious targets, aiming to raise per capita electricity consumption to 2,000 kWh by 2030 and over 4,000 kWh by 2047. It also aligns with India’s climate commitments, including a 45% reduction in emissions intensity from 2005 levels by 2030 and the goal of net-zero emissions by 2070, necessitating a decisive shift towards low-carbon energy pathways.The policy proposes a comprehensive overhaul of planning and finances. Distribution companies (DISCOMs) and State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) will prepare advance Resource Adequacy plans at utility and state levels, while the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) will draw up a national plan to ensure capacity adequacy. On the financial front, tariffs are proposed to be indexed for automatic annual revision, with greater recovery of fixed costs through demand charges to reduce cross-subsidies across consumer categories. Manufacturing units, railways and metro railways may be exempted from cross-subsidies and surcharges to boost competitiveness and lower logistics costs, while consumers with contracted loads of 1 MW and above could be exempted from the universal service obligation. The policy also calls for stronger dispute resolution mechanisms, tighter market monitoring, measures to bring AT&C losses down to single digits, shared distribution networks, creation of a Distribution System Operator, and improved grid operations through functional unbundling of state utilities and alignment of state grid codes with national standards.On generation and infrastructure, the policy emphasises rapid expansion of renewable energy through market-based routes, captive plants and large-scale deployment of storage. DISCOMs may install storage for small consumers to achieve economies of scale, while bulk consumers install their own, with provisions for peer-to-peer trading of surplus power and storage. Renewable and conventional power are to be treated at par in scheduling and deviations by 2030. The roadmap also supports market-based deployment of battery and pumped storage, domestic manufacturing of storage components and incentives such as viability gap funding. Thermal plants will be supported through storage integration and repurposing of older units for grid support, with exploration of direct steam utilisation for district cooling and industrial processes. Nuclear generation will focus on advanced and modular reactors, including small reactors for commercial and industrial use, to reach 100 GW by 2047, while hydro development will prioritise storage-based projects for flood control, irrigation and energy security. Transmission reforms include adoption of advanced technologies, compensation to address right-of-way issues, parity in transmission tariffs for renewables by 2030, and utilisation-based allocation of connectivity. The policy also mandates a robust cybersecurity framework, domestic storage of power sector data, structured data sharing with real-time visibility of distributed energy resources, and a transition to indigenously developed SCADA systems and domestic software for critical applications by 2030.","The draft nep 2026 sets ambitious targets, aiming to raise per capita electricity consumption to 2,000 kwh by 2030.

Budget 2026 for taxpayers: Five fixes that can make taxes less taxing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-for-taxpayers-five-fixes-that-can-make-taxes-less-taxing-explained/articleshow/126666769.cms,"The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe.

By Nishant Khemani

One return, one choice

Cut the sting in foreign remittance TCS

NPS withdrawals: clarity needed on taxability

Level the NPS field under the new regime

Time for

joint tax returns

(Nishant Khemani is a chartered accountant and Managing Partner of the Saturn Consulting Group)

Every Union Budget comes with its share of grand announcements, but for ordinary taxpayers, the real test lies in the fine print. As Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are modest yet meaningful: simplify compliance, nudge long-term savings, and stop treating convenience as a luxury. Here are five changes that could make the tax system smarter, softer and more sensible.The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe. Form 10-IE, required to opt in or out of the new regime, is a classic case of procedural overkill. Many taxpayers either forget to file it or file it incorrectly, losing out on the more beneficial regime. The fix is simple: embed the option directly into the ITR. A single return, a clear choice, no extra forms. Ease of doing business should also mean ease of filing taxes, especially for salaried individuals who neither game the system nor enjoy paperwork.A 20% TCS on foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme was introduced to plug tax leakages. The intent is understandable, but the dosage is excessive.For genuine remittances for family support the high TCS blocks liquidity and creates avoidable stress. A more balanced approach would be to reduce TCS to 10%, or introduce a slab system: lower rates up to, say, ₹50 lakh, and higher rates thereafter. Compliance should be encouraged, not coerced.Recent changes to NPS withdrawal rules are a welcome step. Subscribers can now withdraw up to 100% of the corpus if it is within ₹8 lakh, and 80% if it exceeds that limit. This adds flexibility and makes NPS more attractive.But there’s a catch—or rather, a question mark. Till now, only 60% of the corpus was tax-free on maturity. How will the additional 20% be taxed? The Budget should clarify this and remove the ambiguity. Ideally, the extra withdrawal should also be tax-free, reinforcing NPS as a credible retirement pillar rather than a tax puzzle.Under the new tax regime, deductions are scarce, making Section 80CCD(2), the employer contribution to NPS, a rare oasis. However, the additional ₹50,000 deduction under Section 80CCD(1b) is still unavailable in the new regime. Extending this deduction, and enhancing it to ₹1 lakh under the new regime, would send a strong signal. Global evidence is clear: tax incentives drive long-term savings. A stronger NPS today means lower old-age dependency and reduced fiscal pressure tomorrow.India’s tax system still treats married couples as financial strangers. Introducing joint tax returns, with a higher exemption threshold for married couples, would recognise modern household economics—especially double-income families. Such a move would put more disposable income in the hands of families, improve tax equity and align India with global best practices. After all, if households plan together, why shouldn’t they file together?In sum, Budget 2026 doesn’t need fireworks. It needs fine-tuning. Fewer forms, fairer taxes, clearer rules, and smarter incentives could go a long way in making taxation less intimidating—and more humane.","The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers.

Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Finance Minister will present Union Budget 2026 in the backdrop of uncertain geopolitical dynamics, volatile capital markets, diverse regulatory reforms (e.g. new income tax act, labour codes etc.), fluctuating oil prices as well as INR-USD exchange rate and other uncertainties. However, the one thing certain is that the individual taxpayer will be brimming with expectations of a promise of more net disposable income in their hands on a warm Sunday afternoon of 1 February 2026.However, as India prepares to implement the new Income-tax Act from 1 April 2026, expectations of major tax changes may need to be calibrated. Potentially it may be possible that the Budget may focus on micro, practical changes and administrative improvements, such as faster refunds, simpler compliance etc. to improve taxpayer experience and ensure a smooth transition to the new law.One of the most frequently raised expectations is enhancement of the standard deduction, which currently stands at Rs 50,000 under the old tax regime and Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime.With inflation continuing to raise living costs, the salaried taxpayers are hopeful that the deduction limit will be increased to at least Rs 1 lakh. A higher deduction would provide relief to taxpayers at a time when rising living costs are placing increased pressure on the household finances.Also Read | Budget 2026 income tax: Will GST-style fewer tax slabs be brought under new income tax regime? Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly seen as the future of mobility, and in line with their broader ESG commitments, many employers are now encouraging employees to opt for an EV under their company car lease policies. However, the current perquisite valuation rules continue to rely solely on the cubic capacity of the car, an approach that does not account for the distinct nature of EVs, which do not have an engine in the conventional sense.Hence, it may be practical for the government to introduce a separate valuation mechanism specifically for EVs to ensure a suitable tax treatment and to further promote their adoption.Home loan borrowers have long relied on interest related tax deductions to reduce their repayment burden. However, under the new tax regime, individuals cannot offset housing loan interest against salary income, even in the case of a self‑occupied property.With housing prices continuing to rise and the government’s broader aim of promoting home ownership at affordable rates, there is an expectation that the government may in the upcoming budget allow such interest deduction at least on self-occupied property under the new tax regime. This would provide relief to mid‑income taxpayers families and help build further confidence of taxpayers in the new tax regime.Also Read | Budget 2026: Why standard deduction should be hiked under the new income tax regime - explained Under current provisions, taxpayers can file a revised or belated return for a financial year only up to 31 December following the end of that year. However, this timeline often poses challenges, particularly for individual taxpayers with cross-border income or investments, as tax filings in their home or host countries may not be finalized by then. This mismatch can result in unintentional under-reporting or over-reporting of income in India. For instance, a US citizen who becomes an ordinarily resident in India may be required to report global income for parts of two calendar years in a single Indian tax return, even though overseas tax filings are completed later. Given these practical difficulties, extending the deadline for filing revised or belated returns would provide much-needed relief and help ensure accurate reporting.As the government prepares for the landmark shift to the new Income-tax Act in April 2026, the Union Budget presents an opportunity to address a few long‑standing demands of individual taxpayers. While sweeping changes may be unlikely in a year of transition, targeted reforms whether through higher deductions or more flexible timelines could significantly improve the taxpayer experience. Ultimately, the hope is that the Budget will strike the right balance between fiscal prudence and the genuine needs of India’s growing salaried class.","As india prepares to implement the new income-tax act from 1 april 2026, expectations of major tax changes may need to be calibrated.

Top 5 Benefits of Fewer Income Tax Slabs

Will Budget 2026 Bring Fewer Income Tax Slabs?

Taxpayers in India are looking at Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s speech for announcements related to simplification of income tax slabs, returns, compliance and more. India has two personal tax regimes: old and new, with the latter being the default tax regime that the government is pushing people to adopt.The old income tax regime has fewer tax slabs, and offers more deductions and exemptions. On the other hand, the new income tax regime has the benefit of lower tax rates, higher levels of income at which higher tax rates kick in, but very few deductions and exemptions.Tax experts believe that while the new income tax regime reduces the tax outgo for many taxpayers, the multiple slabs add to confusion. They recommend an approach similar to the one used for GST rates rationalization to make the personal tax regime more friendly for taxpayers.Last year, the government slashed the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on several commodities and reduced the tax slabs to broadly two categories - 5% and 18%. Will something similar be announced for the new income tax regime this Budget?The new income tax regime was introduced in Union Budget 2020 and has since then evolved with lower tax rates, progressive tax slabs and higher rebates. Last year, FM Nirmala Sitharaman made income up to Rs 12 lakh tax free - a limit that goes up to Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers with the inclusion of standard deduction benefits.At present the new income tax regime has as many as seven tax slabs - a fact that makes it somewhat confusing for taxpayers. The new tax regime has multiple slabs starting with a nil rate and then moving through 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% across different income levels.The old income tax regime continues, largely unchanged for the last few years, as the government looks to step up adoption of the new income tax regime. Tax experts widely believe that any changes to the tax regime will now be made under the new income tax regime. But, is there a case to reduce the number of income tax slabs?Tax experts surveyed by Times of India Online are broadly of the view that there is a need for more simplification of the income tax slabs and rates, for a more streamlined and compliance friendly regime. While experts acknowledge that an immediate change in tax slabs may not be possible, given limited fiscal room after last year’s big changes and GST rate cuts, they suggest a progressive move towards a simplified personal tax regime.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India explains that two major changes in the recent past, which include the alignment of the GST structure and revamp of the Income-tax Act, show the government’s clear intention to simplify India’s tax framework.Along with the reforms in GST, the introduction of the Income-tax Act 2025 also reflects this commitment to creating a cleaner and more streamlined regime, as it reduces the number of sections from 819 to 536 and cuts the word count nearly by half, from 5.12 lakh to 2.60 lakh, Surabhi Marwah tells TOI.“Extending this philosophy to personal income tax, rationalising the slab structures into fewer and broader slabs would enhance clarity, reduce litigation, and make compliance easier for taxpayers,” she recommends.Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte India feels that there is a strong case for simplifying personal income tax slabs, given the complex multi-rate structure and rising compliance challenges.Why the need? Viswanathan explains that a streamlined 2-3 slab structure, potentially with a single regime and bigger gaps in slabs and rates, could enhance compliance, reduce litigation, and mirror GST's success.Some tax experts cite global benchmarks and examples to advocate for an income tax regime with fewer tax slabs. Others point to multiple slab tax structures in developed countries.Preeti Sharma, Partner – Tax and Regulatory Services at BDO India notes that while the current income tax slabs structure is progressive, many taxpayers still find it complex.“In many countries, personal income tax systems follow a simpler structure with just three or four slabs such as Denmark, Netherlands. India could gradually move in that direction as well. The experience of GST is often cited in this context, where multiple indirect taxes were replaced with a limited number of tax slabs to simplify the system,” she tells TOI.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax at KPMG in India says that simplification of tax regime has been the stated intent of the government when they had first introduced the new optional tax regime almost five years back.“However, considering various other factors (e.g. inflation, job creation, fiscal deficit etc.) this transition may take time. Further for a country like India – the varied income distribution does make a case for multiple slab structures. Also, internationally many developed countries (e.g., US, UK, Germany etc.) have a multiple slab rate structure,” she says.Chander Talreja, Partner at Vialto Partners believes that the 2-3 slab structure for the new tax regime may not be introduced as it already provides simplified tax slabs. “There are 7 income levels with clearly defined applicable tax rates. The rationale of the said slab rates is to ensure lower tax burden for the individual taxpayers unlike the old regime wherein it is just 4 slabs,” he tells TOI.“For example – the effective tax rate applicable for income falling in tax slab Rs 12-16 lakh under the new tax regime is 15% whereas it is 30% under the old regime. Similarly, the effective tax rate applicable for income of Rs 9 lakh under new tax regime is NIL whereas it is 20% under the old regime,” he explains.Tax experts who spoke to Times of India Online were unanimous in saying that the government does not have immediate room to reduce the number, though the road ahead should be in that direction?Radhika Viswanathan of Deloitte India says that to achieve a 2-3 tax slab structure, the market has to be much more mature. “There has to be a bit of parity between the tax collections at the government level and good purchasing power in the hands of the individuals. Given the tweaking done in last year’s budget, such a simplification might be on the cards, but perhaps not immediately,” she says.Richa Sawhney, Partner, Tax at Grant Thornton Bharat admits that the introduction of 2-3 slab structure for personal income tax will surely simplify the personal taxation regime and make tax calculations easier. “It also aligns with the government policy of simplification of taxation laws and easing compliance,” she tells TOI.But Richa Sawhney is of the view that doing that in the immediate future may not be feasible for the government.“With changes in the direct tax provisions last year, which included the changes in slab rates, the government had anticipated a revenue forgone figure of Rs 1 lakh crore. The latest data on revenue shared by the government shows a near‑flat gross non‑corporate tax collection. So significant change may not be forthcoming in this year’s budget,” she tells TOI.Some tax experts suggest that the government may look to eventually transition to a personal income tax regime that has fewer slabs.“The recent budgets have focused on adjusting rates and income thresholds rather than making structural changes. As a result, a full move to a 2–3 slab personal income tax system may not happen immediately, but the government may gradually reduce the tax slabs over a period of time,” Preeti Sharma of BDO says.Tanu Gupta, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP points out that in an exemption-light regime, it is particularly important to maintain progressivity in tax incidence, especially in the Indian context where equity and ability-to-pay considerations are central to tax policy.At the same time, a simplified slab structure—such as a two- or three-slab framework—can significantly improve transparency, ease of understanding, and voluntary compliance, much like the government’s approach in streamlining the GST rate structure recently, she tells TOI.“Accordingly, the government must strike the right balance between simplicity and fairness by combining a streamlined slab structure with a rate design that remains equitable and just. In doing so, it is essential to ensure that taxpayers are not placed in an adverse position, such as paying higher tax on the same income level compared to the previous year,” she concludes.","Tax experts believe that while the new income tax regime reduces the tax outgo for many taxpayers, the multiple slabs add to confusion.

Budget 2026 is drawing closer and the real estate sector is seeking policy continuity, targeted fiscal measures and long-pending reforms to keep the sector on track.Acording to industry leaders, the updoming Budget can help strengthen confidence across residential, commercial and mixed-use projects by addressing housing affordability, infrastructure-led urban growth, access to capital and faster regulatory approvals, ET reported.Robin Mangla, President of M3M India, placed real estate as a stable, long-term investment, despite ongoing global and domestic uncertainty. He further highlighted the need for a predictable policy framework, particularly for premium housing and mixed-use projects. The expert also expected tax rationalisation for homebuyers, easier access to long-term institutional funding and faster approvals through single-window clearances.Sidharth Chowdhry, MD at Dalcore also expected policy continuity and selective fiscal support to sustain demand across premium and luxury housing markets such as Gurugram. He explained that rationalised stamp duty and better tax benefits on home loan interest could boost buyer sentiment. Low-cost, long-term financing, at the same time, would help developers deliver quality projects.Meanwhile, coming to the mid-income housing, Manoj Gaur, CMD of Gaurs Group, expects the Budget to focus on infrastructure spending and a supportive interest rate environment.He expected widening the scope of EWS and PMAY, restore Section 80EEA benefits for first-time buyers, grant industry status to real estate and introduce a single-window clearance system.Dr Gautam Kanodia, founder of KREEVA and Kanodia Group, emphasised the need for sustained infrastructure, investment in NCR, along with supportive liquidity conditions, could drive the next phase of growth.Infrastructure spending remains central to expectations across allied industries. Rajan Luthra, CFO of ACE-Action Construction Equipment Ltd, says public capex continues to support economic activity and could revive demand for construction equipment. He pointed to private capex, exports, defence and large infrastructure projects such as airports, railways and freight corridors as key demand drivers. Luthra adds that GST rationalisation, lower interest rates and better liquidity could further boost investment and execution.Mohit Goel, managing director of Omaxe Ltd, said that the focus should remain on long-term clarity rather than short-term stimulus. He said that there is strong potential in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, supported by urban infrastructure, better connectivity and housing-linked development. Policies that support public-private partnerships, streamline approvals and strengthen buyer confidence, he says, can help align private capital with development goals.From an investment perspective, Binitha Dalal, founder and managing partner at Mt. K Kapital, highlights the importance of fiscal discipline and measures that improve resilience to global shocks. For real estate, she points to the need for housing affordability, GST rationalisation for construction and redevelopment, clearer REIT norms and support for alternative capital pools. She also expects stronger incentives for green buildings and sustainable construction.Amrita Gupta, director at Manglam Group, also stressed to focus on affordability and sustainability, particularly in cities such as Jaipur where demand is largely end-user driven, as cited by ET. She said that a stable interest rate environment, incentives for green construction and clearer redevelopment policies can support long-term housing demand.Looking beyond traditional housing, Aditya Kushwaha, CEO and director of Axis Ecorp, said that there is growing interest in holiday homes, especially in destinations like Goa. He expected infrastructure development, tourism growth and easier ownership norms to encourage greater NRI participation.Overall, industry expectations from Budget 2026 are modest. Rather than big-ticket announcements, the sector is looking for stability, smoother execution and long-term clarity. With continued infrastructure spending, targeted fiscal support, better access to capital and a focus on quality and sustainability, industry leaders believe real estate can continue to support jobs, urban growth and economic development.","Budget 2026 is drawing closer and the real estate sector is seeking policy continuity, targeted fiscal measures and long-pending reforms to keep the sector on track.

TCS in a world of remittances abroad and big spends

Challenges for taxpayers

The balance required

In daily life, most people focus on how much tax they pay, but rarely on when and how it is collected. An increasingly visible part of India's tax ecosystem is tax collected at source (TCS), which requires a portion of tax to be collected upfront on certain transactions. For many taxpayers, the timing of this collection now matters as much as the final tax amount.TCS has existed for nearly four decades, evolving from a narrow anti-evasion measure into a tool for real time tax monitoring. Initially limited to high-risk sectors such as liquor, timber, tendu leaves, scrap and forest produce, it required a small tax collection at the point of sale to create a transaction trail. As the economy expanded and digital reporting improved, TCS was extended to high value purchases such as motor vehicles above Rs 10 lakh and later to foreign remittances and overseas tour packages, bringing everyday taxpayers into its ambit.To widen and deepen the tax net, the scope of TCS was extended in 2020 to include foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS).Individuals usually remit money abroad for education, medical treatment, overseas tours and other purposes such as gifts, donations, etc. TCS on LRS was introduced not as an additional tax but as an advance collection mechanism, adjustable against final tax liability.The Finance Act, 2025 responded to rising education and travel costs by raising the TCS threshold on LRS remittances from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per financial year and removing TCS on loan-funded overseas education. For self-funded education remittances above Rs 10 lakh, TCS now applies at 5%, reinforcing the intent to avoid burdening genuine education expenses.From April 22, 2025, TCS was also extended to select luxury goods such as watches, yachts, sunglasses, shoes and sportswear, reflecting higher spending in this segment. TCS at 1% applies only where the value of a single item exceeds Rs 10 lakh. Thus, a wristwatch priced at Rs 12 lakh attracts TCS, while two watches costing Rs 6 lakh each do not. The tax is collected at the point of sale and can be claimed as credit while filing the income tax return, enabling tracking of high value purchases without denying tax credit.A key concern with TCS is that even individuals with little or no final tax liability must pay it upfront and wait to claim a refund, resulting in blocked funds and cash flow strain.To address this for salaried taxpayers, changes effective Oct 1, 2024 allow TCS paid to be reported to employers through Form 12BAA, enabling adjustment against monthly tax deductions and easing cash flow pressure. Accurate disclosure of the amount, date and purpose of TCS is essential for this mechanism to work.While this relief benefits salary income earners, taxpayers earning non-salary income must still adjust TCS against advance tax or claim refunds at year end. For example, Kaushal, a self-employed consultant, remits Rs 75 lakh abroad under LRS for his child's education. The TCS collected cannot be adjusted immediately, forcing him to wait until return filing to recover a substantial sum.There are ways to improve this experience without compromising the system's intent. Faster refunds and better digital integration between TCS and TDS could ease cash flow pressures. TCS has strengthened India's tax reporting framework and with thoughtful fine-tuning, it can continue to meet its objectives while remaining responsive to taxpayers' needs. A balanced tax system works best when it ensures both transparency and convenience.(Karmakar is tax partner, EY India; Rajesh Sureshan, director at EY India, also contributed to the article.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

What is the Union Budget?



Importance



Process of Union Budget



Rituals and traditions



India, one of the world's top five economies, is set to present its Union Budget in Parliament on February 1 under the PM Modi–led government for the 15th time, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presenting it as mandated under Constitution's Article 112.However, February 1 was not always the date for presenting the Union Budget. For decades, it was traditionally presented on February 28. This long-standing ritual was amended in 2017, when the annual Union budget was presented on February 1, from then onwards it was fixed as the official date for its presentation.February 1 will mark the second full annual budget of the Modi 3.0 government. For Sitharaman, it will be her ninth consecutive Budget, making her second only to former finance minister Morarji Desai, who had also briefly served as prime minister.The Union Budget records the government’s accounts and financial transactions for a year, known as the “fiscal year” - a 12-month period used by governments and businesses for financial reporting. In India, the fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31. The Budget lays out the government’s financial blueprint and is prepared by the finance ministry.The Lok Sabha enjoys the privilege of the passage of the Union Budget, as the Constitution gives the directly elected members of the Lower House the first right to its presentation and decisive authority over money matters and Money Bills.The Budget documents are later laid before the Rajya Sabha for discussion. However, the Rajya Sabha does not have the power to vote on or amend Money Bills, including the Budget; it can only discuss them and make recommendations.The meaning of the Union Budget is defined in Article 112 of the Constitution, which states that the President allows the government’s “estimated receipts and expenditure” for the year. This is referred to as the “annual financial statement.”Broadly, the Union Budget is divided into two parts: the Revenue Budget and the Capital Budget.The Revenue Budget shows how much money the government earns and how much it spends. The money earned is called revenue receipts and comes from two sources, tax and non-tax income. Revenue expenditure is the money spent on the daily running of the government and on services for people. If the government spends more than it earns, it is called a revenue deficit.The Capital Budget refers to government’s money received and money spent on long-term purposes. Capital receipts mainly include loans taken from the public, foreign governments, and the RBI. Capital expenditure is the money spent on building roads, machines, buildings, hospitals, schools, and other development work. When the government’s total spending is more than its total income, it is called a fiscal deficit.Union Budget is a key practice of government's functioning in India, an unskippable practice that takes place every year, exceptions are those general elections-bound year, when Union Budget's presentation gets divided in two -- pre-polls the finance minister passes ""Interim Budget"" and then the new government's finance minister passes final union budget. As it was last seen in 2024-2025 budget due to 18th Lok Sabha elections that was scheduled between April to June.The budget has serious implications for the economy. ITt lays out various financial goals that the government looks forward to achieving over a set period.Allocation of Resources - The preparation of the budget ensures the government's choice of how it allocates resources optimally to fulfil various goals and objectives.The very essence of the resources allocations ensures public welfare and economic progress.The budget shows which sectors the government plans to support. The finance ministry-led government's financial draft opens up on the restrictions or leniency for specific industry or sectors. It also serves as a signal for investors, who may choose to invest in industries receiving a government push. Overall, it reflects the direction in which the economy is headed.The budget also reflects on key issues such as direct and indirect taxes. Some of its provisions affect citizens directly in their day-to-day lives, while others have an indirect impact. The Union Budget helps people plan their finances better for the coming year.It decides income tax slabs and rates, along with deductions and the method used to calculate income tax.The entire Union Budget process begins with the President.President's constitutional role - Under Article 87, the President addresses in a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament -- the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha -- at the start of the first session after a general election and at the beginning of the first session every year. This address sets the tone for the government’s agenda.What the President's address says - The speech outlines the Union government’s policies, priorities, achievements, and plans for the year ahead. Although delivered by the President, it is prepared by the Union Cabinet.Motion of thanks - After the address, a “Motion of Thanks” is moved in both Houses. Members debate it and vote on it, formally acknowledging the President’s speech and the government’s roadmap.Where it takes place - With the new Parliament building, this joint sitting continues in the new chamber. The President's role is crucial, as the office stands at the constitutional apex of both the executive and the legislature. The President’s prior recommendation is required for Money Bills, including the Budget, making this step essential to its presentation.Dahi-cheeni (curd and sugar)- Under President Droupadi Murmu , the custom of dahi-cheeni has gained renewed prominence. Finance minister Sitharaman met the President at Rashtrapati Bhavan on several occasions before presenting the Union Budget, where President Murmu offers dahi-cheeni as a cultural symbol of good luck and blessings for a successful Budget presentation.The halwa ceremony - Before documents of budget are printed and officials enter the confidential “lock-in” time period, the finance minister participates in the halwa ceremony..The bahi-khata (ledger) - The colonial-era briefcase seems to be a part of history now, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the tradition of carrying Budget papers in a red, folded cloth called a bahi-khata.","India set to present its union budget in parliament on february 1 under the pm modi–led government.

MSMEs: focus on liquidity, costs and exports

Startups : Governance reforms and easier compliance

Broader policy context ahead of Budget Day

As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, industry bodies have flagged key expectations focused on easing pressure on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and strengthening the startup ecosystem amid funding constraints and regulatory challenges.With employment generation and entrepreneurship high on the policy agenda, stakeholders are looking for targeted measures that address cash-flow stress, compliance hurdles and long-term sustainability.The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) said MSME growth is crucial for driving jobs and exports, urging strict enforcement of payment timelines and faster GST and RoDTEP refunds to ease working capital stress.It also called for time-bound support for sectors hit by tariff shocks, including textiles, gems and jewellery, and seafood.To reduce operating costs, ASSOCHAM sought expanded incentives for distributed renewable energy adoption by MSMEs.The industry body also pitched for wider cash-flow–based lending through digital infrastructure and Account Aggregators, targeted credit enhancement for NBFCs lending to MSMEs to lower borrowing costs, and simplified customs procedures and improved logistics to promote cross-border e-commerce exports.The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said recent corporate governance challenges faced by some Indian startups underline the need for stronger oversight mechanisms.It recommended encouraging independent oversight, strengthening shareholder protection and promoting transparency to ensure ethical and responsible management focused on long-term success.To strengthen the policy ecosystem, CII suggested allowing startups to maintain accounts in non-INR currencies to support global expansion.It also called for easing compliance by reducing approvals, simplifying licences and permits, and making it easier to comply with labour and taxation laws.These expectations mirror concerns raised by founders across sectors. Startups continue to face limited access to credit, rigid compliance norms and taxation hurdles despite multiple government schemes.From a macro perspective, Punjab National Bank MD and CEO Ashok Chandra said MSMEs are likely to remain a key focus area in the Union Budget 2026, alongside rural infrastructure and capex-led growth, as per news agency ANI, noting that such priorities help infuse new entrepreneurs and attract capital.As Budget Day nears, industry bodies and entrepreneurs remain hopeful that targeted interventions for MSMEs and startups will help stabilise cash flows, reduce regulatory friction and support sustainable growth.","Union budget 2026 will focus on employment generation and entrepreneurship.

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

From Credit Expansion to Risk Sharing

Liquidity Is the Binding Constraint

Expanding the Tax Base by Valuing Compliance

Strengthening India’s Financial Framework

(Manish Shah is MD & CEO of Godrej Capital)

India’s financial system has crossed an important threshold. Access to credit is no longer the binding constraint it once was. Today, households and enterprises that want credit can largely obtain it. The more relevant question now is whether the terms of finance such as the cost, tenure, liquidity, and risk sharing are aligned with the kind of long-term growth India is aiming for.Capital is available, but decision-making has become more deliberate. Borrowers are not stepping back from finance, they are weighing certainty, affordability, and long-horizon comfort far more carefully than before.That is where Budget thinking for 2026 and beyond can play a catalyst for higher and more inclusive growth.The next phase is not about simply pushing more credit into the system. It is about reducing the friction and cost around long-term borrowing without weakening discipline. The most effective way to do that is through deepening the market.Well-designed guarantee and co-lending frameworks that are built on models like CGTMSE that allow risk to be distributed more efficiently between the government and lenders.When risk is shared intelligently, the cost of credit falls naturally. This creates space for longer tenures, smoother repayment structures, and greater borrower confidence, especially for MSMEs and first-time formal borrowers.Lower cost of credit, however, cannot be sustained without adequate liquidity. India’s financial system needs stronger, more stable domestic funding. Yet household savings have increasingly migrated toward equity, not always by choice, but because tax structures favour it. Fixed-income instruments, particularly fixed deposits, need renewed relevance in household portfolios.Alongside, targeted tax benefits for fixed-income savings can deepen liquidity, strengthen Current Account and Savings Account (CASA) growth, and lower system-wide funding costs. This is not about discouraging equity participation, but about restoring balance so asset allocation reflects suitability rather than tax distortion.A similar principle applies to household wealth locked in real estate.Real estate remains the single largest repository of personal wealth in India, yet capital mobility from property into financial assets remains constrained. Allowing proceeds from real estate sales to be deployed into financial instruments at lower capital gains tax rates would unlock liquidity already within the system. This would let households rebalance portfolios as their needs evolve, freeing capital for productive use rather than locking it in illiquid assets.As we unlock liquidity, we must also broaden the tax base - through encouragement, not only enforcement.Tax compliance improves when it is visibly valued. High-compliance taxpayers contribute disproportionately to fiscal capacity yet often feel least acknowledged. Combining compliance with tangible benefits such as dedicated service lines, straight through approvals wherever feasible, faster immigration or visa support, and premium government interfaces can restore the prestige of paying tax. The goal is simple: make formal and higher participation feel rewarding, not merely obligatory, and visibly recognize those who contribute most.Taken together, these ideas point to a common theme. India does not need a larger financial system. It needs a system where liquidity is deeper, risk is shared more effectively, capital moves more freely, and compliance is aspirational.Budgets that enable these shifts may not announce themselves loudly, but they shape economic behaviour in lasting ways.That is the kind of financial architecture India can benefit from in its next phase of growth.","Budget 2026: the next phase is not about simply pushing more credit into the system.

India faces potential tax shock as compensation cess ends,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-the-hidden-cost-of-gst-2-0-india-faces-potential-tax-shock-as-compensation-cess-ends/articleshow/126944988.cms,"Transition away from the compensation cess has exposed the unfinished edge of reform.

India’s indirect tax journey reached an important milestone in 2025. With the completion of GST 2.0, the full removal of the GST compensation cess, and Parliament’s approval of a new excise framework for demerit goods, the post-GST transition phase can now be said to be formally closed. From a structural standpoint, this is a success. The temporary scaffolding that once supported GST has been dismantled, and the system has demonstrated its capacity to generate stable revenues without extraordinary instruments.Indeed, the data is unambiguous. Even as GST rates were pruned on a wide set of mass-consumption items—moving several goods from higher slabs to lower ones—gross GST collections remained buoyant. Monthly collections in late 2025 consistently exceeded ₹1.7–1.9 lakh crore, posting positive year-on-year growth despite rate rationalisation. This outcome validates a central proposition of public finance: in economies with high informality, compliance elasticity often dominates rate elasticity. Simplification and predictability expand the effective base, allowing revenues to hold even when statutory rates fall.However, the transition away from the compensation cess has exposed the unfinished edge of reform—what might be called the “elephant’s tail” of GST 2.0. The notification of excise rates on demerit goods, particularly cigarettes, has triggered sharp reactions from multiple quarters, and not without reason.The first response has come from tobacco farmers in southern India, especially Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, who grow Flue-Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco used almost exclusively in the legal cigarette industry. These farmers argue—correctly—that they already operate under a disproportionately heavy tax burden. On a per-unit basis, tobacco used in cigarettes is taxed many multiples—often estimated at 30 to 50 times—higher than tobacco grown for bidis or chewing products, which dominate production in northern states. A sudden excise shock would hit FCV tobacco growers the hardest, as their regulated, auction-based crop is tied directly to the legal cigarette chain; with export demand already muted, any fall in domestic demand would push farmers and farm labour into severe distress.The second concern comes from small retailers. Cigarettes, uncomfortable as the category may be, form a high-value, sticky component of sales for millions of kirana stores, pavement sellers, and micro-retailers. These sellers operate on thin margins and limited working capital. A sharp tax-driven price increase risks pushing legal cigarettes beyond the reach of many consumers, redirecting demand toward cheaper illicit alternatives. When enforcement tightens, it is often the smallest retailer who becomes the visible face of the offence, even as organised smuggling networks remain insulated upstream. For the retailer, this is not a moral choice but a survival dilemma.Third, retail investors have reacted swiftly. Cigarette manufacturers and their long-term institutional investors—insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds—are traditionally regarded as stabilising anchors in volatile markets. Sudden uncertainty around excise policy has eroded market capitalisation, affecting not just corporate balance sheets but household wealth routed through financial intermediaries. The estimated erosion in market cap was about Rs. 80,000 crore for these entities as soon as the news unfolded. In an era marked by global geopolitical shocks, such as conflicts in the Middle East or financial tightening in advanced economies, these stocks often act as buffers. Policy-induced volatility in this segment therefore has wider financial implications.The fourth—and perhaps most analytically compelling—concern comes from industry bodies and researchers who track illicit trade. Organisations such as FICCI, which have studied smuggling for over a decade, consistently show a strong correlation between sharp tax hikes on cigarettes and the expansion of illicit markets. India’s own experience is instructive. Between 2012 and 2020, periods of repeated excise increases coincided with a rise in illicit cigarette share from around 17% to nearly 28% of total consumption. After 2021, when duty rates stabilised, the illicit share plateaued and marginally declined to about 26%. This is not coincidence; it is economics.Once illicit trade becomes embedded, it develops scale economies, logistics networks, and institutional corruption that make reversal extremely difficult. A comprehensive international study by Alvarez & Marsal, covering over 70 countries and more than 80% of global cigarette volumes, reaches a clear conclusion: enforcement alone cannot dismantle entrenched illicit markets if taxation and affordability pressures continue to push consumers out of the legal system.This is where economic theory provides clarity. Standard tax-incidence analysis shows that when demand is price-inelastic—as it is for addictive goods—tax shocks are largely passed through to prices. The Becker–Murphy model of rational addiction further explains that consumers adjust how they consume before deciding whether to consume. When legal prices rise beyond affordability thresholds, substitution occurs—not necessarily to cessation, but to cheaper, often illegal, alternatives. In trade theory, this creates arbitrage opportunities, especially in countries with porous borders and large informal retail networks. India fits this description all too well.The deeper concern, therefore, is not taxation per se, but its calibration. Parliament has already approved peak excise rates, providing the legal headroom the government needs. The critical decision now lies in how notified rates are set and sequenced. A sudden quantum jump risks creating a classic tax shock—one that raises revenues briefly but erodes the base over time as consumers and suppliers migrate to the parallel economy. The Laffer-curve intuition is relevant here: beyond a point, higher rates reduce effective collections.A more graded approach would have served better. Phasing adjustments over two to three years would allow farmers, retailers, firms, and consumers to adapt while preserving compliance. Crucially, it would align excise policy with the central lesson of GST 2.0: do not chase revenues through rate hikes; widen the base, reduce friction, and let formalisation do the work.India has shown rare fiscal maturity in 2025 by successfully concluding GST 2.0 and retiring the compensation cess—gains that now need to be protected. An abrupt excise shock on demerit goods risks reversing this progress by fuelling illicit trade, hurting livelihoods, unsettling markets and flattening revenues over time. Sound taxation is not about signalling toughness but about sustaining systems; applying the same moderation and predictability to excise policy that guided GST reform will strengthen India’s fiscal architecture and secure long-term stability over short-term revenue illusion.","Transition away from the compensation cess has exposed the unfinished edge of reform.

Budget 2026: As the Union Budget for the financial year 2026-2027 draws closer, Indian companies are expecting a GST like transformation in the customs duty framework to promote trade facilitation and simplify dispute resolution.Key demands include a rationalisation of customs duty rates, a reduction in the number of duty slabs, and the introduction of an effective single-window clearance system for imports and exports. Industry representatives are also seeking clearly defined timelines for granting Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) certification, along with a formal charter to govern investigations by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI).Dispute resolution has emerged as a major pain point. The industry wants the entire litigation process under customs to be digitised and a targeted mechanism introduced to release Rs 1.52 lakh crore in customs duty currently stuck in legal cases.Deloitte India Partner Gulzar Didwania told PTI that the existing system forces importers and exporters to approach multiple ministries and departments for clearances, making trade operations cumbersome.""That is becoming a big hindrance in doing trade. While I am ready to comply with all these things, but at least I should know that this is the department where I should go.""Didwania further added that under the Customs Act there is already a provision that empowers them to ""act as a single window for all these import-export related licensing requirements. We want this facility to be launched as soon as possible, so that it actually achieves the real, true spirit of single window clearance.""Another area of concern is the AEO scheme, where industry wants fixed timelines for certification. Importers, exporters and customs brokers with AEO status receive facilitation support from overseas customs authorities, which helps improve efficiency in global trade operations.Didwania also pointed out that while the government has issued operational guidelines for the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) under GST, a similar framework is expected for the DRI to bring clarity to its investigative processes.EY India Tax Partner Saurabh Agarwal said achieving the goal of a $5 trillion economy would require tax certainty and stronger support for manufacturing. He noted that dispute settlement initiatives such as the ""Sabka Vishwas"" and ""Vivad se Vishwas"" schemes helped clear backlogs under Central Excise, Service Tax and Income Tax, but no comparable scheme exists for customs disputes.""To effectively arrest spiralling litigation, it is imperative to introduce a Customs Dispute Resolution Scheme covering cases pending up to the Tribunal level.""Crucially, the architecture of this scheme must shift away from the ""complete settlement of a pending litigation"" approach to adopting an 'issue-wise' or 'year-wise' settlement mechanism. Such a pragmatic move would not only unlock stuck revenue but also foster a predictable tax environment essential for global investors,"" Agarwal said.Till March 2024, a total of 38,014 cases involving customs duty worth Rs 1.52 lakh crore remain tied up in litigation.KPMG Partner and National Head, Indirect Tax, Abhishek Jain said that against the backdrop of global uncertainty and tariff wars, industry expectations from the Budget 2026 include greater predictability and stronger policy support for Make-in-India. He said businesses are looking for rationalised customs duties on key raw materials, fewer duty slabs to reduce compliance issues, and a one-time window to clear legacy disputes.At present, customs duty follows an eight-slab structure, with industry pushing for a reduction to five or six slabs.Speedy closure of ""related-party valuation approvals for importers with maybe post-clearance risk-based audits instead of the current tedious process is seen as a practical step towards improving ease of doing business and supply-chain efficiency,"" Jain added.","Indian companies are expecting a gst like transformation in the customs duty framework to promote trade facilitation and simplify dispute resolution.

Latest Income Tax Slabs FY 2025–26 (Under New Income Tax Regime)

So, should the standard deduction limit be raised from Rs 75,000? Most tax experts surveyed by Times of India Online are of the view that a hike in standard deduction under the new income tax regime should be considered by the government.

Why Standard Deduction Should Be Hiked & Why It May Not Be

Standard deduction is seen as a much needed relief for taxpayers - it’s a simple, straightforward deduction from your gross income - a fixed amount that allows salaried taxpayers and pensioners to reduce their tax outgo in a financial year. With the Union Budget 2026 set to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, taxpayers are wondering if this relief will see a hike, especially in the new income tax regime.One important point to note is that the standard deduction limit varies depending on the tax regime that salaried taxpayers opt for: under the old income tax regime it has stayed at Rs 50,000 for several years, and under the new income tax regime it was hiked to Rs 75,000 in 2024. As the government pushes for the adoption of the new income tax regime, any major changes including those in standard deduction limits, are expected only in that regime.Over the last few years, several income tax slab and rate changes have been introduced in the new regime to make it more attractive for salaried individuals.Last year, FM Sitharaman made income up to Rs 12 lakh tax free (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers who get the benefit of Rs 75,000 standard deduction).As per government data, for FY 2023-24, 72% of taxpayers had opted for the new regime - a figure that will likely go up after last year’s tax relief under the new regime.The case for a hike in standard deduction limits is simple: the new income tax regime does not offer benefits of most deductions and exemptions that are available under the old income tax regime. Hiking this limit will push more people to opt to the clutter-free new income tax regime. Some experts also advocate linking standard deduction limits to inflation, hence ensuring that the limit is in line with the rising cost of living.Preeti Sharma, Partner – Tax and Regulatory Services at BDO India tells TOI, “Under the new tax regime, salaried taxpayers currently enjoy a standard deduction of Rs 75,000, raised from Rs 50,000 in Budget 2025. This increase has provided some relief, especially since most exemptions and deductions are not available under the new tax regime. However, rising inflation and higher day-to-day expenses have reduced the disposable income of salaried households. A further increase in the standard deduction would help employees manage these rising costs.”Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte India sees a case for standard deduction to be hiked to as much as Rs 1.25 lakh!“There is a strong case for further enhancing the standard deduction under the new tax regime since no other major deductions or exemptions are available to the salaried class. While the current limit stands at Rs 75,000, the government could consider increasing it to Rs 1 lakh to 1.25 lakh. An increase would provide meaningful relief, support middle-class taxpayers, and preserve the simplicity of the regime without reintroducing multiple deduction-linked compliances,” she tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners is of the view that the introduction of new labour codes may reduce take home pay, and an increase in standard deduction may help offset that.“This Budget will focus on how to further accelerate adoption of the new personal tax regime by the taxpayers. On the one hand, the scope for further rationalization of tax slabs or the introduction of reduced tax rates and additional rebates is limited, as these were revised last year only. On the other hand, introducing new deductions or exemptions under the new personal tax regime may not be feasible, given that the regime is designed to operate without such provisions, and any deviation could dilute its core objective,” he says.According to Talreja, this effectively leaves the government with one viable option - enhancement of the standard deduction. The existing limit is Rs 75,000 under the new personal tax regime which may be increased by at least Rs 15,000 to address rising cost-of-living pressures.“Moreover, the said increase in standard deduction may also be crucial with the introduction of the new Labour Codes. With the definition of “Wages” the contribution towards provident fund may go up which may consequently reduce the take-home pay for individuals. Some relief in the form of increased standard deduction may help to offset this impact,” he says.Tanu Gupta, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP also finds merit in increasing the standard deduction limit. “In last year’s Budget, the government revised the income tax slabs under the new tax regime and enhanced the rebate under Section 87A, effectively providing tax relief for income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers). The objective was to increase disposable income, thereby boosting consumption. This was further supplemented during the year by reductions in GST on several items,” she tells TOI.However, the standard deduction, which was increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 in Union Budget 2024 under the new tax regime, has since remained unchanged, she says.“There is merit in automatically adjusting this limit each year for inflation, in a manner similar to the government’s periodic revision of Dearness Allowance for its employees.Given the limited number of exemptions and deductions available under the new tax regime, such simplicity - combined with automatic inflation adjustment - would make the regime even more straightforward and taxpayer-friendly,” she adds.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax at KPMG in India is also of the view that since salaried taxpayers do not have any avenue to claim deduction for increased cost of living / other expenses (unlike a person earning business income) there is an ongoing expectation that the standard deduction is enhanced periodically keeping in mind the rate of inflation prevailing in the economy.However, some experts note that the government will have limited fiscal room to hike standard deduction after last year’s tax slab changes under the new income tax regime and sweeping GST rate cuts. There is also the rationale that the government may await data on how many taxpayers opt for the new tax regime as per FY 2025-26 slabs before looking to incentivise it further.Richa Sawhney, Partner, Tax at Grant Thornton Bharat explains that salaried taxpayers often feel that they end up paying more taxes than taxpayers with business income, due to limited avenues of deductions available from salary income.Standard deduction is one of the limited deductions available to salaried taxpayers, which aims to compensate them for employment‑related expenses, without requiring proof of claim.“Salaried taxpayers do feel that the current limit of Rs 75,000 is inadequate and a hike is surely on their budget wishlist . However, considering that the standard deduction was enhanced last year, increasing it further this year may not be feasible for the government. More-so, when the softening of gross non corporate tax collections is evident post the slab rate reforms carried out last year,” she says.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India also says that a further hike in the standard deduction appears unlikely in the near term. “In Budget 2024, the government increased the standard deduction under the new tax regime to Rs 75,000 for salaried taxpayers, while the old regime continues to offer Rs 50,000. This differential already provides a clear incentive for taxpayers to shift to the new regime,” she tells TOI.“With the Income-tax Act 2025 focusing on structural simplification, the priority now seems to be on wider adoption of the revised framework rather than introducing additional reliefs,” she adds.","Budget 2026 set to be presented by finance minister nirmala sitharaman on february 1. Taxpayers are wondering if this relief will see a hike, especially in the new income tax regime. Standard deduction limit varies depending on the tax regime salaried taxpayers opt for. The existing limit is rs 75,000 under the new personal tax regime.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126777554,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-41648,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
