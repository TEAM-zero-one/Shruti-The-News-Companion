"Toilets, garbage, linen: Railways overhauls of on-board services, in Gen Coaches as well",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/toilets-garbage-linen-railways-overhauls-of-on-board-services-in-gen-coaches-as-well/articleshow/128357172.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Railways is seeking to address the biggest concern of long distance passengers— train toilets. It on Saturday rolled out reforms in on-board services with focus on regular cleaning of toilets, wash basins and garbage collection in trains on the move, including for millions of passenger travelling in general or unreserved coaches to have access to cleaned toilets.This is a sharp contrast to the current practice where toilets, basins and common areas in general coaches of moving trains are not cleaned at regular intervals unless there is a complaint. A top railway official said this provision is being introduced for the first time. Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, “In the current mechanism, cleaning is done only in reserved coaches. We have included general coaches in the new reform. ” Officials said they aim to ensure cleaning of toilets in such coaches every 1-2 hours.Vaishnaw also said the earlier “clean train station” concept, which provided thorough cleaning at limited stations, is now being replaced with a continuous cleaning model from the train’s origin to its destination. “Toilets, garbage bins, cabin interiors, water availability, and minor electrical or mechanical defects such as lights going out will be addressed continuously during the journey,” he said.Minister announced two reforms — ‘for better on-board services’ and ‘rail-based logistics through Gati Shakti cargo terminals and cargo related facilities’ — as a part of its target to implement “52 Reforms in 52 Weeks in 2026”.To begin with, around 80 long-distance trains with high passenger patronage — 4-5 trains per zone — will be covered under reforms relating to on-board services in the next six months and over three years, it will be implemented across all trains. Vaishnaw said fully technology-enabled professional teams will be engaged with defined Service Level Agreements, specifying cleaning frequency and more frequent cleaning during peak hours. Continuous toilet cleaning, garbage removal, cabinetry cleaning, linen handling and related services will be ensured, and AI-generated images of cleaning activities will be monitored and analysed.Vaishnaw said the linen distribution, linen collection, and cleaning functions, which were earlier distributed among separate agencies, will also now be integrated and awarded to a single entity.He said the reforms in the cargo terminal segment are expected to generate around Rs 30,000 crore additional revenue from new Gati Shakti Cargo Terminals (GCTs) in the next three years. The most significant additions are the integration of processing within cargo terminals, transforming them into “cargo plus processing” hubs and extending contract period from the current 35 years to 50 years.","Railways rolls out reforms in on-board services with focus on regular cleaning of toilets, wash basins and garbage collection in trains on the move.

Gold, Silver Under Pressure After Peaks: Should You Invest And Hold Precious Metals Or Sell Off?

Personal choice, smaller purchases

Beyond weddings: New triggers for buying

Gold continues to hold strong appeal among young Indians, even as access to modern financial products widens, with 62 per cent of respondents naming the precious metal as their preferred investment option, according to a survey.The findings suggest that despite the rise of mutual funds, equities and crypto assets, gold remains the go-to choice for Gen Z and Millennials when it comes to parking their money.The Smytten PulseAI survey, conducted among 5,000 consumers aged between 18 and 39, found that 61.9 per cent would choose gold if they had Rs 25,000 to invest today, as per news agency PTI.This was significantly higher than other options. Mutual funds were chosen by 16.6 per cent of respondents, fixed deposits by 13 per cent, stocks by 6.6 per cent and crypto by just 1.9 per cent.During periods of economic uncertainty, gold’s appeal appeared even stronger. Around 65.7 per cent of those surveyed said gold feels like the safest option compared to bank savings, mutual funds or equities.The findings underline gold’s continued role as a financial safety net across both Gen Z and Millennials.The survey also highlighted a shift in how young people are approaching gold purchases. About 66.7 per cent of respondents said buying gold is largely a personal decision rather than one driven by family tradition.At the same time, buying patterns are changing. Nearly 62 per cent said their most recent gold purchase was below 5 grams. Breaking this down further, 27.5 per cent bought less than 2 grams, while 34.4 per cent purchased between 2 and 5 grams.Overall, 61.9 per cent of recent purchases were under 5 grams, indicating a move away from large, occasional buys towards smaller and more frequent investments.Traditionally associated with weddings and family events, gold is now increasingly being bought for personal financial reasons.According to the survey, nearly 24 per cent said their first gold purchase was triggered by receiving their first salary or earning personal income.Another 23.9 per cent cited an investment decision as the reason for their first purchase.The survey suggests that while gold retains its cultural importance, younger investors are approaching it with a more practical and individual mindset, integrating tradition with financial planning.","61.9 per cent would choose gold if they had rs 25,000 to invest today.

A quieter federal shift

NEW DELHI: For decades, India’s fiscal federal system has had one core element that stood out: poorer states would be supported so that growth could be shared.The 16th Finance Commission has not broken that promise on paper. States will still receive 41 percent of the divisible pool of central taxes. But beneath that headline number, the logic of how money moves across the Union is beginning to change.For the first time, economic output shapes transfers. Long-running revenue deficit grants — once a fiscal buffer for states — have been eliminated. Parts of local government funding are now tied to performance benchmarks. Disaster funding is moving towards risk-indexed allocation rather than discretionary relief.The shift is subtle in design but important in consequence. Transfers are no longer only about closing gaps. They are increasingly about shaping behaviour — rewarding growth, nudging fiscal discipline, and linking public money to administrative capacity.“Considering India’s growth imperative, there is a need for at least a small shift in the devolution criteria towards efficiency,” the Commission said, capturing the direction of travel.Under Article 280 of the Constitution, a Finance Commission is appointed roughly every five years to recommend how Union tax revenues are shared with states and how that share is distributed among them.The 16th Commission covers the period from 2026-27 to 2030-31. Its recommendations come at a time when India is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing major economies and set to become world’s third largest economy in the recommendation period.The core decisions are twofold. Vertical devolution determines what share of central taxes goes to states. Horizontal devolution determines how that pool is divided among them. The vertical share remained unchanged. The horizontal framework has changed.For the first time, contribution to national GDP has been included as a horizontal devolution criterion with a 10 percent weight.Karnataka gains 0.48 percentage points. Kerala gains 0.45 percentage point. Madhya Pradesh loses 0.50 percentage point. Bihar loses 0.11 percentage points .The formula now combines income distance, population, demographic performance, area, forest, GDP contribution. Income distance continues to drive equalisation. GDP contribution introduces an efficiency signal.In response to TOI queries, DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor at EY India, questioned the conceptual basis.“Linking devolution to production efficiency does not appear to be justified,” he said.He said variation in state GDP contribution reflects structural economic factors rather than fiscal management.“It is important to distinguish between efficiency of a production system and efficiency of a fiscal system. GSDPs and GDP are the outcome of the production system in a country which is largely driven by market forces. Inter-state variation in the contribution of the GSDP of an individual state to the overall GDP depends largely on the inter-state concentration of capital stock, inter-state movement of financial and human resources and state level availability of infrastructure,” Srivastava said.He said fiscal rules themselves reinforce divergence.“The differences in inter-state infrastructure depends largely on the limit of fiscal deficit of 3% of GSDP which is by definition higher for higher GSDP states,” he said. “Lowering of the weight attached to the income distance criterion and giving a relatively high weight to the contribution criterion would reduce the degree of equalization.”Ranen Banerjee, Partner and Leader, Economic Advisory, PwC India, said the change sends a policy signal rather than creating an immediate redistribution shock.“The introduction of contribution to GDP as a parameter is a bold step as it clearly puts growth and consequent improvement in the per capita incomes of citizens as an important imperative,” he told TOI.He said states are already competing on growth and investment metrics.“The states have been competing in attracting investments and improving their ease of doing business as well as articulating ambitious growth targets,” Banerjee said. “The signalling through this indicator could possibly work towards restraining populist expenditures and encouraging capital output enhancing expenditures that lead to economic growth.”He added the numerical impact remains modest.“While this may not be counted as a structural shift given the highest negative impact of just 50 basis points in the share of a state with all the changes in the weights and introduction of this parameter, it is a big incentive for states to perform well and provide growth to its population,” he said.Rumki Majumdar, Economist at Deloitte India, said the shift formally introduces performance into federal fiscal thinking.“The introduction of GDP contribution marks an important evolution: for the first time, economic performance finds measured recognition in horizontal devolution,” she said.The Commission has eliminated revenue deficit grants entirely, ending a mechanism historically used to support fiscally weaker states.The Commission’s reasoning is behavioural. It argues that persistent revenue support created ‘adverse incentive structures’ and weakened fiscal reform pressure.Srivastava said stronger design could still have been built around subsidy discipline.“One possible approach could have been to more explicitly exclude excessive or unjustified subsidies in the assessment of states’ expenditure needs during the award period,” he said. “Designing calibrated fiscal incentives or disincentives linked to subsidy discipline may enhance accountability.”Local bodies will receive Rs 7.91 lakh crore between 2026 and 2031, with 60 percent going to rural bodies and 40 percent to urban bodies.Within this, 80 percent is basic grants and 20 percent is performance-linked.Performance conditions include audited accounts publication, property tax system strengthening, and own revenue growth targets.Majumdar said transparency reform is foundational.“Uniform on-budget reporting becomes the first step toward discipline,” she said.She said transparency alone is insufficient without incentive design.“A shift to uniform, on-budget accounting will ensure states remain committed to the path of fiscal prudence. That said, transparency will have to paired with targeted incentives for efficiency and progressive designs,” she said.The Commission has expanded formula-based disaster allocations using a disaster risk index based on hazard, exposure and vulnerability.Banerjee said the framework attempts to balance predictability with flexibility.“The sixteenth finance commission's disaster relief and mitigation fund related recommendations have built in fiscal flexibility,” he said.He said extreme disaster funding scales with the size of the event.“The risk to extreme tail end disaster events that essentially entails relief has been adequately provided for with a graded contribution from states and centre based on the size of relief,” he said.He said fund stockpiling is controlled while allowing emergency replenishment.“The commission has also recommended capping of accumulation in the SDRF to the extent of past 3 years allocation,” he said.“In the event the fund gets depleted on account of a disaster, it has given provision for its replenishment,” he said.He said mitigation spending remains underused.“The challenge has been utilisation of the State Disaster Mitigation Funds,” he said.“Work on mitigation measures utilising the mitigation funds will be the best way to bring down the risks to be within modelled risk scenarios,” he said.Srivastava said tail-risk disasters remain a central government stabilisation responsibility.“Tail-risk disasters refer to high impact, low probability events such as natural disasters and pandemics,” he said.“In the macro-fiscal stabilization framework, dealing with these disasters is largely the responsibility of the central government,” he said.He said fiscal rule flexibility may be necessary in extreme events.“This calls for some flexibility in the fiscal deficit to GDP targets provided in the Centre's FRBM Act,” he said.He cited pandemic precedent.“For events such as Covid-19 also, it was the central government that increased its fiscal deficit to an inordinately high level of 9.2% of GDP in 2020-21 to cope with the Covid led economic contraction,” he said.He said long-term catastrophic planning remains incomplete.“There is also a case to plan for dealing with disasters like pandemics, nuclear and biological holocausts in advance,” he said.Majumdar framed the shift as systemic resilience building.“When the next black swan arrives, the question is not whether models predicted it, but whether financing can move at the speed of need,” she said.“By modernising risk indices, widening eligibility and introducing market-based risk transfer, the framework somewhat ensures that public finances retain the agility required for a new era of tail-risk volatility,” she said.The Commission has recommended subsidy rationalisation, improved targeting, sunset clauses and stronger disclosure.Banerjee said fiscal deficit limits already create indirect discipline.“The fiscal federalism structure has an in-built mechanism that penalises fiscal profligacy by states,” he said.“This is through capping of the fiscal deficit that means limiting the borrowing that a state can undertake,” he said.He said adjustment pressures fall on capital spending.“When states are faced with serious fiscal constraints on account of excessive subsidy, the borrowing limit forces it to rationalise expenses,” he said.“Given the rigidity of expenditure for salaries, pension and interest payments, the casualty of such rationalisation is the capital expenditure,” he said.He said transparency can create market pressure.“More transparency on the fiscal condition of a state should upward pressure on the yields of the state development loans raised by the states making borrowing more expensive,” he said.Srivastava said stronger incentive architecture could have been considered.“One possible approach could have been to more explicitly exclude excessive or unjustified subsidies in the assessment of states’ expenditure needs,” he said.“Designing calibrated fiscal incentives or disincentives linked to subsidy discipline may enhance accountability,” he said.The Commission does not abandon equalisation. Income distance remains the dominant driver.But incentive-linked federalism now sits alongside support-based transfers.Growth versus redistribution, performance versus protection and fiscal discipline versus political economy pressures now operate within the same transfer structure.Over the next five years, states will adjust spending, borrowing and welfare design around this framework.","For the first time, economic output shapes transfers. Long-running revenue deficit grants have been eliminated. Parts of local government funding are now tied to performance benchmarks. Disaster funding is moving towards risk-indexed allocation. Local bodies will receive rs 7.91 lakh crore between 2026 and 2031.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128345240,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1570509,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Reform-driven urban governance



The Union Cabinet has approved the launch of the Urban Challenge Fund (UCF) with a total Central Assistance of Rs 1 lakh crore, aimed at driving market-linked urban infrastructure development and catalysing investments worth around Rs 4 lakh crore over the next five years.The fund marks a shift in urban development model away from grant-based financing towards “market-linked, reform-driven and outcome-oriented infrastructure creation, according to government statement.The scheme will be operational from FY 2025–26 to FY 2030–31, with an extendable implementation window till FY 2033–34.Under the framework, Central Assistance will cover 25% of the project cost, while at least 50% of funding must be mobilised from market sources such as municipal bonds, bank loans and Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs). The remaining portion can be funded by states, Union Territories, urban local bodies or other sources.The fund is designed to leverage private investment, strengthen municipal finance systems and improve governance, while supporting citizen-centric urban reforms and high-quality infrastructure delivery.The PIB statement said the fund aims to create “resilient, productive, inclusive and climate-responsive cities”, positioning urban centres as key drivers of India’s next phase of economic growth.A dedicated Rs 5,000 crore corpus will be used to enhance the creditworthiness of 4,223 cities, including Tier-II and Tier-III urban centres, particularly those accessing market financing for the first time.The Cabinet has also approved a Credit Repayment Guarantee Scheme of Rs 5,000 crore to support urban local bodies in Northeastern and hilly states, and smaller cities with populations below one lakh.The scheme will provide a Central guarantee of up to Rs 7 crore or 70% of the loan amount, whichever is lower, for first-time loans. For subsequent loans, the guarantee will be up to Rs 7 crore or 50% of the loan amount.This is expected to support projects worth at least Rs 20 crore in smaller cities initially and Rs 28 crore in subsequent phases.Projects will be selected through a competitive challenge-based framework focusing on transformative impact, sustainability and reform orientation.Funding will be linked to reform milestones, defined outcomes and performance benchmarks. Continued fund release will depend on sustained reform progress, with monitoring to be carried out through a digital portal of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.Focus on growth hubs, city redevelopment and water infrastructureThe fund will support projects across three major verticals:Smaller cities, including those in Northeastern and hilly states, will be supported through the credit guarantee component, with the government indicating that “in principle all cities will be covered under UCF”.Funding will be linked to reforms across governance, financial systems, service delivery and urban planning, including digital governance, credit strengthening measures and transit-oriented development.Projects will be evaluated based on their ability to deliver economic, social and climate outcomes, including revenue generation, private investment mobilisation, job creation, improved safety, inclusiveness and service delivery.The government expects the Urban Challenge Fund to catalyse large-scale private investment, improve urban governance and accelerate the development of future-ready cities aligned with national development priorities.","A dedicated rs 5,000 crore corpus will be used to enhance the creditworthiness of 4,223 cities, including tier-ii and tier-iii urban centres.

Safety expenditure on Indian Railways has nearly tripled over the past decade to Rs 1,17,693 crore in 2025-26 from Rs 39,200 crore in 2013-14, with the national transporter expanding deployment of indigenous train protection system Kavach and rolling out CCTV surveillance across coaches and locomotives, the government said in response to questions in the Rajya Sabha.Safety remains the highest priority for Indian Railways and the stepped-up investments have contributed to a steep decline in accidents over the years, according to information shared in the Rajya Sabha by Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.Trackside implementation of Kavach -- an indigenously developed Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system -- has been taken up across 23,360 route kilometres, covering the Golden Quadrilateral, Golden Diagonal, High Density Network and other identified sections of the rail network.Kavach assists loco pilots in operating trains within specified speed limits and automatically applies brakes if the driver fails to do so. It also enables safer operations during adverse weather conditions. The system was adopted as the national ATP system in July 2020.After extensive trials, Kavach Version 4.0 has been commissioned across 1,297 route kilometres, including key high-density corridors such as Delhi–Mumbai and Delhi–Howrah.The latest version improves location accuracy, enhances signal information handling in large yards, and enables direct interface with electronic interlocking systems.Indian Railways has also finalised tenders to equip 6,300 electric locomotives with Kavach Version 4.0, while another tender for 2,679 diesel locomotives is under finalisation. More than 48,000 personnel, including about 45,000 loco pilots and assistant loco pilots, have been trained on Kavach technology so far.The cost of providing trackside and station Kavach infrastructure is about Rs 50 lakh per km, while onboard locomotive equipment costs about Rs 80 lakh per loco. Funds utilised on Kavach works till December 2025 stood at Rs 2,573.36 crore, with Rs 1,673.19 crore allocated for 2025-26.Alongside, Indian Railways is expanding onboard surveillance to enhance passenger safety. Around 12,300 coaches — including all operational Vande Bharat and Amrit Bharat train rakes — and 460 locomotives have been equipped with CCTV cameras across the network.The installation of CCTV cameras is aimed at deterring vandalism, theft and other miscreant activities while assisting in incident investigation, with zonal railways and production units undertaking procurement and installation.","Safety expenditure on indian railways has nearly tripled over the past decade to rs 1,17,693 crore in 2025-26 from rs 39,200 crore in 2013-14.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Budget 2026 Overview: What Citizens And Businesses Should Know

(Neetu Vinayek is Partner, Tax Infrastructure and Oil & Gas Leader, EY India . Manmay Chandawalla, Director-Tax, EY India also contributed to the article.)

India’s effort to strengthen its manufacturing foundation has steadily progressed over the past decade through a series of significant policy measures. A major milestone was the launch of the Make in India initiative in 2014, designed to encourage investment, spur innovation, and improve ease of doing business. Labour reforms also moved forward with the rollout of the four Labour Codes on 21 November 2025, merging 29 Central labour laws to streamline compliance and create a modern, resilient workforce framework. Complementing these domestic reforms, India has simultaneously intensified its global trade engagement through a renewed focus on Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Together, these reforms laid the foundation for the renewed manufacturing push outlined in Union Budget 2026.The Budget 2026 places manufacturing as a strategic and frontier sector for sustaining economic growth. The government framed the Budget as a continuation of structural reforms aimed at improving productivity, boosting competitiveness, and strengthening resilience against global disruptions.In light of the rapid progress under the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme, the Budget proposes expanding its allocation to ₹40,000 crore, reaffirming India’s ambition to enhance domestic value addition and secure its place in global electronics supply chains.To compliment this, income tax holiday is being provided for five years to non-residents providing capital goods, equipment, or tooling to contract manufacturer operating in customs-bonded zones. This will help reduce costs which were being incurred on specialised equipment. Safe harbour provisions have been extended to non-residents for component warehousing in a bonded warehouse at a profit margin of 2 percent of the invoice value with a resulting tax incidence of 0.7 percent. This will harness efficiency of just-in-time logistics for the sector.A key highlight is the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) 2.0, to produce equipment and materials, design full-stack Indian IP, and fortify supply chains signalling the country’s ongoing commitment to building a robust domestic semiconductor ecosystem.There is tremendous potential for the aviation sector with rise in airports and regional connectivity under the UDAN schemes. To build sustainable ecosystem it is important to manufacture aircrafts and undertake MRO activities within the country. With this vision basic customs duty is exempted on parts and components imported for manufacture of aircraft. Further, basic customs duty on raw materials imported for manufacture of parts used in maintenance, repair or overhaul requirements in defence units is also exempted. The government has also proposed a seaplane VGF scheme to support operations and indigenise manufacturing of seaplanes.A Scheme for Rare Earth Permanent Magnets, launched in late 2025, is now complemented by proposed support for Rare Earth Corridors across mineral-rich states to promote mining, processing, research and manufacturing.The Budget also introduces Biopharma SHAKTI—a five-year, ₹10,000 crore programme to position India as a global hub for biopharma manufacturing by strengthening capabilities in biologics and biosimilars.To boost the chemicals sector, the government has launched a scheme supporting States in developing chemical parks to expand domestic production.The capital goods sector, often the silent driver of productivity, receives a comprehensive support package. This includes the establishment of Hi-Tech Tool Rooms by Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) as digital service hubs for precision components, a scheme for advanced construction and infrastructure equipment. ₹10,000 crore over five-years is also allocated to develop a competitive container manufacturing ecosystem. These interventions aim to reduce import dependence, shorten supply chains, and lower costs.Beyond advanced manufacturing, the Budget extends support to labour-intensive sectors such as textiles. It also introduces a dedicated thrust to develop India into a global centre for high-quality, affordable sports goods.A Scheme has been proposed to revive 200 legacy industrial clusters to improve their cost competitiveness and efficiency through infrastructure and technology upgradation.Impetus to the manufacturing sector is also provided through taxes. Basic customs duty exemptions have been extended across emerging sectors, including lithium-ion cell battery storage systems, critical mineral processing equipment, raw material for wind turbines and nuclear power plants.In essence, the Union Budget 2026 represents a holistic manufacturing-led growth strategy. It marries structural reforms with targeted fiscal incentives, embraces both advanced and traditional industries, and puts exports and global competitiveness at the centre of its vision. The new set of measures and focus on emerging sectors has the potential to deepen the country’s industrial capabilities and strengthen its position in global value chains. On ground execution and collaboration could mark a transformative chapter in India’s industrial journey.","The budget 2026 places manufacturing as a strategic and frontier sector for sustaining economic growth. The government framed the budget as a continuation of structural reforms aimed at improving productivity, boosting competitiveness, and strengthening resilience against global disruptions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128291387,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-57460,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

India’s Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Budget 2026-27 on 1 February 2026, the ninth of her tenure, terming it as a unique Yuva Shakti-driven Budget.Rather than announcing sweeping tax reductions, the Budget reinforced continuity from last year and focused more on administrative simplification, extending selective relief against the backdrop of substantial tax changes in recent years. There is substantial thrust on promoting ease of compliance for the ordinary taxpayer. This article highlights below some of these proposals.The Hon’ble FM has chosen to retain stability in income tax slabs and rates. The structure applicable for FY 2025–26 continues unchanged in FY 2026-27, under which salaried individuals effectively pay no tax on income up to approximately INR 12 lakhs after considering standard deduction of INR 75,000 and applicable rebates.In line with expectations, the new Income Tax Act 2025, which supersedes the long-standing Act of 1961, will now be effective from 1 April 2026. The new Act was drafted with a valiant attempt at simplification of provisions by reducing jargon and using layman language instead for easier comprehension. The related Income Tax Rules and Forms are expected to be notified shortly, to provide taxpayers sufficient time to familiarize themselves with the new requirements.It would be critical to have these, including the electronic versions, tested and released at the earliest so that tax filing truly becomes a smooth experience for taxpayers.Tax return deadlines have been extended to 31 August in case of non-audit business cases. Other categories of individual taxpayers filing ITR1 and ITR2 will continue to follow the deadline of 31 July. The extended deadline will give some breathing space to such taxpayers to finalise their books of accounts and gather details of business income.Another helpful reform in this year’s Budget permits taxpayers to submit revised income tax returns up to the next 31 March, extending the previous deadline of 31 December. With a nominal fee of INR 1000/ 5000 (depending on income of below/ above INR 5 lakhs), this extension provides taxpayers with greater flexibility and reduces the time pressure for correcting errors. This will be particularly useful for globally mobile taxpayers who have income and reporting requirements of foreign income and assets arising in tax jurisdictions outside India whose tax years are calendar years. It will also allow them to avail tax treaty relief in cases of double taxation.To encourage voluntary compliance and reduce litigation, taxpayers will now be permitted to file Updated returns even after reassessment proceedings have begun, subject to payment of an additional 10% tax over and above the prescribed additional tax. Furthermore, updated returns can be filed even where there is a reduction in claimed losses.Over the past few years, after the introduction of the Black Money law, reporting of Foreign Assets and Income had become a stressful exercise for many people who did not have organised data at their disposal. Consequently, there have been multiple instances of taxpayers missing disclosure requirements. To give some relief to such taxpayers, a six-month tax amnesty scheme has been introduced to facilitate reporting of undisclosed foreign assets/income by certain categories of taxpayers like students, young professionals, tech employees, relocated NRIs, etc.In cases where the taxpayer has acquired such foreign asset from identified sources of income earned in India or abroad, reporting can be done upon a fee payment of INR 1 lakh if the maximum value (FMV) of assets covered is INR 5 crores. In cases where the taxpayer is unable to substantiate the source of funds for acquiring such asset(s), the amnesty scheme permits disclosure of assets, and any income arising therefrom, of a maximum aggregate value of INR 1 crore. The value of the asset would be at FMV and the tax payable will be 60% of such FMV/value. No further penalty is leviable.Budget 2026 has rationalised various Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) provisions, making them less burdensome:These changes make funds more accessible for genuine personal needs instead of getting locked up for refund claims later.In case of taxpayers holding securities in multiple companies, depositories will now be able to accept Form 15G/15H from the investor and provide it directly to various relevant companies. This will eliminate the hassle of tracking multiple investments and missing submissions by taxpayers.The Budget proposes a major overhaul of criminal prosecution provisions under the Act with the aim to minimise unnecessary litigation while maintaining a careful balance for deterrence in some serious offences. In a very welcome move, assessment and penalty proceedings are proposed to be merged into a single order. In addition, it is proposed to remove interest liability on penalties during the pendency of initial appeal proceedings and also lower deposit requirements for tax demands under appeal from the existing 20% to 10%.In order to facilitate Indian businesses in specific sectors to avail of services of foreign experts with specialised skills, compliance has been made easier for such non-resident individuals. It is proposed to exempt income earned outside India (which is not deemed to accrue or arise in India) for a period of 5 consecutive tax years beginning with the first year of services. To be eligible for this relaxation, the individual should be non-resident in India for the last 5 years preceding the start of such services in India.The applicable Schemes are yet to be notified by the Government, but clearly this amendment will be welcomed by industries which need specialised experts to come and work in India. Measures like these will also make India an attractive destination for foreign experts to come and work in India.This Budget was more about consolidation of tax reforms and progress along the path laid out last year. With hardly any big bang changes, it has focused on procedural reforms and simplification under the New Income-tax Act, 2025. There were a few missed chances for greater simplification, e.g. in the area of capital gains, or TDS on rent payments to non-resident landlords, etc. We also hope that the related rules forms are released at the earliest to ensure taxpayers get adequate time to absorb and adopt these changes right from the start of the new tax year.","India’s union finance minister nirmala sitharaman presented the budget 2026-27 on 1 february 2026, terming it as a unique yuva shakti-driven budget.

Budget 2026 Signals Infra First Strategy With Public Capital Expenditure Raised To ₹12.2 Lakh Crore

(Chintan Patel is Partner- Deal Advisory and Head of Real Estate & Hospitality and Transport & Logistics, KPMG in India and Aman Mehta is Vice President – M&A Consulting, KPMG in India)

The Union Budget 2026–27 reinforces a push towards infrastructure driven economic growth, setting a constructive backdrop for India’s real estate sector. While the budget does not introduce direct demand-side incentives for housing, its sharp focus on infrastructure, manufacturing, urban development and tourism is expected to create strong indirect momentum across residential, commercial, industrial and hospitality real estate segments.A key positive for the sector is the continued scale-up of public capital expenditure, with infrastructure outlay rising to INR 12.2 lakh crore from INR 11.2 lakh crore (FY 25-26). Sustained investment in transport networks and urban infrastructure is likely to unlock new real estate growth corridors, particularly beyond the traditional metro markets. The emphasis on strengthening Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities with populations exceeding five lakh recognizes their emerging role as economic centers and is expected to support incremental demand for various real estate asset classes in these locations.The Budget has in addition also proposed the development of seven high‑speed rail corridors connecting major urban and economic centers, aimed at improving inter‑city mobility and acting as growth catalysts along peripheral and secondary micro-markets. In parallel, the creation of City Economic Regions (CERs) across Tier‑2 and Tier‑3 cities, backed by INR 5,000 crore investments per CER across five years, seeks to strengthen infrastructure and accelerate their transition into regional economic hubs, with positive implications for the real estate sector. Measures such as the proposed Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund and continued monetization of CPSE real estate assets through REIT structures are likely to improve private sector participation and liquidity within the infrastructure and real estate sector.The accelerated push toward manufacturing across sectors such as biopharma, electronics, chemicals, textiles, rare earths, and construction equipment is expected to significantly influence the industrial and logistics landscape. The expansion of manufacturing ecosystems, revitalization of legacy industrial clusters, and development of modern plug‑and‑play industrial parks will not only drive sustained long‑term demand for industrial land, warehousing and R&D infrastructure but also enhance the overall growth outlook for the real estate sector across multiple regions.The Budget underscores tourism‑led economic development with a focus on healthcare, heritage and eco‑tourism. Key proposals include the establishment of five regional medical hubs, development of 15 archaeological and heritage sites as experiential cultural destinations. Additionally, the proposal of Buddhist circuits across the North‑Eastern states is expected to strengthen spiritual tourism and support hospitality‑led regional growth.In the budget, while direct tax incentives remain limited, there is a stronger emphasis on a predictable, rules‑based tax regime aimed at resolving long‑standing procedural bottlenecks and transfer‑pricing disputes. This shift enhances investor confidence, lowers risk premiums for foreign capital, and supports more resilient financial markets. The Budget also introduces multi‑decade tax clarity for foreign cloud service providers, who are procuring data center services from India, ensuring non‑taxation on eligible cloud‑related income until 2047. Additionally, the introduction of a 15 per cent on cost safe harbor margin for Indian data‑center entities servicing overseas affiliates strengthens India’s positioning as a competitive hub for hyperscale cloud infrastructure. These measures are likely to attract long term capital into digital infrastructure including new entrants in the data center space.Tax compliance has been eased for resident buyers purchasing immovable property from non‑residents. The removal of the requirement to obtain a TAN, allowing TDS deposits through the buyer’s PAN, streamlines cross‑border transactions and reduces administrative friction.A notable aspect of the Union Budget 2026 was the continued absence of direct tax incentives for the residential real estate sector including on the homebuyer’s ask for increasing the INR 2 lakh cap on interest deduction for self-occupied properties. Despite long‑standing industry expectations, the Budget did not introduce any new exemptions, relief, credit of GST paid on inputs by developers or confer infrastructure status to the real estate sector, measures that stakeholders have consistently advocated to boost sectoral growth.Overall, the Union Budget 2026–27 positions real estate as a downstream beneficiary of infrastructure-led growth. While near-term residential stimulus may be limited, the structural measures announced provide a strong foundation for a geographically diversified and long-term expansion of the sector.","Union budget 2026–27 positions real estate as a downstream beneficiary of infrastructure-led growth.

Carry-Forward Expectations

India’s real estate sector continued its growth momentum in 2025, reaffirming its position as a core pillar of the country's economic expansion. Currently contributing nearly 8% to GDP, the sector is projected to contribute 15-16% by 2047, aligning with India’s vision of “Viksit Bharat”. The Budget reinforces this trajectory through infrastructure-led development, policy & tax reforms, though some sector-specific expectations remain unaddressed.Proposal to monetize public sector real estate assets through dedicated REITs is expected to unlock value from idle assets, deepen institutional participation & enable efficient capital recycling across the sector.The government has reiterated its commitment to Tier 2 & Tier 3 cities, including temple towns, by allocating INR 5,000 crore over 5 years per City Economic Region. This is likely to stimulate urbanisation beyond metros & drive housing demand.Another notable thrust is on industrial & logistics corridors, supported by development of university townships integrating research institutions, skill centres & residential infrastructure.This integrated approach is expected to boost employment generation while creating demand for commercial & residential real estate.Further, development of dedicated rail freight corridors, textile & chemical parks will have positive spillover effects on industrial real estate, warehousing & allied infrastructure.For self-occupied properties, prior-period interest on housing loans continues to be deductible in 5 equal installments after construction completion. This prior-period interest has now been aligned with the Old Regime, with the overall interest deduction capped at INR 2 lakh per annum.Resident individuals & HUFs purchasing property from non-resident sellers can now deduct TDS by quoting PAN without the requirement to obtain a TAN.Consideration received on buy-back of shares will now be taxed as capital gains instead of dividends, with entitlement to capital loss on the cost of shares. However, promoters will be subject to an additional levy, resulting in higher effective tax rate for them.The Budget aligns income-tax provisions for compulsory acquisition of land under Right to Fair Compensation & Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation & Resettlement Act, 2013, bringing clarity & consistency.MAT has been proposed to be reduced from 15% to 14%.For domestic companies continuing under the old tax regime post March 31, 2026, MAT paid will be treated as final tax liability, with no new MAT credit generation. Existing MAT credit as on March 31, 2026 will not be available for set-off unless the company transitions to the new regime.Companies migrating to the new regime during or after FY 2026–27 will be allowed to utilise MAT credit, subject to set-off capped at 25% of normal tax liability per year & carry forward permitted for 15 years from the date of generation.The MAT amendments are designed to encourage migration to the new tax regime. However, as REIT unitholder dividend exemptions remain linked to SPVs under the old regime, REIT managers will need to carefully evaluate the cost-benefit implications.The Budget also promotes foreign investment in Indian data centres by introducing a tax holiday for foreign companies until March 31, 2047 on income from procuring data centre services from specified Indian facilities. Services to Indian users must be routed through an Indian reseller entity.Additionally, the government has proposed the convergence of the Income Computation and Disclosure Standards (ICDS) with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) through a joint Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)–Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) committee, along with a comprehensive review of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules to align them with India’s evolving economic priorities.Even as the reforms strengthen the sector’s overall framework, certain areas could be candidates for future refinement, including affordable housing incentives, interest deduction limits under the new regime, sector-specific relief for hospitality and tourism, and flexibility in ITC utilisation for leased assets.Overall, the Budget presents a largely positive outlook for the real estate sector, driven by infrastructure expansion, regional development & tax rationalisation. The government’s proactive engagement with industry stakeholders throughout the year rather than relying solely on annual budget announcements offers optimism that pending sectoral expectations may be addressed as India progresses toward its Viksit Bharat 2047 vision.","India’s real estate sector continued its growth momentum in 2025, reaffirming its position as a core pillar of the country's economic expansion.

Announced against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions, the Union Budget 2026–27 carried expectations of reinforcing India’s global standing—especially in light of recently concluded Foreign Trade Agreements. The Budget 2026 continues to advance India’s long‑term strategic narrative: strengthening manufacturing as the core engine of growth while simultaneously expanding the country’s capabilities in services and digital trade.The Finance Minister reaffirmed the centrality of manufacturing to India’s economic strategy. Large‑scale investments in textiles, semiconductors, rare‑earth mining, infrastructure, and MSME development signal the Government’s intent to build resilient, future‑ready industrial capacity. These interventions align strongly with India’s aspiration to emerge as a global manufacturing hub.Complementing manufacturing, the Budget underscores the Sankalp for accelerating and sustaining economic growth, fulfilling citizen aspirations, and advancing the vision ofwithin the framework of the three. This focus manifests in initiatives aimed at strengthening the services ecosystem and positioning India deeper within global value chains.Several targeted interventions demonstrate this intent. In a major relief to the IT sector, the Government has introduced several tax reforms, including but not limited to consolidating services under a single category of IT Services with a common safe‑harbour margin of 15.5 percent, increasing the safe-harbour threshold from ₹300 crore to ₹2,000 crore to ease compliance for large taxpayers, and introducing tax holidays until 2047 for foreign companies offering cloud services through India‑based data centres, with a 15 percent safe‑harbour for related entities providing supporting data‑center operations. These key reforms would aid in creating long‑term policy predictability and reinforce India’s digital infrastructure competitiveness.As regards providing a push to the creative industries, establishment of AVGC Content Creator Lab in schools and colleges is likely to accelerate skill development in animation, gaming, VFX, and digital content creation industries which are already experiencing exponential global demand.In terms of alleviating the tourism and hospitality needs of India, a National Institute of Hospitality is proposed which would integrate academia, industry, and the Government. This move is expected to uplift service standards, aligning India’s hospitality workforce with global benchmarks, scale up India’s tourism offerings, boost employment, and enhance economic contribution from both domestic and international tourism.With education and healthcare forming the backbone of any resilient economy, the Budget’s initiatives—such as the creation of a High‑Powered “Education to Employment and Enterprise” Standing Committee and the upgrading of existing institutions alongside the establishment of new centres for training Allied Health Professionals—represent critical forward‑looking interventions. These measures are expected to significantly narrow the skill gap by aligning academic curricula with evolving industry needs, ensuring that learners acquire job‑ready competencies. Together, they will not only enhance employability but also strengthen the quality and preparedness of India’s future workforce, positioning the country to meet the growing demands of a rapidly transforming economic landscape.On a separate note, the Budget lays out a forward‑looking roadmap for strengthening maritime and inland logistics. The introduction of new Dedicated Freight Corridors connecting the East and the West, along with 20 new National Waterways to improve connectivity between mineral belts, industrial hubs, and ports, signals a major push toward integrated transport infrastructure. The proposed development of a ship‑repair ecosystem for inland waterways and the launch of the Coastal Cargo Promotion Scheme—aimed at doubling the share of coastal and inland waterway cargo by 2047 - further demonstrates the Government’s commitment to modernizing multimodal logistics.Reflecting a clear shift from policing to facilitating trade, the Budget introduces a series of trust‑based governance measures aimed at enhancing efficiency, predictability, and transparency within customs processes.Key reforms include the extension of the duty‑deferral period for Tier 2 and Tier 3 AEOs from the current 15 days to 30 days, providing businesses with improved cash‑flow flexibility and reduced working‑capital strain. Additionally, the validity of binding advance rulings has been increased from 3 to 5 years, offering greater certainty to importers and exporters in planning their tax positions. The Government has also proposed recognizing regular, compliant importers within customs risk‑assessment systems, thereby reducing repetitive verification and enabling faster cargo clearance for trusted entities in addition to streamlining the overall Customs Integrated System.While the journey toward fully meeting expectations on Customs simplification has only begun, the initiatives announced in the Budget mark a clear and progressive shift toward enhancing ease of doing business and improving predictability across trade processes. These reforms reinforce the Government’s intent to build a more efficient, trust‑based regulatory environment for importers and exporters alike.It is also noteworthy that the Budget continues to advance India’s agenda of becoming a more attractive investment destination. Key measures include permitting Persons Resident Outside India (PROIs) to invest in listed Indian equities through the Portfolio Investment Scheme, rationalizing TDS/TCS rates to reduce compliance burden, and decriminalizing procedural lapses such as non‑production of books of account or delays in tax deduction payments. Collectively, these steps strengthen investor confidence, improve regulatory clarity, and align with India’s broader objective of fostering a transparent, growth‑oriented business ecosystem under the broader vision ofOverall, the Budget 2026–27 has been delivered with clarity, balance, and a long‑term vision. It successfully addresses expectations across sectors—strengthening manufacturing, deepening services capability, modernizing logistics, and promoting trust‑based governance. This year’s Budget, in many ways, sets the tone for India’s next phase of economic transformation.","Decoding budget 2026-27: delivering clarity, balance, and a long‑term vision (ai image) by rajeev dimri and kunal kohli, kpmg in india.

If past Union Budget s were shaped by tax reforms and progressive personal tax restructuring, then Budget 2026 is more about firefighting, shielding the economy from global shocks, managing uncertainty and rebuilding confidence amid a volatile international environment.With no dramatic fiscal stress to respond to, Budget 2026 shifted attention to longer-term priorities while maintaining continuity in fiscal management.In the past years, the government had already delivered significant personal income tax relief, including raising the exemption limit to spur consumption, and had steadily ramped up capital expenditure to position infrastructure and connectivity as key engines of growth.This year, the emphasis was less on fresh giveaways and more on preparing the ground for the next growth cycle.The Budget came at a time when the global economy was adjusting to the growing weight of the Global South, with India on the threshold of becoming the world’s third-largest economy.Such a transition inevitably brought trade frictions, protectionist pressures and geopolitical realignments. Against this backdrop, India made notable progress on the trade front, including a landmark, win-win agreement with the European Union, even as it grappled with higher tariffs and shifting global trade rules.The Budget also underlined the urgency of scaling up investments in artificial intelligence, accelerating innovation and adoption, and equipping India’s youth with new-age skills.The proposals aligned closely with the expectations set out in the Economic Survey 2025–26, with a clear push to lower input costs and enhance manufacturing competitiveness through rationalisation of customs duties, easier access to finance and measures to attract non-resident capital.That shift in confidence explained why this year’s Budget resisted headline-grabbing populism. There were no sweeping giveaways, no dramatic income-tax cuts and no sudden expansion of welfare promises.Taken together, Budget 2026 was less about managing immediate risks and more about building resilience and capability for the years ahead. It reflected an economy that was cautiously confident, forward-looking and focused on shaping its place in a rapidly changing global order.The emphasis was firmly on public investment, long-term structural reforms and improving the efficiency of existing systems.Budget 2026 is about setting the direction!One of the clearest markers of non-populism is the fiscal stance.Budget 2025 prioritised consolidation in an uncertain global environment, pegging the fiscal deficit at 4.4% of GDP. Budget 2026 continues along the same path, estimating the deficit at a slightly lower 4.3% of GDP for FY27.More importantly, the government has added clarity on its medium-term intent. The Budget explicitly outlines a glide path towards a 50% ±1% debt-to-GDP ratio by 2030, a level that offers long-term fiscal credibility without choking growth.DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor, EY India, told TOI that, ""The pace of fiscal consolidation has moderated in the FY27 Budget. After achieving a reduction of 40 basis points from 4.8% of GDP in FY25 to 4.4% in FY26 (RE), the reduction in FY27 (BE) is only 10 basis points, taking the FY27 fiscal deficit to 4.3% of GDP.""""This moderation is due to a fall in the GoI’s gross tax revenues to GDP ratio… which translates into a fall in GoI’s non-debt receipts relative to GDP,"" he added.If there is one area where Budget 2026 is emphatic, it is capital expenditure.Public capex rises to Rs 12.2 lakh crore for FY27, up from Rs 11.2 lakh crore in the current year and just Rs 2 lakh crore in FY15. Over a decade, this marks a structural shift towards state-led asset creation as the main engine of growth.But this year’s Budget goes beyond simply writing bigger cheques. The emphasis is equally on how capital is deployed and how private investment is drawn in alongside public spending.New institutional mechanisms aim to reduce risk and improve returns for private players, while innovative approaches to asset monetisation seek to unlock value from existing public assets.At the same time, continued investment in freight corridors, inland waterways and coastal shipping underscores a push to improve logistics efficiency.Taken together, these measures signal a shift from ""how much we spend"" to ""how effectively we spend"".Support for manufacturing is another area where Budget 2026 moves away from populism.While Budget 2025 relied heavily on sector-specific incentives, Budget 2026 broadens the approach by strengthening supporting systems. Electronics, semiconductors, defence manufacturing and supply chains receive targeted support, largely via customs duty tweaks rather than blanket subsidies.Defence sees a sharp rise, with an allocation of Rs 7.84 lakh crore for FY27, up 15.3% from last year. The focus remains on modernisation, capacity building and domestic procurement rather than symbolic announcements.Agriculture follows a familiar path. The emphasis is on productivity, technology adoption and value chains across fisheries, horticulture and allied activities. There are no major market reforms or income-linked populist support mechanisms.In social sectors—health, education, skills, tourism and culture—the Budget favours targeted capacity creation over universal giveaways, from medical hubs and allied health professionals to creative economy labs and university townships.For individual taxpayers, Budget 2026 stands out more for continuity than change.Income-tax slabs remain unchanged under both old and new regimes. There is no tinkering with surcharge or cess. This follows last year’s major relief, which exempted income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime.Rather than fresh tax cuts, the Budget focuses on simplifying the tax system and easing compliance.A key step in this direction is the rollout of the New Income Tax Act, 2025, which will come into effect from April 2026. The government has indicated that the new law will be supported by simpler rules and redesigned return forms aimed at reducing complexity and errors.Taxpayers will also get more breathing room through extended timelines for filing returns and for making revisions, a move intended to reduce penalties arising from procedural lapses.In addition, approvals for lower or nil tax deduction at source (TDS) will increasingly be handled through automated, rule-based systems, limiting discretion and speeding up the process.The Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) has been lowered to 14% from the earlier rate of 15%.Relief has also been provided on the outward flow of funds, with a reduction in tax collected at source (TCS) on overseas travel, foreign education and medical remittances.At the same time, individuals who did not disclose foreign non-immovable assets valued below Rs 20 lakh will receive immunity from prosecution, with retrospective effect from October 1, 2024.The philosophy is clear: make compliance easier, not flashier.Not everyone walks away happy. One area where Budget 2026 clearly hurt sentiment was the stock market.Market sentiment took a hit in the immediate aftermath of Budget 2026, with the sharpest reaction coming from the increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options.The announcement sparked heavy selling on Budget day, especially in stocks linked to trading activity, as higher transaction costs directly impact the profitability of frequent and leveraged trades.Both Indian benchmark indices, the Nifty50 and the BSE Sensex, plunged over 2% during the special trading session on Sunday.The Nifty50 closed at 24,825.45, down 593 points or 2.33%, while the BSE Sensex ended at 80,722.94, shedding 1,843 points or 2.23%.For active traders, the move is an undeniable negative, raising costs in a segment that thrives on high volumes and thin margins. However, seen through a policy lens, the intent appears less about extracting easy tax revenue and more about cooling excessive speculation in derivatives markets.""The only real negative in the Budget is the increase in STT on derivatives, and that’s what the market is reacting to in the short term. Overall, once the STT headline settles, the Budget should be seen as growth supportive,"" said Amisha Vora, PL Capital – Prabhudas Lilladher.Poll-bound states have voiced sharp dissatisfaction with the Union Budget, alleging a lack of targeted support. Last year, when Bihar was heading into assembly elections, the Centre announced the National Makhana Board with an initial allocation of Rs 100 crore.In contrast, this Budget avoided such election-linked announcements, drawing criticism from chief ministers of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, who said their states were overlooked.At the same time, shifting geopolitical priorities are visible in the numbers. The Budget makes no provision for Iran’s Chabahar port project and sharply cuts development assistance to Bangladesh, reflecting strained regional ties.On the corporate tax side, promoters face tighter scrutiny, with higher taxes on buybacks. The government has made clear that the move is aimed at curbing what it described as the ""improper use"" of buybacks as a tax-efficient route.Meanwhile, from May 1, 2026, the National Calamity Contingent Duty on chewing tobacco, jarda scented tobacco and other tobacco products, including gutkha, will be raised from 25% to 60%, even as the effective incidence is proposed to be kept at 25%.While direct taxes stay stable, indirect tax measures in Budget 2026 are expected to quietly influence everyday spending and consumer experience.One of the more immediate changes affects personal imports. The tariff rate on all dutiable goods brought in for personal use has been reduced from 20% to 10%. Once updated baggage rules are notified, this could lower the cost of items purchased abroad or carried back during international travel.Healthcare also sees some relief through customs duty exemptions.Basic customs duty has been removed on 17 drugs and medicines, and duty-free personal imports of drugs and food have been extended to cover seven additional rare diseases. For patients dealing with chronic or rare conditions, these steps could translate into lower out-of-pocket expenses over time.Changes to tax collection on overseas spending are likely to ease cash-flow pressures for families.The tax collected at source (TCS) on overseas tour packages has been cut to 2%, while TCS on remittances for foreign education and medical treatment has also been reduced to the same level.This directly benefits households sending children abroad for studies or incurring medical expenses overseas. The Budget also signals longer-term cost moderation through support for domestic manufacturing and clean energy.Customs duty exemptions on components used in microwave ovens, lithium-ion battery manufacturing and solar glass inputs are aimed at strengthening local production.While these may not result in immediate price reductions, they are designed to lower costs gradually and reduce import dependence.In the energy and transport space, duty exemptions on aviation components, incentives for biogas-blended CNG, and a renewed push for waterways and coastal shipping are intended to bring down logistics and fuel-related costs.Such measures typically take time to show results but eventually influence the prices of everyday goods through cheaper transportation.Beyond changes in duty rates, the Budget places strong emphasis on process reforms at customs.A single digital window for cargo clearance, faster approvals for food, drugs and plant products, immediate clearance for goods without compliance requirements, and wider use of AI-based non-intrusive scanning are expected to reduce delays and uncertainty.While these reforms operate behind the scenes, they reduce delays, costs and uncertainty, benefits consumers often feel without noticing the policy behind them.Compared to the last five Budgets, Budget 2026 ranks low on traditional populism. Between FY2021-22 and FY2025-26, India’s tax framework was steadily reshaped through headline-grabbing measures, particularly progressive personal tax relief that directly targeted middle-class sentiment.Middle-class taxpayers benefited from steady personal tax cuts, welfare outlays were expanded, and pandemic-era safety nets were reinforced.The new income-tax regime introduced in 2020 was gradually strengthened: Budgets 2021 and 2022 largely held rates steady, Budget 2023 made the new regime the default option while simplifying slabs and raising the basic exemption, and Budget 2024 enhanced the standard deduction for salaried taxpayers to Rs 75,000.Budget 2025 marked a clear break, dramatically lowering the direct tax burden on the middle class by fully exempting income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried individuals after deduction).Budget 2026, by contrast stands apart from that trajectory. Instead of extending tax relief or unveiling crowd-pleasing announcements, it reflects a shift in intent.Budget 2026 assumes that political capital has already been spent. It avoids large, vote-catching measures and instead doubles down on execution, predictability and long-term growth architecture.What makes finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth Budget distinctive is its refusal to choose between growth and discipline. Instead, it attempts a third path: sustained public investment backed by predictable fiscal behaviour.Effective capital expenditure keeps rising, revenue deficits continue to compress, and governance shifts toward automation, trust and verification rather than control.This is not a Budget designed to dominate headlines. It is designed to influence outcomes gradually and durably. Taken together, Budget 2026 reads less like a populist spectacle and more like a blueprint focused on systems, execution and changes that will matter quietly over time.The Budget also came amid clear momentum in India–US economic ties. Days before its presentation, signals from both sides pointed to progress, with commerce minister Piyush Goyal describing efforts to close the ""father of all deals.""That momentum crystallised on February 2, when US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would cut reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods to 18% following a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, effectively sealing the agreement.","Budget 2026 was less about managing immediate risks and more about building resilience and capability for the years ahead. It reflected an economy that was cautiously confident, forward-looking and focused on shaping its place in a rapidly changing global order.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127889118,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-77586,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

How will a person who has an income Rs 12 lakh benefit from new rates?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said.

With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden.Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.",Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: faqs answered. Finance minister nirmala sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime.
