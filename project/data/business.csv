"Amid threats to ‘chicken’s neck’, India to take rail corridor underground",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-threats-to-chickens-neck-india-to-take-rail-corridor-underground/articleshow/127871006.cms,"Union railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw (PTI photo)

GUWAHATI: India’s plan to secure the strategic “chicken’s neck” corridor to the Northeast from Bengal includes laying underground rail tracks through the nearly 40km stretch flanked by Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said Monday.Vaishnaw said the Budget contains a proposal to expand railway link between the region and the rest of the country to four tracks, fulfilling a long-felt need. Northeast Frontier Railway GM Chetan Shrivastava said the underground stretch would run from Tin Mile Haat to Rangapani stations within Bengal.Decision to take the tracks underground stems from threats — overt and covert — to target the chicken’s neck, which is barely 25km wide at the narrowest point. Concerns over the corridor, being seen as India’s Achilles heel, grew after the fall of Hasina govt in Bangladesh, with some groups speaking about “choking the chicken’s neck” to cut off the Northeast. Voices have framed the region as part of their vision of a “greater Bangladesh”. Dhaka’s outreach towards China is another red flag.During the 2017 Doklam stand-off, military planners had talked about the vulnerability of the Siliguri stretch of the corridor. Any disruption here could isolate NE, severing supply lines and impeding movement of troops.“Taking the tracks underground is part of the strategy to ensure connectivity even in times of crises,” an official said.","Railway minister ashwini vaishnaw said the budget contains a proposal to expand railway link between the region and the rest of the country to four tracks.

BHUBANESWAR: Not smoke. Not mirrors. Just steel that wasn’t there. Three decades after magician PC Sorcar Jr stunned a live crowd by making a passenger train “vanish” at Bardhaman in Bengal, rail travellers in western Odisha faced a far less theatrical disappearance — a reserved coach that never showed up.Passengers holding confirmed tickets for a 3AC coach on Sambalpur–Nanded Nagavali Superfast Exp discovered Sunday morning that their coach was missing when train 20809 rolled into Sambalpur, 320km west of Bhubaneswar.Sorcar’s act relied on lighting, timing and crowd control. This one needed none of that — just confirmed tickets, an absent coach and a reminder that on Indian Railways , reality can outdo illusion.The train departed Sambalpur without coach BE2. Confusion followed on the platform. Ticket examiners fielded protests as travellers were unsure whether to board. Others climbed into any coach they could find. Over 30 passengers with confirmed berths scattered across the train.East Coast Railway blamed a technical snag that prevented attachment of the coach. The issue was resolved when train reached Visakhapatnam Jn, where an AC coach was added.","Passengers holding confirmed tickets for a 3ac coach on sambalpur–nanded nagavali superfast exp discovered sunday morning that their coach was missing.

A Chance to Build a Future-Ready Indirect Tax System

(Jayashree Parthasarathy is Tax Partner, EY India. With contributions from Ketan Lohia, Director-tax, EY India)

India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities. While GST and Customs digitalisation have undeniably transformed the landscape, companies continue to face operational bottlenecks that slow down activity, tie up working capital and drive up compliance costs. These factors directly affect the country’s ease of doing business.In this backdrop, the 56th GST Council meeting marked significant progress by tackling several long-standing pain points. Union Budget 2026 now has an opportunity to build on this momentum and deliver a tax ecosystem that is faster, more consistent and easier for businesses to navigate.A key long pending ask and expectation from the upcoming Budget is a more flexible and business-friendly input tax credit (ITC) system. Companies have long argued that credits representing taxes genuinely paid and used in business operations should be freely available or refunded.Two specific asks remain critical:Allowing smoother credit flow across GST registrations would also unlock meaningful liquidity for enterprises.The recent GST Council decision to treat intermediary services as exports (therefore removing the GST levy) is a welcome step and industry now awaits its formal implementation as a part of the budget process.Businesses are also expecting similar clarity for R&D and testing services, which currently attract 18% GST because place-of-performance rules prevent them from being classified as exports. A consistent and globally aligned export definition would boost India’s competitiveness in high-value service segments.Compliance complexity remains a major concern with an expectation that multiplicity of proceedings would be addressed. A single, centralised audit and faceless assessment system, similar to the efficient model used under the erstwhile service tax regime, would give pan India businesses one point of engagement, reduce repetitive scrutiny and minimise conflicting interpretations across States.Large taxpayers would particularly benefit from a centralized single point of contact approach by way of:A uniform, risk-based audit framework would further enhance consistency and limit unnecessary scrutiny. Equally important is a more calibrated enforcement approach; one that acts firmly against evasion but avoids punitive measures such as asset attachments or frequent detention of goods in cases involving interpretational differences or procedural lapses. A clearer differentiation between wilful violations and good-faith positions will go a long way in restoring business confidence.For India’s smallest enterprises, current GST registration thresholds (₹20 lakh for services and ₹40 lakh for goods) no longer reflect today’s cost structures. Near-decade-high inflation has pushed many micro-businesses into the GST net perhaps far earlier than intended. Raising the threshold to reflect current realities would preserve working capital and support MSME viability.On the Customs side, businesses continue to face prolonged timelines in dispute resolution, with legacy cases stretching for years and delaying investment decisions. A time-bound settlement mechanism, similar to earlier dispute-resolution schemes, would help clear the backlog and allow both industry and the department to focus on priority matters.Businesses are also seeking greater certainty through longer-validity advance rulings and simpler renewals, so long-term projects are not disrupted by tax disputes merely on account of lapse of time.Operational friction also remains a day-to-day challenge at the border. Even after goods are cleared, companies often face manual processes to pay differential duties or correct documents for host of reasons including price variation, corrections. Allowing digital payments and online amendments, and ensuring such payments qualify for GST credit, would reduce compliance effort and minimise cash-flow disruptions.Cross-border businesses are also looking for clearer, time-bound guidelines around Special Valuation Branch (SVB) proceedings. While scrutiny of related-party pricing is necessary, inconsistent practices often create uncertainty for global supply chains. Predictable timelines and uniform standards are essential if India is to position itself as a reliable global hub.Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units seeking to sell into the domestic market face a structural disadvantage, as duties are levied without fully recognising that these units often use domestic inputs. Aligning duty calculations to reflect only the imported content, and/ or extending select benefits available under free trade agreements, would improve capacity utilisation and offer SEZs a more level playing field vis-à-vis foreign suppliers.Budget 2026 offers an opportunity not just for incremental fixes but for meaningful reform that strengthens India’s indirect tax architecture. The foundation laid by GST and recent digitalisation efforts is robust. What businesses now need is a system that is simpler, more consistent and aligned with the needs of a rapidly expanding economy.If India gets this right, indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.","Indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.

No tax on compensation received from govt on acquisition of land,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-tax-on-compensation-received-from-govt-on-acquisition-of-land/articleshow/127874119.cms,"Is govt eyeing your land? Worried about paying tax on compensation you’ll receive? Not anymore. The Budget 2026 has brought an important amendment exempting compensation received on compulsory acquisition of land under Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act).The proposal says the relief will be applicable to individuals and HUFs. With govt pushing for infrastructure development sin urban areas such as metro train networks, industrial corridors and the like, land acquisition is on a rise. The proposal is expected to help landowners. However, this relief will not apply to acquisitions by private players or through mixed structures.On the proposal, Rahul Charkha, partner at Economic Laws Practice, said, “The amendment incorporates the exemption that was earlier provided under Section 96 of the RFCTLARR and CBDT Circular 36/2016. The amendment also considers a decision of the tax tribunal (Amritsar Bench) wherein it was held that compensation from compulsory acquisition of land under the National Highways Act is exempt from income tax by virtue of Section 96 of the RFCTLARR, 2013. The relief is broader than the old capital-gains exemption for specified agricultural land. It will help owners of non-agricultural, and urban land acquired for roads, rail, metro, industrial corridors and other public projects.”","The proposal says the relief will be applicable to individuals and hufs.

Small taxpayers can obtain lower TDS certificate electronically,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/small-taxpayers-can-obtain-lower-tds-certificate-electronically/articleshow/127875204.cms,"Representative image

In a relief to small taxpayers, the finance minister has proposed to give them an option to file applications for obtaining lower or nil TDS certificates electronically.A taxpayer typically applies for a lower or nil TDS certificate when their actual tax liability for the year is lower than the standard TDS rate (or nil) so that excess tax is not deducted upfront and blocked as a refund.Presently, under Section 395 of the Income-Tax Act, small taxpayers have to approach their jurisdictional income-tax officer to file a manual application to obtain such a certificate. The process involves follow-ups, and delays. Under the proposed framework, the payee may file an application electronically before the prescribed income-tax authority, which may issue the certificate electronically, subject to the fulfillment of prescribed conditions.Explaining the proposal, Dipesh Jain, Partner, Economic Laws Practice, said, “The amendment is a targeted compliance-relief measure introduced for small taxpayers as an alternative to the existing manual process. The change is expected to enhance ease of compliance without diluting the substantive safeguards governing grant of such certificates.” While Ameet Patel, partner at Manohar Chowdhry & Associates, welcomed the move, he said, “Going by experience, it would be interesting to see how this would work practically. How much will the applicant be able to explain through electronic means is a big question mark. Like all faceless initiatives, this too is a noble one. But whether it becomes a boon or a bane - only time will tell.”","A taxpayer typically applies for a lower or nil tds certificate when their actual tax liability for the year is lower than the standard tds rate (or nil) under the proposed framework, the payee may file an application electronically before the prescribed income-tax authority, which may issue the certificate electronically.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127875219,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-655498,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
New excise duty on tobacco products: Cigarette prices to increase up to Rs 55 per pack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-excise-duty-on-tobacco-products-cigarette-prices-to-increase-up-to-rs-55-per-pack/articleshow/127842714.cms,"Growth Momentum Will Continue Says FM Sitharaman As Budget 2026 Bets On Tech Cities And Reforms

After the new excise duty regime kicked in, cigarette prices have gone up, with a pack of 10 sticks now costing at least Rs 22–25 more than before.This follows the government’s decision to raise taxes on cigarettes for the first time in nearly seven years, bringing India’s tobacco taxation closer to global public health norms. The new levies, approved by Parliament in December, will replace the existing GST compensation cess framework that has been in place since the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017.The increase in cigarette prices will vary depending on the length and type of cigarette.According to distributors, premium cigarettes of 76 mm length will now cost Rs 50–55 more per pack of 10 sticks, depending on the brand.While manufacturers are yet to issue revised MRP declarations, distributors have begun billing old stock to retailers with 40% GST.With wholesale markets shut on Sunday, distributors expect fresh stock with new MRPs to be lifted from Monday onwards.According to news agency PTI, a packet of Wills Navy Cut (76 mm), earlier priced at Rs 95 per pack of 10 sticks, is expected to cost around Rs 120 per pack.Cigarettes of 84 mm length—such as Gold Flake Kings and Lights, Wills Classic and Wills Classic Milds—currently priced at Rs 170 per pack of 10 sticks, are expected to cost between Rs 220 and Rs 225 per pack.Similarly, slim cigarettes such as Classic Connect (97 mm), priced at Rs 300 for a pack of 20 sticks, are expected to have an MRP of around Rs 350, the report said.However, distributors fear that the price hikes could lead to increased smuggling and the spread of counterfeit products. According to the All India Cigarette and Tobacco Distributors Federation (AICPDF), there are around 8,000–9,000 stockists of cigarettes and tobacco products across the country.“Some companies have already put their stocks on hold. They will start releasing them after billing under the new tax structure,” a stockist told PTI.“Tobacco products are among the few categories where small shopkeepers are still relevant. If this too is pushed into the hands of illicit networks, what will be left for honest retailers? This is not just about taxation—it is about survival,” he said.From February 2026, cigarettes and tobacco products will attract additional excise duty and cess over and above the highest 40% GST slab, replacing the current structure of 28% GST plus compensation cess.The Central Excise Act has also been amended to impose a per-stick excise duty on cigarettes, with rates varying according to length.","A pack of 10 sticks now costs at least rs 22–25 more than before.

Vivek Chaturvedi

is confident about meeting Budget targets and details number of

reform measures

that have been announced to shore up approvals using technology. Excerpts:

A number of reform measures have been announced on the Customs side in the Budget. What is the strategy behind this?

There is a lot of emphasis on using technology to speed up approvals. What are the next steps?

Are you confident of meeting the Budget targets on the Customs duty receipts for FY27?

How do you see

GST revenues

after rate rationalisation?

■ The FM, in her budget announcement, said, the focus is definitely on Customs, primarily on two parts. One is a lot of Customs duty exemptions on goods and the second is simplification of processes and trying to ease certain pain points which could lead to bottlenecks, which could lead to faster dwell time of cargo, ease of congestion, quicker turnaround time for businesses. Both sets of measures also complement each other.Now on the rates part, it’s been a very carefully calibrated and nuanced approach that we have taken. It’s not really a rationalisation whole hog if you look at it. It’s been very specific. We’ve looked at our energy security. We’ve done away with Customs duties for setting up nuclear power plants. We have provided exemption for import of monazite which is a critical rare earth and goes into manufacture of magnets for electric vehicles. There are several measures that have been announced.For ease of living, we have done reforms on baggage rules that will help people who travel abroad, tourists. Since 2016 baggage rules have not been amended. There was a 10-year hiatus.■ We already have a strong IT backbone. What is currently the state of play is that it’s dispersed. We are trying to create one integrated system. There is a two year time frame for this.The expression of interests are out and we hope to have vendors appointed soon. The idea, to have an integrated application and it will lead to a better user experience, faster turnaround time, and more agility. If I need to assess a risk, why should I have a half an hour window for assessing a risk? The risk assessment should be instantaneous. We are trying to do. Once we are able to further strengthen the IT backbone, we will also be in a position to also roll out more and more agile services to our stakeholders.■ We have been very conservative in our estimates. The targets will be met.■ Look, if you look at the collection figures that came on Sunday, they are more or less comparable, slightly more than the figures of Jan 25. And Jan 25 was prior to the rationalisation. With this sort of developments on the supply side and the way revenues are, if not in immediate terms, gradually things will pick up and ultimately we should have resilience of the economy and growth of GDP taking care of revenue buoyancy.","Cbic chairman vivek chaturvedi is confident of meeting budget targets on the customs duty receipts for fy27.

Expenditure secretary V Vualnam says fiscal prudence was a clear priority for govt and within the constraints of the Budget, it has rolled out support for critical sectors. Excerpts:

Can you help us understand the overall strategy behind the spending plan? How much flexibility on raising capex does govt have given the committed spending towards salaries, pension and interest payments?

What about committed spending?

Do you think this has peaked given the fact that in the last two years you were near the target but not fully achieved it?

How do you see the absorptive capacity in Railways, metro rail networks or there’s need to shift focus?

So will there be more PPPs in Railways?

What kind of projects would these be? Will it include tracks?

■ The key point is that the focus on capex is clear. In midst of all uncertainties, capex and building up infrastructure is well recognised everywhere. It has a multiplier effect, the way it helps all parts of economy. It is a recognition of that and the commitment to ensure that that continues and therefore increase is also based on that line of thinking.■ That constraint or tightness remains. It's a reality. But within that we have managed fairly well. The fiscal prudence side was a clear priority for the finance minister and for everyone in govt. We have been able to focus and support sectors and interventions which are a priority, like the rare earth corridor.■ I would not say yes or no because infrastructure should be created and the Budget provides for capex. Within that financing structures are also changing, and new modalities are coming up. Highways are quite advanced now into various types of PPP. So, the Rs 2 lakh crore we give, something more is added or annuity is stretched out and therefore they are able to do this.■ Absorptive capacity is there, especially the railways. Our country requires it.Dedicated freight corridor, whatever is getting ready, is promising. The almost doubling of average speed which freight trains are able to achieve inside the dedicated freight corridor is something which is really transformative.The financing structure is something we no longer would like to go in the old style of everything being EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts. In highway sector we found that, not only financing, quality of construction also improves. There's a stake in maintaining it for 15 years or the period that is mentioned in the contract. These are the benefits of this kind of collaboration.■ In Railways it should start. Once it starts it will move well. You know it's an engineering, qualified team. A team which is handling ops at a high volume. The bandwidth is there. It is just that the mechanism has to come into place. They have prepared a cabinet note on PPP.■ It can be practically anything. Station development is one of the immediate possibilities. The potential is huge. The kind of business that they do: passenger traffic, cargo, there is enough. On station development, Bhopal is a beginning, and a lot of learnings will come from that. They've identified New Delhi. They are trying again now.","V vualnam says fiscal prudence was a clear priority for govt. Says within the constraints of the budget, it has rolled out support for critical sectors.

You have presented nine Budgets. How difficult is policy-making or Budget-making against the backdrop of how the world has changed?

Given your track record in achieving Budget targets, have you been a little conservative with your estimates on deficit and tax, which included significant giveaways this year due to income tax and GST reduction?

What kind of measures should we expect on widening the tax base?

You spoke about helping small taxpayers with compliance and easier filing. What kind of income level are you looking at?

Decriminalisation in the income tax law was a major announcement. You spoke about maximum two-year jail and no rigorous imprisonment. How will this work? Will the income tax department be less aggressive?

There is a lot of focus on simplifying customs processes and reposing more trust. You had reduced the number of slabs last year. Going forward, will you rewrite the law and reduce slabs further?

You have persisted with robust capex. Is there firepower in case the global situation turns adverse? Are you seeing a pick-up in private sector investments?

You have pitched it as a Yuva Shakti Budget. What prompted you to focus on youth?

There is a partnership on education and skilling. How can the private sector help in this?

What will be the focus of the orange economy?

Is this to prepare the workforce for the future and also fill the skill gap, especially in areas where there may be challenges in future such as geriatrics?

On STT, you have stated that the intent is to protect retail investors from excessive speculation. Could this have been handleddifferently, since some foreign investors — who are already exiting the market — will have to face additional costs?

You have introduced capital gains tax on sovereign gold bonds for those who purchase from the secondary market. What is the intent behind the move?

Gold and silver prices have gone up significantly and anecdotally, it appears that some investors are getting overexuberant about getting into these two commodities. Is there a need to sensitise investors?

Given that we are signing several FTAs, have you also factored them to prepare industry to take advantage of these agreements?

You have not made specific reference to the states despite elections in five states. Why?

Some people said that you wore a

Kanjivaram

sari for Tamil Nadu and not one from Bengal. Last year you wore a Madhubani sari. You didn’t name the states.

You have allocated Rs 95,000 crore for G Ram G. The opposition has raised its concern over the scheme, including on cost-sharing between the Centre and the states. How do you respond to it?

Can you help us understand the disinvestment and asset monetisation plan? Also, do instruments like REITs address concerns that officers have on land sale or PSU privatisation?

One of the success stories last year was the turnaround of power discoms due to reforms-linked incentives to states and also regulations issued by the Centre. Does this focus need to continue?

Last time, when the Finance Commission report had come, the Centre was attacked and now balance seems to have been restored. But states, irrespective of political colour, have demanded an increase in the share, while the Centre has argued that it has to meet defence and other spending needs, including those related to health, education and even jobs.

You have announced several steps but you did not undertake major reforms in the Budget and instead sought to steady the ship, taking a middle path...

Govt has rationalised subsidies in the oil sector, but not so much in food and in fertiliser. It’s a politically difficult thing to do. Given that poverty levels have come down, when can the Centre and statesdecide on beneficiaries, because some of the people may not need that subsidy now?

Net FDI has been a bit of a concern. The focus is on increasing inward FDI. How much of a dampener is the current global environment and how will you pitch India as a more attractive destination?

How much of a policy concern is outward FPI flow and the impact that it is having on the rupee and the overall sentiment?

Will the high-level committee look only at banking reforms or on the financial sector as a whole?

How will the infrastructure risk fund work?

You have presented nine Budgets; which one do you see as a milestone?

All constructive?

A day after presenting her ninth Budget , finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke at length on a range of topics with TOI’s Sidhartha and Surojit Gupta. While she is confident the domestic situation is under control, she feels her biggest challenge ‘will be external’FM: It’s largely the global situation rather than domestic factors. Domestic situation is well under control in terms of supply-side problems and inflation; consumption has had a good boost. The latest GST numbers show that consumption is sustained at the level that is giving good yields. So, my challenge will be external.Yes, there are new challenges because of changes in the world. Even at the time of Covid, Budget-making was a challenge. Post revival, we thought of how to step up growth and sustain it — even that was a challenge. Every Budget has its own set of challenges, and it is not just because of global uncertainty.Beyond this, I will be stretching my assessment. You have rightly pointed to tax giveaways. GST will not immediately give a big number (collection after rate rejig), although Jan’s data surprised everybody. So, I have to be realistic. I will have to work to expand the tax base on the direct tax side and build a land monetisation pipeline.Two or three things, which are already in practice but will mature. Using information from AI data analytics, you are able to see where money is being spent and you can check if a return is filed. If not, there will be a nudge pointing to the expenditure. The logic behind connecting TDS to large expenditures will be carried forward. If you have assets abroad, please disclose them. That’s not to say we are going to go after everybody. There will also be deep tech analysis of who’s spending huge amounts and then we will approach taxpayers or non-payers and convince them to come on board and widen the base.Tax mitras will help many small businesses, which want assistance and want to be confident about the returns. That is why through the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, cost accountants, or ICSI, we want to come up with a set of professionals who offer service at an affordable rate so that small businesses can seek their help and are assured that it is being done by a professional. We received suggestions in this regard and that’s why we decided on this.We’ll pursue where we need to pursue but not excessively go after (people). The judiciary can, of course, look at the gravity of the offence and then decide if imprisonment is needed or not and if it can be converted into some kind of penalty. We’ll give an option of paying a fee and get away without going to jail. For a few offences, imprisonment provision will still be there, may be cases of fraud or some other serious offence. It will be for the court to decide on imprisonment or letting a person pay some money and go away.That’s been happening for the last two years. They are already working on it (rewriting). Some are disclosed in this Budget; they (the department) will carry forward that work. It’s time-consuming work.There is certainly a pick-up in private sector investments. I hope, with the kind of India’s domestic market and the robustness seen in exports, there will be further growth in private investments.We received so many inputs from them. The PM participated in the My Bharat dialogue. For education, skilling and entrepreneurship, we have set up a standing committee. You will be able to acquire skills before completing your education and it will help you become an entrepreneur. Two-three ministries will work together. Youth is not just about men. In rural areas, there are several Lakhpati Didis. In Nagaland, due to the rural employment programme, many have become businesswomen. There is a way to move from self-help groups to entrepreneurship, that’s why SHE-Marts came about.I have announced waterways, which pass through the mineral corridor and some, where Nishads live. This community is skilled in repairing and making boats. At the institutes of excellence, they can acquire further skills on maintenance and other aspects. Seaplanes in coastal areas will also create jobs for the youth.We are working with industry on skilling, because in this age of technology, govt can’t work alone. Industry’s requirements are continuously evolving.It will be on AVCG, animation, cartoon videography and gaming. In Japan, Studio Ghibli has been able to integrate man-made pictures with technology and share Ramayana. We need to do all this in India. The idea is not just about content creators but there are several other elements.India’s population is aging and there will be a need for services for which manpower should be made ready. We are constantly, and rightly so, looking to educate children to become doctors and nurses and we still need to support that. But we also need paramedics, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiologists. Even that cadre needs support. That is why we made a mention of that one lakh additional Allied Health Professionals.They are not coming into options. Can we compensate 90% of the retail investors who are losing money in the F&O segment? It is not for the cash segment. We have only touched the F&O trade, which is highly speculative. I have received calls from many parents saying their children are severely losing money, and also seeking govt intervention. The STT hike in F&O will act as a deterrence so that people do not go headlong with that.Original intent was that you will hold the bonds till maturity. It’s not buying and selling, we were asking you to invest and leave it there.I don’t think we have seen individual citizens buying and selling. Gold price is fluctuating in the global market because of different reasons. Even central banks in various countries are investing in gold. Investment by consumers in gold is a personal choice.Very clearly, we are supporting labourintensive sectors such as leather, textile, sports goods, marine products and shrimps. It will boost exports.(Laughs) We have steps for electionbound states. Mineral corridor, rare earth corridor for Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Actually, others can complain that Tamil Nadu has got defence and a rare earth corridor. Kerala economy depends on coconut, somewhat Tamil Nadu. Cashew for Kerala.I can’t wear three saris on the same day. I mentioned Kerala, Tamil Nadu and in West Bengal Dankuni, Durgapur, Siliguri. I mentioned high-speed train in Chennai.It shows that we are committed to the cause of taking care of people who need jobs on demand. When we hiked it to 125 days from 100 days, people said, how will we do it. We allocated the money to meet that demand. We have also given money for that old scheme, MNREGA, because payment has to be made. Utilisation certificates will come later, so we are not denying that money, it’s a substantial amount. I have allocated Rs 95,000 crore for VBG RAM G and Rs 30,000 crore for MNREGA. So, let us see what campaign they want to run now. In their tenure, having brought this law, they didn’t give one-tenth of this. Even though 100 days was promised, the demand was less.The demand was spurious; CAG also commented on it. Someone over 80 years old was going to dig ponds, they are all getting funds under MNREGA. That is why, in this scheme, we have brought a setup where the state govt also has a skin in the game. You think in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, there will be large demand for work under MNREGA, but demand is not so much. States, which say we are developed, we are contributing to GDP but don’t get that kind of money back (from the Centre), see demand under MNREGA go up so much. So, these things will get controlled.You spoke of REITs by central PSUs. Will it be a significant part of the Rs 80,000 crore that you have budgeted for under assetmonetisation. You also mentioned more public floats by PSUs.As an instrument REIT has worked well. Pension funds which come into India also have confidence that the instrument is very effective and they will be happy to invest. On your point on officers being more comfortable, I understand that, but it is not for that reason that a substantial number of land monetisation work has not happened. Some departments which have enough land assets are unable to carve out land parcels due to litigation or are not free of encumbrances. You need a pipeline with parcels or assets that are encumbrance-free; only then can you find an interested buyer. In the past, progress has been affected due to these sorts of things.Yes, this has to continue; it has to be sustained.First, I won’t comment on the Finance Commission report. Cabinet has seen it, approved it and that is why I tabled it in the House. It won’t be right on my part to comment on a constitutional body’s recommendation. The Centre will have to look at its revenue sources and that’s why disinvestment and other things, non-tax revenue, will actually be improved upon. Without that we are going to have to face a lot of challenges because our demands are mounting whether it is defence, whether it is pay commission which is yet to submit its report. Whether it is also skilling or health activities, or the semiconductor mission, agriculture and farming or R&D, all need to get support. Central govt is funding and that cannot come down. So, we will have to look at sources of revenue.There are reforms outside the Budget, too. It is not middle path. Since 2014, we have undertaken several reforms outside the Budget, labour codes, IBC, GST. Even now, IBC has returned from IBC, we are planning to amend the Companies Act. There is a lot of reform outside the Budget. We focus a lot on the Budget, and rightly so, but you need to factor in reforms outside the Budget, too. Reforms are for the development of the country and for faster growth. Whatever is needed will be done.That’s a call which different ministries will have to sit together and take. I am not commenting either this way or that way, but it involves so many different factors. We also need the Census data because we still have 2011 data and it’s been 15 years since then. The new Census itself will give us some direction on how many people are below poverty (line), what is the kind of spread there, and where they are present.Globally, fund movement is determined by the strategic considerations elsewhere, not just for India. Second, the reason why we are constantly talking about part B of the Budget is because of the various proposals that we have come up with for making India a better destination for investment, for job creation. Steps are taken with an expectation that we will be able to get over some of the systemic glitches which existed earlier. We are moving in the direction of making India a better and attractive investment destination, but fund flows depend on many other factors, which are beyond India. Norway and Canada are speaking to me, speaking to the commerce minister (Piyush Goyal) on investing more in India and how we can facilitate that. We are working with the counterparts concerned to enable that.I am here to make sure that the macroeconomic fundamentals are strengthened. Policy will enable it. Ease of doing business will make India an attractive destination. Funds come, funds go and I am not saying it is not important. We need funds. We welcome them and we will work to get them.Banking. Basically, it will help us prepare the roadmap for 2047Many of the risk which investors face will have to be supported by some measure or the other. That’s why we have come up with this. The finer details are being worked out.Each Budget is a challenge. Each Budget is a sort of rigorous exercise. And I have a sense of satisfaction about each of them for the context in which they were made.I am not sure if any of my Budgets were populist, all of them have sought to be constructive.",You have presented nine budgets. How difficult is policy-making or budget-making against the backdrop of how the world has changed? Have you been a little conservative with your estimates on deficit and tax? What kind of measures should we expect on widening the tax base?,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127875255,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1268392,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Budget 2026: 10 Changes In Income Tax Rules That Will Reshape How Indians Save And File Returns

MUMBAI: Government bond yields hardened on Monday, with the benchmark 10-year paper closing at a more than one-year high as a larger-than-expected borrowing programme weighed on demand ahead of the policy meeting, even as the rupee posted its best gains since Dec.The benchmark 10-year yield settled at around 6.77%, sharply higher than the previous session and its highest close since mid-Jan 2025. On Friday, it had ended near 6.7%, up from about 6.5% three months ago. Bond markets were shut on Sunday.The rupee rose about 47 paise to close at 91.51 to the dollar, marking its strongest single-day gain in over a month. The move followed likely dollar sales and modest inflows that helped offset global volatility. On Friday, the currency had touched an all-time intraday low of 91.99 before ending at 91.98.Yields are up nearly 18 basis points so far this year, driven by expectations of higher bond supply from the Centre and states.Concerns intensified after the Budget announced record gross market borrowing of Rs 17.2 lakh crore for 2026–27, nearly Rs 1 lakh crore above expectations.“Net market borrowing came in as expected (Rs 11.7 lakh crore) but gross market borrowing was higher (Rupees 17.2 ).It’s possible that the RBI switches or government buybacks reduce some of the pressure, but that is only a hope for now,” said Pranjul Bhandari, economist with HSBC. According to Bhandari, while the govt met its FY26 fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP, it has opted for a gentler consolidation path of 4.3% for FY27, the smallest consolidation in six years.The Budget also pointed to a slower pace of fiscal consolidation, targeting a debt-to-GDP ratio of 55.6% and a fiscal deficit of 4.3% of GDP next year.In bond market, participants trimmed longer-duration exposure after the Budget and shifted to 1–3 year maturities, expecting liquidity support to cap short-end yields. Bond purchases in the secondary market and scheduled buying operations offered some relief, with markets awaiting further measures and expecting policy rates to remain unchanged.","The benchmark 10-year yield settled at around 6.77%, sharply higher than the previous session.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

The Union Budget 2026 was largely in line with our modest expectations and underscored continuity in the government’s fiscal approach over the past five years, rather than delivering any high-impact near-term stimulus. The policy thrust remains firmly tilted toward public capex, with capital expenditure budgeted to rise 11.5% YoY to Rs 12.2t in FY27E, supporting sectors leveraged to the investment cycle.A key highlight was the government’s intent to attract global investment into data centres, which could drive incremental opportunities across digital infrastructure and utilities. Further, strategic sectors such as semiconductors and electronics manufacturing services, defence, chemicals, and select industrial manufacturing stand out as potential beneficiaries, aided by targeted incentives, production-linked schemes, and the development of dedicated industrial parks—reinforcing a constructive medium-term investment outlook.For the healthcare sector, the budget not only provides financial assistance but also highlights the government’s efforts to prepare Indian companies to gain business on global healthcare platforms.The measures to market ‘India’ for medical tourism, supported with enhancing the resource pool (doctors/nurses), would enable increased international patient flow. The government will support states in establishing five regional medical hubs in partnership with the private sector, which is expected to be supportive for large hospital operators with strong operational presence.The Union Budget 2026-27 reinforces the government’s commitment to promoting clean and emerging technologies across the energy value chain.Viability gap funding (VGF) support for battery energy storage systems (BESS) is proposed to increase sharply to Rs 10b, a tenfold rise from Rs 1b in FY26RE, which is positive for IPPs such as ACME Solar, which have undertaken BESS projects.The capital outlay for Defense was hiked to Rs 2.2t for FY27 (up 18% YoY) vs. Rs 1.9t in FY26RE. The Sharp 18% year-on-year increase in defense capital expenditure directly benefits indigenized defense electronics and order inflows.Bharat Electronics is well-positioned to capitalize on sizable orders including QRSAM, Akash-NG, next-generation corvettes, and base programs.Capital expenditure remains the central pillar of the Budget’s growth strategy. Central government capex rises to about Rs 12.2t in FY27, registering an 11.5% increase over the revised estimates for FY26.Larsen & Toubro’s prospect pipeline stands at a healthy Rs 5.9t, up 7% YoY, diversified across infrastructure, hydrocarbons, carbon, and hi-tech segments. Strategic focus on urban development, renewables, gas, AI, and data centres supports strong opportunity visibility across domestic and international markets.We are optimistic about the domestic tourism industry, with demand consistently exceeding pre-Covid levels. Hotel companies expanding into tier-II and below cities will benefit from the government’s push for tourism.Lemon Tree Hotels continues to demonstrate resilient performance, driven by strong ARR growth and strategic property additions. Aurika Mumbai and other flagship properties are expected to drive double-digit RevPAR growth in 2HFY26.The fact that the government would continue its infrastructure push is a key indirect positive for auto and auto ancillaries. The increase in PLI allocation, move toward establishment of rare earth corridor and provision of 4k e-buses for East Tourism highlight its continued focus on EV transition.We expect the auto segment to sustain its momentum on the back of a positive consumer sentiment, both in urban and rural and steady economic growth expected in FY27.The Union Budget 2026-27 gives a substantial manufacturing push (electronics and infrastructure) that should support demand for cables & wires. Long-term tax holiday until 2047 for foreign companies that provide cloud services globally using data centre infrastructure located in India – will attract investment in Indian data centre capacity, which would drive growth for cables. Polycab remains a strong structural play on India’s electrification, infrastructure and real estate upcycle.The Union Budget 2026-27 announcements and initiatives are aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and competitiveness in the Indian EMS sector. The introduction of an ISM 2.0, Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS), Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS), EMC/EMC2.0 and doubling of outlay under the ECMS scheme promote cost-efficient manufacturing.These steps should position India as a growing hub for electronics production, offering significant growth opportunities. EMS companies will leverage these initiatives by expanding domestic production.Capex for FY27BE is pegged at Rs 12.2t, compared to Rs 11.0t in FY26RE. The infrastructure sector accounts for ~60% of the total domestic steel demand, with construction at ~20% and automobiles at ~8%.Domestic steel demand is expected to improve with higher capex and recent GST rate cuts on auto, consumer durables and other sectors. Tata Steel is well placed to benefit from improving steel realizations, operating efficiencies, and robust domestic demand.Cement demand has improved after remaining weak for 1.5 years. Industry volume grew ~7-8% YoY in 3QFY26, with strong demand momentum after the monsoon and festive periods.The government's increased allocation to overall capex (up ~12% to Rs 12.2t vs. 2025-26RE) is expected to indirectly benefit cement demand. We now estimate industry volume growth to be ~8% YoY in FY26E (vs. earlier estimate of 6-7%). We believe Ultratech is well positioned to leverage the strong demand uptrend given its large scale of operation and strong brand equity.",Motilal oswal financial services shares its top 10 stock picks that investors can consider buying. Capital expenditure remains the central pillar of the budget’s growth strategy. Central government capex rises to about rs 12.2t in fy27.

Budget 2026: 10 Changes In Income Tax Rules That Will Reshape How Indians Save And File Returns

STT hike to cool F&O frenzy

Buyback tax overhaul: What it means

NRIs get wider access to Indian equities

Borrowing to invest?

Stock market's panic-stricken sentiment on Budget Day

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

The Budget for FY 2026-27 is a mix of cautious and reform- oriented measures for stock market investors. The government proposed tougher norms for trading in futures and options, along with new opportunities for foreign Indian investors.During her speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an increase in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on Futures and Options (F&O), a change in the taxation regime for share buybacks, and improved access for non-resident Indians to equities.In a move aimed at discouraging excessive speculation in derivatives, the government has proposed a steep increase in Securities Transaction Tax on futures and options trades.The STT on futures will rise to 0.05 per cent from 0.02 per cent, while the tax on options premium and exercise of options will both increase to 0.15 per cent. Currently, these stand at 0.1 per cent and 0.125 per cent, respectively.Market participants say the higher transaction costs could dampen trading volumes, particularly among retail traders, arbitrageurs and short-term participants. The move comes amid regulatory concerns that a large majority of individual traders in the F&O segment continue to incur losses.Policymakers appear to be prioritising moderation in derivatives activity over revenue gains, especially as higher taxes may themselves reduce volumes.""The measured increase in STT on futures and options reflects a clear intent to curb excessive speculation, fostering a more stable market and encouraging sustainable participation from long-term retail and institutional investors,"" Vishal Kampani, vice chairman and managing director at JM Financial Ltd, told TOI.Meanwhile, talking about retail investors' perspective, Archit Gupta, Founder and CEO, ClearTax told TOI, ""The Budget’s hike in STT, by 150% on Futures and 50% on Options, sends a clear signal: the government wants to slow down excessive short-term trading. Even though STT collections stayed flat at around Rs 45,000 crore (from FY2425 to FY2625) against a Rs 78,000 crore target, the bigger story lies in the investor behaviour. Retail participation hasn’t fallen; it has evolved. With over 21 crore demat accounts and record SIP inflows of Rs 31,000 crore+ in 2025, we’re seeing a shift from frequent trading to long-term investing. The policy choice is clear - support steady capital formation over short-term transaction revenue.""The Budget also overhauled the taxation on share buybacks in a move said to be aimed at protecting minority shareholders and curb tax arbitrage by promoters.Share buyback, also known as share repurchase, is a process through which a company purchases its own outstanding shares from the market or directly from its shareholders. The primary reason for share buybacks is to distribute excess cash to the shareholders, improve financial ratios such as EPS, and/or express confidence in the future business operations of the company.In extension, a buyback tax is a imposed on companies when they repurchase their own shares from shareholders. Governments typically use this tax to discourage firms from returning profits through buybacks instead of distributing them as dividends.Buybacks will now be taxed as capital gains in the hands of all shareholders, replacing the earlier structure that often led to uneven tax outcomes. However, to control misuse, promoters will face an additional buyback tax, pushing the effective tax rate to 22 per cent for corporate promoters and 30 per cent for non-corporate promoters. ""Change in taxation of buyback was brought in to address the improper use of buyback route by promoters,"" said Sitharaman.Experts believe this could make buybacks less attractive for promoter groups and encourage companies to reconsider capital allocation strategies, possibly shifting toward dividends, capital expenditure or research and development. For individual investors, however, the change could mean a more favourable tax treatment compared to being taxed at the highest income slab rates earlier.Roop Bhootra, Whole-time Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers, said the proposal benefits individual shareholders, as their tax burden would fall from the highest slab rate of 30 per cent to capital gains tax rates — 20 per cent for short-term and 12.5 per cent for long-term gains. However, he noted that the move is negative for corporates, as it discourages buybacks and may prompt companies to deploy reserves toward capital expenditure or research and development instead, as quoted by PTI.The buyback tax framework currently in force was introduced in Budget 2024 and became effective from October 1, 2024. Under these rules, the tax burden on share buybacks was shifted from companies to shareholders. Amounts received by shareholders from a buyback are treated as dividend income and taxed according to the shareholder’s applicable income tax slab. The company undertaking the buyback is required to deduct Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) before making the payment.For resident individuals, TDS is deducted at 10 per cent if the buyback proceeds are Rs 5,000 or more. For non-resident individuals, TDS is deducted at 20 per cent, subject to relief under an applicable tax treaty.At the same time, the cost of acquisition of the shares tendered in the buyback is treated as a capital loss in the hands of the shareholder. This loss may be classified as short-term or long-term depending on the holding period and can be set off against other capital gains or carried forward for up to eight assessment years.In a market-friendly reform, the government has proposed allowing individual Persons Resident Outside India (PROI) to invest in shares of listed Indian companies through the Portfolio Investment Scheme.The investment limit for an individual PROI will be raised to 10 per cent from 5 per cent, while the overall cap for all such investors will increase to 24 per cent from the current 10 per cent.Market experts said the move could broaden India’s investor base, improve liquidity and bring in more stable, long-term capital. By attracting overseas Indians who understand domestic market dynamics, the reform may also help reduce dependence on more volatile institutional flows and support currency stability over time.To discourage borrowing for investments in the stock market and mutual funds, the finance minister has proposed disallowing the deduction of interest paid on such loans against investment income.Currently, investors who take loans to buy shares or mutual fund units can claim the interest paid as a deduction—up to 20% of the income earned—against dividends or other investment income, with the remaining amount taxed under ‘income from other sources’. Under the proposed change, this tax benefit would be withdrawn.Ameet Patel, chief risk partner at Manohar Chowdhry & Associates, said the move aligns with the government’s repeated concerns over excessive speculation in capital markets. “Time and again, we have heard from regulators and the government that there is too much speculation in the capital markets, which is not in the interest of common investors. This proposal is a clear move to discourage investors from borrowing money to invest in securities,” he said.Stock markets reacted sharply to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget 2026 speech, with the Nifty50 falling below 25,000 and the BSE Sensex dropping over 1,600 points in early trading. Investors were spooked by the hike in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options, which raised trading costs and prompted aggressive selling in brokerage, exchange, and high-volume market stocks. The performance did not improve much by closing. Sensex was at 1,546.84 points to close at 80,722.94, while the Nifty fell 495.20 points to settle at 24,825.45.The downturn quickly spread beyond derivatives-related counters, with heavyweights like Reliance Industries and State Bank of India also declining. Small- and mid-cap indices fell 2–3 per cent, reflecting broad-based risk aversion.While Budget 2026 supports infrastructure, manufacturing, and digital-led growth, the absence of capital gains tax relief and the STT hike create short-term headwinds.Narendra Solanki, Head of Fundamental Research – Investment Services at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Limited, talked about his view on why the stock markets were reacting sharply. “Markets witnessed a knee-jerk reaction following the unexpected hike in STT on Futures and Options, as hopes of a reduction in capital gains tax had already been priced in,” he said.Meanwhile, Somil Mehta, Head of Retail research at Mirae Asset Sharekhan gave his insights on how to navigate the volatality now saying, ""The Budget is clearly supportive of infrastructure, manufacturing, and digital-led themes. However, the absence of capital gains tax relief and the increase in STT create near-term headwinds for the broader market. Investors should remain selective, focus on quality sectors with strong policy visibility, and avoid aggressive short-term bets. """"Defensive allocation and long-term positioning remain key in navigating post-Budget volatility.

"Budget eases transfer pricing norms, signals friendlier tax regime for tech MNCs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-eases-transfer-pricing-norms-signals-friendlier-tax-regime-for-tech-mncs/articleshow/127862330.cms,"Budget 2026: Indian FM’s Huge Income Tax Announcement | Latest Slabs, Old & New Regime Rates

The Budget has rolled out a sweeping reset of India’s transfer pricing framework, aiming to cut litigation, improve tax certainty and make the country a more attractive base for multinational companies (MNCs) and global capability centres.Presenting the proposals, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced far-reaching reforms to safe harbour rules and Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs), with a sharp focus on the IT and technology-driven sectors.A key change is the consolidation of software development, IT-enabled services, KPO and contract R&D into a single category of “Information Technology Services”, with a uniform safe harbour margin of 15.5%. This replaces multiple, higher margins and is expected to address long-standing disputes around classification and profitability. Safe harbour refers to prescribed pricing margins under which tax authorities accept a company’s transfer pricing without scrutiny, giving taxpayers certainty and protection from disputes.The eligibility threshold for opting into safe harbour has also been raised sharply from Rs.300 crore to Rs. 2,000 crore, significantly widening coverage to include mid-sized and large IT service providers. Applications will move to an automated, rule-based approval process, eliminating officer-level examination, and companies can lock in safe harbour for up to five consecutive years.“These changes are expected to significantly reduce disputes and compliance burden for many multinational IT companies and global capability centres operating from India,” said Ameya Kunte, founder of Globeview Advisors, adding that the reduction in acceptable margins from the earlier 17–18% range to 15.5% is a major sweetener for industry.According to CBDT data, a total of 815 Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) have been concluded till March 2025. The 174 APAs signed in 2024-25 is the highest ever in a single year since the APA regime was launched in 2012. APAs help eliminate long-drawn disputes over transfer pricing by setting agreed pricing methodologies in advance.The budget proposals strengthen the APA program. It proposes fast-tracking unilateral APAs for IT services, with an endeavour to conclude cases within two years, extendable by six months at the taxpayer’s request — a sharp improvement over historical timelines that often stretched beyond three years.Another significant reform allows associated enterprises of an APA-covered taxpayer to file modified returns within three months of the agreement being signed, aligning group-level tax positions.“The amendment gives associated enterprises a statutory route to align their own returns with the agreed pricing. This may reduce instances of economic double taxation within the group and materially strengthen the effectiveness of the APA programme,” said Rahul Charkha, partner, Economic Laws Practice.To curb procedural disputes, the Budget also replaces the existing 60-day deadline for transfer pricing officers to pass orders with a clearer month-based timeline, a move aimed at eliminating interpretational litigation over limitation periods.Industry experts see the package as a decisive shift towards certainty-led tax administration. “The expansion of safe harbour, automated approvals and faster APAs reflect a strong policy intent to simplify compliance and significantly reduce litigation,” said Sandeep Bhalla, partner, Dhruva Advisors.","The budget has rolled out a sweeping reset of india’s transfer pricing framework.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveiled the Union Budget 2026 on February 1, setting out a clear roadmap for individual taxpayers. While personal income tax rates and the broader structure of taxation stays untouched, the Budget introduced a range of reforms to further simplify the process for taxpayers. The measures focus on easing return-filing timelines, reducing tax collection at source on select transactions, and addressing long-standing practical difficulties faced by small taxpayers. The Budget also had measures for foreign asset holders.The finance minister said that the government completed a comprehensive overhaul of the existing tax law and is preparing taxpayers for a smoother transition. “In July 2024, I announced a comprehensive review of the Income Tax Act, 1961. This was completed in a record time and the Income Tax Act, 2025 will come into effect from 1st April, 2026,” she said.She added that compliance under the new framework is expected to be simpler. “The simplified Income Tax Rules and Forms will be notified shortly, giving adequate time to taxpayers to acquaint themselves with its requirements. The forms have been redesigned such that ordinary citizens can comply without difficulty,” Sitharaman said.The slab rates for individuals under both the new and old tax regimes will remain untouched in Budget 2026-2027. There are no proposed changes to education cess or surcharge either.Filing timelines for returns have been revised. Individuals filing ITR-1 and ITR-2 will continue to have a deadline of July 31, while non-audit business cases and trusts will now be allowed to file returns up to August 31. The window for revising returns will also be extended from December 31 to March 31, subjected to payment of a nominal fee.Tax collected at source on overseas tour packages will be reduced to a flat 2%, replacing the earlier 5% and 20 percent rates, irrespective of the amount spent. TCS on remittances for self-funded foreign education and overseas medical treatment under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme will also be reduced from 5% to 2%.For small taxpayers seeking nil or lower TDS certificates, a fully automated, rule-based approval mechanism will be introduced, replacing the current application-based process involving tax officers.Manpower services will now clearly fall under payments to contractors for TDS purposes, removing any confusion. TDS on these services will be charged at either 1% or 2%.To simplify matters for taxpayers holding securities across multiple companies, the FM proposed depositories to be collected Form 15G or Form 15H from investors and submit it directly to the respective companies.A one-time, six-month foreign asset disclosure scheme has been proposed to address issues faced by students, young professionals, tech employees and individuals relocating to or returning to India. The scheme covers two categories of taxpayers.At the same time, individuals who did not disclose foreign non-immovable assets valued below Rs 20 lakh will receive immunity from prosecution, with retrospective effect from October 1, 2024.Persons resident outside India will be permitted to invest in listed Indian equities through the Portfolio Investment Scheme, with the individual investment limit raised from 5% to 10% and the overall cap increased from 10% to 24%.For sale of immovable property involving non-residents, resident buyers can deduct and deposit tax deducted at source (TDS) using PAN-based challan, removing the need for a TAN and thus simplifying compliance.To attract global expertise, an exemption on foreign-sourced income has been granted to experts visiting India for up to five years, subject to conditions. The individual must have been a non-resident for the preceding five years, provide services under a government-notified scheme and meet other prescribed requirements.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman unveiled the union budget 2026 on february 1, setting out a clear roadmap for individual taxpayers.

Growth Momentum Will Continue Says FM Sitharaman As Budget 2026 Bets On Tech Cities And Reforms

When the 16th Finance Commission began work, one concern for the southern states was a fall in their share of tax transfers from the Centre. Having invested in population control and human development over decades, they did not want to be penalised for outperforming much of North India on these counts.The Finance Commission, headed by economist Arvind Panagariya, appears to have addressed these concerns by factoring states’ contribution to states’ combined GDP into the resource allocation formula. “This criterion captures the effect of various forms of efficiencies, including efficient spending and fiscal rectitude,” it said. Second, demographic performance has been defined as the inverse of population growth between 1971 and 2011.Third, the forest and ecology criteria have also been reworked.As a result, barring Tamil Nadu, the four southern states are better off, receiving a larger share of the devolution, which has been retained at 41% of the Centre’s tax collection. Similarly, Maharashtra and Gujarat are among gainers, while Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Rajasthan are among those that see a marginal decline in their share, although these states will still receive over 48% of total transfers (see table on right).It was a tough balance to strike for the Finance Commission, whose award period stretches from April 2026 to March 2031. In all, 18 of the 28 states pitched for a 50% share of the divisible pool, arguing that they needed additional resources for health, education, agriculture, drinking water, sanitation, welfare schemes and law and order.The Centre — without putting a number on it — argued for moderation in tax devolution, citing the need for higher spending on defence and for macroeconomic management. Many states, including those that pitched for under a 50% transfer, also argued that the Centre was increasingly relying on cesses and surcharges, which are not shared with states.The five-member panel rejected this plea, stating that these levies are meant for specific purposes and including them in the divisible pool would defeat their objective. The Centre’s subsidies are now more focused and better delivered, and the quality of spending has improved, the Finance Commission said. It praised tax reforms — both direct taxes and GST— while noting that there remains scope for further reforms in tax policy and administration to improve collections.In the states, however, the Commission flagged concerns over tax collections rising at a slower pace than economic growth. This has made states increasingly reliant on transfers from the Centre. Northeastern states, along with Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand, are among the most reliant on tax devolution, while Telangana, Haryana, Karnataka and Maharashtra lie at the other end of the spectrum, the report noted.The panel also cautioned states on rising subsidies and off-budget borrowings, and pointed to persistent stress in power distribution companies (discoms), recommending privatisation as a solution. Power accounts for the largest subsidy burden on states, estimated at 27% of total subsidies and transfers. For the Finance Commission, the bigger worry is the rapid rise of unconditional cash transfers across states, which will account for nearly a fifth of subsidies and transfers this year, compared with just 3% in 2018-19. These transfers are projected to touch close to Rs 2lakh crore.“The largest unconditional transfer schemes, as per the 2025-26 budget estimates, are the Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana in Maharashtra, Gruha Lakshmi in Karnataka and Lakshmir Bhandar in West Bengal,” the report said.","Four southern states are better off, receiving a larger share of the devolution. Maharashtra and gujarat are among gainers, while madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, west bengal, bihar and rajasthan are among those that see a marginal decline in their share. Northeastern states, along with uttar pradesh and bihar, are among the most reliant on tax devolved.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127854141,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-959016,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Subsidies, Jobs, AI Tool: FM Sitharaman Unveils Big Budget Boost For Agri Sector To Help Farmers

How will a person who has an income Rs 12 lakh benefit from new rates?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said.

With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden.Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.",Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: faqs answered. Finance minister nirmala sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime.
