RBI monetary policy: MPC likely to cut repo rate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-set-to-end-longest-rate-pause/articleshow/117962535.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI's monetary policy committee began its meeting on Wed and is expected to end its longest pause with a rate cut on Friday, the first in nearly five years.The last rate cut was in May 2020 when RBI lowered the repo rate to 4% to support the economy during the Covid-induced lockdown. It later raised rates seven times to 6.5% due to inflation amid the Ukraine war, supply chain disruptions, and global price surges. The pause has remained since Feb 2023.Most economists expect a 25bps cut, but some believe it would be premature if US President Donald Trump escalates tariff threats, worsening financial market volatility. Lower interest rates could also pressure the rupee, making US debt more attractive for foreign investors.Dipanwita Mazumdar , an economist at Bank of Baroda , said risks to growth from uncertainty, highlighted in the IMF's latest report, could prompt RBI to start cutting rates. ""For other economies, rate cuts began earlier, giving them room for a 'wait and watch' approach,"" she said. ""Balancing macro and geopolitical factors, we believe there is space for a 25bps rate cut.""The policy meeting includes two new RBI members - governor Sanjay Malhotra and deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao - who will be attending the meeting for the first time in place of their predecessors Shaktikanta Das and Michael Patra, respectively. Malhotra recently announced liquidity measures injecting Rs 1.5 lakh crore, seen as paving the way for rate transmission. A liquidity deficit could keep borrowing costs high even if RBI cuts rates. Govt has supported a rate cut.","Most economists expect a 25bps cut, but some believe it would be premature if us president donald trump escalates tariff threats.

Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.Yes, the limit of total income for NIL tax payments in the new tax regime has been increased to Rs. 12 lakhs in this budget provided the taxpayer files ITR to avail the rebate.Earlier the limit of income for nil tax payment was Rs 7 lakh. By increasing this limit to Rs 12 lakh around one crore assessees who were earlier required to pay tax varying from Rs 20,000 to Rs 80,000 will be now paying nil tax.Yes, a standard deduction of Rs. 75,000 is available to a tax payer in the new regime.

For example, for a person having income of Rs 12,10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax, works out to be Rs. 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakhs + 10% of Rs 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10 thousand). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-.The tax liability on such tax payer by way of slabs only is Rs 61,500. How ever a person having Rs 12 lakh income pays nil tax. By providing marginal relief it has been ensured that the tax payable by a person having income marginally above Rs 12 lakhs is required to pay only marginal amount of tax equal to the amount of income above Rs 12 lakhs so that his carry home is also Rs 12 lakhs. In this case he will be required to pay a tax of Rs 10,000.The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-(i) First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. In the answer given to question no.15 above, tax on the total income of Rs 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:(ii) Tax payable on total income of Rs 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.(iii) Now the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs 61,500) shall be compared with amount exceeding total income upto which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs 12,10,000 - Rs 12,00,000](iv) The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs 10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs 61,500) as tabulated above.(v) Therefore, in the above case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/- = 51,500/-) is allowed.(vi) Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500 - Rs 51,500]Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh!
