NEW DELHI: Centre’s gross direct tax collections went up 4.1% to Rs 21.5 lakh crore, dragged down by sluggish growth in income tax, where govt had offered significant concessions in the last budget.During the financial year up to Jan 11, non-corporate tax, as govt refers to income tax, was 1.2% higher at Rs 10.6 lakh crore, according to the latest data released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes. Corporation tax increased 7.7% to around Rs 10.5 lakh crore during this period.Refunds were, however, 16.9% lower at Rs 3.1 lakh crore with a 25% fall in the case of non-corporate tax (to Rs 1.3 lakh crore) and a 10% decline for corporate tax (Rs 1.8 lakh crore).On a net basis, collections were 8.8% higher at nearly Rs 18.4 lakh crore. “A 9% net collection growth is encouraging and seems to indicate that govt may be on track to achieve the yearend target. However, it is on the back of significantly lower refunds being released to both corporate and individual taxpayers. Exact details of why the trends on refunds diverging significantly from previous year are not very apparent,” said Rohinton Sidhwa, partner at Deloitte India.","During the financial year up to jan 11, non-corporate tax was 1.2% higher at rs 10.6 lakh crore.

Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the central excise act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from rs 2,050 to rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks.

"Budget: Budget proposes 30% TDS on net winnings in online games, removes threshold for TDS levy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-proposes-30-tds-on-net-winnings-in-online-games-removes-threshold-for-tds-levy/articleshow/97527935.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Budget 2026: Need for an overhaul of the TDS framework,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-need-for-an-overhaul-of-the-tds-framework/articleshow/126488694.cms,"The requirement to issue TDS and TCS certificates is increasingly seen as redundant. (AI image)

For transactions involving the purchase of tangible/material goods and for transactions undertaken through an electronic medium/platform (if not subject to GST), a withholding tax rate of 0.1 percent can be prescribed without any threshold limit.

For transactions involving the supply of any type of services (if not subject to GST), a withholding tax rate of 2 percent can be prescribed without any threshold limit.

For residuary transactions, such as withholding tax on interest and dividends (if not subject to GST), a withholding tax rate of 10 percent can be prescribed.

India’s tax deduction at source (TDS) framework, originally designed as a mechanism to ensure steady revenue inflows and improve tax compliance, has over the years become a source of complexity, cash-flow stress and litigation for businesses. With the scope of TDS expanding almost every year, tax experts argue that the time is ripe for a comprehensive rationalization of withholding tax provisions.At present, the withholding tax system is marked by a multiplicity of rates and thresholds. TDS and TCS rates range from as low as 0.1 per cent to as high as 30 per cent, depending on the nature of the transaction. This fragmented structure increases the risk of compliance errors, often leading to disputes, interest and penalties.“The current withholding tax framework involves multiple TDS and TCS rates, which creates significant complexity and an increased risk of compliance errors. Excessive withholding also results in liquidity constraints for taxpayers and additional administrative effort to seek refunds,” said Rohinton Sidhwa and Amit Bablani, partners at Deloitte India, in their pre-budget booklet.Data released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) underlines the scale of the problem.Income-tax refunds have risen sharply from Rs. 1.92 lakh crore in FY21 to Rs. 4.76 lakh crore in FY25. A substantial portion of these refunds is attributed to excess TDS and TCS, resulting in blocked working capital for businesses and higher interest outgo for the government.The Finance Act, 2024 took some steps towards simplification by reducing several 5 per cent TDS rates to 2 per cent and aligning the TDS rate to 0.1% on e-commerce transactions with that on purchase and sale of goods. However, tax professionals point out that the underlying structure remains cumbersome with lack of uniformity.One key reform proposal is to leverage the nationwide GST framework to reduce duplication. Since GST already provides a robust, invoice-level reporting mechanism, experts suggest that TDS and TCS should be eliminated for transactions where GST is applicable.Deloitte India recommends:Using GST to reduce TDS/TCS compliance: With the implementation of a Pan-India GST framework, a unified tax reporting system already exists. This can be effectively used to reduce TDS/TCS compliance. It is recommended that TDS/TCS be eliminated on all transactions where GST is applicable (per the invoice). The Income-tax Department can obtain information and track these transactions as needed by mandating an appropriate information return from suppliers. Suppliers are already filing such returns (GST returns), so there will not be any additional compliance.Simplified categorization of withholding tax provisions: Withholding tax provisions should be consolidated into three broad categories, as follows:Experts also flag the need to ease procedural burdens. The requirement to issue TDS and TCS certificates, for instance, is increasingly seen as redundant in an era where tax credits are reflected electronically through Form 26AS and AIS. Removing this obligation could significantly reduce compliance costs, especially for small and mid-sized businesses.Perhaps most contentious is the continued use of stringent prosecution provisions (Three months up to seven years) for delays in depositing TDS and TCS, even where taxes have been paid voluntarily along with interest. While the law provides for relief in cases of reasonable cause, industry feedback suggests that prosecution is often initiated mechanically, causing undue hardship.As India’s tax administration becomes increasingly data-driven, experts argue that the emphasis should shift from excessive withholding and penal action to trust-based compliance. A simpler, more predictable TDS regime could ease cash-flow pressures, reduce litigation and ultimately make tax compliance less adversarial—benefiting both taxpayers and the exchequer.","India’s tax deduction at source (tds) framework has over the years become a source of complexity, cash-flow stress and litigation for businesses.

By George Alexander Muthoot

Enabling financial inclusion through

Priority Sector Status

(PSL)

Gold-linked Credit Line

via

UPI

This idea came to me during a recent visit to one of our branches in Kochi, I met an old customer who is also an acquaintance. Our conversation ranged from everyday household needs to how deeply UPI has become part of daily financial life.

One simple question stayed with me: why should access to credit remain disconnected from the way people actually transact today?

That interaction led me to think about the possibility of a gold-linked credit line via UPI. Gold loans are already a trusted, secured product for households and small businesses. If such credit can be seamlessly linked to UPI, customers could access funds instantly when required, backed by idle gold jewellery, and at interest rates far lower than those charged by credit cards. We believe this can significantly improve access to affordable credit once NBFCs are enabled to integrate with the UPI ecosystem.

Rationalising exposure limits for Gold Loan NBFCs

Creating a Fair Framework for Retail NCD Investors

(George Alexander Muthoot is MD of Muthoot Finance)

Union Budget 2026 comes at a critical juncture for India’s growth journey. With political stability, resilient macro fundamentals and strong domestic demand, the government has an opportunity to deepen financial inclusion while accelerating credit-led growth. For the NBFC sector, particularly those focused on last-mile lending, the Budget can play a catalytic role in expanding access to affordable credit and strengthening household balance sheets.Targeted policy and regulatory interventions can significantly enhance the ability of formal financial institutions to serve small borrowers and micro-entrepreneurs. Our budget wishlist focuses on four key areas: enabling priority sector recognition for eligible gold loan NBFCs, leveraging digital public infrastructure to democratise credit, rationalising exposure limits and creating a fair and efficient framework for retail debt investors.We strongly advocate for granting PSL status to eligible gold loan NBFCs. Gold loans are mostly availed by small borrowers, often with ticket sizes below Rs 50,000, who rely on them to meet short-term liquidity needs such as medical expenses, education costs, agricultural inputs or working capital for micro-businesses.Currently, while banks enjoy PSL recognition for similar lending, gold loan NBFCs do not. This asymmetry limits the sector’s ability to scale responsibly and offer competitively priced credit.Granting PSL status would create a level playing field, lower the cost of funds and encourage NBFCs to expand outreach in semi-urban and rural markets.UPI has transformed the way individuals and small businesses transact. However, access to credit has not kept pace with this transformation. We propose the introduction of a gold-linked credit line via UPI, enabled for NBFCs. Under this framework, customers could monetise idle gold jewellery and access a revolving, secured credit line directly through UPI-enabled platforms. Such a facility would allow instant, need-based access to funds at interest rates in the range of 12-18%, significantly lower than what is charged by unsecured credit cards.The rationale is simple: gold loans are a trusted and well-understood product, while UPI is deeply embedded in daily financial life. Bringing the two together can dramatically improve access to affordable credit for households and small business owners, reduce dependence on high-cost borrowing, and promote responsible credit usage. In the short term, this could boost consumption and liquidity; over the medium term, it would strengthen household financial resilience and formalise borrowing behaviour.We also seek alignment of single counterparty exposure limits for gold loan NBFCs with those applicable to other NBFCs, set at 20% of Tier-1 capital. The current disparity constrains lending capacity despite gold loans being fully secured and historically demonstrating strong asset quality. Rationalising these limits would enable well-capitalised, regulated NBFCs to extend credit more efficiently, without compromising prudential safeguards.Retail investors play an important role in diversifying NBFC funding sources. However, current TDS provisions on listed NCDs mandates 10% TDS on interest - this creates avoidable compliance burdens, particularly when NCDs are traded on stock exchanges. Given that listed securities already provide a transparent audit trail of ownership and interest payments, simplifying or rationalising TDS norms would ease friction and improve market participation.Additionally, we recommend allowing a higher interest rate for retail investors, pensioners and senior citizens in public issues of secured NCDs, over and above rates offered to institutional investors. Retail investors often have different risk-return expectations and limited access to alternative fixed-income instruments. Offering appropriate incentives would encourage household participation in capital markets and support long-term savings.","Budget 2026 should introduce a gold-linked credit line via upi, enabled for nbfcs.

At present, the scheme offers Rs 4 crore per 4.8 TPD of capacity.IBA said it will share these recommendations with the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy and the Ministry of Finance, adding that it has raised the demands at multiple forums ahead of the Budget.The association said the capex cost of CBG plants has risen by over 50 per cent since the launch of the Central Financial Assistance (CFA) scheme in 2014, necessitating a revision in subsidy norms. It proposed that the enhanced subsidy structure be supported by a minimum corpus of Rs 10,000 crore, enabling projects of up to 20 TPD capacity.For Budget 2026, IBA said the biogas and CBG sector should be positioned as a fast-maturing pillar of green growth, which now requires deeper fiscal support, faster implementation and easier access to finance to unlock private investment and rural income opportunities.The association also called for scaling up project incentives by raising CFA levels, and proposed a mandated blending of fermented organic manure (FOM) in fertiliser use — at least 5 per cent by 2028, rising to 10 per cent by 2030.Pointing to the government’s annual Rs 2 lakh crore chemical fertiliser subsidy, IBA said this contributes little to soil organic content. Redirecting even 10 per cent (Rs 20,000–25,000 crore) of this subsidy towards FOM-linked or carbon-based incentives could improve soil health, reduce import dependence and promote climate-smart agriculture, it said.The association noted that the current Rs 1,450 crore allocation over three years for Market Development Assistance (MDA) for organic manure from CBG plants is “abysmally low” and only a starting point, especially when compared with chemical fertiliser subsidies.In line with the compressed biogas blending obligation (CBO) under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, IBA suggested that the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers consider introducing a FOM–Chemical Fertilizer Blending Obligation (FCFBO) under an Organic–Chemical Fertilizer Blending Programme.The industry body also pushed for carbon monetisation through a Green Certificate mechanism, urging the government to allow biogas and CBG producers to sell carbon credits in domestic and international markets. It said this would help meet climate targets while opening new revenue streams for producers.Carbon credits in voluntary markets are valued at USD 5–50 per tonne of CO₂, and even at the lowest price, the carbon premium for CBG’s greenhouse gas mitigation could be Rs 10–12 per kg of methane produced, IBA said. With around 1,000 CBG plants expected by 2030, the market value of CBG-based green certificates could be about Rs 4,000 crore, it estimated.IBA also suggested introducing ‘cap and trade’ practices for carbon-intensive entities, and subsidising part of the proposed carbon pricing mechanism to help kick-start the system.","The indian biogas association (iba) has proposed the creation of a rs 10,000 crore fund to provide capital subsidy to the biogas industry in the union budget 2026.

Wealth tax seen as inefficient

Tax experts have cautioned the government against raising the income tax surcharge on high-income individuals or reintroducing a wealth tax in the Union Budget 2026-27, warning that such moves could push wealthy taxpayers to relocate to low-tax jurisdictions and hurt investment and job creation.At present, individuals earning over Rs 50 lakh are subject to a surcharge on income tax — 10 per cent on income between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore, 15 per cent for Rs 1–2 crore, and 25 per cent for Rs 2–5 crore. Those earning above Rs 5 crore pay a 25 per cent surcharge under the new tax regime, while the surcharge is 37 per cent under the old regime, PTI reported.According to estimates by independent economists, recent GST rate cuts and lower income tax collections could cost the exchequer around Rs 2 lakh crore in the current fiscal, prompting debate on whether additional revenue measures may be needed in FY27 for higher spending on defence and other priorities.PwC & Co LLP Partner Amit Rana said while the principle of taxation is based on vertical equity, excessively high taxes can be counterproductive.“We have a pretty good slab, wherein at the highest level you pay 42 per cent, at the lowest level you pay almost zero, even at reasonable income levels. But, when you start making it very prohibitive, you run the risk of high-income earners wanting not to be in India, and that is possible in the world today,” Rana told PTI.He added that high-income individuals play a key role in creating industries and generating jobs, making it essential to strike a careful balance in taxation.EY India Tax Partner Surabhi Marwah echoed similar concerns, saying high surcharges or a return of wealth tax could prompt high-net-worth individuals to move capital or residency abroad.“Tax uncertainty and steep effective rates may play a role in decisions around capital relocation and residency. Stability and predictability in the tax regime may be as important as the rates when the objective is to retain capital and talent,” she said.Marwah noted that wealth tax was abolished in 2015 as collections did not justify the administrative effort involved. She added that surcharges are generally viewed as more efficient and less litigious than asset-based taxes.“With the government now having access to robust data trails through GST, CRS agreements and other systems, policymakers may continue to see surcharge adjustments as a relatively simpler option compared to asset-based valuation regimes,” she said.Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co Partner Gouri Puri said higher tax rates could encourage capital flight and discourage entrepreneurship.“Capital flight is a genuine risk since mobile families can re-domicile to other jurisdictions with lower rates. There is always global competition to keep tax regimes investor-friendly, and harsher taxes in India may discourage investment and push capital away,” she said, adding that a wealth tax would also revive concerns over compliance costs and administrative complexity.Deloitte India Partner Alok Agrawal pointed out that the government had already reduced the highest surcharge from 37 per cent to 25 per cent in Budget 2023 for individuals earning above Rs 5 crore under the new tax regime, bringing down the maximum marginal tax rate from about 42.7 per cent to 39 per cent.“This applied from April 1, 2023, and was applicable only under the new tax regime. So, it seems unlikely that the government would hike this once again within a short span of three years,” he told PTI.On wealth tax, Agrawal said collections from such a levy have historically been small relative to the cost of administration.“The government’s focus has instead been on improving tax collections through more robust enforcement by leveraging technology and information-sharing with other countries,” he added.","Risk of high earners relocating to low-tax jurisdictions, tax experts say.

Budget 2026: CII pitches demand-led disinvestment plan; proposes four-step privatisation roadmap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-202627-cii-pitches-demand-led-disinvestment-plan-proposes-four-step-privatisation-roadmap/articleshow/126462077.cms,"AI image

The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) suggested a four-fold privatisation process in their recommendations on the Union Budget 2026-27. They called for faster and more predictable disinvestment.The industry body claimed that a calibrated privatisation approach would help sustain capital expenditure and fund development priorities, particularly in sectors where private participation can improve efficiency, technology adoption, and competitiveness.CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee highlighted the role of private enterprise in India’s growth. “A forward-looking privatisation policy, aligned with the vision of Viksit Bharat, will enable the government to focus on its core functions while empowering the private sector to accelerate industrial transformation and job creation,” he said, as quoted by ANI.To accelerate the government’s exit from non-strategic Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs), CII outlined a four-pronged strategy.First, CII recommended adopting a demand-led approach for selecting PSEs for privatisation. Contrary to short-listing entities and then checking the appetite for them, it was proposed that government needs to start by measuring market interest for a larger list of entities and short-list those with better interest and valuation.Second, the industry body called for announcing a rolling three-year privatisation pipeline in advance. According to CII, greater visibility would give investors time to plan, deepen participation, and improve price discovery.Third, CII proposed setting up a dedicated institutional mechanism to oversee privatisation. This would include a ministerial board for strategic direction, an advisory panel of industry and legal experts, and a professional execution team to handle due diligence, market engagement, and regulatory coordination.Fourth, acknowledging that complete privatisation is complex and time-consuming, CII suggested a calibrated disinvestment route as an interim measure. The government could initially reduce its stake in listed PSEs to 51 per cent, retaining management control, and later bring it down further to between 33 per cent and 26 per cent.CII estimated that lowering government ownership to 51 per cent in 78 listed PSEs could unlock nearly Rs 10 lakh crore. In the first two years, disinvestment in 55 PSEs could raise about Rs 4.6 lakh crore, followed by Rs 5.4 lakh crore from 23 additional enterprises.“A calibrated reduction of government stake balances strategic control with value creation,” Banerjee said, adding that the proceeds could fund healthcare, education, green infrastructure, and fiscal consolidation while maintaining control in strategic sectors.The Union Budget for 2026–27 will be presented on February 1.",The confederation of indian industry (cii) suggested a four-fold privatisation process in their recommendations on the union budget 2026-27.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
