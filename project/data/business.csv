(AI image)

1. Irregular NSS accounts:

Two NSS-87 accounts opened prior to DG order

Two NSS-87 accounts opened after DG order

ln case of more than two NSS-87 accounts

The following rules apply to two NSS-87 accounts that were opened before the DG Posts' Order No. 35-19/9GSB-lll dated 02.04.1990:

The first account that was opened will receive the current scheme rate. The second account, which was opened after the first one, will earn the prevailing POSA rate with an additional 200 basis points on the outstanding balance. However, these rules are subject to certain conditions.

Cumulative deposits in both the accounts put together should not exceed the applicable deposit limits for each year.

Excess deposits (if any) shall be refunded to the investor without any interest.

These special provisions are a one-time concession granted to NSS-87 investors until September 30, 2024, as per the Office Memorandum issued by the Ministry of Finance on July 12, 2024. Starting from October 1, 2024, both accounts will no longer earn any interest.

The following rules apply to two NSS-87 accounts opened after the DG Posts' Order No. 35-19/90-SB-lll dated 02.04.1990:

The first account that was opened will receive the interest rate as per the prevailing scheme. The second account, which was opened after the first account, will earn the prevailing POSA rate on the outstanding balance. However, these rules are subject to certain conditions.

The total deposits in both accounts combined should not surpass the applicable deposit limit for each year. If there are any excess deposits, they will be returned to the investor without any interest.

These rules are a one-time special dispensation for NSS-87 investors, valid until 30 September 2024, as per the Office Memorandum dated 12th July 2024 issued by the Ministry of Finance.

Starting from 1 October 2024, both accounts will no longer earn any interest, and the rate will be zero percent.

2. When a PPF account is opened under the name of a minor:

For such irregular accounts, POSA interest will be paid until the minor reaches the age of 18, at which point they become eligible to open an account. From that point onward, the applicable interest rate will be paid.

The maturity period for these accounts will be calculated starting from the date the minor becomes an adult, which is the date from which the individual is eligible to open the account.

3. Multiple PPF Accounts:

The primary account, chosen by the investor from their two accounts at any Post Office or agency bank, will earn the scheme's interest rate as long as the deposit remains within the yearly ceiling. (Primary Account is the one the investor prefers to maintain upon regularisation).

The remaining balance in the second account will be combined with the primary account, provided the primary account stays within the applicable annual investment limit. After the merger, the primary account will continue to earn the current scheme interest rate. Any excess balance in the second account will be refunded without interest.

Any additional accounts beyond the primary and second account, shall earn zero percent rate of interest from the date of opening of that account.

4. NRI's PPF Account Extension

5. Minor's Small Savings Scheme Account (Excluding PPF and SSY)

6. Regularization of Sukanya Samriddhi Account (SSA) opened by Grandparents, other than Guardian.

For accounts opened under the guardianship of grandparents who are not the legal guardian, the guardianship must be transferred to the person legally entitled to it. This means that the guardianship should be given to the child's living parents, who are the natural guardians, or to a court-appointed Legal Guardian.

According to the Sukanya Samriddhi Account Scheme, 2019, ""ln case of accounts opened under the guardianship of grandparents (who are other than legal guardian), the guardianship shall be transferred to a person entitled under the law in force, that is, to the natural guardian (alive parents) or Legal Guardian."" If a family has opened more than two accounts, violating Para 3 of the scheme, the irregular accounts will be closed, as they are considered to have been opened in contravention of the scheme guidelines.

Bank Fixed Deposit Rates: Which banks offer the best FD rates? Which are the top 5 bank fixed deposits? Bank Fixed deposits or FDs are a favored investment option for risk-averse investors. Financial experts suggest that the present high interest rate environment may be an ideal time to invest in fixed deposits before the RBI begins to lower rates. However, with numerous banks offering FDs, it can be challenging to determine which ones provide the best returns.To help you make an informed decision, below is a list of the top 5 bank FDs for tenures of 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years as provided by the ET Intelligence Group. Additionally, we provide you with an estimate of how much your investment of Rs 10,000 would grow into when invested in these fixed deposits.IndusInd Bank (7.75% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 10,798), RBL Bank (7.5% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 10,771), Bandhan Bank (7.25% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 10,745), Yes Bank (7.25% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 10,745), Indian Overseas Bank (7.10% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 10,729).RBL Bank (8% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 11,717), IndusInd Bank (7.75% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 11,659), DCB Bank (7.5% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 11,602), IDFC First Bank (7.5% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 11,602), ICICI Bank (7.25% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 11,545).DCB Bank (7.55% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 12,516), RBL Bank (7.5% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 12,497), Yes Bank (7.25% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 12,405), IDFC First Bank (7.25% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 12,405), IndusInd Bank (7.25% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 12,405).DCB Bank (7.4% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 14,428), Dhanlaxmi Bank (7.25% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 14,323), IndusInd Bank (7.25% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 14,323), Yes Bank (7.25% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 14,323), RBL Bank (7.1% interest compounded quarterly, Rs 10,000 would grow to Rs 14,217).The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may have decided to keep the repo rate unchanged in its latest monetary policy review earlier this month, but experts believe that this could be the last pause before the central bank starts a series of interest rate cuts.As a result, bank FD interest rates may gradually decrease in the coming months. While FD investors benefited from the rising interest rates in the past, the same investment strategy may not provide similar returns in a falling interest rate environment.For those with extra funds or FDs that are about to mature, this could be the perfect opportunity to secure their investments at the current high interest rates. ""This is an opportune moment for fixed income investors to lock-in rates at elevated levels. Considering how the case for future rates is balanced between status quo and declines, fixed rate propositions may be favoured over floaters,"" advises Nirav Karkera, Head Research, Fisdom.Experts told ET that it is expected that long-term FDs will be less affected by the initial rate cuts, while short to medium-term FDs may experience a more substantial decrease in interest rates. This means that the chances of getting better interest rates when your FD matures in the future are less likely.","Here is a list of the top 5 bank fds for tenures of 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years.

Sovereign Gold Bonds: How investors can buy SGBs from the stock market; step-by-step guide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/sovereign-gold-bonds-how-investors-can-buy-sgbs-from-the-stock-market-step-by-step-guide/articleshow/112830983.cms,"Investors can purchase Sovereign Gold Bonds from the primary market during the government-announced subscription periods.

How to buy Sovereign Gold Bonds from stock market

To purchase SGBs through the stock market, follow these steps:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Buying SGBs from the stock market: The government introduced Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) in 2015 as a safer alternative to physically holding gold. SGBs eliminate the risks and costs associated with storing physical gold while guaranteeing investors the market value of gold at maturity and monthly interest payments. The bonds are held in the RBI's records or in demat form, mitigating the risk of scrip loss and other related issues.Investors can purchase Sovereign Gold Bonds from the primary market during the government-announced subscription periods or from the secondary market through the National Stock Exchange ( NSE ) and the Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ).According to an ET report, if you fail to apply for SGBs during the primary issuance, you can still invest in them through the stock exchanges in the secondary market. The price of SGBs in the secondary market is determined by supply and demand, similar to other securities. Typically, SGBs trade at a discount to the spot price of gold, the ET report said.Step 1: Identify the discounted or high-yielding SGB on NSE or BSE.Step 2: Locate the SGB scrip code in your demat account and place a buy order.Step 3: The bonds will be credited to your demat account within one working day (T+1) of the transaction.Also Read | Sovereign Gold Bonds: RBI announces early redemptions for some SGBs - should investors redeem? The tax treatment for exiting a gold bond investment varies depending on the method chosen. According to the report, the tax treatment differs if you exit your gold bond investment earlier.There are two popular ways to exit a gold bond investment; the first is via the early redemption window at the end of 5 years, and the second is to sell your bonds in the secondary market. In both cases, capital gains will be taxable according to the usual definition of short-term and long-term capital gains. If it is the former, the rate applicable will be at its peak. If it is the latter, then the investor can choose between a flat tax rate of 10% or 20% after considering indexation.The NSE website provides important information about Sovereign Gold Bonds through frequently asked questions section. SGBs can be traded on stock exchanges from a date notified by the RBI, but only bonds held in de-mat form with depositories are eligible for trading. Additionally, bonds can be sold and transferred according to the provisions of the Government Securities Act, 2006, with partial transfers also being possible.Also Read | Top 5 Bank FDs: Which banks offer the best fixed deposit rates? Check List Investors can place bids for SGBs through either Depository Mode or Physical Mode. In Depository Mode, the RBI credits the Gold Bonds to the client's demat account, while in Physical Mode, the RBI issues a physical Gold Bond Certificate to the clients. Bids can be cancelled until the last date of the issue period.Although the term of an SGB is eight years, some investors who purchased SGBs earlier may not be able to hold the bonds for the entire tenure. In such cases, these individuals can use exchanges to sell their assets, similar to how stocks are traded.",Sovereign gold bonds (sgbs) introduced in 2015 as a safer alternative to physically holding gold.

Typically, SGBs trade at a discount to the spot price of gold, the ET report said.Step 1: Identify the discounted or high-yielding SGB on NSE or BSE.Step 2: Locate the SGB scrip code in your demat account and place a buy order.Step 3: The bonds will be credited to your demat account within one working day (T+1) of the transaction.Also Read | Sovereign Gold Bonds: RBI announces early redemptions for some SGBs - should investors redeem? The tax treatment for exiting a gold bond investment varies depending on the method chosen. According to the report, the tax treatment differs if you exit your gold bond investment earlier.There are two popular ways to exit a gold bond investment; the first is via the early redemption window at the end of 5 years, and the second is to sell your bonds in the secondary market. In both cases, capital gains will be taxable according to the usual definition of short-term and long-term capital gains. If it is the former, the rate applicable will be at its peak. If it is the latter, then the investor can choose between a flat tax rate of 10% or 20% after considering indexation.The NSE website provides important information about Sovereign Gold Bonds through frequently asked questions section. SGBs can be traded on stock exchanges from a date notified by the RBI, but only bonds held in de-mat form with depositories are eligible for trading. Additionally, bonds can be sold and transferred according to the provisions of the Government Securities Act, 2006, with partial transfers also being possible.Also Read | Top 5 Bank FDs: Which banks offer the best fixed deposit rates? Check List Investors can place bids for SGBs through either Depository Mode or Physical Mode. In Depository Mode, the RBI credits the Gold Bonds to the client's demat account, while in Physical Mode, the RBI issues a physical Gold Bond Certificate to the clients. Bids can be cancelled until the last date of the issue period.Although the term of an SGB is eight years, some investors who purchased SGBs earlier may not be able to hold the bonds for the entire tenure. In such cases, these individuals can use exchanges to sell their assets, similar to how stocks are traded.",Sovereign gold bonds (sgbs) introduced in 2015 as a safer alternative to physically holding gold. Sgbs eliminate the risks and costs associated with storing physical gold while guaranteeing investors the market value of gold at maturity and monthly interest payments.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112831034,imgsize-62260,width-400,resizemode-4/112831034.jpg"

How To Save Rs 1 crore

Consider this scenario: if you invest Rs 4,000 per month in an equity mutual fund scheme with an annual return of 12%, it will take you slightly over 28 years (339 months) to accumulate Rs 1 crore, assuming you invest consistently without any interruptions, says the ET analysis.

By increasing your monthly investment to Rs 5,000, you can reduce the time needed to save Rs 1 crore to just over 26 years (317 months) at the same 12% interest rate.

If you can allocate 30% of your salary, which amounts to Rs 7,500 per month, you can achieve your Rs 1 crore goal in 23 years or 276 months, assuming the same annual interest rate.

Furthermore, if you can invest Rs 10,000 every month, which is 40% of your monthly salary, you can reach Rs 1 crore in slightly more than 20 years or 248 months.

These examples demonstrate that the more you can invest each month, the quicker you can attain your financial goal of saving Rs 1 crore.

Step-up SIP strategy:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Saving Rs 1 crore on a monthly salary of Rs 25,000 may seem daunting, but it is achievable with consistent investments over an extended period. To reach this financial milestone, setting a clear monetary target is crucial. Once the goal of saving Rs 1 crore is established, the next step is to identify the most suitable investment vehicle.Equity investments have historically delivered higher returns compared to debt instruments. Although equities are associated with higher risk, they have proven to be rewarding and capable of generating superior returns over the long term, says an ET analysis by Anulekha Ray.When aiming to accumulate a substantial sum like Rs 1 crore, investing in an equity mutual fund through a systematic investment plan ( SIP ) is a wise choice, the analysis says.Also Read | When will your investment double, quadruple? Know the rule of 72 and 144 With a mutual fund SIP, you commit to investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, typically every month. Even if the initial investment amount is modest, the power of compounding and rupee-cost averaging enables you to save a significant lump sum over time.While it's not advisable to allocate a significant portion of your income to a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), it's crucial to consistently set aside 15-20% of your salary each month for long-term financial objectives. However, investing a smaller sum means it will require more time to reach your target.Accumulating Rs 1 crore can be achieved more quickly by employing a step-up SIP strategy, which involves increasing your monthly SIP installment annually as your salary rises. This approach not only helps combat the negative impact of inflation on your savings but also enables you to align your savings with your income growth.By starting with a monthly SIP investment of Rs 4,000 and increasing it by just 5% each year, you can reach your goal of Rs 1 crore in approximately 25 years (301 months). The step-up SIP works by gradually raising your investment amount.For example, if you begin with Rs 4,000 per month, after a year, you would increase it to Rs 4,200 per month for the entire second year. In the third year, you would invest Rs 4,410 every month, and so on.Also Read | When will gold prices hit the Rs 2 lakh mark? The time required to accumulate Rs 1 crore decreases as you increase your initial SIP amount. If you start with Rs 5,000 per month and raise it by 5% annually, you can achieve your target in a little over 23 years (281 months). By increasing the SIP amount by 10% each year, you can become a crorepati in 20.5 years (246 months).Similarly, starting with a monthly SIP of Rs 7,500 and increasing it by 5% annually, you can save Rs 1 crore in 20.3 years (244 months). A 10% annual increase would allow you to reach your goal in just under 18 years (215 months).If you begin your SIP investment with Rs 10,000 per month and raise it by 5% each year, you can accumulate Rs 1 crore in 18.3 years (220 months). By increasing the SIP amount by 10% annually, you can achieve your target in a little over 16 years (194 months).Remember, even if you can't invest a substantial sum initially, don't worry. Increase your SIP amount only if your salary increases. Consistency and gradual increments can help you reach your financial goals.SIPs are generally ideal for long-term investments due to the principle of compounding. When investing in a mutual fund SIP, it's important to commit for the long term. Maintaining patience and consistently investing over the years is key. If you can continue your SIP without interruptions, cancellations, or withdrawals during market downturns, you are more likely to achieve your financial goals.","Saving rs 1 crore on a monthly salary of rs 25,000 may seem daunting, but it is achievable with consistent investments over an extended period.

According to ET, this rule provides a quick calculation to determine the approximate time required for your investment to double in value.Here's how it works: To understand the Rule of 72, divide 72 by the expected annual rate of return.For example, if you invest Rs 1 lakh in an investment with an expected 8% annual return , divide 72 by 8 to get 9. This means it will likely take about nine years for your money to double, growing to Rs 2 lakh.But what if you aim higher, aiming to quadruple return? Enter the Rule of 144 .The Rule of 144 functions similarly, offering an approximation of the time needed to quadruple your investment. To find out how long it will take for your investment to quadruple, use the Rule of 144. Instead of 72, you use 144.For example, if your annual return is 9%, divide 144 by 9, which equals 16. This means it will likely take 16 years for your money to grow four times at a 9% annual return.","Rule of 72 provides a quick calculation to determine the approximate time required for your investment to double in value.

Saving Rs 1 crore on a monthly salary of Rs 25,000 may seem daunting, but it is achievable with consistent investments over an extended period. To reach this financial milestone, setting a clear monetary target is crucial. Once the goal of saving Rs 1 crore is established, the next step is to identify the most suitable investment vehicle.Equity investments have historically delivered higher returns compared to debt instruments. Although equities are associated with higher risk, they have proven to be rewarding and capable of generating superior returns over the long term, says an ET analysis by Anulekha Ray.When aiming to accumulate a substantial sum like Rs 1 crore, investing in an equity mutual fund through a systematic investment plan ( SIP ) is a wise choice, the analysis says.Also Read | When will your investment double, quadruple? Know the rule of 72 and 144 With a mutual fund SIP, you commit to investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, typically every month. Even if the initial investment amount is modest, the power of compounding and rupee-cost averaging enables you to save a significant lump sum over time.While it's not advisable to allocate a significant portion of your income to a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), it's crucial to consistently set aside 15-20% of your salary each month for long-term financial objectives. However, investing a smaller sum means it will require more time to reach your target.Accumulating Rs 1 crore can be achieved more quickly by employing a step-up SIP strategy, which involves increasing your monthly SIP installment annually as your salary rises. This approach not only helps combat the negative impact of inflation on your savings but also enables you to align your savings with your income growth.By starting with a monthly SIP investment of Rs 4,000 and increasing it by just 5% each year, you can reach your goal of Rs 1 crore in approximately 25 years (301 months). The step-up SIP works by gradually raising your investment amount.For example, if you begin with Rs 4,000 per month, after a year, you would increase it to Rs 4,200 per month for the entire second year. In the third year, you would invest Rs 4,410 every month, and so on.Also Read | When will gold prices hit the Rs 2 lakh mark? The time required to accumulate Rs 1 crore decreases as you increase your initial SIP amount. If you start with Rs 5,000 per month and raise it by 5% annually, you can achieve your target in a little over 23 years (281 months). By increasing the SIP amount by 10% each year, you can become a crorepati in 20.5 years (246 months).Similarly, starting with a monthly SIP of Rs 7,500 and increasing it by 5% annually, you can save Rs 1 crore in 20.3 years (244 months). A 10% annual increase would allow you to reach your goal in just under 18 years (215 months).If you begin your SIP investment with Rs 10,000 per month and raise it by 5% each year, you can accumulate Rs 1 crore in 18.3 years (220 months). By increasing the SIP amount by 10% annually, you can achieve your target in a little over 16 years (194 months).Remember, even if you can't invest a substantial sum initially, don't worry. Increase your SIP amount only if your salary increases. Consistency and gradual increments can help you reach your financial goals.SIPs are generally ideal for long-term investments due to the principle of compounding. When investing in a mutual fund SIP, it's important to commit for the long term. Maintaining patience and consistently investing over the years is key. If you can continue your SIP without interruptions, cancellations, or withdrawals during market downturns, you are more likely to achieve your financial goals.","Saving rs 1 crore on a monthly salary of rs 25,000 may seem daunting, but it is achievable with consistent investments over an extended period.
