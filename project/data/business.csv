New Income Tax Rules 2026 likely to be notified in March: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/new-income-tax-rules-2026-likely-to-be-notified-in-march-report/articleshow/128111047.cms,"Budget 2026 Brings New Income Tax Act From April With No Slab Change But Major Compliance Reset

The Income Tax Department is likely to notify the draft Income Tax Rules, 2026 and the accompanying forms in the first week of March, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) sources told ET.The new rules are aligned with the Income Tax Act, 2025, which is scheduled to come into force from April 1, 2026, and will replace the existing Income Tax Rules, 1962. Once notified and approved by Parliament, the Income Tax Rules, 2026 will be applicable from the same date.The department had earlier released draft rules and forms as part of the transition to the new Income Tax Act, aimed at simplifying compliance and aligning procedural provisions with the updated law.Sources said revisions related to perquisites under the new framework will be applicable under both the old and the new tax regimes, offering relief across categories of taxpayers.The notification of the rules is seen as a key step in operationalising the Income Tax Act, 2025, ahead of its scheduled rollout from the next financial year starting April 1, 2026.The draft rules and forms will remain in the public domain for 15 days, until February 22, 2026. The Income Tax Department had invited stakeholders and members of the public to examine the draft framework and submit feedback, saying the consultative process is aimed at making the framing of subordinate legislation more participative and effective.According to the department, the drafting of the new Income-tax Rules and forms follows the same philosophy as the Income Tax Act, 2025, with a focus on simplification and clarity. The language of the rules has been simplified wherever possible, with formulas and tables introduced to improve understanding, while efforts have been made to eliminate redundancies present in the existing Income-tax Rules, 1961.While the broader policy framework has been retained, the department said selective changes have been introduced to align the rules and forms with provisions of the Income Tax Act, 2025.The tax forms included in the draft rules have also been significantly simplified to ease compliance for taxpayers. Common information has been standardised across forms to reduce duplication and lower the compliance burden.The department said the redesigned forms incorporate features such as automated reconciliation and pre-fill capabilities, making tax filing more intuitive and less prone to errors. It added that the use of smart forms would facilitate centralised processing and data-driven decision-making, enabling improved taxpayer services.Officials said the language used in the forms and accompanying notes has been simplified to avoid operational, administrative and legal ambiguity, further enhancing the overall taxpayer experience.","The income tax department is likely to notify the draft income tax rules, 2026 and the accompanying forms in the first week of march.

J&K: Omar Abdullah faces PDP fire over central loan scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-omar-abdullah-faces-pdp-fire-over-central-loan-scheme/articleshow/128127911.cms,"J&K CM Omar Abdullah (PTI photo)

JAMMU: PDP slammed J&K’s Omar Abdullah-led National Conference (NC) govt on Monday for tapping the Centre’s Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI), calling it the “most dangerous scheme” after the abrogation of Article 370.The scheme provides 50-year interest-free loans for capital investments and infrastructure, besides offering financial incentives for reforms in key sectors.Speaking during the assembly’s budget session, PDP legislator Waheed Parra accused NC of betraying its mandate. “Why are you taking loans under this scheme? Who will repay these loans after 50 years?” Parra asked CM Omar, who was present in the House, in an emotional speech.Omar had in his budget speech last week revealed that J&K was brought under SASCI last year, saying his govt had “proactively leveraged this new opportunity”. “This reflects the confidence of Govt of India in reform orientation, financial discipline, and execution capacity of J&K,” Omar had said.However, Parra questioned SASCI’s benefits, pointing out that unlike the earlier MGNREGA rural job scheme, these funds are not a grant but a “market loan”.“If you are constructing roads, bridges and playgrounds under SASCI, you are effectively putting J&K under mortgage. You are putting J&K on sale. SASCI means destruction of J&K and you have brought it without consultation,” Parra argued, his voice getting louder and riling NC members.The Pulwama MLA urged Omar to allow a debate on the scheme. “It is a death trap. It (problems from similar loan schemes) happened in Bangladesh and Pakistan. We are selling J&K for petty loans. Who will repay this loan after 50 years, and who gives loans for free?” Parra asked.Parra went further with his criticism of the scheme. “BJP is not your alliance partner. So, on whose behest you are bringing this? Why are you taking a Rs 50,000-crore loan for free?” he asked.Later, Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather ordered an inquiry into whether Parra had used an additional microphone to amplify his voice, which Omar and NC members claimed kept getting louder.",J&k's omar abdullah-led national conference (nc) govt tapped centre's special assistance to states for capital investment (sasci) pdp legislator waheed parra accused nc of betraying its mandate. “why are you taking loans under this scheme?

Bond funds slide after RBI decision to keep rates unchanged,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/bond-funds-slide-after-rbi-decision-to-keep-rates-unchanged/articleshow/128105368.cms,"Bond funds slide (AI image)

What should investors do

(Disclaimer: Times of India does not give any personal finance or stock market investment advice. Always consult an expert before taking investment decisions)

The RBI’s latest policy decision to keep the repo rate unchanged has delivered an unpleasant surprise to the bond market. Traders and investors were positioned for an easing signal, but the central bank chose to stay put. Government bond yields shot up after the RBI decision was announced, with the benchmark 10-year bond yield climbing to 6.73%.Rising bond yields is bad news for debt fund investors. Bond prices and bond yields move in opposite directions. When yields rise, existing bonds with lower coupons become less attractive, so their prices fall, leading to an immediate drop in NAVs.The impact of the surge in bond yields was not uniform across categories. Mutual funds holding long-term bonds, especially gilt funds and long duration funds, were the worst hit. The long-duration category lost 0.75% and the gilt category fell 0.61% in a single day, wiping out gains of the past three months. Medium duration funds and dynamic bond funds also saw sharp losses of 29-35 basis points because they carry meaningful interest-rate sensitivity.Short-term funds, however, were relatively insulated. Their portfolios consist largely of bonds and money market instruments with very short maturities.Since these securities mature soon, they are less affected by changes in long-term yields. In simple terms, their NAVs don’t swing as wildly when the market re-prices interest rates. The category slipped 14 basis points on Friday.Market experts now believe that India’s rate-cutting cycle is over. Instead of a quick easing phase, the more likely scenario is a prolonged pause. “We expect the curve to steepen incrementally and yields to gradually rise on the back of higher gross borrowings in the current fiscal,"" says Puneet Pal, Head of Fixed Income at PGIM India Mutual Fund.Others also expect the pain to continue. “The bearishness in the bond market, driven by a mix of structural, cyclical, and one-off factors, is likely to persist through the rest of 2026-27, with the benchmark 10-year bond yield hovering in the 6.60–6.75% range,” says Madhavi Arora, Chief Economist, Emkay Global Financial Services.If your debt fund portfolio is tilted towards long duration, gilt or aggressive dynamic bond funds, it may be time to reassess. These categories work best when interest rates are falling, because bond prices rise sharply and funds benefit from capital gains. But when yields rise, even gradually, these funds can deliver negative returns for weeks or months, and the volatility can be unsettling for investors who entered expecting “fixed-income-like” stability.If your goal is parking money for 6 months to 3 years, avoid long duration exposure. Instead, the safer approach in the current cycle is to stay with short-term debt funds and focus on accrual. Short duration funds, money market funds, and high-quality corporate bond funds with low maturity profiles tend to generate returns largely through interest income rather than bond price gains. This accrual strategy is typically steadier, and it reduces the risk of sudden NAV shocks when yields spike.Long-term debt funds are not “bad”, but they require the right timing and the ability to tolerate volatility. Right now, with the market shifting from rate-cut hopes to a higher-yield reality, most retail investors are better off staying short, earning accrual, and letting the interest-rate noise pass.","The impact of the surge in bond yields was not uniform across categories.

Fewer forms & filings: New I-T law to ease compliance load,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fewer-forms-filings-new-i-t-law-to-ease-compliance-load/articleshow/128133246.cms,"NEW DELHI: The new income tax rules are expected to make life less taxing for taxpayers by reducing the number of forms and rules and doing away with several declarations that you are required to make under the 1962 Act, which will be replaced by the new law from April.To make life simpler for individuals over 75 years, the tax department has sought to simplify Form 12BBA into a basic authorisation. Eligible seniors can authorise banks to compute and deduct tax. The number of fields are reduced by about 46%, and many seniors may no longer need to file returns.So, for those without a PAN, say your kid, which required filing of Form 60 for 21 different transactions - yielding some 13 crore declarations annually - under the new law, the number of non-PAN declarations have been reduced significantly. No filings are required where data is already available through banking systems or digital payments, govt said Monday. Issuing PAN, for which five crore applications are made annually, too is expected to be speeded up with new simplified forms.The draft rules, released for public comments on Saturday, have also raised the transaction limits for quoting of PAN for cash deposits and withdrawal in banks, for purchase of motor vehicles and property, and payment of hotel bills.It has also proposed raising the value of tax-free perquisites provided by employers, and making it mandatory for crypto exchanges to share information with the department. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will be included as an accepted mode of electronic payment.Following stakeholder consultation, the rules are expected to be finalised by the first week of March.According to the proposed rules, quoting PAN will be mandatory for making cash deposits or withdrawals of Rs 10 lakh or more in a financial year. Currently, PAN is required for cash deposits of Rs 50,000 during a day with a bank.While purchasing vehicles, a buyer has to quote PAN if the price exceeds Rs 5 lakh. Under current rules, PAN is not required for purchase of two-wheelers.Officials said the idea is to capture only relevant information and ""leveraging tech-enhancements of reporting entities"" under the Income Tax Act. The value of tax-free perquisites for official vehicles and free meals is proposed to be enhanced in view of the current market realities.","The tax department has sought to simplify form 12bba into a basic authorisation.

India’s real estate sector continued its growth momentum in 2025, reaffirming its position as a core pillar of the country's economic expansion. Currently contributing nearly 8% to GDP, the sector is projected to contribute 15-16% by 2047, aligning with India’s vision of “Viksit Bharat”. The Budget reinforces this trajectory through infrastructure-led development, policy & tax reforms, though some sector-specific expectations remain unaddressed.Proposal to monetize public sector real estate assets through dedicated REITs is expected to unlock value from idle assets, deepen institutional participation & enable efficient capital recycling across the sector.The government has reiterated its commitment to Tier 2 & Tier 3 cities, including temple towns, by allocating INR 5,000 crore over 5 years per City Economic Region. This is likely to stimulate urbanisation beyond metros & drive housing demand.Another notable thrust is on industrial & logistics corridors, supported by development of university townships integrating research institutions, skill centres & residential infrastructure.This integrated approach is expected to boost employment generation while creating demand for commercial & residential real estate.Further, development of dedicated rail freight corridors, textile & chemical parks will have positive spillover effects on industrial real estate, warehousing & allied infrastructure.For self-occupied properties, prior-period interest on housing loans continues to be deductible in 5 equal installments after construction completion. This prior-period interest has now been aligned with the Old Regime, with the overall interest deduction capped at INR 2 lakh per annum.Resident individuals & HUFs purchasing property from non-resident sellers can now deduct TDS by quoting PAN without the requirement to obtain a TAN.Consideration received on buy-back of shares will now be taxed as capital gains instead of dividends, with entitlement to capital loss on the cost of shares. However, promoters will be subject to an additional levy, resulting in higher effective tax rate for them.The Budget aligns income-tax provisions for compulsory acquisition of land under Right to Fair Compensation & Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation & Resettlement Act, 2013, bringing clarity & consistency.MAT has been proposed to be reduced from 15% to 14%.For domestic companies continuing under the old tax regime post March 31, 2026, MAT paid will be treated as final tax liability, with no new MAT credit generation. Existing MAT credit as on March 31, 2026 will not be available for set-off unless the company transitions to the new regime.Companies migrating to the new regime during or after FY 2026–27 will be allowed to utilise MAT credit, subject to set-off capped at 25% of normal tax liability per year & carry forward permitted for 15 years from the date of generation.The MAT amendments are designed to encourage migration to the new tax regime. However, as REIT unitholder dividend exemptions remain linked to SPVs under the old regime, REIT managers will need to carefully evaluate the cost-benefit implications.The Budget also promotes foreign investment in Indian data centres by introducing a tax holiday for foreign companies until March 31, 2047 on income from procuring data centre services from specified Indian facilities. Services to Indian users must be routed through an Indian reseller entity.Additionally, the government has proposed the convergence of the Income Computation and Disclosure Standards (ICDS) with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) through a joint Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)–Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) committee, along with a comprehensive review of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules to align them with India’s evolving economic priorities.Even as the reforms strengthen the sector’s overall framework, certain areas could be candidates for future refinement, including affordable housing incentives, interest deduction limits under the new regime, sector-specific relief for hospitality and tourism, and flexibility in ITC utilisation for leased assets.Overall, the Budget presents a largely positive outlook for the real estate sector, driven by infrastructure expansion, regional development & tax rationalisation. The government’s proactive engagement with industry stakeholders throughout the year rather than relying solely on annual budget announcements offers optimism that pending sectoral expectations may be addressed as India progresses toward its Viksit Bharat 2047 vision.","India’s real estate sector continued its growth momentum in 2025, reaffirming its position as a core pillar of the country's economic expansion.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

India’s Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Budget 2026-27 on 1 February 2026, the ninth of her tenure, terming it as a unique Yuva Shakti-driven Budget.Rather than announcing sweeping tax reductions, the Budget reinforced continuity from last year and focused more on administrative simplification, extending selective relief against the backdrop of substantial tax changes in recent years. There is substantial thrust on promoting ease of compliance for the ordinary taxpayer. This article highlights below some of these proposals.The Hon’ble FM has chosen to retain stability in income tax slabs and rates. The structure applicable for FY 2025–26 continues unchanged in FY 2026-27, under which salaried individuals effectively pay no tax on income up to approximately INR 12 lakhs after considering standard deduction of INR 75,000 and applicable rebates.In line with expectations, the new Income Tax Act 2025, which supersedes the long-standing Act of 1961, will now be effective from 1 April 2026. The new Act was drafted with a valiant attempt at simplification of provisions by reducing jargon and using layman language instead for easier comprehension. The related Income Tax Rules and Forms are expected to be notified shortly, to provide taxpayers sufficient time to familiarize themselves with the new requirements.It would be critical to have these, including the electronic versions, tested and released at the earliest so that tax filing truly becomes a smooth experience for taxpayers.Tax return deadlines have been extended to 31 August in case of non-audit business cases. Other categories of individual taxpayers filing ITR1 and ITR2 will continue to follow the deadline of 31 July. The extended deadline will give some breathing space to such taxpayers to finalise their books of accounts and gather details of business income.Another helpful reform in this year’s Budget permits taxpayers to submit revised income tax returns up to the next 31 March, extending the previous deadline of 31 December. With a nominal fee of INR 1000/ 5000 (depending on income of below/ above INR 5 lakhs), this extension provides taxpayers with greater flexibility and reduces the time pressure for correcting errors. This will be particularly useful for globally mobile taxpayers who have income and reporting requirements of foreign income and assets arising in tax jurisdictions outside India whose tax years are calendar years. It will also allow them to avail tax treaty relief in cases of double taxation.To encourage voluntary compliance and reduce litigation, taxpayers will now be permitted to file Updated returns even after reassessment proceedings have begun, subject to payment of an additional 10% tax over and above the prescribed additional tax. Furthermore, updated returns can be filed even where there is a reduction in claimed losses.Over the past few years, after the introduction of the Black Money law, reporting of Foreign Assets and Income had become a stressful exercise for many people who did not have organised data at their disposal. Consequently, there have been multiple instances of taxpayers missing disclosure requirements. To give some relief to such taxpayers, a six-month tax amnesty scheme has been introduced to facilitate reporting of undisclosed foreign assets/income by certain categories of taxpayers like students, young professionals, tech employees, relocated NRIs, etc.In cases where the taxpayer has acquired such foreign asset from identified sources of income earned in India or abroad, reporting can be done upon a fee payment of INR 1 lakh if the maximum value (FMV) of assets covered is INR 5 crores. In cases where the taxpayer is unable to substantiate the source of funds for acquiring such asset(s), the amnesty scheme permits disclosure of assets, and any income arising therefrom, of a maximum aggregate value of INR 1 crore. The value of the asset would be at FMV and the tax payable will be 60% of such FMV/value. No further penalty is leviable.Budget 2026 has rationalised various Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) provisions, making them less burdensome:These changes make funds more accessible for genuine personal needs instead of getting locked up for refund claims later.In case of taxpayers holding securities in multiple companies, depositories will now be able to accept Form 15G/15H from the investor and provide it directly to various relevant companies. This will eliminate the hassle of tracking multiple investments and missing submissions by taxpayers.The Budget proposes a major overhaul of criminal prosecution provisions under the Act with the aim to minimise unnecessary litigation while maintaining a careful balance for deterrence in some serious offences. In a very welcome move, assessment and penalty proceedings are proposed to be merged into a single order. In addition, it is proposed to remove interest liability on penalties during the pendency of initial appeal proceedings and also lower deposit requirements for tax demands under appeal from the existing 20% to 10%.In order to facilitate Indian businesses in specific sectors to avail of services of foreign experts with specialised skills, compliance has been made easier for such non-resident individuals. It is proposed to exempt income earned outside India (which is not deemed to accrue or arise in India) for a period of 5 consecutive tax years beginning with the first year of services. To be eligible for this relaxation, the individual should be non-resident in India for the last 5 years preceding the start of such services in India.The applicable Schemes are yet to be notified by the Government, but clearly this amendment will be welcomed by industries which need specialised experts to come and work in India. Measures like these will also make India an attractive destination for foreign experts to come and work in India.This Budget was more about consolidation of tax reforms and progress along the path laid out last year. With hardly any big bang changes, it has focused on procedural reforms and simplification under the New Income-tax Act, 2025. There were a few missed chances for greater simplification, e.g. in the area of capital gains, or TDS on rent payments to non-resident landlords, etc. We also hope that the related rules forms are released at the earliest to ensure taxpayers get adequate time to absorb and adopt these changes right from the start of the new tax year.","India’s union finance minister nirmala sitharaman presented the budget 2026-27 on 1 february 2026, terming it as a unique yuva shakti-driven budget.

Announced against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions, the Union Budget 2026–27 carried expectations of reinforcing India’s global standing—especially in light of recently concluded Foreign Trade Agreements. The Budget 2026 continues to advance India’s long‑term strategic narrative: strengthening manufacturing as the core engine of growth while simultaneously expanding the country’s capabilities in services and digital trade.The Finance Minister reaffirmed the centrality of manufacturing to India’s economic strategy. Large‑scale investments in textiles, semiconductors, rare‑earth mining, infrastructure, and MSME development signal the Government’s intent to build resilient, future‑ready industrial capacity. These interventions align strongly with India’s aspiration to emerge as a global manufacturing hub.Complementing manufacturing, the Budget underscores the Sankalp for accelerating and sustaining economic growth, fulfilling citizen aspirations, and advancing the vision ofwithin the framework of the three. This focus manifests in initiatives aimed at strengthening the services ecosystem and positioning India deeper within global value chains.Several targeted interventions demonstrate this intent. In a major relief to the IT sector, the Government has introduced several tax reforms, including but not limited to consolidating services under a single category of IT Services with a common safe‑harbour margin of 15.5 percent, increasing the safe-harbour threshold from ₹300 crore to ₹2,000 crore to ease compliance for large taxpayers, and introducing tax holidays until 2047 for foreign companies offering cloud services through India‑based data centres, with a 15 percent safe‑harbour for related entities providing supporting data‑center operations. These key reforms would aid in creating long‑term policy predictability and reinforce India’s digital infrastructure competitiveness.As regards providing a push to the creative industries, establishment of AVGC Content Creator Lab in schools and colleges is likely to accelerate skill development in animation, gaming, VFX, and digital content creation industries which are already experiencing exponential global demand.In terms of alleviating the tourism and hospitality needs of India, a National Institute of Hospitality is proposed which would integrate academia, industry, and the Government. This move is expected to uplift service standards, aligning India’s hospitality workforce with global benchmarks, scale up India’s tourism offerings, boost employment, and enhance economic contribution from both domestic and international tourism.With education and healthcare forming the backbone of any resilient economy, the Budget’s initiatives—such as the creation of a High‑Powered “Education to Employment and Enterprise” Standing Committee and the upgrading of existing institutions alongside the establishment of new centres for training Allied Health Professionals—represent critical forward‑looking interventions. These measures are expected to significantly narrow the skill gap by aligning academic curricula with evolving industry needs, ensuring that learners acquire job‑ready competencies. Together, they will not only enhance employability but also strengthen the quality and preparedness of India’s future workforce, positioning the country to meet the growing demands of a rapidly transforming economic landscape.On a separate note, the Budget lays out a forward‑looking roadmap for strengthening maritime and inland logistics. The introduction of new Dedicated Freight Corridors connecting the East and the West, along with 20 new National Waterways to improve connectivity between mineral belts, industrial hubs, and ports, signals a major push toward integrated transport infrastructure. The proposed development of a ship‑repair ecosystem for inland waterways and the launch of the Coastal Cargo Promotion Scheme—aimed at doubling the share of coastal and inland waterway cargo by 2047 - further demonstrates the Government’s commitment to modernizing multimodal logistics.Reflecting a clear shift from policing to facilitating trade, the Budget introduces a series of trust‑based governance measures aimed at enhancing efficiency, predictability, and transparency within customs processes.Key reforms include the extension of the duty‑deferral period for Tier 2 and Tier 3 AEOs from the current 15 days to 30 days, providing businesses with improved cash‑flow flexibility and reduced working‑capital strain. Additionally, the validity of binding advance rulings has been increased from 3 to 5 years, offering greater certainty to importers and exporters in planning their tax positions. The Government has also proposed recognizing regular, compliant importers within customs risk‑assessment systems, thereby reducing repetitive verification and enabling faster cargo clearance for trusted entities in addition to streamlining the overall Customs Integrated System.While the journey toward fully meeting expectations on Customs simplification has only begun, the initiatives announced in the Budget mark a clear and progressive shift toward enhancing ease of doing business and improving predictability across trade processes. These reforms reinforce the Government’s intent to build a more efficient, trust‑based regulatory environment for importers and exporters alike.It is also noteworthy that the Budget continues to advance India’s agenda of becoming a more attractive investment destination. Key measures include permitting Persons Resident Outside India (PROIs) to invest in listed Indian equities through the Portfolio Investment Scheme, rationalizing TDS/TCS rates to reduce compliance burden, and decriminalizing procedural lapses such as non‑production of books of account or delays in tax deduction payments. Collectively, these steps strengthen investor confidence, improve regulatory clarity, and align with India’s broader objective of fostering a transparent, growth‑oriented business ecosystem under the broader vision ofOverall, the Budget 2026–27 has been delivered with clarity, balance, and a long‑term vision. It successfully addresses expectations across sectors—strengthening manufacturing, deepening services capability, modernizing logistics, and promoting trust‑based governance. This year’s Budget, in many ways, sets the tone for India’s next phase of economic transformation.","Decoding budget 2026-27: delivering clarity, balance, and a long‑term vision (ai image) by rajeev dimri and kunal kohli, kpmg in india.

So where does populism fit in?



If past Union Budget s were shaped by tax reforms and progressive personal tax restructuring, then Budget 2026 is more about firefighting, shielding the economy from global shocks, managing uncertainty and rebuilding confidence amid a volatile international environment.With no dramatic fiscal stress to respond to, Budget 2026 shifted attention to longer-term priorities while maintaining continuity in fiscal management.In the past years, the government had already delivered significant personal income tax relief, including raising the exemption limit to spur consumption, and had steadily ramped up capital expenditure to position infrastructure and connectivity as key engines of growth.This year, the emphasis was less on fresh giveaways and more on preparing the ground for the next growth cycle.The Budget came at a time when the global economy was adjusting to the growing weight of the Global South, with India on the threshold of becoming the world’s third-largest economy.Such a transition inevitably brought trade frictions, protectionist pressures and geopolitical realignments. Against this backdrop, India made notable progress on the trade front, including a landmark, win-win agreement with the European Union, even as it grappled with higher tariffs and shifting global trade rules.The Budget also underlined the urgency of scaling up investments in artificial intelligence, accelerating innovation and adoption, and equipping India’s youth with new-age skills.The proposals aligned closely with the expectations set out in the Economic Survey 2025–26, with a clear push to lower input costs and enhance manufacturing competitiveness through rationalisation of customs duties, easier access to finance and measures to attract non-resident capital.That shift in confidence explained why this year’s Budget resisted headline-grabbing populism. There were no sweeping giveaways, no dramatic income-tax cuts and no sudden expansion of welfare promises.Taken together, Budget 2026 was less about managing immediate risks and more about building resilience and capability for the years ahead. It reflected an economy that was cautiously confident, forward-looking and focused on shaping its place in a rapidly changing global order.The emphasis was firmly on public investment, long-term structural reforms and improving the efficiency of existing systems.Budget 2026 is about setting the direction!One of the clearest markers of non-populism is the fiscal stance.Budget 2025 prioritised consolidation in an uncertain global environment, pegging the fiscal deficit at 4.4% of GDP. Budget 2026 continues along the same path, estimating the deficit at a slightly lower 4.3% of GDP for FY27.More importantly, the government has added clarity on its medium-term intent. The Budget explicitly outlines a glide path towards a 50% ±1% debt-to-GDP ratio by 2030, a level that offers long-term fiscal credibility without choking growth.DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor, EY India, told TOI that, ""The pace of fiscal consolidation has moderated in the FY27 Budget. After achieving a reduction of 40 basis points from 4.8% of GDP in FY25 to 4.4% in FY26 (RE), the reduction in FY27 (BE) is only 10 basis points, taking the FY27 fiscal deficit to 4.3% of GDP.""""This moderation is due to a fall in the GoI’s gross tax revenues to GDP ratio… which translates into a fall in GoI’s non-debt receipts relative to GDP,"" he added.If there is one area where Budget 2026 is emphatic, it is capital expenditure.Public capex rises to Rs 12.2 lakh crore for FY27, up from Rs 11.2 lakh crore in the current year and just Rs 2 lakh crore in FY15. Over a decade, this marks a structural shift towards state-led asset creation as the main engine of growth.But this year’s Budget goes beyond simply writing bigger cheques. The emphasis is equally on how capital is deployed and how private investment is drawn in alongside public spending.New institutional mechanisms aim to reduce risk and improve returns for private players, while innovative approaches to asset monetisation seek to unlock value from existing public assets.At the same time, continued investment in freight corridors, inland waterways and coastal shipping underscores a push to improve logistics efficiency.Taken together, these measures signal a shift from ""how much we spend"" to ""how effectively we spend"".Support for manufacturing is another area where Budget 2026 moves away from populism.While Budget 2025 relied heavily on sector-specific incentives, Budget 2026 broadens the approach by strengthening supporting systems. Electronics, semiconductors, defence manufacturing and supply chains receive targeted support, largely via customs duty tweaks rather than blanket subsidies.Defence sees a sharp rise, with an allocation of Rs 7.84 lakh crore for FY27, up 15.3% from last year. The focus remains on modernisation, capacity building and domestic procurement rather than symbolic announcements.Agriculture follows a familiar path. The emphasis is on productivity, technology adoption and value chains across fisheries, horticulture and allied activities. There are no major market reforms or income-linked populist support mechanisms.In social sectors—health, education, skills, tourism and culture—the Budget favours targeted capacity creation over universal giveaways, from medical hubs and allied health professionals to creative economy labs and university townships.For individual taxpayers, Budget 2026 stands out more for continuity than change.Income-tax slabs remain unchanged under both old and new regimes. There is no tinkering with surcharge or cess. This follows last year’s major relief, which exempted income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime.Rather than fresh tax cuts, the Budget focuses on simplifying the tax system and easing compliance.A key step in this direction is the rollout of the New Income Tax Act, 2025, which will come into effect from April 2026. The government has indicated that the new law will be supported by simpler rules and redesigned return forms aimed at reducing complexity and errors.Taxpayers will also get more breathing room through extended timelines for filing returns and for making revisions, a move intended to reduce penalties arising from procedural lapses.In addition, approvals for lower or nil tax deduction at source (TDS) will increasingly be handled through automated, rule-based systems, limiting discretion and speeding up the process.The Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) has been lowered to 14% from the earlier rate of 15%.Relief has also been provided on the outward flow of funds, with a reduction in tax collected at source (TCS) on overseas travel, foreign education and medical remittances.At the same time, individuals who did not disclose foreign non-immovable assets valued below Rs 20 lakh will receive immunity from prosecution, with retrospective effect from October 1, 2024.The philosophy is clear: make compliance easier, not flashier.Not everyone walks away happy. One area where Budget 2026 clearly hurt sentiment was the stock market.Market sentiment took a hit in the immediate aftermath of Budget 2026, with the sharpest reaction coming from the increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options.The announcement sparked heavy selling on Budget day, especially in stocks linked to trading activity, as higher transaction costs directly impact the profitability of frequent and leveraged trades.Both Indian benchmark indices, the Nifty50 and the BSE Sensex, plunged over 2% during the special trading session on Sunday.The Nifty50 closed at 24,825.45, down 593 points or 2.33%, while the BSE Sensex ended at 80,722.94, shedding 1,843 points or 2.23%.For active traders, the move is an undeniable negative, raising costs in a segment that thrives on high volumes and thin margins. However, seen through a policy lens, the intent appears less about extracting easy tax revenue and more about cooling excessive speculation in derivatives markets.""The only real negative in the Budget is the increase in STT on derivatives, and that’s what the market is reacting to in the short term. Overall, once the STT headline settles, the Budget should be seen as growth supportive,"" said Amisha Vora, PL Capital – Prabhudas Lilladher.Poll-bound states have voiced sharp dissatisfaction with the Union Budget, alleging a lack of targeted support. Last year, when Bihar was heading into assembly elections, the Centre announced the National Makhana Board with an initial allocation of Rs 100 crore.In contrast, this Budget avoided such election-linked announcements, drawing criticism from chief ministers of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, who said their states were overlooked.At the same time, shifting geopolitical priorities are visible in the numbers. The Budget makes no provision for Iran’s Chabahar port project and sharply cuts development assistance to Bangladesh, reflecting strained regional ties.On the corporate tax side, promoters face tighter scrutiny, with higher taxes on buybacks. The government has made clear that the move is aimed at curbing what it described as the ""improper use"" of buybacks as a tax-efficient route.Meanwhile, from May 1, 2026, the National Calamity Contingent Duty on chewing tobacco, jarda scented tobacco and other tobacco products, including gutkha, will be raised from 25% to 60%, even as the effective incidence is proposed to be kept at 25%.While direct taxes stay stable, indirect tax measures in Budget 2026 are expected to quietly influence everyday spending and consumer experience.One of the more immediate changes affects personal imports. The tariff rate on all dutiable goods brought in for personal use has been reduced from 20% to 10%. Once updated baggage rules are notified, this could lower the cost of items purchased abroad or carried back during international travel.Healthcare also sees some relief through customs duty exemptions.Basic customs duty has been removed on 17 drugs and medicines, and duty-free personal imports of drugs and food have been extended to cover seven additional rare diseases. For patients dealing with chronic or rare conditions, these steps could translate into lower out-of-pocket expenses over time.Changes to tax collection on overseas spending are likely to ease cash-flow pressures for families.The tax collected at source (TCS) on overseas tour packages has been cut to 2%, while TCS on remittances for foreign education and medical treatment has also been reduced to the same level.This directly benefits households sending children abroad for studies or incurring medical expenses overseas. The Budget also signals longer-term cost moderation through support for domestic manufacturing and clean energy.Customs duty exemptions on components used in microwave ovens, lithium-ion battery manufacturing and solar glass inputs are aimed at strengthening local production.While these may not result in immediate price reductions, they are designed to lower costs gradually and reduce import dependence.In the energy and transport space, duty exemptions on aviation components, incentives for biogas-blended CNG, and a renewed push for waterways and coastal shipping are intended to bring down logistics and fuel-related costs.Such measures typically take time to show results but eventually influence the prices of everyday goods through cheaper transportation.Beyond changes in duty rates, the Budget places strong emphasis on process reforms at customs.A single digital window for cargo clearance, faster approvals for food, drugs and plant products, immediate clearance for goods without compliance requirements, and wider use of AI-based non-intrusive scanning are expected to reduce delays and uncertainty.While these reforms operate behind the scenes, they reduce delays, costs and uncertainty, benefits consumers often feel without noticing the policy behind them.Compared to the last five Budgets, Budget 2026 ranks low on traditional populism. Between FY2021-22 and FY2025-26, India’s tax framework was steadily reshaped through headline-grabbing measures, particularly progressive personal tax relief that directly targeted middle-class sentiment.Middle-class taxpayers benefited from steady personal tax cuts, welfare outlays were expanded, and pandemic-era safety nets were reinforced.The new income-tax regime introduced in 2020 was gradually strengthened: Budgets 2021 and 2022 largely held rates steady, Budget 2023 made the new regime the default option while simplifying slabs and raising the basic exemption, and Budget 2024 enhanced the standard deduction for salaried taxpayers to Rs 75,000.Budget 2025 marked a clear break, dramatically lowering the direct tax burden on the middle class by fully exempting income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried individuals after deduction).Budget 2026, by contrast stands apart from that trajectory. Instead of extending tax relief or unveiling crowd-pleasing announcements, it reflects a shift in intent.Budget 2026 assumes that political capital has already been spent. It avoids large, vote-catching measures and instead doubles down on execution, predictability and long-term growth architecture.What makes finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth Budget distinctive is its refusal to choose between growth and discipline. Instead, it attempts a third path: sustained public investment backed by predictable fiscal behaviour.Effective capital expenditure keeps rising, revenue deficits continue to compress, and governance shifts toward automation, trust and verification rather than control.This is not a Budget designed to dominate headlines. It is designed to influence outcomes gradually and durably. Taken together, Budget 2026 reads less like a populist spectacle and more like a blueprint focused on systems, execution and changes that will matter quietly over time.The Budget also came amid clear momentum in India–US economic ties. Days before its presentation, signals from both sides pointed to progress, with commerce minister Piyush Goyal describing efforts to close the ""father of all deals.""That momentum crystallised on February 2, when US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would cut reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods to 18% following a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, effectively sealing the agreement.","Budget 2026 was less about managing immediate risks and more about building resilience and capability for the years ahead. It reflected an economy that was cautiously confident, forward-looking and focused on shaping its place in a rapidly changing global order.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127889118,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-77586,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

The Union Budget 2026 was largely in line with our modest expectations and underscored continuity in the government’s fiscal approach over the past five years, rather than delivering any high-impact near-term stimulus. The policy thrust remains firmly tilted toward public capex, with capital expenditure budgeted to rise 11.5% YoY to Rs 12.2t in FY27E, supporting sectors leveraged to the investment cycle.A key highlight was the government’s intent to attract global investment into data centres, which could drive incremental opportunities across digital infrastructure and utilities. Further, strategic sectors such as semiconductors and electronics manufacturing services, defence, chemicals, and select industrial manufacturing stand out as potential beneficiaries, aided by targeted incentives, production-linked schemes, and the development of dedicated industrial parks—reinforcing a constructive medium-term investment outlook.For the healthcare sector, the budget not only provides financial assistance but also highlights the government’s efforts to prepare Indian companies to gain business on global healthcare platforms.The measures to market ‘India’ for medical tourism, supported with enhancing the resource pool (doctors/nurses), would enable increased international patient flow. The government will support states in establishing five regional medical hubs in partnership with the private sector, which is expected to be supportive for large hospital operators with strong operational presence.The Union Budget 2026-27 reinforces the government’s commitment to promoting clean and emerging technologies across the energy value chain.Viability gap funding (VGF) support for battery energy storage systems (BESS) is proposed to increase sharply to Rs 10b, a tenfold rise from Rs 1b in FY26RE, which is positive for IPPs such as ACME Solar, which have undertaken BESS projects.The capital outlay for Defense was hiked to Rs 2.2t for FY27 (up 18% YoY) vs. Rs 1.9t in FY26RE. The Sharp 18% year-on-year increase in defense capital expenditure directly benefits indigenized defense electronics and order inflows.Bharat Electronics is well-positioned to capitalize on sizable orders including QRSAM, Akash-NG, next-generation corvettes, and base programs.Capital expenditure remains the central pillar of the Budget’s growth strategy. Central government capex rises to about Rs 12.2t in FY27, registering an 11.5% increase over the revised estimates for FY26.Larsen & Toubro’s prospect pipeline stands at a healthy Rs 5.9t, up 7% YoY, diversified across infrastructure, hydrocarbons, carbon, and hi-tech segments. Strategic focus on urban development, renewables, gas, AI, and data centres supports strong opportunity visibility across domestic and international markets.We are optimistic about the domestic tourism industry, with demand consistently exceeding pre-Covid levels. Hotel companies expanding into tier-II and below cities will benefit from the government’s push for tourism.Lemon Tree Hotels continues to demonstrate resilient performance, driven by strong ARR growth and strategic property additions. Aurika Mumbai and other flagship properties are expected to drive double-digit RevPAR growth in 2HFY26.The fact that the government would continue its infrastructure push is a key indirect positive for auto and auto ancillaries. The increase in PLI allocation, move toward establishment of rare earth corridor and provision of 4k e-buses for East Tourism highlight its continued focus on EV transition.We expect the auto segment to sustain its momentum on the back of a positive consumer sentiment, both in urban and rural and steady economic growth expected in FY27.The Union Budget 2026-27 gives a substantial manufacturing push (electronics and infrastructure) that should support demand for cables & wires. Long-term tax holiday until 2047 for foreign companies that provide cloud services globally using data centre infrastructure located in India – will attract investment in Indian data centre capacity, which would drive growth for cables. Polycab remains a strong structural play on India’s electrification, infrastructure and real estate upcycle.The Union Budget 2026-27 announcements and initiatives are aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and competitiveness in the Indian EMS sector. The introduction of an ISM 2.0, Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS), Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS), EMC/EMC2.0 and doubling of outlay under the ECMS scheme promote cost-efficient manufacturing.These steps should position India as a growing hub for electronics production, offering significant growth opportunities. EMS companies will leverage these initiatives by expanding domestic production.Capex for FY27BE is pegged at Rs 12.2t, compared to Rs 11.0t in FY26RE. The infrastructure sector accounts for ~60% of the total domestic steel demand, with construction at ~20% and automobiles at ~8%.Domestic steel demand is expected to improve with higher capex and recent GST rate cuts on auto, consumer durables and other sectors. Tata Steel is well placed to benefit from improving steel realizations, operating efficiencies, and robust domestic demand.Cement demand has improved after remaining weak for 1.5 years. Industry volume grew ~7-8% YoY in 3QFY26, with strong demand momentum after the monsoon and festive periods.The government's increased allocation to overall capex (up ~12% to Rs 12.2t vs. 2025-26RE) is expected to indirectly benefit cement demand.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said.

With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden.Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.",Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: faqs answered. Finance minister nirmala sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime.
