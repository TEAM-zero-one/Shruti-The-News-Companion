Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22

As India gears up to celebrate Diwali, the India’s Union Government, led by a visionary Prime Minister, left no stone unturned to increase the savings for a common man through revolutionary reforms and rate rationalisation under GST. As expected, the removal of 12% and 28% slabs will pervasively benefit key business sectors including daily essentials, healthcare, consumer electronics, automobile, agriculture etc. The reforms, when given a closer look, are reflective of significant measures to boost some of the key drivers of the economy namely – Human Capital, Private Consumption, Business Investments and Government Expenditures.As GST 2.0 was dedicated to the common man, the focus on daily essentials was indeed a highlight. From exempting key products like ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk, breads, paneer etc. to bringing down the levy to a mere 5% GST rate on butter, packaged food products etc., the measures would only serve the objective of deepening the pockets of citizens for ensuring increased private spendings ahead of the festive season.The ""COMMON MAN ITEMS"" section in the Press Release highlighted the theme of rationalization, featuring household items like handbags, umbrellas, bicycles, now made subject to a concessional 5% GST.This reduction reflects a thoughtful approach rather than a forced change, as many of these goods were previously taxed at 18%, indicating a deliberate effort to ease the financial burden on consumers while maintaining certain existing tax slabs.It was also widely noted that pursuant to the announcement of GST 2.0, sectors like automobiles and consumer electronics saw a sales dip due to anticipated rate reductions. With clearer implementation timelines, these sectors are poised for revenue growth during the festive season. While luxury vehicles maintain high GST rates , the decision to limit three-wheeler GST reductions to 18% (instead of 5%) may invite re-consideration, as these vehicles serve the rural population expected to benefit from the reforms.Moving towards agriculture, the Government walked the talk which was being echoed since the fall of tariff negotiations with the US. The dedicated support for farmers was clear with the reduced GST to 5% on essential agricultural machinery and fertilizers. Simultaneously, as the pharmaceutical sector remained exempt from the US taxes, it was only fair to grant full exemptions for essential drugs and lower levies on medical devices under GST, showcasing an effort to enhance equity in domestic trade.While the services sector too went through significant changes, the critical highlight and talking point would remain the exemptions granted to the insurance industry. As part of the Union Budget 2025-26, it is noteworthy that the Government enhanced the FDI limits in the sector to 100% under automatic routes which opened the doors for increased competitiveness in the sector through foreign players. These measures, when analysed collectively, are likely to increase the affordability of insurance products in India.Shifting the focus from rate changes, it is equally critical to note the extended focus on Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) as the Government has taken noteworthy steps by way of simplifying GST registration processes, treatment of discounts which will play a critical role in the upcoming festive season. Additionally, the measures to sanction 90% accumulated ITC refunds on preliminary risk evaluation and removing levy in intermediary services has set a tone for strengthening the position of ‘Made-in-India’ goods/ services at global stage.It was indeed pleasing to see that the Government also took note of significant challenges caused to businesses owing to delayed implementation of the Appellate Tribunals despite notifying specific rules long back. Consequently, the industry would welcome the decision to operationalise Tribunals by end of September including the clarity offered for timelines for consideration of backlog appeals and hearing.On the revenue and policy front, the Government’s decision to impose higher GST rates of 40% on luxury and sin goods, such as tobacco, pan masala, aerated sugar drinks and luxury automobiles is understandable since the move discourages harmful consumption and offsets revenue losses caused by external tariff impacts, especially US trade barriers. The higher rate structure acts as an economic shock absorber consequently fortifying the domestic market against global tariff-induced uncertainty while curbing forex outflows associated with luxury imports.While the GST 2.0 effective from 22 September 2025 delivers significant relief to end consumers, it is indeed an uplifting measure of India’s GDP as well which needed a significant push considering the $30 Trillion economy dream to be achieved by 2047. It is likely that these measures would enhance Per Capita Income levels leading to increased spendings, a critical affair amidst global tariff wars. It is also noteworthy that reforms would also entail some short-term transitional challenges to businesses such as implementing anti-profiteering measures, navigating refund of accumulated credits etc. Therefore, to ensure smooth and litigation-free implementation of these reforms, the Government may need to work closely with industry bodies to achieve the defined objectives and issue appropriate clarifications, as required.","As india gears up to celebrate diwali, the india’s union government, led by a visionary prime minister, left no stone unturned to increase the savings for a common man.

Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22





The central government’s revenue loss from the recent GST rate cuts is projected to be only around Rs 3,700 crore in FY26, cushioned by stronger consumption and higher tax collections, according to a report by the State Bank of India (SBI).As per news agency ANI, the report noted that while the government, based on FY24 estimates, had earlier projected a gross revenue loss of Rs 93,000 crore from GST rationalisation, higher collections reduced the net loss to Rs 48,000 crore.For FY26, SBI expects the gross loss to rise to Rs 1.11 lakh crore, but with buoyant consumption and better compliance, the net loss is seen sharply lower at Rs 25,794 crore, including Centre and states’ share.For the Centre alone, the loss is significantly smaller. Using the FY24 baseline, the Centre’s share was Rs 6,960 crore, while for FY26 it is projected at Rs 3,740 crore, SBI said. “Based on the trend growth and consumption boost, we expect Rs 3,700 crore revenue loss in GST,” the report added, noting the fiscal impact is just about 1 basis point of the deficit.SBI highlighted that past GST rate cuts have often led to additional revenues of nearly Rs 1 trillion.It argued the latest reforms should be viewed as structural rather than a temporary stimulus, as the simplified framework is expected to reduce compliance burdens, widen the tax base, and encourage voluntary compliance.On inflation, the report estimated that reducing GST rates on around 295 essential items, many now under 5% or Nil, would lower CPI inflation in this category by 25–30 basis points in FY26. Further, rationalisation in services is expected to ease CPI by another 40–45 basis points, taking the overall moderation to 65–75 bps over FY26–27.Experts said the reforms, part of GST 2.0 approved by the GST Council on September 3, reflect a shift to demand-led growth. Essentials will now attract 5%, other goods 18%, and luxury/sin items 40%.As per news agency PTI, HSBC Global Research said the combination of GST changes, income tax cuts and benign inflation will create conditions for “sustained growth,” with GDP rising by up to 0.2 ppt.Jefferies said the GST cuts would help both consumers and companies at a time of weak demand, while Kotak Institutional Equities noted they could revive FMCG consumption. Standard Chartered said the GST reduction could lower inflation by 40–60 bps annually, while adding 0.1–0.16 ppt to GDP growth.Overall, analysts expect the reforms to spur consumption in sectors including consumer goods, retail, automobiles, cement, insurance, and renewables, while also giving a push to private capex after years of sluggishness.","The central government’s revenue loss from the recent gst rate cuts is projected to be only around rs 3,700 crore in fy26.

"GST reforms to boost dairy and fertiliser sectors; lower household costs, aid farmers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-reforms-to-boost-dairy-and-fertiliser-sectors-lower-household-costs-aid-farmers/articleshow/123736376.cms,"AI image





The sweeping GST reforms announced this week will give a major push to India’s cooperative and farm sectors by reducing costs, boosting demand, and raising incomes, the Ministry of Cooperation said in a statement.The ministry noted that the reforms will particularly benefit rural enterprises, farmer producer organisations (FPOs), and women-led self-help groups engaged in food and milk processing. “GST rate reductions will benefit cooperatives in farming and animal husbandry, promote sustainable farming practices, and benefit small farmers and FPOs. The NextGenGST reforms brought under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji has been hailed by the entire dairy cooperative sector, including the big cooperative brands like AMUL,” it said, ANI quoted.In the dairy sector, milk and paneer—whether branded or unbranded—have been exempted from GST, while the tax on butter, ghee, and similar products has been cut from 12% to 5%. GST on milk cans made of iron, steel, or aluminium has also been reduced from 12% to 5%. The ministry said these changes will make dairy products more competitive, provide direct relief to farmers and consumers, and strengthen women-led rural enterprises.Food processing has also received a major boost, with GST on cheese, namkeens, butter, and pasta lowered to 5%. Jams, jellies, yeasts, bhujia, and fruit pulp or juice-based drinks now attract 5% GST, while chocolates, corn flakes, ice creams, pastries, cakes, biscuits, and coffee have also seen a reduction from 18% to 5%. “Lower GST will reduce household expenditure on food items, stimulate demand in semi-urban and rural areas, and promote growth in the food processing and dairy cooperative sectors,” the ministry added.The reforms extend to agriculture inputs and logistics. GST on key fertiliser inputs such as ammonia, sulphuric acid, and nitric acid has been reduced from 18% to 5%, correcting the inverted duty structure and lowering input costs for fertiliser companies. Bio-pesticides and micronutrients have also seen a cut to 5%, which the government said will promote eco-friendly farming and benefit organic farmers under the Natural Farming Mission.Tractors below 1800 cc and their components such as tyres, tubes, and hydraulic pumps will now attract only 5% GST, down from 18%. The GST on commercial goods vehicles such as trucks and delivery vans has been lowered from 28% to 18%, which the ministry said will reduce freight costs and improve export competitiveness. In addition, GST on third-party insurance of goods carriage has been cut from 12% to 5% with input tax credit.The government described the reforms as “next-generation GST changes,” announced just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to them in his Independence Day speech. The GST Council approved the sweeping rate cuts, which the government has described as a Diwali gift for citizens.","The reforms will particularly benefit rural enterprises, farmer producer organisations (fpos), and women-led self-help groups engaged in food and milk processing.

For most Indians, the fear of outliving retirement savings looms larger than ever as life expectancy rises and medical costs climb. Picture this: your morning coffee in retirement, bills paid, lifestyle intact — and all of it supported by a steady Rs 1 lakh monthly income. Financial planners say this is possible, but the secret lies in building the right retirement corpus and matching it with your risk appetite.Depending on the investment route you choose, the required savings range from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore. Safe options like annuities and fixed deposits can work with Rs 2 crore, while those willing to take higher risks may target the same income with just Rs 1 crore in diversified equity funds.To generate Rs 12 lakh annually, the required corpus depends on the rate of return. With Rs 2 crore, investors can choose safer instruments like annuities, debt funds or fixed deposits, which typically offer around 6% returns, according to an ET report. For those with Rs 1.5 crore, instruments offering 8% returns, such as the Senior Citizens’ Savings Scheme, balanced hybrid funds or equity savings funds, may be enough.According to Value Research data (September 2, 2025) quoted in the ET analysis, balanced hybrid and equity savings funds have delivered 8.80% and 8.10% CAGR respectively over the last decade.Risk-tolerant investors with Rs 1.2 crore can aim for products that generate about 10% returns, such as aggressive hybrid, large-cap or large-and-midcap funds, which have delivered 11.98%, 12.75% and 14.69% CAGR respectively in the last 10 years. At the highest-risk level, those with Rs 1 crore can still target Rs 12 lakh annual income by investing in flexicap or multicap funds, which have historically returned over 12% CAGR. Flexicap funds, for instance, gave 13.64% CAGR in the past decade.Table source: ETSome planners recommend strategies that preserve capital while providing inflation-adjusted returns. Rohan Goyal of MIRA Money suggests a 4–5% withdrawal rate, requiring Rs 2.4–3 crore to sustainably generate Rs 12 lakh annually. “A 4–5% withdrawal rate is low enough that portfolio growth should outpace withdrawals, making the corpus last decades,” he was quoted as saying.Arun Kumar of FundsIndia advises an 85:15 split between aggressive hybrid and arbitrage funds, with systematic withdrawal plans (SWPs) starting after one year. Withdrawals should pause if the market corrects sharply and shift temporarily to arbitrage funds, resuming later.Elever’s Karan Aggarwal suggests a glide-path approach: begin with a 50:50 split between debt and arbitrage funds, then shift 10% annually towards equity until the sixth year, when equity allocation reaches 50%.Tax treatment varies across instruments. Equity funds attract 15–20% short-term capital gains tax and 10–12.5% long-term capital gains tax, while debt funds face 20% with indexation or 12.5% without. Hybrid funds are taxed according to their asset mix, said CA Suresh Surana.A fixed withdrawal of Rs 1 lakh today may lose significant value over 10 years. SWPs that allow part of the corpus to remain invested and continue compounding can help balance current income with future security.Experts say there is no universal formula for securing Rs 1 lakh a month. “Start early, diversify across equity, debt and hybrid options, and review periodically,” one planner said. “What matters most is matching investments with risk appetite and keeping income inflation-adjusted.”","For most indians, the fear of outliving retirement savings looms larger than ever as life expectancy rises and medical costs climb.

Will ensure your fiscal health is safeguarded: FM to states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-ensure-your-fiscal-health-is-safeguarded-fm-to-states/articleshow/123740036.cms,"From Healthcare to MSMEs Business Bodies Cheer GST 2.0 as Big Push for Self-Reliance, Relief





NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has assured states about the Centre's commitment to ensuring fiscal health of states, addressing concerns over revenue getting impacted, at least temporarily, due to a reduction in GST rates.""Our govt remains committed to safeguarding fiscal stability and economic well-being of all states. The well-calibrated approach in the current GST rate rationalisation exercise - with our focus on the common man, farmers, middle class, MSME and such other targeted segments will ensure an optimal balance between rational tax incidence and robust revenue,"" she said in a letter to the states, while ""recognising"" their contribution at the last meeting of the GST council.Earlier this week, the all-powerful panel of ministers had rationalised rates by lowering the levy on 375 items and raising it on only 25-odd goods and services. The slabs were also changed, with 12% and 28%, set to be abolished from Sept 22, leaving goods and services either in the 5% or 18% bracket in addition to 14 (nine goods and four services) going to the new rate 40%, reserved for sin and luxury goods.Some of the states, where opposition parties are in power, had raised concerns over ""revenue loss"", which the Centre argued is unlikely given that lower taxes will boost demand and generate buoyancy.In her letter, FM said: ""The spirit of cooperative federalism underpinned our deliberations. The strength of the Council as a forum for in-depth discussions and decisions was demonstrated. The proposals agreed upon in this meeting mark a historical milestone in the journey of GST. It is expected that our decisions will have a far reaching impact on the nation's indirect tax framework.

"Rice exporters call GST reform economic catalyst; agri sector gains from quicker refunds, consumers to benefit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rice-exporters-call-gst-reform-economic-catalyst-agri-sector-gains-from-quicker-refunds-consumers-to-benefit/articleshow/123737545.cms,"



The next-generation Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms will act as an economic catalyst, with significant benefits for agriculture and rice exports, according to Indian Rice Exporters Federation’s Vice President Dev Garg. Calling the move “not just a tax reform, it is an economic reform,” Garg said the measures would unlock growth opportunities, create jobs and strengthen the sector.Speaking to ANI, he highlighted that exporters had long faced bottlenecks in GST registration, which earlier took more than a month. “Firstly, the time limit for GST registration has now been reduced to three days. Earlier, it used to take more than 30 to 40 days and this was a very challenging aspect for any large exporter,” Garg said.He added that the reform would make exports more viable across multiple ports. “If we specifically talk about rice, an exporter may export from Kandla port, Vizag port, Mumbai port or Kakinada port… Earlier, if I didn’t have GST registration in Andhra Pradesh, it was very difficult to aggregate large quantities at the port warehouse and export it.”Another critical change is quicker refunds. “Any exporter would get provisional 90% refund within one week, which has been reduced from earlier 60 days to seven days.If we talk about the rice industry, more than Rs 1,230 crore of the rice industry are stuck under GST refunds. By bringing in this enabling provision, this amount will be unlocked for the industry which will reduce the working capital cycle,” Garg said.He also noted that GST rate cuts would stimulate demand. “This new change will also bring in a wave of fresh consumer demand as we have seen that for most consumer goods, the GST slab has been cut down. This will lead to increased demand from the consumer side,” he said.With India expecting a record rice harvest this Kharif season, Garg stressed the timing was crucial. “We anticipate that the crop for high value basmati and other varieties of Indian rice will result in a huge surplus stock situation. When there is a surplus, we need enhanced consumer demand to uplift the prices and keep the prices for paddy high during the harvest season so that farmers get their due,” he said.He argued that consumers will now have more purchasing power. “If earlier somebody was purchasing a low value rice variety of Rs 25 to 35 per kg, today because of this GST rate rationalisation, he will be able to shift to a higher variety of rice… basmati and other premium types.”On behalf of around 7,500 rice exporters, Garg thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government for implementing the reform, which was described by the GST Council as a “Diwali gift” after approving sweeping rate cuts across sectors including food staples, agriculture, education, healthcare, automobiles, electronics and insurance.","Gst reforms will act as an economic catalyst, with significant benefits for agriculture and rice exports, says indian rice exporters federation’s vice president dev garg.

GST reform: Nirmala Sitharaman calls overhaul 'a people’s reform' touching every family; to boost consumption,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-reform-nirmala-sitharaman-calls-overhaul-a-peoples-reform-touching-every-family-to-boost-consumption/articleshow/123735234.cms,"



Calling the landmark GST overhaul a “people’s reform”, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the sweeping rationalisation of tax rates across nearly 400 products will benefit every family, lower household bills, and boost consumption, giving a fresh push to the economy.In an interview to PTI, Sitharaman emphasised that she would personally monitor whether the benefits of the cuts are passed on to consumers through price reductions, while pointing out that industry has already shown positive intent. “This is a reform which touches the lives of all 140 crore people. There is no individual in this country who is untouched by GST. The poorest of the poor also have something small that they buy, touched by GST,” she said.She noted that in the days since the decision, carmakers, PSU insurers, shoe brands and apparel companies have already announced significant price cuts, with others expected to follow suit by the time the new rates kick in on September 22, the first day of Navratri.The rejig eliminates the 12% and 28% slabs, leaving a simplified structure of 5% for common-use goods and 18% for others, with a new 40% slab reserved only for sin and ultra-luxury items.Essential goods like soaps, shampoos, tractors, cars, air-conditioners and even individual health and life insurance premiums will become cheaper, with the latter now fully exempt from GST.Under the revamped structure, most daily food and grocery items will fall under the 5% slab, with staples like bread, milk and paneer attracting no tax at all. “So this rate reduction is going to bring down monthly household ration and medical bills, as well as help aspirational buying like upgrading from car, replacing white goods like refrigerator or washing machine,” Sitharaman explained.The minister said the reform—the most significant since the 2017 rollout of GST—was designed with the common man in mind. Combined with the income tax relief she announced in February’s Budget, the measures leave more money in people’s hands and create conditions for higher consumption. “People do understand for example, Rs 100 with which they go to the shop to buy a thing. Today, the same Rs 100 they can buy one and a half of the commodity. Earlier, they bought one,” she said.Sitharaman stressed that she would directly engage with companies if they fail to pass on the benefit of rate cuts. “They’ve all come out openly to say we will pass this on. So, I can see the positivity from industry and trade... I’m very confident they will pass it on,” she said.On inflation, she added that it was “already well under control” and the tax cut would encourage people to spend more. “There is no doubt about it,” she asserted.The reforms, she said, go beyond rate reductions, targeting ease of business for small and medium enterprises as well. Key features include simplified compliance, faster refunds and smoother registration. Under the new system, 90% of refunds will be processed within the stipulated time, and companies will be able to register within three days.The overhaul also resolves long-standing disputes over product classification. For instance, all types of salted popcorn will now be taxed at 5%, irrespective of whether they are sold loose or pre-packed. Earlier, packaged salted popcorn attracted 12% GST while caramel popcorn was taxed at 18%. Similarly, cream buns will now attract 5% GST instead of 18%, addressing earlier anomalies where buns and cream were taxed separately at lower rates.“The GST overhaul touches every household, reduces confusion, and supports businesses, while ensuring affordability across the board,” Sitharaman said, adding that it will create a “virtuous cycle” of higher consumption and growth.","Nirmala sitharaman says she will personally monitor whether the benefits of the cuts are passed on to consumers through price reductions.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS .In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform.

By Parizad Sirwalla

(The author is Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India)

Budget 2025 income tax: In the run up to the Budget 2025, individual taxpayers were eagerly looking forward to favorable tax reforms. The FM seems to have brought some cheer to them through her proposals.Recognizing the contributions of the middle class and with an objective to eventually phase out the old tax regime, various changes have been introduced in the new tax regime. The basic exemption limit has been increased from INR 3 lakhs to INR 4 lakhs. In a significant shift, the highest slab is increased from INR 15 lakhs to 24 lakhs. The other slabs and tax rates have been realigned and a new tax rate of 25% has been included. Income threshold for rebate under 87A available to resident taxpayers has been increased from INR 7 lakhs to INR 12 lakhs. For computing this threshold, special rate income (such as capital gains, lottery winnings etc.) has been specifically excluded, to also address certain ambiguities in the earlier interpretation.With these changes, all the taxpayers in the new tax regime have some reason to celebrate, irrespective of income levels.As an illustration, a person with income up to 12 lakhs can now enjoy annual tax savings of INR 80,000 (excluding cess). At the same time, an individual with income of 18 lakhs has a tax savings upto INR 110,000 (excluding cess). The savings would be higher for income levels where surcharge is applicable.Few amendments have been made with a view to simplify certain provisions. Earlier, in case of vacant properties, annual income could be considered as NIL for up to two self-occupied properties (SOP). While there is no change in above, to qualify as SOP, currently there is a condition that the taxpayer should not be able to reside therein due to his business or employment or profession and that taxpayer is staying in a premises not owned by him. This condition has now been done away with.NPS Vatsalya Scheme launched in September 2024, enabled parents and guardians to start a NPS for their minor children, which on attaining majority, would be transferred to the child's name with the accumulated corpus. As a welcome measure, the Budget has extended the deduction of INR 50,000 under section 80CCD (available in the old tax regime) to also include contributions towards this scheme. Further, it has been specified that partial withdrawals up to 25 per cent from the scheme, allowed for specified reasons, shall not be taxable.Currently, a deduction is allowed to an individual for any amount deposited in the National Saving Scheme (NSS), prior to 1 April 1992. Any withdrawals from the scheme are held as taxable. As a notification dated 29 August 2024 specified that the balances would not earn interest, this made the depositors keen to withdraw the NSS balance. Based on various representations received, the FM has now exempted the withdrawals done post 29 August 2024, for which deduction was allowed earlier, to provide them the much-required relief.Striking a balance between fiscal prudence and the theme of “Trust first, Scrutinize later”, the Government has enhanced timelines for filing updated returns by two more years by paying additional taxes of 60 and 70 percent respectively. This will help boost tax revenues through voluntary compliance.Consistency and clarity has been provided in the taxability of redemption proceeds of all un-exempted ULIPs, by including them in the definition of equity - oriented fund, which was earlier only with respect to certain unexempted ULIPs.There has been a rationalization of the various TCS/ TDS thresholds including on remittances under Liberalized remittance scheme (from INR 700,000 to INR 10,00,000 and NIL in the case of remittance for education financed by a specified loans) and interest income for senior citizens (from existing INR 50,000 to INR 100,000). This will positively impact their cash flows.The higher TDS is proposed to be continued on assesses having invalid PAN/ non-PAN holders. However, it is proposed to remove the higher TDS/TCS on non-filers of return of income with an attempt for ease of doing business and reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers.The FM has also promised to table the much-awaited New Income Tax Bill which aims at simplicity and reduced litigation, in the next week. All in all, the Budget endeavors to take steps to reinforce confidence and optimism in the taxpayers.","Income threshold for rebate under 87a available to resident taxpayers has been increased from inr 7 lakhs to inr 12 lakhs.

'Budget's given comfort to monetary authority': Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budgets-given-comfort-to-monetary-authority-finance-secretary-tuhin-kanta-pandey/articleshow/117995724.cms,"In an interview to TOI,

Pandey, who is also in charge of the revenue department, said

Do you think the Budget has done enough to help accelerate growth against the backdrop of global uncertainties?

Is the time right for

monetary authorities to play a part in accelerating growth, for example with a rate cut?

So, has the Budget created conditions for a rate cut?

Is the tax relief largely to boost consumption and address some of the concerns of the middle class?

Have other levers of economy got required attention, apart from consumption and investment?

When do you expect I-T bill to be presented in Parliament? How will it make life of the taxpayer simple?

Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the 2025-26 Budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation.the Budget has enabled all levers of growth to accelerate. Excepts:It is a pro-growth Budget. We have headwinds and we also have internal challenges. We have addressed both. Although, we are still the fastest growing large economy in the world, not only we have to maintain this growth, but we have to push it up. We have addressed both the supply-side and demand-side and tried in a non inflationary way to maximise growth, accelerate growth.I think it's up to the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to take a call on that. But, on the fiscal side, we have done our bit. We have kept the promise of fiscal consolidation. FM had announced that it will be 4.9% in this year and we have been able to achieve 4.8%. FM had said fiscal consolidation path will mean we'll bring it to 4.5% next year. We are proposing 4.4% and there was also an announcement that thereafter we will have a glide path in terms of the debt-to-GDP level and a visibility would be given on how it will go forward.That has also been included in the FRBM statement.In a way, the Budget has provided whatever stimulations are required. We are not providing a stimulus at the cost of the deficit by increasing the deficit. So, we are giving sufficient sort of comfort to the monetary authority. However, they would have to take a call based on whatever.I would say consumption is one part. However, we are not really prescribing how taxpayers, who have got this money back in a way, how they will behave. Basically, the decision making is transferred to taxpayers, who have got this relief. They may choose to consume, save or invest directly in either of the three situations we have. It will have a salutary and good effect on the economy because if they choose to consume, it will boost demand. If they choose to invest indirectly, they are supporting the banks to extend more credit. Because, banks can give credit only when they have got increased deposits. And, if they choose to directly invest, for example in a house, they also participate in investments. In that case, it will work like an investment multiplier anyway. So, it will be a combination of consumption and investment multiplier, with a positive impact on savings. Overall, I would say it will be a growth-booster.A large economy like India has to have all engines firing. You cannot simply say we will only go for agriculture, not for manufacturing. Or, we will go for manufacturing and not for services. Therefore all three are required. If you see all the proposals on supply side, we have tried to see how we can speed up production, how we can speed up productivity and how we can spur employment. So, it is employment-led growth. In agriculture, we have taken steps to boost pulses productivity and increase credit limit for farmers. Everywhere we have said how we can boost production and productivity. We are saying let there be a growth path for MSMEs. Let there be more credit available for MSMEs. Let their participation in exports be more. Let there be more support for them in terms of innovation and research. Our tax policy is supporting labour intensive sectors.It is proposed to be done before Feb 13. We are not changing the policy through it. The same thing will be carried forward because after passing, this bill will be applicable from a future date. We wanted to reform right away. So, those reforms have been brought in this bill through amendments. There are so many redundant provisions. There are a number of changes. More than 4,000 changes have happened since 1962, when this act was enacted. In 63 years, the finance sector changed, plus there were many taxation laws and amendment bills. Things get complicated to read and they may also create interpretation problems. There could be many interpretation problems or litigations. If you have more readability, if you have clarity, there will be less litigation.","Finance secretary tuhin kanta pandey said the 2025-26 budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation.

The revised income tax slabs were announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in her Union Budget 2025 speech. The most important takeaway from the new income tax rules for the upcoming financial year is that individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh will have to pay ZERO tax. For salaried individuals, once the standard deduction of Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime is counted, this income level goes up to Rs 12.75 lakh.Additionally, across the board income tax slab changes mean that individuals under the new tax regime, will now have to pay lower taxes, even at income levels above Rs 12 lakh. There is also the concept of marginal relief, which allows individuals earning just above Rs 12 lakh to not pay taxes more than their additional income.The total tax benefit of slab rate changes and rebate at different income levels can be illustrated with examples:Confused about the new income tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime?

Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs. 12 lakhs. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.Yes, the limit of total income for NIL tax payments in the new tax regime has been increased to Rs. 12 lakhs in this budget provided the taxpayer files ITR to avail the rebate.Earlier the limit of income for nil tax payment was Rs 7 lakh. By increasing this limit to Rs 12 lakh around one crore assessees who were earlier required to pay tax varying from Rs 20,000 to Rs 80,000 will be now paying nil tax.Yes, a standard deduction of Rs. 75,000 is available to a tax payer in the new regime.

For example, for a person having income of Rs 12,10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax, works out to be Rs. 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakhs + 10% of Rs 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10 thousand). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-.The tax liability on such tax payer by way of slabs only is Rs 61,500. How ever a person having Rs 12 lakh income pays nil tax. By providing marginal relief it has been ensured that the tax payable by a person having income marginally above Rs 12 lakhs is required to pay only marginal amount of tax equal to the amount of income above Rs 12 lakhs so that his carry home is also Rs 12 lakhs. In this case he will be required to pay a tax of Rs 10,000.The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-(i) First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. In the answer given to question no.15 above, tax on the total income of Rs 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:(ii) Tax payable on total income of Rs 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.(iii) Now the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs 61,500) shall be compared with amount exceeding total income upto which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs 12,10,000 - Rs 12,00,000](iv) The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs 10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs 61,500) as tabulated above.(v) Therefore, in the above case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/- = 51,500/-) is allowed.(vi) Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500 - Rs 51,500]Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh!

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/latest-income-tax-slabs-2025-26-how-much-tax-do-individuals-earning-slightly-above-rs-12-lakh-have-to-pay-marginal-relief-calculations-explained/articleshow/117911656.cms,"Budget 2025 income tax: The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs. 12,75,000/-.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 post Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ZERO or NIL tax liability for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in the Union Budget 2025 under the new income tax regime. For salaried individuals, including the standard deduction, this limit is Rs 12.75 lakh under the new regime.But what about individuals with taxable income slightly above Rs 12 lakh? Will they have to pay more income tax than their additional earnings above Rs 12 lakh? Will someone earning Rs 12,10,000 face a Rs 61,500 tax burden versus an individual earning Rs 10,000 less who will pay nothing?There's good news! Here's where the concept of marginal relief comes us. Individuals with income slightly above Rs 12 lakh, which is the nil tax threshold, will receive fair treatment through marginal tax relief.For example, for a person having income of Rs 12, 10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax works out to be Rs 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakh + 10% of 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10,000).

GST reforms on the cards?

More tax relief coming soon? The Narendra Modi government, having provided substantial relief in personal income tax and customs tariff rationalisation in the Union Budget 2025, is now expected to initiate efforts to streamline the goods and services tax (GST) framework for easier implementation and adherence, according to officials.The primary objective will be to restructure the tax slabs to ensure meaningful outcomes, they indicated.The GST structure comprises four slabs-5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, with special rates for certain items like precious metals and additional cess on sin goods.The 5% slab currently covers 21% of GST items, whilst 12% applies to 19%, 18% to 44%, and 28% to 3% of items.According to an ET report, the government intends to discuss simplification and rationalisation with the group of ministers (GoM) tasked with reviewing rates, according to a source close to the discussions.The source noted that whilst the GoM has primarily concentrated on slab adjustments for goods, a comprehensive simplification requires fundamental restructuring of the current system.The GST Council established the GoM for rate rationalisation in September 2021. Despite numerous meetings, the GoM has not yet presented its final recommendations.Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The GoM is considering proposals including elimination of dual rates for items like pens and sunglasses based on price thresholds. Specialists have noted these complexities create compliance challenges.The GST revenue-neutral rate (RNR) has decreased to 11.6% from 15.5% at its July 2017 implementation, due to various exemptions and reductions.Most experts advocate a three-rate structure for enhanced simplicity and effectiveness.","The primary objective will be to restructure the tax slabs to ensure meaningful outcomes.

For an annual income of Rs 13.7 lakh, with basic salary at 50% (Rs 6.85 lakh), the NPS contribution at 14% would amount to Rs 95,900. Combined with the Rs 75,000 standard deduction, this eliminates tax liability on the entire Rs 13.7 lakh.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 after Budget 2025: Zero income tax on Rs 13.7 lakh salary? Don’t rub your eyes! Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget 2025 speech announced that there will be NIL or zero income tax for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh. But did you know that for salaried individuals, the tax-free annual income can reach Rs 13.7 lakh, compared to Rs 12 lakh for others!“I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000,” FM Sitharaman announced in her Union Budget speech.This advantage of no tax till Rs 13.7 lakh income stems from the Rs 75,000 standard deduction and National Pension System (NPS) investments. Section 80CCD(2) allows tax deduction of up to 14% of basic salary invested in NPS, whilst the old tax regime offers 10%.According to an ET analysis, a salaried individual with Rs 13.7 lakh yearly income can achieve tax savings of approximately Rs 96,000 through NPS contributions. It’s important to note that this benefit requires employer participation in NPS as part of cost to the company, as employees cannot opt independently.It’s interesting to note that despite this opportunity existing for nearly a decade, only 2.2 million individuals have enrolled. ""Only a few corporates are interested in rolling out the NPS benefit, and even fewer employees are willing to enrol in it,"" said Sudhir Kaushik, chief executive of tax filing portal Taxspanner.com.Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? The extended NPS lock-in period and withdrawal limitations at maturity discourage many investors. Pre-retirement withdrawals are restricted to exceptional circumstances. Upon maturity, only 60% can be withdrawn, whilst 40% must be invested in an annuity for lifetime pension.Financial experts consider these restrictions beneficial. ""The lack of liquidity in NPS is not necessarily bad because the money is at the right place. Investment returns can be enormous if held for the long term,"" said Sriram Iyer, chief executive of HDFC Pension.NPS provides additional benefits, including asset mix selection, fund switching options, and pension fund manager changes without tax implications.

As a common man of India, I would like to compliment and thank Hon’ble Finance Minister (FM) for being considerate towards the middle class and salaried taxpayers who generally feel neglected. The projected fiscal deficit of 4.4% for the next year (as against revised fiscal deficit of 4.8% for the current year) reflects a well thought through approach. The 2025 budget presented by the FM strikes a perfect balance between maintaining fiscal responsibility and managing taxpayers’ expectations.To begin with, the FM is keen to sunset the Old Personal Tax Regime (OPTR) as all the tax benefits are now proposed under New Personal Tax Regime (NPTR). With the proposed changes, NPTR will now become far more appealing for individuals as it would mean availing beneficial tax rates and no tax declaration or providing/ maintaining tax deduction and exemption proofs. Just to share perspective, last year only 28% of taxpayers opted for OPTR which will substantially decline in coming years as OPTR will only be beneficial if you are in the 30% tax bracket with over INR 8 lakh of eligible deductions and exemptions.Even the slab rates are easy to remember, slab changes with every block of 4 lakh and corresponding tax rates changes 5% up to six blocks with highest slab being 30 percent. Salaried individuals with a gross salary of up to INR 12.75 lakh will have zero tax under NPTR. To illustrate further, an individual earning income of, say, INR 24 lakh per annum, who had previously opted for NPTR will now enjoy a tax saving of INR 114,400 and much more compared to OPTR.Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The FM has taken conscious effort to bring down administrative burden and tried to rationalize on various aspects like penalty will be in abeyance till the final order is passed by the tax department. Now taxpayers have an opportunity to file an Updated Income Tax Return (UITR) with applicable penalty slabs based on the period of delay, up to four years in case they have missed reporting any income. By extending the option of filing UITR, Government is further encouraging such suo-moto filings, thereby enhancing its revenue streams, and providing an opportunity for taxpayers to be compliant.Further, the FM has proposed increasing TDS threshold on interest paid to senior citizens from INR 50,000 to INR 100,000, benefiting those who rely on traditional savings like term deposits and post office schemes by allowing them to retain more interest income. Additionally, TDS on dividends will now apply only if the amount exceeds INR 10,000, resulting in higher disposable income for active investors and more opportunities for reinvestment.In 2020, the Government introduced foreign remittance tracking mechanism by levying Tax Collection at Source (TCS) under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). While foreign remittances up to USD 250,000 per annum is permitted under the LRS, currently, TCS is applied on remittances above INR 7 lakh. With the proposed increase in threshold from INR 7 lakh to INR 10 lakh, Government aims to alleviate the financial burden on individuals remitting funds for various purposes.Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? For families who are supporting their children to pursue higher education overseas by borrowing from banks, the current TCS requirement of 0.5% on remittances exceeding INR 7 lakh adds to their financial strain. With interest rates on education loans usually exceeding 8% per annum, additional TCS meant lesser funds. With the budget proposing to scrap TCS on education-related remittances funded through financial institutions, the Government is promoting access to global educational opportunities, aligning with the vision of ""Viksit Bharat” and contributing to a more skilled workforce.By introducing the National Pension Scheme (NPS) Vatsalya last year, the Government provided an initiative for parents or guardians to open NPS accounts for their minor children. The FM expanded tax benefits for NPS to include contributions of up to INR 50,000 in NPS Vatsalya under OPTR.Regarding Income from house property, the proposal allows taxpayers to claim up to two properties as self-occupied without any conditions. This change offers relief to those with a second property that may remain vacant for various reasons. This is again testimony to avoid ambiguity and litigation.While no change in the tax rates on crypto transactions, it is proposed to be included in the definition of Virtual Digital Assets and prescribed reporting entities will furnish information in a specified statement.Further, the ambiguity about taxing the redemption of unit-linked insurance with high premiums policies has now been clarified i.e., long term capital gains at 12.5%.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime For millions of middle-class taxpayers, this budget represents more than just a change in policy; it serves as a financial lifeline. This shift in focus towards the middle class is particularly significant in a time when rising costs and inflation have put pressure on their finances. As they navigate the challenges of daily life, the tangible benefits of this fiscal relief will enable them to participate more actively in the economy, ultimately contributing to a cycle of growth and stability.To conclude - As one said, “Income tax is the hardest thing in the world to understand”, the FM has taken the challenge seriously and is moving in the right direction to simplify the same. The budget has provided a preview of a simplified tax system in the country, serving as a teaser for the New Income Tax Bill set to be unveiled next week. If today's budget is any indication, we can anticipate a more tax-friendly and simplified compliance-oriented tax framework soon.",The 2025 budget presented by the fm strikes a perfect balance between maintaining fiscal responsibility and managing taxpayers’ expectations.

The sweeping changes in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates announced by the government will come into effect from September 22, the first day of Navratri, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Saturday, calling it a transformative step for the economy.Speaking at a press conference at the BJP headquarters, Vaishnaw said the rationalisation of rates and simplification of the tax system would ease citizens’ lives and provide an economic push. “Before 2014, the taxation system was very complex and goods were taxed at multiple levels. GST has made it simple. This rationalisation and simplification in GST reforms will make people’s lives easier,” he said, ANI quoted him as saying.The minister argued that the measures, alongside income tax relief announced in the 2025-26 Budget, would help lift India’s GDP through higher consumption.""This GST reform will push further India's economy. From pure economics point of view, our GDP is currently at Rs 3.30 lakh crore, of which Rs 2.02 lakh crore is our consumption. Even if our consumption rises by 10%, we will have Rs 20 lakh crore extra consumption, contributing to GDP,"" he gave a back of the envelope calculation as to what to extent can this GST reform boost the country's consumption.The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, has slashed rates across multiple sectors in what the government described as a Diwali gift. Items of daily use such as hair oil, shampoo, toothpaste, soaps, toothbrushes and shaving cream will now attract 5% GST, down from 18%.Similarly, dairy products like butter, ghee, cheese and packaged snacks such as namkeens, bhujiya and mixtures will see their rates reduced from 12% to 5%. Utensils, feeding bottles, baby napkins and clinical diapers will also now fall under the 5% slab.Farmers are set to benefit with tractor tyres and parts moving from 18% to 5%, and tractors themselves from 12% to 5%. The healthcare sector, too, has received significant relief, with individual health and life insurance policies now fully exempt from GST. Medical products including thermometers, oxygen, diagnostic kits, reagents, glucometers and test strips will be taxed at 5% instead of 12%, while corrective spectacles also fall under the 5% slab.Education items such as maps, charts, globes, pencils, sharpeners, crayons and pastels are now fully exempt, with notebooks, exercise books and erasers also shifted to the nil slab.The automobile sector, a major contributor to GDP, will also see relief. Petrol, hybrid, LPG and CNG cars up to 1200 cc and 4000 mm length, along with diesel and hybrid cars up to 1500 cc, will be taxed at 18% instead of 28%. Three-wheelers, motorcycles up to 350 cc and goods transport vehicles will also benefit.High-ticket appliances, including air conditioners, televisions above 32 inches, monitors, projectors and dishwashers, have also been brought down to 18% from 28%.Alongside rate cuts, procedural reforms were also announced. New GST applicants will now get automatic registration within three working days through system-driven analysis.“These reforms fulfil the promise made by PM Modi from the ramparts of the Red Fort,” Vaishnaw said, adding that the changes will strengthen the consumption cycle and push India’s growth momentum further.","Ashwini vaishnaw said the reform will help lift india's gdp through higher consumption. The changes will come into effect from september 22, the first day of navratri. Items of daily use such as hair oil, shampoo, toothpaste, soaps, toothbrushes and shaving cream will now attract 5% gst.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123734801,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-623860,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
