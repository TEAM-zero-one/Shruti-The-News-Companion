BHUBANESWAR: Not smoke. Not mirrors. Just steel that wasn’t there. Three decades after magician PC Sorcar Jr stunned a live crowd by making a passenger train “vanish” at Bardhaman in Bengal, rail travellers in western Odisha faced a far less theatrical disappearance — a reserved coach that never showed up.Passengers holding confirmed tickets for a 3AC coach on Sambalpur–Nanded Nagavali Superfast Exp discovered Sunday morning that their coach was missing when train 20809 rolled into Sambalpur, 320km west of Bhubaneswar.Sorcar’s act relied on lighting, timing and crowd control. This one needed none of that — just confirmed tickets, an absent coach and a reminder that on Indian Railways , reality can outdo illusion.The train departed Sambalpur without coach BE2. Confusion followed on the platform. Ticket examiners fielded protests as travellers were unsure whether to board. Others climbed into any coach they could find. Over 30 passengers with confirmed berths scattered across the train.East Coast Railway blamed a technical snag that prevented attachment of the coach. The issue was resolved when train reached Visakhapatnam Jn, where an AC coach was added.","Passengers holding confirmed tickets for a 3ac coach on sambalpur–nanded nagavali superfast exp discovered sunday morning that their coach was missing.

What do salaried taxpayers, middle class, and the common man want from

Union Budget 2026

on the income tax front? We take a look at the top 5 expectations.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Income Tax Slabs FY 2026-27 & Rebate Under Section 87A

Income up to Rs 4 lakh is exempt from tax - so the basic exemption limit is Rs 4 lakh. There is an ask among taxpayers that this limit be hiked further to reduce compliance burden.

Income in the Rs 4 lakh to Rs 8 lakh bracket attracts a 5% tax.

Income in the Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh bracket attracts a 10% tax.

Income ranging from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 16 lakh is taxed at 15%, rising to 20% for income between Rs 16 lakh and Rs 20 lakh. Those earning between Rs 20 lakh and rs 24 lakh are taxed at 25%.

Any income above Rs 24 lakh is taxed at the highest slab rate of 30%. Salaried taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to raise the income threshold for 30% tax bracket to Rs 30 lakh.

At present income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers) is tax free after availing rebate under Section 87A. Tax experts suggest that this limit can be hiked to Rs 15 lakh.

Standard Deduction

Home Loan Interest

self-occupied residential property

Section 80C

Tax Filing Compliance

Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget speech in the hope of more tax relief. Last year, FM Sitharaman announced major changes in the new income tax regime, and while tax experts believe that there is little fiscal room in Budget 2026 for any big tax income tweaks, there is also a hope that some changes may be brought about to further boost consumption.At present the income tax slabs under the new tax regime are:Several taxpayers continue to file tax returns under the old income tax regime. They want the government to reduce tax rates and hike basic exemption limit under that regime as well.Standard deduction limits under the old and the new income tax regimes differ. Those filing tax under the old income tax regime get the benefit of Rs 50,000 standard deduction, while those under the new income tax regime can avail a higher standard deduction of Rs 75,000. Tax experts are of the view that there is a case to hike the standard deduction limit, especially under the new tax regime which offers very few deductions and exemptions.Individual taxpayers can avail tax deduction on the interest paid on a home loan under the old income tax regime. The interest you pay on a home loan for yourcan be deducted from your taxable income up to ₹2 lakh per year (or actual interest paid if less). Tax experts are of the view that to encourage housing sector, this benefit should also be available under the new tax regime.Section 80C is a popular exemption available under the old income tax regime, but its limit of Rs 1.5 lakh has remained unchanged for many years now. The exemption is for investments made in Provident Fund, Public Provident Fund (PPF), mutual funds and other popular investment options. Tax experts believe that to incentivise savings, there is a case to not only hike this limit, but also include this exemption benefit under the new income tax regime to encourage adoption.The government has been focusing on ease of income tax return filing, but taxpayers believe that e-filing of returns still needs to be made easier. The tax compliance mechanism, grievance redressal system, and tax queries related to mismatches in the Annual Information Statement (AIS), Form 16, Form 26AS needs to be made less complicated, say tax experts.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations: like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to fm nirmala sitharaman’s union budget speech in the hope of more tax relief.

NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark indices slumped sharply on Budget day on Sunday, with both the Sensex and Nifty50 ending more than 2% lower as markets reacted negatively to the fine print of the Union Budget.The BSE Sensex plunged 1,843 points, or 2.23%, to close at 80,722.94, while the NSE Nifty50 fell 593 points, or 2.33%, to 24,825.45, wiping out early gains as selling pressure intensified through the session.At 12:30, BSE Sensex was trading at 81,119, trimming 1,150 points or 1.40% while NSE Nifty50 reached 24,790, down 530 points or 2.09%.The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) had issued separate circulars confirming that trading will proceed as usual on Budget day.Both exchanges said market hours will remain unchanged, following the standard schedule for a regular trading session.Gold and silver prices tumbled on Sunday, hitting lower circuit levels in futures trade ahead of the Union Budget 2026–27 presentation. Gold futures for April 2, 2026, delivery dropped Rs 9,140, or 6%, to Rs 1,43,205 per 10 grams, while silver futures for March 5, 2026, delivery fell Rs 17,515, or 6%, to Rs 2,74,410 per kg.The steep fall extended to MCX shares, which slipped 10% to hit the lower circuit at Rs 2,145.25. Analysts attributed the selloff to profit-booking following Friday’s historic crash, which saw both metals post their sharpest single-day declines. Market participants are closely watching how the Union Budget and global cues influence the recovery of precious metals in the coming sessions.Also read: Gold, silver prices crash on Budget 2026 day; hit lower circuit levels in futures trade - what’s causing the slide? The BSE added that while key segments such as equity, futures and options, and commodity derivatives will operate normally, certain specialised sessions will be suspended. “Trading Members may note that trading in the T+0 Settlement Session and Auction Session for settlement default will not be conducted on Sunday, February 01, 2026,” the exchange said.Trading on a Sunday is uncommon for Dalal Street, as both exchanges typically remain shut on weekends and designated public holidays. February 1 will therefore be among the rare Sundays when markets are open for regular trading.Talking about investor expectations, Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited said, “Investors don’t have expectations of any major tax reliefs in this Budget since the 2025 Budget delivered huge income tax reliefs. Some tweaking of certain taxes is likely. If there is an increase in exemption for long-term capital gains tax from Rs 1.25 lakhs presently to a higher limit that would be a positive. From the market perspective, a fiscally prudent, growth-oriented Budget is desirable. There are rumours of exemption from long-term capital gains tax for certain categories of FIIs. If this happens, it can trigger a rally in the market.”Further mentioning sectors that’ll be in focus, he added, “Higher allocation for defense is a given and, therefore, defense stocks will continue to be in focus. A thrust area of the Budget can be exports, particularly manufacturing exports which the Economic Survey harps on. Therefore, export segments are likely to be on the radar of investors. Announcements relating to PSU bank mergers; disinvestment in PSUs will be keenly watched. Aside from the Budget, the crash in precious metal prices may bring investors back into equity.""A look at market trends over the past decade shows that Budgets have sparked strong rallies, but many have led to muted moves or even declines.Markets generally respond well when the Budget emphasises growth, infrastructure spending and tax stability. In 2017, for instance, then finance minister Arun Jaitley avoided major tax hikes and offered relief to the middle class. Investors welcomed the approach, with the Sensex rising about 1.7% and the Nifty gaining nearly 1.8% , one of the stronger Budget Day performances of that period.Another standout came in 2021, when Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Budget in the wake of the Covid-19 shock. With a clear push towards economic recovery, higher capital expenditure, healthcare and infrastructure, markets rallied sharply. The Sensex jumped over 2% and the Nifty climbed almost 2.7%, marking one of the best Budget Day gains in recent years.But not every Budget has cheered investors. In 2016, higher dividend taxation dampened sentiment, and the Sensex ended the day in the red. In 2018, the introduction of long-term capital gains tax on listed equities and equity mutual funds caught markets off guard. Although indices slipped only modestly on the day, they fell around 6.8% over the following sessions. The 2023 Budget triggered a largely flat reaction, as it maintained fiscal discipline but lacked big-bang reforms to excite traders.The July 2024 Budget also drew a cautious response. Changes related to capital gains taxation surprised some investors. While the reaction was not severe, both the Sensex and Nifty ended slightly lower, underscoring how unexpected tax measures can weigh on sentiment even when the broader macro picture is stable.Also historically, volatility after the Budget has been common, and one-month returns have often been mixed.As the nation heads into the Union Budget 2026, market conditions are already unsettled. Equity indices have pulled back from recent highs, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers, and global factors such as interest rates, geopolitical tensions and trade policies continue to influence sentiment. In this backdrop, sharp moves on Budget Day are almost inevitable.","The bse sensex plunged 1,843 points, or 2.23%, to close at 80,722.94. The nse nifty50 fell 593 points,or 2.33%, to 24,825.45.

Parliament Budget Session

: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2026 in Parliament on February 1, 2026.The Union Budget 2026 will mark FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive Budget presentation, making her the first finance minister in India to achieve this milestone. She will also become the first finance minister to present a Union Budget on a Sunday, adding to the historic significance of the occasion.In 1999, when February 28 fell on a Sunday, then finance minister Yashwant Sinha presented the Union Budget a day earlier, on Saturday, February 27. Nirmala Sitharaman has previously presented Budgets on Saturdays as well — on February 1, 2020, shortly before the Covid-19 lockdown, and again on February 1, 2025.Until 1999, the Union Budget was presented at 5 pm, a colonial-era practice aligned with British working hours. That convention was changed by then finance minister Yashwant Sinha, who shifted the Budget presentation to 11 am, a practice that continues to this day. Later, in 2017, former finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced another reform by advancing the Budget presentation to February 1 from the end of the month.The Budget 2026 will be delivered during the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament and will lay out the government’s fiscal roadmap for the 2026–27 financial year. The Budget speech is scheduled for February 1, 2026, with the Finance Minister expected to begin her address at 11:00 am.The Union Budget is generally presented on February 1 to allow ministries and departments adequate time to implement proposals from the start of the new financial year on April 1.Viewers can watch the Union Budget 2026 speech live through multiple official and media platforms:The full Budget documents will be made available online soon after the speech, along with explanatory statements and annexures.The Budget Session of Parliament commenced with President Droupadi Murmu addressing members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on January 28. The first phase of the session is scheduled from January 28 to February 13, while the second phase will run from March 9 to April 2, with the session comprising 30 sittings.The Union Budget is a key annual policy statement that outlines government spending, taxation proposals and fiscal strategy for the coming year, and the 2026 presentation will be closely tracked across sectors, markets and households.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman is scheduled to present the union budget 2026 in parliament on february 1, 2026.

West Bengal

Tamil Nadu

Kerala

Assam

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman may not have opened the purse strings for poll-bound states in Union Budget 2026 but she made them a part of many ambitious development initiatives like the rare earth corridor, dedicated freight passage and the proposed high-speed rail networks.Assembly elections are scheduled in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry later this year. With the BJP going all out to wrest Bengal from Mamata's Trinamool Congress and make inroads in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, there were expectations that Nirmala Sitharaman would announce a slew of proposals with these states in focus like many times in the past. While the Budget did not make big-ticket state-specific announcements, there was something to cheer for all the poll-bound states.So, while Tamil Nadu got a high-speed rail link for Chennai, ecologically sustainable mountain trail in Podhigai Malai in the Western Ghats and a rare earth corridor in the Budget, poll-bound Bengal featured in many infrastructure, logistics, rail and tourism initiatives. Kerala found mention in the context of rare earths and the turtle trail.A key announcement for West Bengal was the proposal to develop a new dedicated freight corridor from Dankuni in West Bengal to Surat in Gujarat, aimed at promoting environmentally sustainable and efficient movement of cargo.The corridor is expected to significantly reduce logistics costs for industries in eastern India, and improve connectivity between the eastern and western markets.In another major push, Sitharaman said the Centre will develop an Integrated East Coast Industrial Corridor, with a well-connected industrial node at Durgapur, a key manufacturing hub in West Bengal. The project is expected to strengthen the state's role in the Centre's 'Purvodaya' vision for accelerating industrial growth in eastern India.The Budget also proposed the creation of five tourism destinations across the five 'Purvodaya' states, including West Bengal, to boost employment and regional development. To support sustainable urban mobility in these regions, the government also said it will make a provision for 4,000 electric buses.To boost rail connectivity, Sitharaman announced plans to develop seven high-speed rail corridors across the country, with one of the proposed routes linking Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and Siliguri in northern West Bengal. The corridor is expected to significantly cut travel time, and enhance economic and strategic integration of north Bengal with the rest of the country.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee described the Union Budget for 2026-27 as a “directionless and visionless Humpty Dumpty”, claiming that it had nothing to offer to the common man and her state. “This Budget is directionless, visionless, actionless and anti-people. It is also anti-women, anti-farmer, anti-education and against the SC, ST and OBC... There is nothing on offer for Bengal... in the Humpty Dumpty budget,"" she said.“For West Bengal, what have they given (in the Budget)? Nothing. They talk big, but offer nothing,” Mamata added.Tamil Nadu got a high-speed rail link for Chennai, ecologically sustainable mountain trail in Podhigai Malai in the Western Ghats and a rare earth corridor. Bird watching trails along the Pulikat lake and development of the archaeological site of Adichanallur into a vibrant, experiential cultural destinations were among the other announcements for the poll-bound state.In Adichanallur, excavated landscapes will be opened to the public through curated walkways. Immersive storytelling skills and technologies will be introduced to help conservation labs, interpretation centres, and guides.Sitharaman also announced that Hyderabad-Chennai and Chennai-Bengaluru will be part of the seven high-speed rail corridors between cities as growth connectors.Tamil Nadu is also one of the key states that will be part of the dedicated rare earth corridor to promote mining, processing, research and manufacturing. The Centre had in November 2025 launched a scheme for Rare Earth Permanent Magnets. The proposed corridor is an extension of that effort.India has the potential and opportunity to offer world-class trekking and hiking experience. Ecologically sustainable mountain trail will be developed in Podhigai Malai in the Western Ghats. Also, bird watching trails will be developed along the Pulikat lake which covers both Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in her speech.Tamil Nadu, which is home to thousands of temples and pilgrimage centres like Rameswaram and has several temple-towns including Madurai, Kancheepuram and Kumbakonam, will also benefit from the initiatives announced in the Budget.Kerala will be part of ""rare earth corridors"" and ""Turtle Trails"" announced in Budget 2026. The ""Turtle Trails"" would be established along key nesting sites in coastal regions aimed at conservation and eco-tourism. The dedicated Rare Earth Corridors aim to boost mining, processing, research and manufacturing in the sector.The state found little else to cheer, with several long-anticipated projects missing from Centre's plans. The state was not included in the proposed high-speed rail corridors, while neighbouring Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana featured in the network expansion.Kerala's ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) criticised Budget 2026, saying it left the state largely sidelined.Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor said ""There was a reference to an All India Institute of Ayurveda being established, but not any indication as to where. Kerala would imagine that, as a major centre of Ayurveda, it should be a logical place, but they haven't promised us that.""""Even when coconuts and cashews were talked about, the state wasn't mentioned. So, I am assuming that some of these subheadings she spoke about will translate into concrete projects and programmes for us....but where details came, we had reason for disappointment, for example, ship repair for inland waterways, they are parking them in Varanasi and Patna despite Kerala having so many rivers and inland waterways,"" he added.Assam hopes to benefit from the Union Budget's thrust on infrastructure development of Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, as well as the announcement of Buddhist Circuits. The focus on MSMEs will be advantageous for the poll-bound state, which has a large number of small and medium enterprises, said officials.The proposal for setting up a Buddhist Circuit in the region, including Assam, also features in the Union Budget for 2026-27. The scheme will cover preservation of temples and monasteries, pilgrimage interpretation centers, connectivity and pilgrim amenities.""The North-Eastern Region is a civilisational confluence of Theravada and Mahayana/Vajrayana traditions. I propose to launch a scheme for development of Buddhist Circuits in Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura,"" Sitharaman said.The Budget also proposes creation of five tourism destinations in the five 'Purvodaya' states and proposes to upgrade the National Mental Health Institutes in Tezpur as a Regional Apex Institution.In a series of X posts, Assam chief minsiter Himanta Biswa Sarma listed out several points from the Union Budget and asserted that the state is going to gain in many aspects.""The announcement of Self-Help Marts (SHE-Marts) will further strengthen Assam's efforts towards building a robust ecosystem of Lakhpati Didis under #MMUA,"" Sarma said.The chief minister maintained that the emphasis on skilling in the Budget aligns with Assam's vision to emerge as a trusted hub for skilled professionals in healthcare, AI and other allied sectors. ""This Budget provides Rs 2 lakh crore under the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment, which will accelerate infrastructure activities in Assam,"" he added.","West bengal, tamil nadu, kerala, assam and puducherry will hold elections later this year. Finance minister nirmala sitharaman made them a part of many ambitious development initiatives.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127841613,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1153884,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

KURUKSHETRA:

Subsidies, Jobs, AI Tool: FM Sitharaman Unveils Big Budget Boost For Agri Sector To Help Farmers

The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Charuni has strongly criticised the Union Budget 2026–27 presented by the Central Government on Sunday, terming it anti-farmer, disappointing and far removed from ground realities. The farmers’ body said millions of farmers across the country had high expectations from the budget, but once again those hopes were dashed.In a statement issued after the budget presentation, the BKU (Charuni) media in-charge Rakesh Kumar Bains said the government focused heavily on technology, artificial intelligence, digital platforms and futuristic plans in its budget speech, while completely ignoring the immediate and pressing issues faced by farmers.The farm union pointed out that the budget remained silent on several key demands, including a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, the continuously rising cost of farming, sharp increases in prices of diesel, fertilisers, seeds and pesticides, and comprehensive loan waivers for debt-burdened farmers. It also criticised the absence of concrete measures for adequate compensation for crop losses caused by natural disasters and the failure to enhance the amount under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme.According to the BKU (Charuni), the annual assistance of Rs 6,000 provided under PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme has become inadequate in the present economic conditions and has effectively turned into a “mockery” for farmers. Despite repeated assurances by the government, no firm announcement was made in the budget to increase this amount. Similarly, the farm union expressed strong disappointment over the government’s continued silence on granting a legal guarantee to MSP, calling it a betrayal of farmers’ trust.The farmers’ union alleged that while the budget provides relief to corporates and promotes policies on paper, it fails to address the concerns of farmers who toil in the fields. “Farmers do not need Apps or speeches; they need fair prices, security and dignity,” the statement said.The BKU (Charuni) has demanded that the government immediately provide a legal guarantee for MSP, increase the PM-Kisan assistance to at least Rs 12,000 per year, implement loan waivers along with affordable credit facilities for farmers, and reform the crop insurance scheme to make it simpler, transparent and farmer-friendly.Warning of future action, BKU Charuni said that if the government continues to ignore farmers’ issues, it will not hesitate to adopt agitational measures to protect farmers’ interests.","The bharatiya kisan union (bku) charuni has strongly criticised the union budget 2026–27 presented by the central government on sunday.

PM Modi Calls Budget 2026 Historic As Reforms Empower Youth Women And India’s Growth Push

LUCKNOW: The Union Budget 2026-27 on Sunday drew mixed reactions from the top echelons of Uttar Pradesh politics, with chief minister Yogi Adityanath terming it a welfare-oriented blueprint for building a 'Viksit Bharat', and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav rebuking it as an ""invisible ledger"" of the BJP's corruption.In a post on X in Hindi, Adityanath said, ""On the auspicious occasion of Maghi Purnima and the birth anniversary of Sadguru Ravidas Ji Maharaj, the Union Budget 2026-27, presented today by the Hon'ble Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman under the visionary guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is an inspiring blueprint for building a 'Viksit Bharat'.""This Budget will provide opportunities to the youth, security to farmers, encouragement to entrepreneurs, relief to the middle class, and respect to the labourers.""This was the third Budget of the BJP-led NDA government in its third term in office.The chief minister said the Budget announcements would give a new impetus to innovation, manufacturing and employment, while strengthening agriculture, rural development, infrastructure, tourism, culture and the country's knowledge traditions, ""thus realising the mantra of 'Development with Heritage'"".""Under the guidance of the prime minister, the foundation for an ' Aatmanirbhar Bharat ' has been further strengthened by supporting MSMEs, startups and indigenous production.We are confident that this Budget, through social justice, inclusive development and good governance, will pave the way for the India of today and tomorrow,"" Adityanath said, thanking the prime minister and the finance minister for a ""visionary"" ""welfare-oriented"" Budget.Samajwadi Party chief president Akhilesh Yadav, however, launched a sharp attack on the Centre, saying the Budget is meant to aid the BJP's own people and commissions, calling it an ""invisible ledger"" of its corruption.Taking to X, Yadav said, ""The result of the BJP's Budget is out - the stock market has crashed. We already said that the question was not whether the stock market would open on Sunday, but how much more it would fall.""Reiterating that there was no reason to expect anything positive from the Budget, the former chief minister said, ""When there is no hope from the BJP government, what can be expected from its Budget?""Yadav also said the Samajwadi Party considers every BJP budget as a ""1/20th Budget"" as it caters to only 5 per cent of the population.""The BJP's Budget is meant for its own people and commissions. It is an invisible ledger of its corruption,"" he alleged.Yadav also said the Budget neither mentioned nor cared for the common people, flagging the ""failure"" to provide tax relief to the public despite soaring inflation as ""tax exploitation"".In a lengthy post, Yadav claimed that while multiple concessions have been given to the businesses and leisure activities of the rich, the plate of expectations of those struggling with joblessness and unemployment remained empty.""This is a disappointing and condemnable Budget,"" he claimed.Reacting to the Budget, Uttar Pradesh Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said, ""It focuses on youth and women empowerment, job creation, and strengthening education and healthcare. With sound policies and a results-oriented vision, the Budget firmly propels us towards the goal of a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047.""""From manufacturing to infrastructure, healthcare to tourism, rural economy to AI, sports to pilgrimage - the Budget opens up vast opportunities in every sector.""The allocation of two crucial high-speed rail corridors to Uttar Pradesh - Varanasi-Delhi and Varanasi-Siliguri - out of the seven planned corridors, will give a new direction to the state's connectivity, investment and development,"" Maurya said.","The union budget 2026-27 drew mixed reactions from the top echelons of uttar pradesh politics.

The ministry of external affairs said Pakistan should instead address the long-standing grievances of the people of Balochistan and its record of human rights violations. The response came after Pakistan’s military and interior minister alleged Indian involvement following multiple suicide and gun attacks across the province that left 33 people, including civilians, dead, while security forces claimed to have killed 92 militants.

Duty cuts and exemptions may make sports equipment, leather goods, cancer medicines, seafood, solar panels, EV batteries and personal imports cheaper, while lower TCS will reduce upfront costs on foreign travel, education and medical remittances. In contrast, trading activity, corporate cash distributions, video gaming equipment parts, imported coffee machines and alcoholic liquor may become costlier due to changes in taxes and withdrawal of exemptions.

“All Talk, No Solutions” Oppn Slams Centre Over Economy, Jobs

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabh Rahul Gandhi on Sunday slammed the Union Budget 2026-27, calling it “blind to India’s real crises” and accusing the government of ignoring deep economic distress faced by ordinary citizens.In a post on X, the Leader of the Opposition laid out what he described as the country’s pressing problems: “Youth without jobs. Falling manufacturing. Investors pulling out capital. Household savings plummeting. Farmers in distress. Looming global shocks - all ignored.” He added that it was “a Budget that refuses course correction, blind to India’s real crises.”Gandhi’s remarks came soon after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her ninth consecutive Budget, in which she raised the capital expenditure target to Rs 12.2 lakh crore for FY27, up from Rs 11.2 lakh crore in the current fiscal.The Budget also outlined infrastructure measures, including projects in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, against a backdrop of global uncertainty, trade frictions and slowing exports.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also slammed the budget, arguing that the government lacked both ideas and direction. “The Modi Government has run out of ideas. Budget2026 does not provide a single solution to India’s many economic, social, and political challenges,” he wrote.In another post, Kharge said, “‘Mission Mode’ is now ‘Challenge Route’. Reform Express rarely stops at any ‘Reform’ Junction.

Budget 2026 Signals Infra First Strategy With Public Capital Expenditure Raised To ₹12.2 Lakh Crore

Railway Budget 2026: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced seven new high-speed, bullet train corridors spanning the Indian Railways network across the country as part of her Union Budget speech. This is the first time that the Budget is being presented on a Sunday.""In order to promote environmentally sustainable passenger systems, we will develop seven high speed rail corridors between cities as growth collectors,"" FM Sitharaman announced. The seven routes are:At present India does not have any functional high-speed or bullet train corridor. The first bullet train project is currently under construction between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.The first phase of this bullet train corridor within Gujarat is expected to be operational by 2027.Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, Senior Director & Global Head, Consulting, Crisil Intelligence says, “The Finance Minister’s announcement of seven high-speed transport corridors is critical not just for capacity creation, but for enabling technology adoption through advanced signalling, traffic management and higher-spec rolling stock.These corridors will significantly reduce inter-city travel times and support seamless multimodal people movement by integrating rail, road, metro, bus and aviation networks. Given their long gestation, success will hinge on access to long-term financing and appropriately structured moratoriums.”Sitharaman said to promote environmentally-sustainable movement of cargo, she proposed to establish a new dedicated freight corridor connecting Dankuni in the east to Surat in the west.Talking about infrastructure, FM Sitharaman said, “During this past decade, our government has undertaken several initiatives for large scale enhancement of public infrastructure, including through new financing instruments such as infrastructure investment trust. We shall continue to focus on developing infrastructure in cities with over five lakh population that is tier two, tier three cities, which have expanded to become growth centers. ”Indian Railways has been given a total allocation of Rs 2.78 lakh crore. Union Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Sunday said the Union Budget presented in Parliament outlines a clear roadmap for Vikas Bharat, adding that the ₹2.78 lakh crore allocation for Railways reflects that vision.Speaking to ANI, Vaishnaw said the announcement of seven new high-speed rail corridors would sharply cut travel time and lead to a transformative change in the daily lives of people across regions.The minister, who also holds the portfolios of Information and Broadcasting and Electronics and Information Technology, said the Budget reflects a strong commitment to the country, with a special focus on youth and women.“Today's budget is dedicated to the youth of our country. It's dedicated to women's power in our country. And it is inspired by the sense of duty, duty towards our nation, making sure that 'sabka saath, sabka vikas,' the inclusive growth happens in our country. The budget also lays down the roadmap for Vikas Bharat. Today's railway budget of Rs 2,78,000 crore is clearly a step in that direction... Seven new high-speed corridors have been announced today. These high-speed corridors will significantly reduce travel time, bringing about a major change in people's lives,” he said.Highlighting the impact on southern India, Vaishnaw said the Chennai–Bengaluru–Hyderabad triangle would act as a powerful growth engine for Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka, calling it a significant boost for all five states.He further said the planned 4,000 kilometres of high-speed corridors are expected to attract investments worth ₹16 lakh crore.Vaishnaw added that cities such as Mumbai, Pune, and Hyderabad will also emerge as major economic corridors, while in northern India, the Delhi–Varanasi–Siliguri corridor will connect Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal. According to him, this will substantially alter travel patterns while driving tourism and economic activity across these regions.Indian Railways has been getting record capital expenditure allocation for some years now. In the last five years, railway budget allocations have grown exponentially, as the government focused on infrastructure as a driver of economic growth.Till 2017, the Railway Budget was presented separately. Suresh Prabhu was the last Railway Minister to present a separate railway budget in 2016. Since then railway allocations find space in the Finance Minister’s speech, but there is no separate speech or list of new trains announced. The Budget speech around railways tends to center around upcoming projects and long-term vision on passenger services, freight, and safety.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman announced seven new high-speed, bullet train corridors spanning the indian railways network across the country.

The presentation forms part of the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament and will outline the government’s fiscal roadmap for the financial year 2026–27.Sitharaman was seen leaving Kartavya Bhavan for Rashtrapati Bhavan carrying her trademark red ‘bahi-khata’ style tablet folder bearing the national emblem. She becomes the first to present a full Union Budget on a Sunday.The Lok Sabha’s List of Business confirms that the House will assemble at 11am, when the finance minister begins her address.The 11am Budget speech is now standard practice, but this was not always the case.Until 1999, the Union Budget was presented at 5 pm, a colonial-era practice aligned with British working hours. That changed when then finance minister Yashwant Sinha shifted the presentation to the morning, making it more suited to Indian administrative and market timings.Another key reform came in 2017, when Arun Jaitley advanced the Budget date to February 1 from the end of the month. The move gave ministries more time to roll out schemes and spending from the start of the financial year on April 1.Today’s speech continues both these traditions — a February 1 presentation at 11 am — while adding a new footnote: a Sunday Budget. In 1999, when February 28 fell on a Sunday, the Budget was presented a day earlier. Sitharaman, however, proceeds on the scheduled date.During her speech, the Finance Minister will lay out the estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India for 2026–27. She will also table key documents required under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003.She will then seek leave to introduce the Finance Bill, 2026, which gives legal effect to the government’s taxation and financial proposals.Senior officials, including Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, Chief Economic Adviser Dr V Anantha Nageswaran, CBDT Chairman Ravi Agrawal and other Finance Ministry officials, were seen accompanying her.The Budget follows the tabling of the Economic Survey 2025–26, the government’s annual assessment of the economy. Prepared by the Economic Division under the Chief Economic Adviser, the survey reviews performance over the past year and frames the context for fiscal decisions.Union minister Piyush Goyal pointed to the Survey’s First Advance Estimates projecting real GDP growth of 7.4% for FY 2025–26. He said this keeps India as the fastest-growing major economy for the fourth consecutive year. He also cited inflation of 1.7% between April and December 2025, crediting lower food prices and what he described as effective inflation management.The Survey also highlighted a policy push in manufacturing, with the government framing its strategy as moving from “Swadeshi” to “Strategic Resilience” and now “Strategic Indispensability”.",Finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present the union budget 2026 at 11am in the lok sabha today.

India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities. While GST and Customs digitalisation have undeniably transformed the landscape, companies continue to face operational bottlenecks that slow down activity, tie up working capital and drive up compliance costs. These factors directly affect the country’s ease of doing business.In this backdrop, the 56th GST Council meeting marked significant progress by tackling several long-standing pain points. Union Budget 2026 now has an opportunity to build on this momentum and deliver a tax ecosystem that is faster, more consistent and easier for businesses to navigate.A key long pending ask and expectation from the upcoming Budget is a more flexible and business-friendly input tax credit (ITC) system. Companies have long argued that credits representing taxes genuinely paid and used in business operations should be freely available or refunded.Two specific asks remain critical:Allowing smoother credit flow across GST registrations would also unlock meaningful liquidity for enterprises.The recent GST Council decision to treat intermediary services as exports (therefore removing the GST levy) is a welcome step and industry now awaits its formal implementation as a part of the budget process.Businesses are also expecting similar clarity for R&D and testing services, which currently attract 18% GST because place-of-performance rules prevent them from being classified as exports. A consistent and globally aligned export definition would boost India’s competitiveness in high-value service segments.Compliance complexity remains a major concern with an expectation that multiplicity of proceedings would be addressed. A single, centralised audit and faceless assessment system, similar to the efficient model used under the erstwhile service tax regime, would give pan India businesses one point of engagement, reduce repetitive scrutiny and minimise conflicting interpretations across States.Large taxpayers would particularly benefit from a centralized single point of contact approach by way of:A uniform, risk-based audit framework would further enhance consistency and limit unnecessary scrutiny. Equally important is a more calibrated enforcement approach; one that acts firmly against evasion but avoids punitive measures such as asset attachments or frequent detention of goods in cases involving interpretational differences or procedural lapses. A clearer differentiation between wilful violations and good-faith positions will go a long way in restoring business confidence.For India’s smallest enterprises, current GST registration thresholds (₹20 lakh for services and ₹40 lakh for goods) no longer reflect today’s cost structures. Near-decade-high inflation has pushed many micro-businesses into the GST net perhaps far earlier than intended. Raising the threshold to reflect current realities would preserve working capital and support MSME viability.On the Customs side, businesses continue to face prolonged timelines in dispute resolution, with legacy cases stretching for years and delaying investment decisions. A time-bound settlement mechanism, similar to earlier dispute-resolution schemes, would help clear the backlog and allow both industry and the department to focus on priority matters.Businesses are also seeking greater certainty through longer-validity advance rulings and simpler renewals, so long-term projects are not disrupted by tax disputes merely on account of lapse of time.Operational friction also remains a day-to-day challenge at the border. Even after goods are cleared, companies often face manual processes to pay differential duties or correct documents for host of reasons including price variation, corrections. Allowing digital payments and online amendments, and ensuring such payments qualify for GST credit, would reduce compliance effort and minimise cash-flow disruptions.Cross-border businesses are also looking for clearer, time-bound guidelines around Special Valuation Branch (SVB) proceedings. While scrutiny of related-party pricing is necessary, inconsistent practices often create uncertainty for global supply chains. Predictable timelines and uniform standards are essential if India is to position itself as a reliable global hub.Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units seeking to sell into the domestic market face a structural disadvantage, as duties are levied without fully recognising that these units often use domestic inputs. Aligning duty calculations to reflect only the imported content, and/ or extending select benefits available under free trade agreements, would improve capacity utilisation and offer SEZs a more level playing field vis-à-vis foreign suppliers.Budget 2026 offers an opportunity not just for incremental fixes but for meaningful reform that strengthens India’s indirect tax architecture. The foundation laid by GST and recent digitalisation efforts is robust. What businesses now need is a system that is simpler, more consistent and aligned with the needs of a rapidly expanding economy.If India gets this right, indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.","Indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has presented the Union Budget 2026–27, laying out a series of measures for education and skilling, including IIT Creator Labs, a new design institute in eastern India, girls’ hostels in every district, and expanded healthcare training. This is her ninth Budget and the Modi government’s second full fiscal roadmap of its third term, coming at a time when education is closely tied to technology shifts and job readiness.Education spending has risen steadily over the past five years, with combined allocations for school and higher education increasing from ₹84,219 crore in FY21 to ₹1,28,650 crore in FY26, reflecting the government’s continued focus on learning outcomes and employability.IIT Mumbai will set up Creator Labs to strengthen hands-on innovation and entrepreneurship, giving students access to advanced tools, mentorship, and industry-linked project spaces.The government announced a new design institute in eastern India, aimed at boosting regional creative education and strengthening the country’s design ecosystem.The Centre will assist states in creating five integrated university townships, designed to cluster higher education and STEM institutions while improving student housing and research infrastructure.One girls’ hostel will be established in each district to improve access to education and support higher enrolment among female students, especially from underserved regions.The Budget proposes three new All India Institutes of Ayurveda, alongside training for 1.5 lakh caregivers in wellness and yoga services.Ten new allied health disciplines—including optometry, anesthesia, applied psychology, and behavioural health—will be introduced, with a target to train one lakh Allied Health Professionals over five years.The government will support states in establishing five medical tourism hubs, aimed at strengthening healthcare infrastructure and attracting global patients.A high-powered Standing Committee will focus on the service sector, driving job creation, technology exports, and AI integration to align skills with future workforce needs.Budget 2026–27 introduces the Natural Fibre Scheme, Textile Expansion and Employment Scheme, and National Handloom and Handicraft programme to support traditional industries and generate jobs.Professional bodies including ICAI, ICSI, and ICMAI will develop short modular courses to build a network of corporate mitras, strengthening business skills in tier 2 and tier 3 citiesThe government announced a pilot programme to skill 10,000 tourist guides across 20 iconic destinations through 12-week training courses, to be conducted in collaboration with Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), aiming to improve service quality and create local employment.The government said it will place renewed emphasis on the service sector to meet youth aspirations, while highlighting inclusive growth through greater participation of women in STEM and persons with disabilities across education and employment initiative.The government announced plans to upgrade telescope infrastructure to strengthen astrophysics and astronomy research, aiming to expand observational capabilities and support advanced scientific studies across institutions.The Union Budget 2026 proposes the establishment of new veterinary and para-veterinary colleges in collaboration with Indian and foreign institutions. A loan-linked capital subsidy scheme will support these colleges, hospitals, and diagnostic laboratories, aiming to strengthen infrastructure, improve facilities, and enhance research and training in the sector.The government proposes setting up two National Mental Health Institutes (NIMHANS) in North India and upgrading the existing institute in Ranchi, aiming to strengthen mental health education, research, and services across the country.The government plans to establish a high-powered Education to Employment and Enterprises Standing Committee to enhance employment outcomes and evaluate how emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, are shaping jobs and skill requirements.FM Nirmala Sitharaman told ANI, “To provide a pathway to fulfilling aspirations of a youthful India with the following measures, I propose to set up a high-powered Education to Employment and Enterprises Standing Committee to recommend measures that focus on services sector as a core driver of economic growth.” The committee will also assess the impact of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, on jobs and skill requirements.Highlighting the need for diverse and skilled career opportunities, FM Nirmala Sitharaman announced targeted measures to align education and training with emerging job markets. Existing allied health professional institutions will be upgraded, and new institutions set up in both public and private sectors, aiming to train one lakh allied health professionals over the next five years.FM Nirmala Sitharaman proposed new institutes, university townships, district-level girls’ hostels, and telescope infrastructure upgrades for higher education.FM Nirmala Sitharaman announced the proposal to set up a High-Powered ‘Education to Employment and Enterprise’ Standing Committee while presenting the Budget 2026-27 in Parliament. The committee will recommend measures to position the services sector as a core driver of Viksit Bharat and strengthen the link between education, jobs, and enterprise creation.The committee will focus on identifying priority areas with high potential for growth, employment generation, and exports. It will also assess the impact of emerging technologies, including AI, on jobs and skill requirements, and suggest steps to align education and training systems with future workforce needs.The government aims to make India a global leader in services, targeting a 10% share in the global services market by 2047 through this initiative.Last year’s allocation of about ₹1.28 lakh crore to the Ministry of Education, up 6.22 per cent from the previous year, reinforced the government’s commitment to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Schools received their highest-ever funding, with increased support for Samagra Shiksha, PM-POSHAN, and PM-SHRI Schools. BharatNet began extending broadband to government secondary schools, while digital textbooks in Indian languages under the Bharatiya Bhasha Pustak Scheme aimed to make learning more inclusive.Higher education continued its expansion. Five IITs set up after 2014 received infrastructure upgrades, 6,500 new seats were added, and IIT Patna was earmarked for major development. The PM Research Fellowship expanded support for 10,000 scholars at IITs and IISc. A ₹500-crore Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence for Education signalled a first step towards AI-enabled teaching.Medical education was also being revitalized with an increase of 10,000 seats this year as part of a more long term goal of 75,000 seats in five years.The scaffolds are being erected. The question to be asked is whether Budget 2026 will turn radically towards the quality of learning, teacher preparedness, and employability.The NEP 2020 is progressive, although the difficult task will be the future.According to the Economic Survey 2025-26, education was outlined as the core part of the growth process in India, with an increase in enrolment and increased career opportunities. The current Gross Enrolment Ratios are 90.9 on the primary level and 90.3 on upper primary level.Today India has 23 IITs, 21 IIMs, and 20 AIIMS, with international IIT campuses in Zanzibar and Abu Dhabi. The Academic Bank of Credit has 2,660 institutions, whose IDs have been issued to over 4.6 crore individuals, giving them the option of entering and leaving freely. Approximately 153 universities have implemented bi-annual admissions, which has facilitated the objective of NEP, which aims at achieving 50 percent higher education GER by 2035.But NEP 2020 was not all about numbers. It has real potential in multidisciplinary learning, quality teachers, and education that is industry oriented. Those hopes require low interest in the training of the faculty and reforming the curriculum and assessment systems, aspects that hardly find their place in the headlines but ultimately come back to haunt.What is more important, a greater discomfort is spreading among students: What will artificial intelligence do to their careers?Entry-level jobs in IT, services, and media are already being automated. At the same time, new opportunities are emerging in data, design, ethics, and human–AI collaboration. The challenge for India is not resisting technology but preparing young people to work alongside it.Last year’s AI Centre of Excellence was an important signal. Education leaders now hope that Budget 2026 can go a step further, including supporting scale of teacher training, installing AI literacy in schools and inspiring universities to develop programmes with industry.In the absence of this change, India would have the risk of graduating students with degrees who are not directing in the rapidly evolving job market.The shift in the government towards skill-based education, which has been seen through five National Centres of Excellence in Skilling, has demonstrated the increasing concern over the workforce preparation. However, there is still a gap between theoretical education and the requirements of the workplace, particularly beyond the best-of-the-best schools.The stakeholders expect Budget 2026 to provide greater backing to apprenticeships, micro-credentials, and regional skill hubs. Another priority is teacher capacity-building. Education reform cannot move faster than the educators who deliver it.There is also rising demand for better-targeted funding for digital infrastructure and higher education financing, as India positions itself as a global talent supplier.Education funding has grown steadily. Now comes the more difficult phase: translating expenditure into impact. Budget 2026–27 arrives at a moment when India’s demographic advantage is still intact, but not guaranteed. If today’s announcements successfully link NEP 2020 with AI readiness, teacher development, and real-world skills, this Budget could shape the country’s workforce for decades.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman has presented the union budget 2026–27, laying out a series of measures for education and skilling.

A 'Humpty Dumpty’ Budget: Unimpressed oppn slams Centre



NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday presented the Budget for the financial year 2026–27 in the Lok Sabha during the ongoing Budget session of Parliament. This marked FM Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive Union Budget presentation.FM Sitharaman announced that the capital expenditure (capex) target will be increased to Rs 12.2 lakh crore for FY27, up from Rs 11.2 lakh crore allocated in the current fiscal year.The government expects the fiscal deficit to narrow to 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2026–27, slightly lower than the 4.4 per cent projected for the current financial year. Economists generally consider a fiscal deficit of 3–4 per cent to be comfortable for a developing economy like India, as it helps balance growth requirements with financial stability.In her speech, Sitharaman said the Centre will provide Rs 1.4 lakh crore to states as tax devolution in the next financial year, while net tax receipts are estimated at Rs 28.7 lakh crore. The total size of the Union Budget has been pegged at Rs 53.5 lakh crore.The general government debt-to-GDP ratio stood at around 85 per cent in 2024, including about 57 per cent attributed to central government debt.During her speech, Sitharaman also announced that the new Income Tax Act, 2025, will come into effect from April 1, with rules and income tax return forms to be notified soon.The income tax rates and slabs remain unchanged following last year’s major tax reforms.While the basic tax structure remains the same, the FM announced several measures aimed at simplifying tax compliance and providing relief to taxpayers. The FM proposed extending the timeline for revising income tax returns from December 31 to March 31 with a nominal fee.FM Sitharaman also suggested staggered deadlines for filing returns: individuals using ITR‑1 and ITR‑2 will continue to file by July 31, while non-audit business cases and trusts will have time until August 31.Multiple tax proposals have been announed with the aim of improving ease of living, simplifying compliance, and providing relief to individual taxpayers. The government is focusing on making the income tax system simpler and more citizen-friendly.Interest awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) to individuals will be exempt from income tax. Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on such interest payments will be removed. The move is aimed at ensuring accident victims and their families receive full compensation without tax deductions.TCS on the sale of overseas tour programme packages will be reduced to 2 per cent. The current TCS rates range between 5 per cent and 20 per cent. The reduced 2 per cent rate will apply without any minimum transaction threshold, making foreign travel spending simpler for taxpayers.TCS for remittances sent abroad for education and medical purposes will be reduced from 5 per cent to 2 per cent. The move is expected to reduce the financial burden on families funding overseas education and medical treatment.Supply of manpower services will be explicitly included under contractor payments for TDS purposes. TDS on such services will be applicable at 1 per cent or 2 per cent.Immunity from prosecution will be provided for non-disclosure of small foreign assets. The exemption applies to non-immovable foreign assets with a total value below Rs 20 lakh. The provision will apply retrospectively from October 1, 2024.The Income Tax Act, 2025 will come into force from April 1, 2026. Simplified tax rules and redesigned income tax return forms will be notified soon to help taxpayers transition smoothly.Seven environmentally sustainable passenger corridors planned including Mumbai–Pune, Pune–Hyderabad, and Hyderabad–Bengaluru.- Dedicated freight corridor connecting Dankuni in the east to Surat in the west.- Proposed corridors betweenThe government announced three dedicated chemical parks in every state using a cluster-based plug-and-play model to enhance domestic chemical production.Four states including Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to establish dedicated rare earth corridors.Support to states for three dedicated chemical parks through a challenge route on a cluster-based plug-and-play model.A large portion of the world's rare earth refining capacity is controlled by China, who keep tightened export controls on critical minerals.Benchmark stock market indices Sensex and Nifty slumped on Sunday afternoon trade after the Union Budget proposed raising the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on commodity futures to 0.05 per cent from the existing 0.02 per cent.Sitharaman also announced that buyback proceeds will be taxed as capital gains for all categories of shareholders.After witnessing volatility in early trade, the 30-share BSE Sensex briefly recovered but erased all gains during the Budget presentation. It later plunged 2,370.36 points, or 2.88 per cent, falling below the 80,000 mark to 79,899.42 in afternoon trade. Similarly, the 50-share NSE Nifty dropped 748.9 points, or 2.95 per cent, to 24,571.75.Among Sensex constituents, Bharat Electronics fell 6.50 per cent. Other major losers included State Bank of India, HCLTech, Tata Steel, Asian Paints and Eternal.Gold prices plunged sharply, dropping by nearly 20 per cent in the last two days amid extreme volatility in commodity markets, according to Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) data. The decline continued on Sunday, which coincided with Budget day, with 24-carat gold on the MCX falling to around Rs 1,36,185 per 10 grams. The metal had opened the session at about Rs 1,46,800 per 10 grams, highlighting persistent selling pressure and sharp intraday fluctuations. The weakness was reflected in global markets as well, with international gold prices falling by more than 9 per cent to around USD 4,887 per ounce, further weighing on domestic bullion rates.Selling pressure was also seen in the silver market. Silver prices on the MCX dropped to about Rs 2,65,900, registering a decline of nearly 9 per cent in a single trading session on Sunday. The sharp correction followed strong weekly gains recorded over the past two months.Market experts said a large number of investors had entered gold and silver trades during this period, drawn by the sustained upward momentum in prices. Much of the rally was supported by leveraged positions, which benefited from consistent weekly gains in both gold and silver.Senior opposition leaders including leader of oppositions Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi criticised the Budget for ""ignoring"" looming global shocks. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee termed it a “directionless and visionless Humpty Dumpty” Budget.""Youth without jobs. Falling manufacturing. Investors pulling out capital. Household savings plummeting. Farmers in distress. Looming global shocks - all ignored,"" said Rahul Gandhi.“This Budget is directionless, visionless, actionless and anti-people. It is also anti-women, anti-farmer, anti-education and against the SC, ST and OBC... There is nothing on offer for Bengal... in the Humpty Dumpty budget,"" Mamata said, adding, ""education funds and subsidy have been slashed, along with social security subsidy and fertiliser subsidy. This is a garbage of lies... of Himalayan incompetence. The economy will be totally derailed"".Echoing similar sentiments, Kharge said that the Budget had ""no policy vision and political will"".""Modi Govt has run out of ideas. #Budget2026 does not provide a single solution to India’s many economic, social, and political challenges. 'Mission Mode' is now 'Challenge Route.' 'Reform Express' rarely stops at any 'Reform' Junction. Net result: NO policy vision, NO political will. Our Annadata Farmers still await meaningful welfare support or an income security plan. Inequality has surpassed the levels seen under the British Raj, but the Budget does not even mention it or provide any support to SC, ST, OBC, EWS, and Minority communities. The Finance Commission’s recommendations will have to be studied more, but they do not appear to provide any relief to State Governments which are under severe financial stress. Federalism has become a casualty.,"" Kharge said.",Nirmala sitharaman presents union budget 2026. Capital expenditure (capex) target will be increased to rs 12.2 lakh crore for fy27. The government expects the fiscal deficit to narrow to 4.3 per cent of gdp in 2026–27.

A producer-centric budget?

What's there for middle class?

A Make in India push?

NEW DELHI: Last year, the salaried class cheered, this time it's producers' turn to clink glasses. From morning coffee to stock market trades, the Union Budget 2026–27 quietly redrew the household balance sheet, making some crucial drugs cheaper, while nudging others up, as Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman chose long-term industrial muscle over instant consumer relief amid global trade jitters.As the economists termed it a ""producer-centric"" budget, they expressed optimism that it would give Make in India a positive push. For middle class, it may look disappointing on paper, but experts believe that ""indirect benefits are greater than direct benefits"".The Budget proposals draw a clear line between items that may turn cheaper for consumers and sectors that could feel the pinch. On the relief side, the government has moved to lower costs for sports equipment, leather goods, cancer medicines and seafood through policy support, duty-free imports and customs exemptions, aiming to boost domestic sectors and ease the burden on patients and producers.In contrast, trading activity and certain corporate cash-distribution routes are likely to become costlier following proposed changes to buyback taxation, the securities transaction tax (STT) and tax collected at source (TCS), signalling a tougher stance on tax arbitrage and compliance. Moreover, imported coffee and alcohol may also get costlier.""The budget clearly tilts toward strengthening industry and supply chains rather than immediate consumer relief,"" said economics professor Vinod Sen, Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Amarkantak.""The government’s belief is that strong supply-side growth will eventually benefit consumers through trickle-down effects, though the immediate emphasis remains on production and competitiveness,"" he added.Unlike last year when the Budget offered massive tax relief to the salaried class, this time, it remained ""more producer-centric Budget, with initiatives such as dedicated rare-earth corridors and increased growth and budgetary support for manufacturing, defence, and infrastructure (record Rs 12.5 lakh crore capital expenditure),"" said Raksha Singh, economics professor, IGNTU.""Middle-income households receive selective relief, though the overall impact is modest,"" Sen said.""The Union Budget 2026–27 prioritizes industrial growth and long-term competitiveness over immediate consumer or middle-class relief. Its benefits will unfold gradually through stronger manufacturing, supply chains, and employment opportunities. This approach aligns with the government’s Viksit Bharat @2047 vision but demands consistent execution and favorable global trade conditions,"" he added.The cheaper and the dearer list offers little for the middle class. Major relief in cancer medication prices, along with relief in appliances seem to be a few reliefs here and there.However, experts believe that it may prove beneficial in the longer run as it would ""generate employment opportunities over time"".""For the middle class, indirect benefits are greater than direct benefits, as the Budget is based on structural economic growth rather than immediate consumption growth, which is expected to generate employment opportunities over time. As we all expect every time tax exemptions and tax benefits, so in that front, no change,"" Singh said.The Budget has attempted to sharpen the Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat push by ringfencing manufacturing-heavy, strategic sectors for scale-up and import substitution.The government targeted frontier areas such as biopharma and biosimilars, semiconductors and electronics components, rare earth magnets, chemicals, capital goods and construction equipment, container manufacturing, and clean energy—including EV batteries, solar glass and nuclear power.""The budget provides meaningful but long-term support for domestic manufacturing in the face of global trade challenges,"" said Sen, adding that ""Semiconductor Mission 2.0, capital goods expansion, and duty exemptions on equipment for lithium-ion cells and critical minerals strengthen local production.""""These steps reduce reliance on imports and shield India from tariff shocks,"" he said.Singh, however, said that the self-reliance depended on ""proper implementation"" of the schemes.""Make in India push is slow and strategic, and it can be achieved if properly implemented. Reduced input costs and improved MSME financing will provide a push; however, innovation faces challenges due to relatively less emphasis on R&D, and the focus appears to be more on 'assemble in India' rather than 'Make in India',"" Singh said.""However, from another angle, this can be seen as a smart move to give an immediate push to industries and generate employment opportunities, with the expectation of gradually shifting towards indigenous manufacturing over time,"" she added.","Sitharaman proposed the launch of 'khelo india mission' which would focus on employment, skilling and job opportunities in the world of sports. Sitharaman announced customs duty exemption on 17 cancer medicines and added 7 rare diseases for relief for patients.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127839655,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1552368,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Union Budget 2026: Every year, one of the main components of the Budget presentation is the income tax, as taxpayers keenly watch for changes in the slabs, tax rates and other factors — which may ease their tax burden!However, post Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Union Budget speech, the income tax framework remains unchanged from the previous Budget.FM Nirmala Sitharaman, who presented her ninth consecutive Union Budget on Sunday, was the one who introduced the new tax regime. 6 years back, in 2020, taxpayers were offered another new choice of tax structure, the new income tax regime. Since then, taxpayers have constantly faced a choice: Go with the new tax regime or stay with the old one. Deciding between the two is quite a task as one offers promises of lower rates and simpler compliance while the other lures higher income earners with deductions and exemptions.The new income tax regime was introduced to give middle-class taxpayers more relief. It also aims to simplify the tax system and make filing easier.For FY 2026-2027, under the new tax regime, income up to Rs 4 lakh will remain completely tax-free. Beyond this, a progressive slab system is there, with rates increasing gradually based on income levels:One of the key highlights of the new regime introduced in FY 2025-26, is the enhanced rebate.Previously, resident individuals with a total income up to Rs 7 lakh did not pay any tax. However, under the revised system effective FY 2025-26, this rebate limit has been hiked allowing individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh to be completely tax-free.For salaried taxpayers, this threshold effectively rises to Rs 12.75 lakh, owing to a standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The old income tax regime continues to offer a higher number of exemptions and deductions, making it preferable for salaried taxpayers who claim substantial tax exemptions and deductions during the year.However, the tax rates in the old tax regime are comparatively higher:Deductions commonly claimed under the old regime include House Rent Allowance (HRA), Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), Section 80C, medical insurance under Section 80D, additional NPS contribution under Section 80CCD (1B), and interest on housing loans for self-occupied property.For income levels up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh in the case of taxpayers), opting for the new tax regime means ZERO tax. So, there is no question of opting for the old tax regime. Let’s understand this with an example; at an income level of Rs 10 lakh, with just Section 80C exemptions of Rs 1.5 lakh availed, the tax burden under the old regime is Rs 75,400/- including cess. This amount is ZERO or NIL under the new regimeIt’s important to understand the thumb rule when deciding between the old and new income tax regimes.The simplest way to do this is to add the total number of exemptions and deductions that you can avail. So add your House Rent Allowance or Home Loan interest, Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), Section 80C, NPS benefit of Rs 50,000, Section 80D for medical insurance, Section 80TTA for bank interest income, Section 80G for charity.If this number is lower than Rs 8 lakh for an income threshold of above Rs 24 lakh, then the new income tax regime is more beneficial for you, and your tax outgo under it will be lower than the old tax regime. If however, you are able to claim exemptions and deductions above Rs 8 lakh at income levels above Rs 24 lakh, then the old tax regime is the right choice for you.For incomes between Rs 12 lakh to Rs 24 lakh, this threshold limit will vary depending on the deductions and exemptions you can avail.In Budget 2026, while the finance minister left core income tax structure untouched, a clutch of announcements were made to ease procedures and extend relief to different categories of taxpayers.For income tax regime, however, there were no new changes.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the new tax regime to reduce complexity and dependence on tax professionals. It offered lower slab rates but removed most deductions. At the time, income up to Rs 2.5 lakh was exempt, the top 30% rate applied only beyond Rs 15 lakh, and Section 87A ensured zero tax up to Rs 5 lakh. Even without deductions, many taxpayers paid less tax under the new system than the old one.The new regime provided lower tax rates but higher but the old regime stood strong with deductions.The Union Budget 2023 marked a major shift. The basic exemption limit under the new regime was raised to Rs 3 lakh, and the Section 87A rebate was increased to Rs 7 lakh, making income up to that level tax-free, though the old regime stayed capped at Rs 5 lakh. Standard deduction benefits were introduced, surcharge at income above Rs 5 crore was cut from 37% to 25%, and the new regime became the default option.Taxpayers received more relief after standard deduction under the new regime increased to Rs 75,000 for salaried employees, and the family pension deduction raised to Rs 25,000, benefiting around four crore taxpayers.The biggest relief arrived when income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers after standard deduction) was made effectively tax-free under the new regime. The 30% tax slab threshold was also raised sharply from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 24 lakh.From 2020 to 2026, the new tax regime has been repeatedly liberalised with higher exemptions and lower effective taxes, while the old regime remains unchanged, offering higher rates, but with deductions and exemptions intact.","The new income tax regime was introduced to give middle-class taxpayers more relief. It also aims to simplify the tax system and make filing easier. For fy 2026-2027, under the new tax regime, income up to rs 4 lakh will remain completely tax-free. The old income tax regime continues to offer a higher number of exemptions and deductions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127839191,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-33070,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
