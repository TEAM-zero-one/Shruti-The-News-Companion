The Resilience Gap: Why Household Security Matters Now

(First Revised Estimate)

India’s Impending Challenge: Ageing with Dignity

From Reform to Execution: Making Policy Work for Households

(Sumit Madan is Managing Director and CEO, Axis Max Life Insurance)

The Union Budget 2026 arrives at a defining juncture of India’s ascent, where progress must be measured not merely by the velocity of our growth, but by the resilience of the nation’s foundation. Over the past few decades, India has undergone a historic transformation, scaling from a $1 trillion economy to a global powerhouse through massive, sustained investments in physical and digital infrastructure. Yet, as the nation targets the $5 trillion milestone and beyond, we must recognize that swift economic expansion without robust household financial security is inherently fragile. As India enters this next chapter of growth, life insurance must be positioned as a national priority and a strategic pillar that transforms prosperity into permanence and shields the aspirations of a billion-plus people from the headwinds of uncertainty.For a ""Viksit Bharat"" to endure, national success must be measured by the financial resilience of Indian families. However, recent data signals a dual vulnerability where according to the Economic Survey 2024-25, India’s gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP fell from 31.2% in 2021-22 to 30.2% in 2022-23. This decline in savings is mirrored by a stagnation in financial protection, leaving households exposed.This downward shift is more than just a statistic, and signals an impending vulnerability in the nation's financial foundation. To address this, the Union Budget 2026 must serve as a critical demand-side engine to rebuild this foundation through a two-pronged fiscal strategy. First, to bolster overall household savings, a comprehensive overhaul of Sections 80C, 80CCC, and 80CCD is required, featuring higher, inflation-indexed limits.As it stands, India’s total sum assured as a percentage of GDP stands at just 24%, a stark contrast to Singapore (332%) or Malaysia (153%). Consequently, India’s protection gap remains the highest in the region at 83%, compared to just 55% in Singapore.Hence, to specifically bridge this protection gap, the government should introduce a dedicated tax deduction for pure term insurance premiums, independent of the current ₹1.5 lakh limit of Section 80C. By establishing an exclusive incentive similar to Section 80D’s treatment of health insurance, the Budget can elevate life protection from a discretionary expense to a fundamental pillar of financial planning, ensuring a secure household base for a developed India.Despite rising disposable incomes, a significant share of Indian households, especially those dependent on a single breadwinner, remains one income shock or medical emergency away from financial distress. The need for reform is made more urgent by a looming demographic shift: India is set to age faster than it grows rich. By 2050, one in five Indians will be over the age of 60, yet retirement preparedness continues to lag behind aspiration.Addressing India's impending demographic and financial challenges requires moving beyond fragmented, legacy frameworks. The Union Budget 2026 should create a dedicated tax bucket for annuities and pension products, recognizing retirement planning as a non-negotiable social necessity. Crucially, this reform must create parity with the National Pension System (NPS), ensuring that all pension-linked instruments benefit from a level playing field to encourage long-term disciplined saving.Central to this overhaul should be the inclusion of annuities under Section 10(10D) as tax-exempt instruments. Currently, Section 10(10D) explicitly excludes retirement payouts, treating annuity income as taxable at the individual’s slab rate, which creates a significant deterrent to retirement security. Granting tax-free status to these payouts will ensure protection remains meaningful in an evolving economy. By aligning the annuity tax treatment, India’s financial architecture can evolve into a credible social security platform, shifting life insurance from a discretionary purchase to an essential safety net.To deliver these targeted solutions at scale, the regulatory framework must undergo a commensurate evolution. The government’s recognition of life insurance as an essential service under the GST framework is a progressive measure that serves as a vital precursor to the sector's overarching reform. This fiscal alignment effectively anchors the Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha Bill 2025, which has already established the strategic direction for universal coverage. To translate this vision into impact, the upcoming Union Budget 2026 must now provide a concrete execution roadmap, formalizing the transition toward 100% FDI while ensuring robust governance remains paramount.Furthermore, there is significant anticipation for a clear roadmap regarding Composite Licensing. By enabling a ""one-stop-shop"" model integrating life and health insurance, the industry can lower distribution costs and simplify the consumer journey, fostering a more holistic protection ecosystem for all Indians.Today, it is time to recognize life insurance as a vital fiscal stabilizer, with the Union Budget 2026 representing an opportunity to institutionalize financial security as a national priority. Together, policymakers and the industry can ensure that by 2047, every Indian household stands protected.","For a ""viksit bharat"" to endure, national success must be measured by the financial resilience of indian families.

""We seek more funds in the 16th Finance Commission,"" he said.Notably, the 15th Finance Commission recommended specific grants for Goa, including Rs 500 crore for climate change and Rs 200 crore for tourism, totalling Rs 700 crore in state-specific funds, while also providing grants for rural bodies and projecting GST compensation.Recently. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had chaired a pre-Budget meeting with leading economists.At the meeting, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Suman Bery and other eminent economists were present. Discussions focused on key priorities and inputs for the upcoming Union Budget.Earlier, Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Nirmala Sitharaman held 10 rounds of Pre-Budget Consultations as part of the preparations for the forthcoming Union Budget 2026-27.The meetings brought together representatives and experts from key sectors of the economy, including agriculture and MSMEs, capital markets, manufacturing, services, and technology.The series began with consultations with leading economists, followed by representatives from farmer associations and agricultural economists.Subsequent sessions engaged stakeholders from MSMEs, capital markets, startups, manufacturing, BFSI (Banking, Financial Services and Insurance), information technology, tourism and hospitality, and finally trade unions and labour organisations.During these meetings, sector experts and stakeholders presented their recommendations, challenges, and expectations for the upcoming Budget. The discussions focused on economic growth, employment generation, investment climate, technological advancement, industrial competitiveness, financial sector stability, labour welfare, and sustainable development.The Union Budget is typically presented on February 1 of each year.

The meeting also saw participation from the Governor of Manipur, chief ministers of Delhi, Goa, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Meghalaya and Sikkim, and deputy chief ministers of several states, including Telangana.Opposition-ruled states said the changes to the rural employment framework weaken the employment guarantee and go against the spirit of cooperative federalism.Parliament last month passed the VB-G RAM G Bill, replacing the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Under the new scheme, the Centre will bear 60 per cent of the cost and states 40 per cent, compared with the 90:10 funding pattern under MGNREGA.Punjab Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema strongly opposed the proposed changes, saying the new framework dilutes the employment guarantee while shifting a significant financial burden to states.“Proposed MGNREGA changes weaken employment guarantee and burden states,” Cheema said at the meeting, calling for the restoration of the original demand-driven structure and funding pattern of the scheme.Telangana Finance Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said the Union government had replaced MGNREGA with VB-G RAM G without consulting states. He noted that the shift from a 90:10 to 60:40 funding ratio would further strain state finances.He also pointed out that any additional man-days beyond the normative allocation would now have to be borne by states, which would create a serious obstacle in providing demand-based work to job seekers.“This is entirely against the spirit of cooperative federalism and starving them of funds for capital outlay, which is essential for maintaining growth momentum,” Vikramarka said.The Telangana finance minister also suggested that surcharges on income tax and corporation tax be credited to a non-lapsable infrastructure fund, from which states could receive grants for infrastructure development. Alternatively, he said, surcharges should be merged with basic tax rates to expand the divisible pool of central taxes.On GST reforms, Vikramarka said GST 2.0 may boost demand but questioned its sustainability, warning that states’ revenues could fall due to rate reductions. He called for a suitable mechanism to compensate states for any revenue loss.Punjab also sought a special fiscal package, citing the “double whammy” of border tensions and floods in 2025. On GST, Cheema said Punjab is facing an annual revenue loss of nearly Rs 6,000 crore following GST 2.0 and pressed for a predictable GST stabilisation or compensation mechanism for states.",Opposition-ruled states punjab and telangana sought additional fiscal support from the centre in the union budget 2026-27.

He also flagged constraints under the Urban Infrastructure Development Fund (UIDF), arguing that the current Rs 100 crore cap on project size was limiting execution of large urban projects, and proposed that the ceiling be raised to Rs 500 crore.Saini thanked the Centre for continuing the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment scheme and sought higher untied allocations for Haryana, along with relaxations in utilisation conditions, citing the state’s special requirements due to its location in the National Capital Region (NCR).He said the upcoming Budget would further pave the way for Haryana’s progress and reaffirmed the state’s commitment to contributing towards making India a developed nation by 2047.Highlighting Haryana’s agrarian profile, Saini said the state ranks second in the country in foodgrain production and is known as the breadbasket of India. He said around six lakh acres of land are affected by salinity and waterlogging, and sought central financial assistance to prevent further damage.He also underlined the need for modernising agriculture through digital agriculture, micro-irrigation, agri-logistics and value addition, adding that agri-processing clusters and MSMEs could become engines of rural prosperity.On the social sector, Saini said Haryana plans to open a medical college in every district, for which substantial support under centrally sponsored schemes would be required. He also sought higher assistance for social security pensions, noting that over 44 lakh people in the state receive such benefits.The chief minister said Haryana’s NCR region is being developed as a logistics hub, requiring higher central capital investment to improve connectivity and time-bound movement of goods. Stressing the importance of entrepreneurship, he said Haryana ranks fourth nationally in startups and is setting up a Rs 2,000 crore Fund of Funds to support them.He added that the state is developing 10 new Industrial Model Townships (IMTs) to boost MSMEs and attract investment, for which additional central assistance is needed.Saini also emphasised the importance of human capital, calling for greater focus on education, health and skills, particularly in emerging areas such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, green technology and biotechnology.","Haryana chief minister nayab singh saini urged the centre to step up allocations for the state’s rural and urban infrastructure, agriculture and allied sectors in the union budget for fy27.

Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the central excise act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from rs 2,050 to rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

The Income-tax Act, 2025, which is slated to come into force from 1 April 2026, is the product of an extensive consultative exercise, involving a Parliamentary Committee, wide-ranging stakeholder representations, and detailed deliberations before its eventual enactment. Against this backdrop, it would ordinarily be expected that the forthcoming Budget would refrain from proposing substantive changes to direct tax law, particularly to a statute that is yet to be operationalised. Any premature tinkering with the framework risks diluting the objective of introducing a clean-slate, simplified legislation. It is the concerns around tax administration and implementation that need to be addressed, emphasisesAccording to him, policy expectations can broadly be classified into four baskets.One of the most pressing areas requiring attention is simplification of compliance, particularly in the area of tax deduction at source (TDS). The current regime prescribes multiple rates across numerous sections, creating significant interpretational challenges.Litigation frequently arises around the applicable rate, classification of payments, and procedural lapses—often without any underlying revenue loss. There is a strong case for rationalising TDS rates into two or three broad buckets.For example: One rate for salary income, one uniform rate for most non-salary payments and a separate, higher rate for exceptional categories such as lottery winnings or similar windfall incomes. Such rationalisation would dramatically reduce compliance complexity.“Large taxpayers today maintain sizeable teams merely to manage withholding tax compliance and litigation risk. Simplifying TDS rates would lower compliance costs, reduce disputes, and free up productive resources, without materially impacting revenue collection,” he emphasises.India has articulated a clear ambition to position itself as a global hub for high-technology manufacturing, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and advanced electronics. These sectors are capital-intensive and R&D-heavy, requiring sustained investment in research and innovation.At present, however, India offers no meaningful tax incentive for research and development expenditure. This stands in contrast to many competing jurisdictions that actively use tax policy to attract cutting-edge innovation.“The Budget presents an opportunity to re-examine whether targeted R&D incentives—designed carefully to avoid misuse—can be reintroduced or recalibrated, particularly for sunrise sectors critical to India’s long-term competitiveness. This assumes added significance in light of the evolving global mobility landscape. A number of highly skilled Indian professionals, particularly in science and technology, may consider returning to India due to constraints around work visas such as the H-1B in the United States. Creating a robust domestic ecosystem for research and innovation, supported by sensible tax incentives, could help India productively absorb this talent,” states Kanabar.Kanabar points out that prolonged litigation has an adverse fall out for both taxpayers and the government. The Revenue is deprived of its dues, beyond the standard 20% pre-deposit, for several years.Taxpayers carry prolonged contingent liabilities, affecting cash flows, balance sheets, and business decisions—even in cases where additions may ultimately not survive. India’s experience with tax dispute resolution schemes has been largely positive. Schemes introduced in the past, including those rolled out in 2020 and revisited in 2024, witnessed significant participation and resulted in meaningful revenue mobilisation and dispute reduction. “There is a strong case for re-imagining a comprehensive dispute resolution framework, both for direct taxes and for indirect taxes, particularly customs, where litigation has accumulated over decades. A well-designed scheme can unclog the appellate system, provide certainty to taxpayers, and deliver immediate fiscal benefits to the exchequer,” he states.Tax administration and respect for taxpayer sentiment: Lastly Kanabar points out that the Budget must reinforce the principle that tax administration should be facilitative, not adversarial. Concerns around indiscriminate issuance of notices, mechanical reopening of assessments, and lack of accountability continue to affect taxpayer confidence. While faceless processes have reduced some friction, they have also introduced new challenges relating to responsiveness, proportionality, and application of mind. What is required is not another layer of legislation, but administrative sensitivity. An approach that recognises that taxpayers are partners in nation-building and that certainty, fairness, and predictability are integral to ease of doing business, he sums up.","The income-tax act, 2025, is slated to come into force from 1 april 2026.

• Incentivise manufacturing and employment:

The Income-tax Act, 2025, marks a comprehensive overhaul of India’s six-decade-old direct tax law, replacing the Income-tax Act, 1961, with a simplified, principle-based framework. Aimed at reducing litigation and improving tax certainty, the new law seeks to streamline provisions, remove redundancies, and align tax administration with a digital-first compliance environment, while retaining the core structure of India’s income tax system. The forthcoming Budget 2026 must aid its transition.Sameer Gupta, National Tax Leader, EY India, said, “The direct tax framework is expected to undergo critical changes aimed at enhancing certainty and compliance. Detailed guidelines and FAQs should be provided to minimize confusion during the transition from the old I-T Act to the new one. This is crucial to avoid litigation and ensure a smooth transition for taxpayers.”EY-India also outlined certain direct tax reforms, which if introduced, could unlock private capital, enhance competitiveness, and support inclusive economic growth.Establishing a stable tax environment by minimizing frequent changes in tax rates is essential.A predictable tax policy builds trust and improves compliance, which is vital for enhancing revenue collection.With 37 different types of payments to residents where TDS rates vary from 0.1% to 30%, TDS provisions become a fertile ground for disputes relating to categorisation and interpretation. In many instances, industry faces cash flow blockages awaiting refunds, and the government incurs avoidable interest costs on such refunds. Budget 2026 should lay down a roadmap for rationalisation of TDS rate structure with no more than three-four rates. B2B payments subject to GST may be exempted from TDS as information relating to such transactions is already captured in Form 26AS/AIS.To boost investment and stimulate growth in the manufacturing sector, the government should consider reintroducing accelerated depreciation as a targeted fiscal incentive. This should be made available as part of existing concessional corporate tax regime of 22% or 15% (plus surcharge and cess) itself, so that this higher depreciation does not trigger Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) for companies. In the wake of global economic uncertainties and India's ambition to become a manufacturing hub under initiatives like ‘Make in India’, reinstating this benefit could provide much-needed support to domestic manufacturers. It would not only enhance competitiveness and productivity but also attract both domestic and foreign investment, generating employment and driving long-term economic growth.While an employer organisation can claim a 30% deduction of ‘additional’ employee cost for three consecutive assessment years if new employees are hired – there is a salary cap prescribed. A new employee is treated as an additional employee only if the salary of such employee does not exceed Rs. 25,000. “To incentivise business entities to generate new employment opportunities, the monthly employee cost limit should be increased to Rs one lakh. Many new hires fall outside this incentive because salaries are higher today – especially in the upcoming niche sectors like AI and robotics – this threshold needs a relook,” states Gupta.On the indirect tax front, the current customs tariff framework should be simplified to reduce compliance burden on importers. This includes sector-wise customs duty rationalization and aligning tariff rates with global standards ensuring Indian goods remain competitive in international markets. Further, the validity of advance rulings (for customs) should be extended from three to five years to enhance tax certainty and mitigate disputes.Gupta is of the view that providing tax certainty to foreign investors is critical. “Since existence of a permanent establishment of the foreign entity in India and profit attribution define India’s taxing rights, the absence of specific rules has led to recurring litigation; clear codification would enhance certainty.” He adds that an optional presumptive regime could be considered for foreign entities in certain sectors such as turnkey projects, technical services, digital and e-commerce, general services like consultancy, management and software.","The income-tax act, 2025, marks a comprehensive overhaul of india’s six-decade-old direct tax law.

A section 54F style Income Tax provision for physical asset monetisation

Why this reform matters now?

Far-reaching impact across economy

A Budget reform that could signal a maturing economy

(Navneet Munot is MD & CEO of HDFC Asset Management Company)

India is a country of enormous diversity, with languages, customs and beliefs varying widely across regions. Yet one financial habit cuts across income levels and geography. Most households have grown up buying physical gold or silver every year on Akshaya Tritiya, Dhanteras or on other auspicious days. This was not driven by price charts or return calculations but because Gold was trusted as a store of value that could be passed down across generations. For many families, Land served a similar purpose as a tangible, secure asset. In the absence of a wide range of formal investment avenues, this instinct served Indian households well and helped India build a reputation as a ‘Nation of Savers’. The downside however was that a large share of this wealth remained idle.That is now beginning to change owing to sustained efforts of policymakers and industry to build confidence in India’s capital markets. As of FY25, Indian households had ~7% of their total assets in Equities vs only ~3% in FY15. Since January 2021, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) have infused over $250 billion into equity markets, providing stability even as Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) pulled out approximately ~$20 billion during the same period.Retail participation through mutual fund SIPs has been critical, with monthly SIPs rising to ~Rs 29k Cr in November 2025 from ~Rs 8k Cr in November 2019. Even so, financialization of savings has barely begun, with households still holding approx. two third of wealth in physical assets.Today, with numerous avenues available to invest savings more productively and with the economy in need of enormous financial capital to meet its growth objectives, the next phase of reforms must focus on monetising these assets in a productive way. The Union Budget could consider introducing a new provision in the Income Tax Act, modelled on Section 54F. If introduced, it should provide an exemption from long-term capital gains tax when proceeds from the sale of physical gold, silver or Land are reinvested into Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS), with a lock-in of 5 years. Section 54F currently allows tax-free reinvestment of gains from any asset into a residential house. Extending a similar principle to financial assets would encourage households to rebalance a part of their portfolios in a tax-efficient manner.Indian households are among the largest holders of precious metals in the world, with an estimated holding of ~25,000 tonnes of gold accumulated over generations. The recent surge in gold and silver prices has significantly increased the financial worth of families across India. At the same time, for a large number of households, this wealth remains largely notional.Secondly, most working Indians remain outside formal pension systems, even as life expectancy rises and healthcare costs increase. As ELSS’ provide transparency, professional management and potential inflation-beating returns in the long term, this reform could go a long-way in creating a credible retirement security.For households, the benefits could be tangible if the reform is introduced. Families that have seen the value of inherited gold or under-utilised land rise over time could monetise a portion and reinvest it into ELSS without immediate taxation. Over 10–20 years, such investments can materially strengthen retirement security or fund other financial goals.For the financial system, even a modest shift of household portfolios from physical to financial assets could translate into substantial, stable inflows. The 5-year lock-in would create a pool of patient domestic capital. Such flows help deepen market liquidity and crucially, cushion the market and the economy during bouts of FPI selling. A stronger domestic investor base is the best insurance against external volatility.From the Government’s perspective, the revenue risks appear limited. Many of these Gold and Land holdings are not being sold today and are being passed on through generations. When these get monetised, the Government can generate revenues from securities transaction tax, Stamp duty and GST on transactions/associated services that would not have occurred otherwise. Without requiring budgetary allocation, it uses the tax benefit to gently change behaviour, encouraging savers to become long-term investors. This should also aid Government’s efforts for formalisation of the economy.Every festive season, India’s cultural affinity for gold expresses itself in strong demand. This festive season, robust festival-driven purchases contributed to higher gold imports ($9.6Bn in Oct’25, $14.7Bn in Nov’25 vs Average of $3.3Bn for other months of CY25) adding to the current account deficit at a time when trade landscape is challenging. At the macro level, recycling household gold can gradually reduce dependence on incremental imports and ease current account pressure. More importantly, it would free up much needed financial capital needed to finance India’s growth ambitions.Union Budgets are often considered a statement of Government’s intent. A section 54F-style exemption for reinvestment of proceeds from physical assets into financial products like MFs would signal confidence in India’s capital markets to the rest of the world. With emphasis on investor protection and investor education, such a measure can advance financial inclusion, macroeconomic resilience and the realisation of Viksit Bharat in the decade ahead.","Navneet munot: a section 54f style income tax provision for physical asset monetisation could have a far-reaching impact across the economy.

Budget 2026: The Narendra Modi government is looking to revamp the customs duty slabs and tariff structure in the Union Budget 2026. FM Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the Budget on February 1, 2026. The government is weighing a plan to streamline the customs duty framework by cutting the number of tariff slabs to five or six from the existing eight.The proposed overhaul is aimed at simplifying the duty structure, lowering disputes and aligning import tariffs more closely with India’s industrial strategy and trade objectives. The review is likely to prioritise the settlement of classification-related disputes, address inverted duty anomalies and reduce the scope of discretionary exemptions. These changes are also intended to support the government’s broader effort to modernise customs operations.As part of a wider overhaul, the government is also looking to revisit and recalibrate the duty structure governing transactions between special economic zones and domestic tariff areas, the sources said, adding that this forms a key element of the ongoing SEZ reform process.The initiative is being pursued in the context of recently finalized trade agreements, ongoing negotiations with key partners and the push towards a paperless and frictionless customs system.Over the past two years, the Centre has steadily worked to rationalise customs duties by pruning slabs and withdrawing exemptions.“The last budget customs duty structure saw a major rationalisation. There is room for further rationalisation of customs slabs to five-six,” a senior official told ET. The official added that groundwork for the changes has been underway for the past three to four months and a formal announcement is likely in this year’s budget.The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs is working towards aligning the customs duty framework with the restructured goods and services tax system to create a more integrated and consistent tax regime, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials quoted by the financial daily said efforts are underway to address operational bottlenecks highlighted by industry participants.Those involved in the discussions noted that curbing disputes over tariff classification, a leading cause of prolonged litigation, remains a central objective of the exercise. The scale of the issue is reflected in data from a parliamentary standing committee on finance, which showed that as of December 2024, as many as 75,592 customs-related cases were pending, with recoverable dues totalling Rs 24,016.20 crore.Industry bodies have argued for the introduction of an amnesty mechanism in cases where disputes arise without any intent to evade duties, as a way to ease the litigation burden. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had indicated last month that rationalising and simplifying customs duties would be the next major focus area in the government’s reform agenda.","The proposed overhaul is aimed at simplifying the duty structure, lowering disputes and aligning import tariffs more closely with india’s industrial strategy and trade objectives.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
