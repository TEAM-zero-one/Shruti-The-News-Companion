Budget 2026 for taxpayers: Five fixes that can make taxes less taxing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-for-taxpayers-five-fixes-that-can-make-taxes-less-taxing-explained/articleshow/126666769.cms,"The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe.

One return, one choice

Cut the sting in foreign remittance TCS

NPS withdrawals: clarity needed on taxability

Level the NPS field under the new regime

Time for

joint tax returns

Every Union Budget comes with its share of grand announcements, but for ordinary taxpayers, the real test lies in the fine print. As Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are modest yet meaningful: simplify compliance, nudge long-term savings, and stop treating convenience as a luxury. Here are five changes that could make the tax system smarter, softer and more sensible.The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe. Form 10-IE, required to opt in or out of the new regime, is a classic case of procedural overkill. Many taxpayers either forget to file it or file it incorrectly, losing out on the more beneficial regime. The fix is simple: embed the option directly into the ITR. A single return, a clear choice, no extra forms. Ease of doing business should also mean ease of filing taxes, especially for salaried individuals who neither game the system nor enjoy paperwork.A 20% TCS on foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme was introduced to plug tax leakages. The intent is understandable, but the dosage is excessive.For genuine remittances for family support the high TCS blocks liquidity and creates avoidable stress. A more balanced approach would be to reduce TCS to 10%, or introduce a slab system: lower rates up to, say, ₹50 lakh, and higher rates thereafter. Compliance should be encouraged, not coerced.Recent changes to NPS withdrawal rules are a welcome step. Subscribers can now withdraw up to 100% of the corpus if it is within ₹8 lakh, and 80% if it exceeds that limit. This adds flexibility and makes NPS more attractive.But there’s a catch—or rather, a question mark. Till now, only 60% of the corpus was tax-free on maturity. How will the additional 20% be taxed? The Budget should clarify this and remove the ambiguity. Ideally, the extra withdrawal should also be tax-free, reinforcing NPS as a credible retirement pillar rather than a tax puzzle.Under the new tax regime, deductions are scarce, making Section 80CCD(2), the employer contribution to NPS, a rare oasis. However, the additional ₹50,000 deduction under Section 80CCD(1b) is still unavailable in the new regime. Extending this deduction, and enhancing it to ₹1 lakh under the new regime, would send a strong signal. Global evidence is clear: tax incentives drive long-term savings. A stronger NPS today means lower old-age dependency and reduced fiscal pressure tomorrow.India’s tax system still treats married couples as financial strangers. Introducing joint tax returns, with a higher exemption threshold for married couples, would recognise modern household economics—especially double-income families. Such a move would put more disposable income in the hands of families, improve tax equity and align India with global best practices. After all, if households plan together, why shouldn’t they file together?In sum, Budget 2026 doesn’t need fireworks. It needs fine-tuning. Fewer forms, fairer taxes, clearer rules, and smarter incentives could go a long way in making taxation less intimidating—and more humane.","The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers.

The Union Budget is just round the corner, and it is that time of the year when Indian taxpayers look at the hon’ble Finance Minister with a lot of anticipation and expectation. While their wishlist will always be long, some of the key items at this juncture are:There are currently 7 ITR forms, which are applicable to different categories of taxpayers. Multiple forms often confuse taxpayers. They create complexity and increase chances of errors. The taxpayers have to figure out the correct ITR form applicable for them for any particular year, basis their sources of income and other parameters applicable for that year. As the sources of income may differ on a year-on-year basis, ITR form may also vary.The government had in the past considered the option of one uniform ITR form for all taxpayers, to make tax filing simpler and user friendly. It is desirable that the same be re-evaluated, more-so, when after the introduction of the New Income-tax Act (New Act) the ITR forms in any case need revision. This single ITR form could have the option to select the entity type of taxpayer and income sources, post that only relevant pre-filled schedules may be visible to the taxpayer. This will further streamline the return filing experience for taxpayers.The New Act would become applicable from 1 April 2026. There are numerous circulars and notifications which have been issued in the past six decades in the context of the Income-tax Act, 1961(old Act).It may be worthwhile to issue a master circular listing all the circulars which are applicable as on 1 April 2026, giving reference of the new sections in the New Act, after removing Circulars relating to the sections which have been deleted in the New Act.This Master Circular may be updated and re-issued on a yearly basis. This would help taxpayers in referring to the correct circulars. It will also be in line with the government’s intent to make income- tax law simple and user friendly.TDS compliances take a lot of time and there is an urgent need to revamp the TDS framework; and it may be possible to do that in a neutral revenue manner. Studies may be conducted to identify TDS sections where collections are high, others with insignificant contributions could either be deleted or merged. Any shortfall would be factored in the consequential advance tax figures. Also, it is desirable that only 2-3 rates are prescribed, so that it becomes easier for taxpayers to comply.Further, the requirement to issue TDS certificates should be removed. This information is already available in form 26AS and Annual Information Statement (AIS). TDS Ledger mechanism may be considered to avoid litigation on matching income with TDS. These measures put together, will go a long way in reducing compliance burden on taxpayers and mitigating litigation on interpretation issues.Tax as a tool to tackle air pollution in Indian cities – Many Indian cities continue to regularly appear in the world's most polluted cities list. In the recent past many countries have also issued travel advisories for India highlighting the pollution concerns. Considering the magnitude of the problem, a multi pronged approach is required to address this challenge. Using direct tax law as an enabler by giving a special tax incentive for purchase of Electric Vehicles (EVs) may be considered in the new individual tax regime.While the policy of the government has been to move to lower taxes with lesser deductions and exemptions, an exception may be carved out for this incentive due to health emergency the country faces on account of air pollution. Taxpayers could also be encouraged to earmark some proportion of CSR spend for supporting research in pollution control measures and supporting government approved pollution control schemes/drives in the cities in which they operate. This spend should be specifically permitted to be treated as tax deductible expenditure. While these measures on a stand-alone basis may not resolve the issue, they could help support the overall efforts needed at the government level to tackle the situation.To conclude, while some of these expectations are in sync with the government’s stated intent of simplifying and streamlining the taxation regime in India, others depict a wishlist based on the need being felt by masses in India to tackle the health hazard being felt by all of us. Taxpayers hope that the government considers them favourably in the upcoming budget.","The union budget is just round the corner, and it is that time of the year when indian taxpayers look at the hon’ble finance minister with a lot of anticipation and expectation.

"Budget: Budget proposes 30% TDS on net winnings in online games, removes threshold for TDS levy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-proposes-30-tds-on-net-winnings-in-online-games-removes-threshold-for-tds-levy/articleshow/97527935.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Developing world-class aviation infrastructure and enhancing regional connectivity

Enabling a competitive and self-reliant aviation ecosystem

Green, global and digital aviation growth

India’s aviation sector is approaching a critical inflection point. In FY25, Indian airports collectively offered handling capacity of about 500-515 million passengers per annum (MPPA), against the actual traffic of 414 million passengers. By FY26, this capacity is expected to increase further to nearly 550 MPPA with additional capacity from new airports such as Jewar, Navi Mumbai and Bhogapuram, while air traffic is expected to reach 460 million passengers. Looking ahead, in FY30 the adequate capacity of about 775 - 825 MPPA would be required to cater to the anticipated traffic of 630-650 million passengers, highlighting the need for timely, well-directed investments and policy support to stay ahead of demand and prevent future capacity bottlenecks.If aligned with the government’s Viksit Bharat @2047 vision, the upcoming Union Budget’s focus on the aviation sector could be a defining moment for shaping a future-ready, inclusive, and sustainable aviation ecosystem.The focus of this year’s budget allocation for the aviation sector should be on developing world-class aviation infrastructure through a renewed push for public-private partnerships (PPP), and expanding the current portfolio of PPP airports from 14 to additional 25 airports in the next three to four years aligned with the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) initiative.This must be complemented by continued modernisation of existing airports and development of new metropolitan and regional hubs. With cargo volumes projected to nearly triple to about 10 million metric tonnes (MMT) by 2030, another priority area is the strengthening of air cargo infrastructure. This will require sustained investment in airport upgrades, including dedicated cargo handling zones and express cargo facilities at major hubs as well as upcoming airports such as Navi Mumbai, Jewar and Bhogapuram, so that logistics capacity can keep pace with passenger infrastructure. Additionally, aligning air freight expansion with the PM Gati Shakti initiative will be essential to enhance rail-road-air connectivity, optimise shared assets across multimodal hubs, and enable seamless door-to-door delivery of goods nationwide.Developing inclusive and balanced regional connectivity remains another important areas for the development of the aviation sector. For this, strengthening the Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) scheme, with focused interventions for hilly terrains, remote areas and the Northeast will be essential to ensure affordable, reliable air connectivity and balanced regional development.To enhance competitiveness within the aviation sector, the Budget should prioritise rationalisation of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) taxation through a calibrated roadmap to progressively bring ATF under the Goods and Services Tax framework, while incentivising states to moderate Value Added Tax (VAT) on ATF.Building an ‘Atmanirbhar’ aviation ecosystem will require reinforcing GIFT City as a global hub for aircraft leasing and financing, and scaling up domestic maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) and aerospace manufacturing capabilities. This can reduce outflow of foreign exchange, deepen the domestic value chain and create high-skilled jobs.The Budget could help position India as a global aviation leader by supporting modernisation of bilateral air service agreements and developing select airports as globally competitive transit hubs, backed by efficient airside infrastructure and superior passenger services.Sustainability should also be a key focus area for the sector by prioritising initiatives which promote sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), develop carbon-neutral airports, and encourage the adoption of energy-efficient and environmentally responsible technologies.Finally, the development of a digital and passenger-centric aviation ecosystem will be key for driving the next phase of growth, efficiency, and competitiveness of India’s aviation sector. Expansion of DigiYatra, deployment of AI-enabled air traffic management systems, and the transition to end-to-end paperless processes can significantly enhance efficiency, safety, and passenger experience.By aligning infrastructure expansion, fiscal reforms, sustainability, self-reliance and digitisation, the Union Budget can catalyse India’s aviation sector as a powerful enabler of inclusive economic growth, global connectivity, and the Viksit Bharat ambition.","Budget’s focus on the aviation sector could be a defining moment for shaping a future-ready, inclusive, and sustainable aviation ecosystem.

Budget 2026: Simpler tax laws may lift FDI flows; experts flag capital cost relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-simpler-tax-laws-may-lift-fdi-flows-experts-flag-capital-cost-relief/articleshow/126687325.cms,"The Union Budget should prioritise simpler and more predictable tax laws, alongside tax neutrality for cross-border and corporate reorganisations, to strengthen India’s appeal as a long-term destination for foreign direct investment (FDI), tax and economic experts said, reported PTI.They argued that rationalising the tax framework and lowering the cost of capital would complement ongoing reforms and help attract sustained foreign capital inflows, even as global investment conditions remain uncertain.Rudra Kumar Pandey, Partner at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, said the forthcoming Budget offers an opportunity to recalibrate the tax system in a way that supports growth while removing long-standing structural hurdles to investment and corporate restructuring.“The forthcoming budget presents an opportune moment for policymakers to recalibrate the tax framework in a manner that fosters growth, rewards compliance, and enhances the purchasing power of the citizenry—whilst simultaneously addressing long-standing structural impediments to corporate reorganisations and investment flows,” Pandey said, PTI quoted.He added that a structurally lower cost of capital—backed by credible fiscal consolidation, deregulation and tax clarity—would deepen private investment and make India more attractive for stable FDI and portfolio inflows than incremental liberalisation alone.Pandey also flagged a gap between corporate law reforms and tax treatment. While the Companies Act now allows a wider range of fast-track mergers and overseas holding company reorganisations from September 2025, similar tax neutrality has not been extended to fast-track demergers.“Extending tax-neutral treatment to fast-track demergers would ensure that the procedural efficiencies achieved under corporate law are not nullified by adverse tax outcomes,” he said.On sectoral opportunities, Pandey noted growing foreign investor interest in India’s defence ecosystem, driven by higher procurement outlays, export momentum and co-development opportunities under Atmanirbhar Bharat. Rather than raising FDI caps, he suggested removing specific regulatory bottlenecks. He also said foreign investors remain keen on India’s fast-growing e-commerce sector, given the scale of the digital consumer base and its role in supporting exports and MSMEs.Rumki Majumdar, Economist at Deloitte India, said India’s efforts to diversify trade markets could aid foreign investment, but stronger execution is needed.To improve FDI inflows, she said India must enhance the utilisation of free trade agreements, which would require further progress on ease of doing business, better logistics and competitiveness, and a continued focus on skilled talent availability.“To move up the value chain, India will need investment in advanced manufacturing, such as semiconductors, pharma, heavy machinery, clean energy, battery storage, and grid modernisation,” Majumdar said, identifying these as key sectors where foreign investment will be crucial to meet rising demand.","The union budget should prioritise simpler and more predictable tax laws, tax and economic experts said.

An evolving path

NEW DELHI: The Budget is not just an economic document or an annual statement of accounts of the central government - it’s the road map that sets the tone and direction of economic reforms and growth. It also signals policy direction to citizens, businesses and investors, shaping confidence and long-term economic outcomes. Over the last few decades, several Union Budgets in India have stood out for being reformist, transformational and path breaking.From Manmohan Singh ’s landmark 1991-92 Budget that opened up the Indian economy and Chidambaram’s ‘Dream Budget’ to Jaswant Singh’s 2003–04 Budget and Nirmala Sitharaman’s new income tax regime measures, we take a look at some Union Budgets that stood out in the last few decades:On February 28, 1983, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee stood before Parliament and announced what he called ""the somewhat unconventional step"" of allocating Rs 300 crore to states based not on population or political negotiation, but on measured performance in implementing specific programmes.""Another Rs 125 crore would be distributed among the States on the basis of their performance in implementing programmes in identified areas of high priority.""Mukherjee told Parliament.The budget documents specified the mechanism: states would receive funding only after demonstrating capacity to achieve targets above those implied in their approved plans. This was outcome-based federalism a decade before the phrase entered policy discourse.Beyond allocation mechanisms, the 1983-84 budget introduced what Mukherjee termed a ""minimum tax"" on corporate profits. His solution was structural. ""I therefore propose to provide that fiscal incentives and concessions shall not absorb more than 70 per cent of the profits. This would secure that companies pay a minimum tax, on at least 30 per cent of their profits."" he said.The 1983-84 budget received limited attention at the time. India was emerging from drought, international attention was focused elsewhere, and the changes appeared technical. But the principles embedded in that budget—performance-based allocation, minimum taxation regardless of incentives, mandatory investment norms for tax-exempt entities—would recur in subsequent reforms.Two years later, V.P. Singh presented a budget that addressed what he termed the ""counter-productive"" nature of India's personal income taxation. In his February 16, 1985 speech, Singh outlined a comprehensive approach to tax reform.The changes were substantial. Singh raised ""the exemption limit for personal income taxation from Rs 15,000 to Rs 18,000"" which, he noted, would result in ""around 10 lakh"" assessees being removed from the tax net entirely. He restructured the rate schedule, reducing the number of slabs ""from eight to four.""""The maximum marginal rate of income-tax on personal incomes will stand reduced from 61.875 per cent to 50 per cent,"" Singh announced.On corporate taxation, Singh adopted the minimum tax principle from Mukherjee's earlier budget, noting: ""There are companies which are flourishing, but are paying no tax at all."" But he went further on depreciation policy. Recognizing that ""the internal funds available with the corporate sector are inadequate"" for modernization, he announced: ""I propose to increase the general rate of depreciation in respect of plant and machinery from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. ""For energy efficiency, the approach was more aggressive: ""I propose to go farther and allow 100 per cent depreciation on devices and systems for energy saving.""The budget also began dismantling the industrial licensing system. ""It is proposed to notify a list of industries for delicensing so that procedural delays are cut to a minimum,"" Singh stated.When Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi presented the 1987-88 budget on February 28, 1987, his focus was not merely fiscal but institutional. For education, the commitment was substantial. ""To give a good start to the new Policy, I have allocated as much as Rs 800 crore for education as compared with Rs 352 crore in 1986-87,"" he said. This represented more than a doubling of education expenditure in a single year.This decision led to the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, which received statutory powers through legislation in 1992. Prior to SEBI, the Controller of Capital Issues regulated securities markets through the Capital Issues (Control) Act of 1947—a wartime measure designed for a controlled economy, not a liberalising one.Gandhi also announced expansion of the mutual fund industry beyond the monopoly of Unit Trust of India. ""The State Bank of India will set up a Mutual Fund"" to provide investors with additional options, he said. This was the first step toward creating a competitive mutual fund industry.The Union Budget presented on July 24, 1991 marked a decisive break in India’s economic policy, which was later commonly called LPG or Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation. The strategy was framed explicitly as a response to the balance of payment crisis. Addressing Parliament, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh argued that “over centralisation and excessive bureaucratisation of economic processes have proved to be counter productive,” leaving the economy less productive, less competitive, and acutely vulnerable to shock.The scale of the crisis was laid out in blunt terms. “The fiscal deficit of the Central Government… is estimated at more than 8 per cent of GDP in 1990–91,” Singh said, while “external debt… is estimated at 23 per cent of GDP.” Foreign exchange reserves had fallen to “Rs 2500 crores,” sufficient to finance “imports for a mere fortnight.” India, he warned, stood “at the edge of a precipice.”The policy response was structural rather than incremental. Industrial licensing was dismantled across most sectors as the government moved to “bring about a significant measure of deregulation in the domestic sector.” Trade policy shifted “from a regime of quantitative restrictions to a price based mechanism,” reinforced by exchange-rate adjustment and export promotion, while monopoly controls were relaxed to intensify domestic competition.Privatisation and globalisation as they were later referred to followed as complementary pillars of reform. Fundamentally it was about disinvestment and restructuring. Public enterprises were to be refashioned into “an engine of growth rather than an absorber of national savings,” through equity dilution, greater managerial autonomy and clearer accountability.To cushion the social impact of restructuring, Singh announced “a National Renewal Fund, with a substantial corpus,” ensuring that “the cost of technical change and modernisation… does not devolve on the workers.”Foreign investment, long viewed with suspicion, was recast as essential to recovery and competitiveness. India would “welcome, rather than fear, foreign investment,” permitting up to 51 per cent foreign equity in priority industries. The reforms, Singh concluded, were no longer a matter of choice: “no power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come”.P. Chidambaram's 1996-97 budget, presented on July 22, 1996, addressed a fundamental structural problem: India's financial system was unable to provide long-term finance for infrastructure projects.""Infrastructure needs long-term finance, typically 15-20 year financial instrument"" Chidambaram stated.The IDFC was designed as ""a direct lender, as a refinancing institution and as a provider of financial guarantees"" to infrastructure projects. This created institutional capacity for long-term infrastructure financing that had not previously existed in India's financial architecture.The budget also strengthened highway development. ""I have decided to provide a sum of Rs 200 crore to strengthen the capital base of the National Highway Authority of India.""On disinvestment, Chidambaram announced the establishment of a Disinvestment Commission. ""Any decision to disinvest will be taken and implemented in a transparent manner. Revenues generated from such disinvestment will be utilised for allocations for education and health and for creating a fund to strengthen public sector enterprises.""P. Chidambaram’s 1997–98 Union Budget, presented on February 28, 1997, came to be known as the “dream budget” for its sweeping tax reforms and its explicit recognition of the information technology revolution. Chidambaram framed his proposals around the logic of the Laffer Curve, arguing that an optimal tax rate exists at which revenue is maximised, and that pushing rates beyond this point reduces collections by discouraging work and investment.On personal income tax, he made a clear break with past practice. “If we look at comparative income-tax slabs in other developing Asian countries, it will be evident that tax rates in India are still high and constitute an important reason for tax evasion,” he said.""I have, therefore, decided to lower the rates of personal income-tax across-the-board in a significant manner. The current rates of 15, 30 and 40 per cent are being replaced by the new rates of 10, 20 and 30 per cent."" Chidambaram announced.On capital markets, Chidambaram introduced five structural reforms to the Companies Act. ""Over 20 million Indians have invested their savings in the capital market. The establishment of the first Depository was an important step taken to bring the Indian capital market upto world standards and to protect the interests of the investors,"" he said.The reforms included introducing the principle of buy-back of shares by companies subject to certain conditions; merging provisions of Sections 370 and 372 of the Companies Act with an overall ceiling of 60 per cent for inter-corporate investment and loans; providing for nomination facilities for holders of securities; requiring companies raising funds from the capital market to give an annual statement disclosing the end-use of such funds; and giving one-time permission to stockbrokers to corporatise their business without attracting tax on capital gains.The budget also announced comprehensive legislative reform. ""I had set up an expert group to draft a new Companies Bill and another expert committee to prepare a new Direct Taxes Bill."" Chidambaram said.Perhaps most significantly for India's future trajectory, Chidambaram explicitly recognized information technology as a transformative force. ""Information Technology has radically altered conventional wisdom on growth strategies. I propose several measures to encourage this industry and to reduce costs,"" he stated.When Yashwant Sinha presented the 1999-2000 budget on February 27, 1999, he signaled a fundamental shift in how the state would manage public sector enterprises. For the first time after Independence, with the enthusiastic support of all political parties in Parliament, it had been possible to discard the long standing tradition of presenting the budget at 5 PM—a break with colonial practice that symbolized the broader reforms to come.""Government's strategy towards public sector enterprises will continue to encompass a judicious mix of strengthening strategic units, privatising non-strategic ones through gradual disinvestment or strategic sale and devising viable rehabilitation strategies for weak units,"" FM Yashwant Sinha said.The disinvestment programme drew primarily upon the recommendations of the Disinvestment Commission, which had submitted eight reports containing recommendations for 43 public sector enterprises. ""In 1999-2000, I propose to raise Rs.10,000 crore through the disinvestment programme. This will help the Government to fund the requirements of social and infrastructure sectors"" he announced.The budget also addressed a fundamental governance challenge. ""The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act has become obsolete in certain areas in the light of international economic developments relating to competition laws.""This recommendation led to the Competition Act of 2002 and the establishment of the Competition Commission of India.On expenditure management, Sinha announced two institutional innovations. ""We will constitute an Expenditure Reforms Commission headed by an eminent and experienced person,"" he stated. He also proposed to initiate a system of zero base budgeting in preparation for the next budget.When Jaswant Singh presented the 2003-04 budget on February 28, 2003, India had recovered from the 1991 crisis but fiscal discipline remained elusive. FM Jaswant Singh's diagnosis was clear: ""Interest payments in 2002-03 are estimated at Rs 1,15,663 crore, equivalent to 48.8 per cent of the Government's revenue receipts.""The solution was to bind future governments through legislation. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, passed in August 2003, set legally enforceable targets to reduce fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, end automatic monetization of the deficit by the Reserve Bank of India, and cap annual government guarantees at 0.5 per cent of GDP.The Act also mandated transparency. Every budget would now include a Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement, a Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, and a Macroeconomic Framework Statement. The government would have to publicly explain deviations from targets.""The Government has nurtured macroeconomic stability—held inflation low, and maintained a strong balance of payments position while promoting growth,"" Singh stated.The one-page tax return was introduced. ""I propose to introduce a one-page only return form for individual tax payers, having income from salary, house property and interest, etc. This has already been devised, and will come into operation from April 1 onwards."" he said.Tax clearance certificates were abolished. ""Henceforth, only expatriates who come to India in connection with business, profession or employment, would have to furnish a guarantee from their employer, etc. in respect of the tax payable before they leave India. An Indian citizen, before leaving India, will only have to give his/her permanent account number.""On search and seizure operations, new protections applied. ""Stocks found during the course of a search and seizure operation will not be seized under any circumstances. Second, no confession shall be obtained during such search and seizure operations. Third, no survey operation will be authorized by an officer below the rank of Joint Commissioner of Income Tax.""On July 8, 2004, P. Chidambaram returned as Finance Minister and introduced a budgetary innovation that would be replicated across multiple sectors: earmarked taxation.""I propose to levy an education cess of 2% on the aggregate of all Central government taxes,"" Chidambaram stated.The cess was not additional spending—education allocations continued from the general budget. Rather, it created visible linkage between taxation and social investment. Citizens paying income tax, corporations paying corporate tax, importers paying customs duty—all would see 2 per cent of their tax bill designated specifically for education.The innovation was transparency. Unlike general taxation where revenues disappeared into the Consolidated Fund, earmarked cesses made the social contract visible: you pay this specific amount, it funds that specific purpose.The budgets presented by Pranab Mukherjee between 2009 and 2012 coincided with the rollout of digital identity infrastructure that would transform benefit delivery.In his 2009-10 budget, presented in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Mukherjee stated: ""The challenge before us is to revive the economy without compromising medium-term fiscal sustainability.""Budget documents during this period referenced the Unique Identification Authority of India, established in January 2009 through executive order. The UIDAI was mandated to issue unique identification numbers—Aadhaar—to all residents.Subsequent Mukherjee budgets referred to pilot programs for Aadhaar-based beneficiary identification and direct benefit transfers. Though not fully implemented during his tenure, the budgetary provisions and pilot programs laid groundwork for the JAM trinity that would later enable direct benefit transfers at scale.Arun Jaitley's February 1, 2017 budget came months before the July 1, 2017 rollout of the Goods and Services Tax—India's most complex tax reform since independence.""The GST Council has held nine meetings and taken decisions on the basis of consensus,"" Jaitley stated.The GST replaced 17 central and state indirect taxes with a unified framework. But the institutional innovation was the GST Council itself—a constitutional body comprising the Union Finance Minister, Union Minister of State for Revenue, and Finance Ministers of all states.The Council operated on consensus. Each state had one vote; the Centre had one-third of total votes. Decisions required three-fourths majority. This forced negotiation, compromise, and federal cooperation on tax rates, exemptions, thresholds, and compliance procedures.For the first time in Indian fiscal history, tax policy for a major revenue source was made not by the Union government alone, not by Parliament alone, but by a federal body requiring agreement between Centre and states.The Union Budget for 2020-21 was presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2020. In her speech, Sitharaman referred to the National Infrastructure Pipeline, which identified infrastructure projects across sectors over a multi-year horizon.A Project Preparation Facility was announced to support the appraisal and design of infrastructure projects. The budget documents referred to the involvement of technical and professional expertise in project preparation. The formulation of a National Logistics Policy was also referred to, with the objective of clarifying roles across ministries and reducing duplication.“In continuation of the reform measures already taken so far, the tax proposals in this budget will introduce further reforms to stimulate growth, simplify tax structure, bring ease of compliance, and reduce litigations” she said.The budget increased capital expenditure and outlined plans for asset monetisation through a structured pipeline. The National Monetisation Pipeline was referred to in the budget documents as a mechanism for leasing public assets.But the 2020-21 budget's most consequential institutional reform was in personal income taxation. Sitharaman announced a fundamental restructuring of the tax regime itself.The Union Budget for 2025-26 was presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The budget referred to Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0, which proposed the decriminalisation of specified provisions across multiple laws. The objective, as stated in the budget documents, was to reduce compliance burden and improve ease of doing business.Under the new tax regime, the Finance Minister said no income tax will be payable on incomes up to Rs 12 lakh, excluding income taxed at special rates, with the limit rising to Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers after the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.A high-level committee was announced to review non-financial sector regulations, licences, and permissions. The budget proposed the introduction of a new Income Tax Bill. ""The new bill will be clear and direct in text so as to make it simple to understand for taxpayers and tax administration,"" Sitharaman stated.Thresholds for tax deduction at source and tax collection at source were revised. The budget also announced revisions to thresholds for certain categories of taxpayers, including senior citizens and small enterprises.Four decades separate Mukherjee's performance-based grants from Sitharaman's compliance rationalisation. Yet the trajectory is consistent: budgets have served as instruments of institutional adaptation, responding to the evolving challenges of the Indian state.India's budgetary reforms have not followed a predetermined blueprint. They have emerged from negotiation between continuity and change—preserving the state's redistributive role while dismantling mechanisms that stifled growth.What remains unresolved is whether these frameworks can keep pace with emerging challenges. Digital taxation, climate financing, and the fiscal implications of changing demography require a budget as an anchor of reform and evolution. The budget, once again, may need to serve as more than an accounting exercise.","The budget is not just an economic document or an annual statement of accounts of the central government. It’s the road map that sets the tone and direction of economic reforms and growth. It also signals policy direction to citizens, businesses and investors, shaping confidence and long-term economic outcomes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126620895,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-663350,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
"Budget 2026: Education experts urge government to improve quality, boost infra; call to shift focus on skills",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-education-experts-urge-government-to-improve-quality-boost-infra-call-to-shift-focus-on-skills/articleshow/126674791.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, education experts have urged the government to shift focus from expanding enrolment to improving quality, infrastructure and future-ready skills.The experts added that it is crucial to harness India’s young population and fast-growing higher education sector.India has the world’s second-largest education system, with nearly 40 per cent of its population below the age of 25. In the previous Union Budget, the education sector received an allocation of Rs 1.28 lakh crore, a 6.22 per cent increase over the year before, with Rs 50,077.95 crore earmarked for higher education.Data from the Economic Survey 2024-25 show steady expansion in the sector. The number of higher education institutions rose by 13.8 per cent over the past eight years, while the Gross Enrolment Ratio increased from 23.7 per cent to 28.4 per cent during the same period, as reported by PTI.Dr PR Sodani, president of the Indian Institute of Health Management Research (IIHMR) University, said that the higher public investment in education and healthcare is critical for building strong human capital.He said spending should prioritise skill development, digital transformation and strengthening institutional capacity. According to Sodani, Budget 2026 could be a turning point if it focuses on upgrading infrastructure, promoting digital and multilingual education, and preparing students for a knowledge-driven economy.Pankaj Priya, deputy director and dean (academics) at BIMTECH, said that while access to higher education has expanded, physical infrastructure has not kept pace with rising enrolments.He pointed to gaps in laboratories, hostels and student facilities, adding that the upcoming Budget should place greater emphasis on capacity-building, research and employability.“The next phase of reform must pivot towards quality, deep research capacity and strong employability outcomes, not just expanding access,” Priya said.He also stressed the need to align academic curricula with emerging technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and machine learning, in line with the goals of the National Education Policy 2020.","India has the world’s second-largest education system, with nearly 40 per cent of its population below the age of 25.

Budget 2026 outlook: ICRA flags focus on debt consolidation; capital expenditure push to continue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-outlook-icra-flags-focus-on-debt-consolidation-capital-expenditure-push-to-continue/articleshow/126641391.cms,"Representative image

The government is expected to prioritise medium-term debt consolidation while continuing a strong push for capital expenditure in the Union Budget for 2026-27, according to pre-Budget expectations outlined by rating agency ICRA.ICRA said the upcoming Budget assumes added significance as it will be the first to align with the recommendations of the 16th Finance Commission, which will decide fiscal transfers between the Centre and the states for the next five years.The agency expects the Centre’s fiscal deficit to be capped at around 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2026-27, slightly lower than the 4.4 per cent budgeted for 2025-26, supported by an estimated 9.8 per cent growth in nominal GDP.On this trajectory, the Centre’s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to ease from 56.1 per cent in 2025-26 to about 55.1 per cent in 2026-27, in line with the medium-term consolidation path.However, in absolute terms, the fiscal deficit is expected to rise to Rs 16.9 trillion in 2026-27 from Rs 15.7 trillion in 2025-26, mainly due to higher capital expenditure.ICRA said the government is likely to front-load infrastructure spending before fiscal rigidities increase from 2027-28 onwards, when the implementation of the 8th Central Pay Commission is expected to raise salary and pension liabilities.“We believe that the GoI will push up capital expenditure by ~14% (to Rs 13.1 trillion), before fiscal rigidities in the form of higher committed expenditure set in from FY2028,” the agency said.Capital expenditure is projected to rise to Rs 13.1 trillion, or 3.3 per cent of GDP, from an estimated Rs 11.5 trillion in 2025-26, supporting investment activity and improving the quality of government spending.On the revenue side, gross tax revenues are expected to grow by around 7 per cent in 2026-27, led by an 11 per cent rise in direct taxes, while indirect tax growth may remain muted at about 2 per cent following GST rate cuts from September 2025.After devolution to states, net tax revenues are projected to increase by 5.2 per cent to Rs 28.5 trillion.Revenue expenditure growth is expected to stay contained at around 4 per cent, helping the revenue deficit narrow to Rs 4.7 trillion, or 1.2 per cent of GDP, the lowest in nearly two decades.At the same time, gross market borrowings are projected to rise by 15–16 per cent to Rs 16.9 trillion in 2026-27 due to higher capital spending and increased debt redemptions.The Union Budget for 2026-27 is scheduled to be presented in Parliament on February 1, 2026.",Icra said the upcoming budget assumes added significance as it will be the first to align with the recommendations of the 16th finance commission. The agency expects the centre’s fiscal deficit to be capped at around 4.3 per cent of gdp in 2026-27.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126641430,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-33380,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
Budget 2026: India's crypto sector calls for clarity and tax relief; seeks 1% TDS rationalisation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-indias-crypto-sector-calls-for-clarity-and-tax-relief-seeks-1-tds-rationalisation/articleshow/126610560.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

As the Union Budget approaches, India’s cryptocurrency sector is seeking clear rules for digital assets. It is also seeking for a rationalisation of the 1% TDS on crypto transactions to boost investor confidence and encourage onshore participation.In the Union Budget 2025, the finance minister left the existing tax framework for VDAs unchanged, despite repeated appeals from the industry, which has argued that the current rules discourage investors and traders. India formally recognised cryptocurrencies as Virtual Digital Assets in Budget 2022, introducing a defined tax regime.Under the Income Tax Act, Sections 115BBH and 194S govern the taxation of VDAs such as cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital tokens. Gains from VDAs are taxed at a flat 30 per cent, along with a 1 per cent TDS on transactions, while non-trading income is taxed as per an individual’s income slab, according to ET.Industry leaders said that the upcoming budget is a key moment for course correction. Raj Karkara, Chief Operating Officer at ZebPay, said Budget 2026 comes at a pivotal time for India’s crypto ecosystem.“The Union Budget 2026 comes at a pivotal moment for India’s crypto ecosystem, with the industry hopeful for long-awaited regulatory clarity that can bring greater direction and confidence to the investors and a clear and consistent framework for digital assets would help strengthen trust among investors, institutions, and market participants, while enabling business to operate responsibly within well-defined boundaries,” he said.Karkara added that from a taxation standpoint, rationalising the current 1 per cent TDS could improve liquidity and encourage stronger onshore participation. He also called for a review of the flat 30 per cent tax on VDA gains, aligned with other asset classes and allowing loss set-offs, to create a more balanced investment environment.“Greater policy clarity could unlock innovation, help India’s Web3 ecosystem scale responsibly, and strengthen the country’s role in the global crypto economy,” he said.Nischal Shetty, founder of WazirX, said the budget offers an opportunity to refine the existing framework.“This budget is a clear opportunity to fine-tune a framework which supports transparency and compliance while fostering innovation,” he said. He added that the lower transaction-level TDS and allowing loss set-offs could revive onshore liquidity and improve compliance.Shetty highlighted that clear rules on reporting would boost investor confidence and support a sustainable digital asset ecosystem aligned with India’s $5 trillion economy goal.Pankaj Balani, CEO and co-founder of Delta Exchange, said India’s strong global crypto adoption should be matched with a clear ‘Make in India’ approach.“India’s leadership in global crypto adoption reflects strong grassroots participation from both retail users and sophisticated market participants, the upcoming Union Budget is an opportunity to match that momentum with a clear ‘Make in India’ approach to the digital assets industry,” he said.Balani stressed the need to support compliant domestic platforms that follow Indian KYC and anti-money laundering norms, capital controls and data protection rules, while acting decisively against unauthorised entities. He said policy should clearly differentiate between compliant Indian platforms and non-compliant offshore operators.Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX, said the sector is looking for measured relief, especially as it has been four years since the current tax framework was introduced.“The virtual digital asset sector is naturally looking for measured relief, especially since it has been four years since the current taxation framework was introduced and the decisions taken now can meaningfully accelerate innovation and help India emerge as a global Web3 and VDA leader,” he said.Gupta highlighted the need for clear rules and uniform implementation of TDS across all crypto exchanges, saying this would improve compliance and enhance consumer protection by curbing non-compliant operators.SB Seker, Head of APAC at Binance, said India’s rapid adoption of blockchain and VDAs reflects the scale of its digital economy and growing retail participation.“The forthcoming budget presents an opportunity to strengthen the VDA ecosystem through measured regulatory and tax refinements that protect users, maintain financial stability, and support responsible market development,” he said.","India formally recognised cryptocurrencies as virtual digital assets in budget 2022, introducing a defined tax regime.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
