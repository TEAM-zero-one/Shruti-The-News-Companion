Budget 2026: Will tax provisions ease for crypto assets?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-will-tax-provisions-ease-for-crypto-assets/articleshow/126525033.cms,"Losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.

Key concerns flagged:

Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities.

Use of offshore exchanges, private wallets, and decentralised platforms complicates enforcement and obscures transaction trails, hindering accurate tax assessment and recovery.

Jurisdictional limitations add to the challenge, as many transactions occur outside India’s regulatory reach, making compliance and enforcement “virtually impossible.”

Suggestions for

Budget 2026

:

Allowing set-off of losses between different VDAs, even if not against other income

Providing statutory guidance on the situs of VDAs, especially for non-residents

Reviewing the impact of 1% TDS on market liquidity

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has raised fresh concerns about the risks posed by virtual digital assets (VDAs) such as cryptocurrencies, aligning its stance with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The tax department’s warning presented recently to a Parliamentary Standing Committee of Finance underscores regulatory agencies' growing scepticism about cryptocurrencies fit within India’s financial and taxation framework. It highlights revenue risks, enforcement gaps and potential misuse for evasion or illicit finance.The tax regime in India, for VDAs can be considered as one of the most stringent in the world.The Finance Act, 2022, ushered in a bespoke tax regime for VDAs by inserting section 115-BBH into the Income-tax Act, 1961 (I-T Act). Income from the transfer of VDAs is taxed at a flat 30%, plus surcharge and cess, regardless of the holding period. The law allows only the cost of acquisition as a deduction, barring transaction fees, exchange charges or other expenses.More critically, losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.Losses also cannot be carried forward. A parallel provision mandates 1% tax deduction at source (TDS) on transfers beyond specified thresholds, further tightening liquidity. To illustrate: For a salaried individual, a 1% TDS is applicable on transfer of the VDAs if the transaction amount exceeds ­10,000.Various associations have in their pre budget submissions, argued that disallowing set-off of losses between VDAs is economically distortive and ultimately counterproductive for tax revenues.The argument is simple: when losses are ring-fenced, but gains are fully taxed, risk-taking is penalised asymmetrically. This has reportedly contributed to trading volumes migrating offshore, exchanges shifting operations overseas and Indian investors being pushed into cross-border structures that raise FEMA and compliance complexities.The result is a tax structure that treats crypto trading far more harshly than equities, real estate or even speculative assets, despite its growing mainstream adoption.While section 115-BBH of the I-T Act, applies equally to residents and non-residents, tax provisions are not clear on a crucial issue: where is a VDA located? For non-residents, taxability hinges on whether income accrues or arises in India (the provisions of sections 5 and 9 of the I-T Act and the relevant tax treaty provisions come into play).Unlike shares or immovable property, VDAs lack a clearly identifiable physical or legal location. In the absence of legislative clarity on the situs of crypto assets, non-resident taxation risks becoming a fertile ground for disputes particularly where trading occurs on global exchanges, assets are held in offshore wallets and sale proceeds are received outside India.Experts point out that clarity is essential to avoid avoidable litigation. Jurisdictions such as the UK offer guidance by linking the situs of crypto assets to the residential status of the beneficial owner, an approach India could adapt.Individuals dealing in cryptocurrencies are required to disclose income from virtual digital assets in Schedule VDA of their annual income tax returns — typically ITR-2 or ITR-3, depending on their income profile. The schedule seeks granular information, including the date of acquisition and transfer, cost of acquisition and sale consideration. Accurate reporting is crucial, as any under-reporting or misreporting of VDA income can attract penalties, apart from interest on unpaid tax.Possible reforms being discussed in policy circles include:Ashish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch said, ""India’s VDA ecosystem is at a pivotal stage, with growing adoption across the country. However, the current tax framework presents challenges for retail participants by taxing transactions without recognising losses, creating friction rather than fairness. A reduction in TDS on VDA transactions from 1% to 0.01% could improve liquidity, ease compliance, and enhance transparency while preserving transaction traceability. Raising the TDS threshold to ₹5 lakh would help protect small investors from disproportionate impact.""""Introduced in 2022 as a stand-in for regulation at that time, VDA taxation has since been complemented by strong oversight from FIU-IND and improved compliance. This Budget presents a great opportunity to revisit the framework in a manner beneficial to both investors and the government. We remain hopeful that the government will recognize this gap and consider reviewing the current framework soon,"" he concluded.","Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities.

Budget 2026: The urgent need to tackle long-pending and long drawn-out tax litigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-the-urgent-need-to-tackle-long-pending-and-long-drawn-out-tax-litigation/articleshow/126556471.cms,"As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals). (AI image)

Here are top five issues that

Budget 2026

should tackle:

1. Reduce pendency before CIT(A) and allow refund of taxes collected during pendency of appeal

2. Rationalise provisions to facilitate obtaining full stay of demand during pendency of appeals

3. Reducing administrative inconvenience and hardship

4. Avoiding repetitive appeals by the Revenue

5. Strengthening the advance ruling mechanism

As the Union Budget 2026 draws closer, industry bodies and tax professionals are urging the government to shift part of its reform focus from tax rate rationalisation to the far more structural problem of long-pending direct tax litigation. On the ground, businesses argue that predictability, timeliness and administrative efficiency in dispute resolution matter as much as headline tax rates—particularly for capital-intensive sectors such as manufacturing.The scale of the problem is substantial. As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals), involving disputed demands of about ₹18.16 lakh crore. Protracted disputes result in working capital being locked up for years, management attention diverted from productive activity, and depressed valuations when Indian promoters seek foreign investment.Industry body FICCI has flagged the mounting backlog at the CIT(A) level as a critical bottleneck in the dispute resolution framework.The first appellate authority, meant to serve as an effective corrective forum, has instead become a point of prolonged delay.FICCI points out that pendency increased sharply after the faceless appeal regime was rolled out in 2021. While faceless appeals were introduced to eliminate physical interface and improve transparency, the absence of effective monitoring and the unfamiliarity of both officers and taxpayers with the technology have led to repeated notices, duplication of submissions and delayed disposals. Even where taxpayers have filed detailed responses on the portal, they are often asked to resubmit information without clarity on what additional inputs are required. Virtual hearings, when sought, are not granted liberally, and even when conducted, limitations in document presentation weaken effective representation.A key procedural gap, according to FICCI, is the absence of any time limit for assessing officers to submit remand reports called for by the CIT(A), coupled with ambiguity over whether jurisdictional officers or faceless units are responsible for such reports. Meanwhile, parallel penalty proceedings are routinely initiated while quantum appeals remain pending, resulting in both quantum and penalty matters piling up at the first appellate stage.The industry body warns that the litigation lifecycle—already 12 to 15 years before Covid—has now lengthened by another five years. This not only delays revenue collection for the government but also forces companies to carry disputed tax demands as contingent liabilities, adversely impacting share valuations during fund-raising or stake sales.To address this, FICCI has recommended prioritised disposal of appeals involving high-pitched assessments, scrutiny cases, matters where detailed submissions have already been filed, issues covered by High Court or Supreme Court rulings, and appeals pending for over five years. It has also called for filling nearly 40% vacancies at the CIT(A) level and introducing a dual-track system, with fast-track disposal for simple, low-value cases and a detailed track for complex, high-value disputes, backed by differentiated timelines and targets.Tax professional Sandeep Bhalla, Partner at Dhruva Advisors, notes that appeals pending before the CIT(A) for more than two years cause serious hardship, particularly where disputed demands continue to remain outstanding. He argues that in such cases, taxpayers should not be compelled to wait indefinitely and should be allowed to approach the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) directly.Bhalla suggests a structured mechanism under which the assessee could approach the Range Head (Additional or Joint Commissioner), who would prepare a concise factual and legal factsheet. This, along with the appeal records, could then be placed directly before the Tribunal for adjudication. Such a process, he believes, would help decongest the CIT(A) level while ensuring quicker resolution of long-pending disputes.At the same time, Bhalla emphasises that institutional accountability must be built into the system so that appeals remaining undisposed beyond two years without taxpayer fault are treated as a measurable performance failure rather than an administrative inevitability.FICCI has also called for a rethink of the current framework governing stay of disputed tax demands. Although CBDT instructions provide that a stay may be granted on payment of 20% of the disputed demand, taxpayers are often required to make this payment even when the issue has been decided in their favour in earlier years.Compounding the problem, refunds for subsequent years are routinely adjusted by the Central Processing Centre (CPC) against demands that are formally stayed, because stay orders are not digitally integrated with CPC systems. According to FICCI, this defeats the very purpose of a stay and intensifies liquidity stress for businesses.To resolve this, the industry body has suggested creating a real-time interface enabling assessing officers to upload stay orders so that stayed demands are automatically excluded from refund adjustments. It has also proposed allowing alternative forms of security—such as bank guarantees or indemnities—in appropriate cases instead of insisting on a cash pre-deposit, noting that international tax administrations adopt similar risk-based approaches without compromising revenue protection.Bhalla highlights that even after taxpayers succeed in appeals, delays in passing Orders Giving Effect (OGEs) often render appellate relief meaningless. Refunds remain on paper for months, or even years, resulting in continued cash-flow strain.He recommends that OGEs be system-driven and mandatorily passed within three months, with interest payable for departmental delays made personally recoverable from the concerned assessing officer. Mandatory uploading of scrutiny and compliance reports on the tax portal, he argues, would enhance transparency and accountability.Bhalla also points to the largely mechanical nature of rectifications under section 154 against CPC adjustments under section 143(1). He suggests that taxpayers should be allowed to file detailed reconciliations, that CPC orders rejecting rectification must give clear reasons, and that a virtual hearing should be provided wherever adjustments are proposed to be confirmed.Despite settled judicial precedents, the Revenue continues to litigate recurring issues, adding to the backlog. Bhalla recommends that the CBDT issue authoritative position papers on key settled matters, particularly those affecting specific industries, and hold field officers accountable for filing appeals contrary to binding rulings.Bhalla also flags concerns around the functioning of the Board for Advance Rulings, which replaced the Authority for Advance Rulings in 2021. More than four years on, the mechanism has failed to deliver the certainty it was meant to provide, especially for cross-border and high-value transactions, underscoring the need for corrective measures in Budget 2026.As India positions itself as a preferred investment destination, the credibility of its tax dispute resolution system will be closely watched by both domestic and global investors. Meaningful reforms that reduce pendency, ensure timely refunds and curb avoidable litigation could significantly improve confidence on the ground. Budget 2026, therefore, has a chance to signal that tax certainty and administrative efficiency are central to the government’s growth strategy.","As of april 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the commissioner of income-tax (appeals) industry bodies and tax professionals are urging the government to shift part of its reform focus from tax rate rationalisation to the far more structural problem of long-pending tax litigation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126556606,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148077,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Budget 2026 expectations: Why India must put prevention at the centre of healthcare reform,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-why-india-must-put-prevention-at-the-centre-of-healthcare-reform/articleshow/126544628.cms,"Medical inflation is the most pressing concern at the moment.

PM Modi Says 2025 Marked by India’s Commitment to Reforms

Medical Inflation: The primary challenge

Prevention is the need of the hour

(Srikanth Kandikonda is Chief Financial Officer of ManipalCigna Health Insurance)

As India prepares for the Union Budget 2026-27, stakeholders across sectors are sharpening their focus on measures that can strengthen economic resilience and citizen welfare in the coming year. In the healthcare and insurance space, expectations are anchored in a sustained commitment to making quality healthcare accessible and affordable for all. With rising medical inflation and evolving health risks, the budget presents a timely opportunity to bolster public health infrastructure and support insurance solutions that protect millions of Indian families.We recognize and applaud the proactive policy measures the government has already taken to support the health insurance sector and make coverage more affordable. A major development has been the passing of the Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha (Amendment of Insurance Laws) Bill, 2025, which allows 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in the insurance sector. This year, the government has also taken steps to reduce the cost burden on policyholders by removing 18% GST earlier levied on insurance premiums. This initiative makes health and life insurance products more affordable for customers, especially for underserved communities.Medical inflation is the most pressing concern at the moment. As per industry reports, it is projected around 11.5-14% for 2025-2026, significantly outpacing general inflation, and among Asia's highest. Customers unfortunately bear the brunt of it. With hospital bills, cutting-edge treatments, specialized medicines, and a heavier load of illnesses are all driving up out-of-pocket expenses, leaving too many without the care they need.Given this backdrop, we request the government to take steps in the Union Budget to increase public healthcare spending. Currently, public health expenditure in India remains below global benchmarks and even short of the National Health Policy target of 2.5% of GDP in 2025. Enhancing the budgetary outlay for public health would strengthen primary care networks, expand preventive services, and relieve financial stress on citizens. It would also support the expansion of community health infrastructure in underserved areas which are critical in bridging healthcare inequities.While increased public spending is imperative, complementary policy measures can significantly accelerate the transition toward preventive healthcare, a proven strategy for reducing overall healthcare expenditure. Evidence from India and globally demonstrates that prevention fundamentally alters the economics of healthcare. For instance, primary prevention programs in cardiovascular disease management alone saved 3.6 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) annually at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $469 per DALY averted when compared with the status quo of no coverage.The impact on hospitalization is equally significant. Individuals with Outpatient Department (OPD) coverage, demonstrate 5-10% reduction in hospitalizations compared to those without such coverage. In practical terms, this means preventing the need for expensive hospital visits and prolonged inpatient stays.To harness this prevention dividend and encourage wider adoption of OPD coverage, we recommend the government introduce separate and enhanced tax benefits specifically for OPD services and preventive health screenings in the Union Budget 2026-27. Currently, preventive health check-ups receive a modest tax deduction of ₹5,000 annually under Section 80D. This is a limit that does not reflect the true value of prevention in reducing long-term healthcare costs.According to a recent report by KPMG, by 2050, India is projected to account for 16% of the global population aged 60 and older. As per United Nations Population Fund, India’s elderly population is predicted to double by 2050 and overtake the number of children in the country. As people live longer, the risk of chronic illnesses also increases. This makes preventive healthcare even more critical. Regular health check-ups, early detection and timely care can help seniors stay healthier for longer and avoid serious medical complications later. Policy measures that support preventive healthcare are, therefore, the need of the hour.Looking forward, the Union Budget 2026-27 provides a strategic moment to reinforce a health-led growth framework that aligns with India’s long-term vision of ‘Insurance for All by 2047’. The combination of increased public investment, and pro-insurance reforms, and focus on preventive approach, can accelerate progress towards universal health protection and financial security for all Indians.As the budget announcement approaches, we look forward to constructive reforms that foster greater affordability, inclusivity, and resilience in India’s healthcare and insurance landscape.","Medical inflation is the most pressing concern at the moment.

He also called for raising the affordable housing price cap from Rs 45 lakh to around Rs 80–90 lakh and expanding unit size norms. “Mid-income housing will be the key demand driver going into 2026, and supportive tax and policy measures are essential to sustain growth,” he said.Eden Realty MD Arya Sumant said the Budget must strike a balance between fiscal discipline and growth-oriented reforms. “Higher home loan interest deductions for mid-income and first-time buyers, an updated affordable housing definition, GST rationalisation and faster approvals will improve project viability and speed-to-market,” he said, adding that sustained urban infrastructure investment would unlock demand across residential and commercial segments.Sahil Saharia, CEO of Bengal Shristi Infrastructure Development Ltd, said policy focus should shift towards large, integrated developments. “Support for mixed-use townships, rental housing and commercial hubs, along with faster clearances and digital single-window mechanisms, can help create self-sustained urban ecosystems and improve execution efficiency,” he said.Developers said clear and stable policy signals in the Budget could help restore homebuyer confidence, attract long-term capital and ensure sustainable growth for the real estate sector in eastern India.",Real estate developers in kolkata have urged the centre to use the union budget to recalibrate housing policies to reflect rising land and construction costs.

Budget 2026 income tax expectations

:

New Income Tax Regime: What Tax Relief Was Announced Last Time?

But, after last year’s tax slab tweaks, is there still a case to make the new tax regime more attractive so that more taxpayers switch over? What are the top things that can be done?

Will New Income Tax Regime Be Made More Lucrative?

New Tax Regime: What More Can Be Done?

Firstly, the standard deduction limit may be increased from Rs 75,000 to Rs 90,000/-

Secondly, the employer’s contribution to the NPS is allowed as a deduction under the new income tax regime. For the non-salaried individuals, while this deduction is not applicable, they do not even get any deduction for their own contribution. This is a hardship and the government may consider introducing deduction in respect of an individual's contribution to NPS under section 80CCD(1B), currently capped at Rs 50,000. This will benefit salaried as well as non-salaried individuals.

Will FM Nirmala Sitharaman provide more reason to cheer for salaried and middle class taxpayers two years in a row? 2025 was a year of tax reforms - massive overhaul of the new income tax regime, introduction of the New Income Tax Act, and finally sweeping GST rate cuts and slabs rationalization. But what will Budget 2026 bring on the income tax front?The government has increasingly been nudging taxpayers to opt for the new income tax regime. For one - it was made the default regime two years ago, which means you have to explicitly opt for the old tax regime and in case you fail to file your income tax return within the due date, you are automatically switched to the new regime.Like every year, there is always an expectation of the common man from the government to rejig the tax slabs and provide more net disposable income in their hands. Going by the past trends any changes that are likely to be introduced would be limited to the new income tax regime.FM Nirmala Sitharaman had in her Budget speech last year announced: There will be no income tax payable up to income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The income tax slabs and rates under the new income tax regime were also revised to hike the basic tax exemption limit from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh.As FM Sitharaman said: A taxpayer in the new regime with an income of Rs 12 lakh will get a benefit of Rs 80,000 in tax (which is 100% of tax payable as per existing rates).A person having income of Rs 18 lakh will get a benefit of Rs 70,000 in tax (30% of tax payable as per existing rates).A person with an income of Rs 25 lakh gets a benefit of Rs 1,10,000 (25% of his tax payable as per existing rates).One important point to note is that after the changes made in Budget 2025, such as higher tax rebates and revised tax slabs, the new income tax Regime has become much more attractive for most taxpayers. Hence the adoption of the new regime is expected to be much higher when income tax returns for the ongoing financial year are filed later this year.Tax experts surveyed by Times of India Online are mostly of the view that no major changes to the income tax regime are likely in this year’s Budget.As Preeti Sharma, Partner – Tax and Regulatory Services, BDO India, if a taxpayer cannot claim sufficient deductions, the new income tax regime usually results in a lower tax burden.“Since the Government has already made major improvements to the new income tax regime in Budget 2025, big changes to tax slabs are unlikely in this year's Budget,” she opines.The growing preference for the new income tax regime is already visible. Out of 7.28 crore income tax returns filed for AY 2024–25, around 72% were filed under the new income tax Regime, while only 28% chose the old tax regime. “This shows that most taxpayers now find the new tax regime simpler and more tax efficient,” Preeti Sharma said.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India also doesn’t expect any changes in the new income tax regime to be announced in this year’s budget. “The new tax regime has already been liberalised with lower slabs and higher rebates. In Parliament, the Minister of State for Finance clarified that the Personal Income-tax regime (without deductions) has been recently simplified with liberal slabs and increased rebates by Finance Act, 2025. The minister said that there is no further proposal under consideration in this regard’,” she told TOI.“Thus, the immediate focus is likely to be on stability and a smooth transition rather than introducing additional reforms. Any further refinements, if considered, are expected to follow a phased approach, aligning with the broader objective of tax certainty and compliance simplification,” she added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India believes that given the significant overhaul in slab rates last year, it may be highly optimistic to expect a significant change to income slabs or tax rates this year as well.“More realistically, the focus may possibly be on incremental measures from ease of interpretation and rationalizing of compliances,” she tells TOI.Tanu Gupta, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP feels that every tax relief is always welcome! In the past, the government has often provided further relief only to those who opted for the new tax regime while leaving the old regime unchanged, and this is likely the path it may continue to follow, she says.“Considering the significant tax relief provided last year, as well as the relief extended through changes in GST rates during the year, the government may leave personal tax rates unchanged this time. Additionally, there is pressure on government tax collections, and it needs more resources to support exports and businesses in navigating an uncertain global economic environment,” she tells TOI.In recent years, the government has introduced several changes to the new income tax regime to make it more attractive for taxpayers. However, experts point out that despite the tax slabs being revised and rationalised, a section of taxpayers continues to opt for the old tax regime due to the availability of many deductions.While not expecting any major changes, Preeti Sharma of BDO India said that the government may come with the minor changes under the new income tax regime to make it even more attractive, especially for middle-class taxpayers.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners says that to make the new income tax regime more attractive, the government may take steps to revisit the limit of deductions allowed in the new regime or consider introducing a new one. He lists the following moves:Akhil Chandna, Partner and Global People Solutions Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat also advocates for a hike in standard deduction limit. “To encourage broader adoption of the new regime, it is expected that the government may further increase the standard deduction limit. Additionally, certain reasonable deductions - such as those for health insurance and home loan interest - may also be allowed under the new regime,” he tells TOI.Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte India sees scope for some limited measures for additional relief to taxpayers.Despite the significant relief for resident taxpayers earning up to Rs 12 lakh (who now pay zero tax), taxpayers in the 12 lakhs to Rs 30 lakhs bracket, particularly those with home loans and insurance often continue to find the old regime more beneficial. To bridge this gap and accelerate a full transition to the new regime, the government could consider a few targeted measures, she says.Currently, the new regime does not allow any deduction for interest on self-occupied house property. “Introducing even a capped deduction (for example, up to Rs 2 lakhs) would significantly improve its appeal for millions of homeowners. Similarly, while employer contributions to NPS can be reduced from taxable income, employee contributions cannot, and allowing the same would bring parity and encourage retirement savings,” she tells TOI.“Further, with health insurance premiums rising year after year, many taxpayers incur substantial costs without any tax benefit under the new regime; a limited deduction for medical insurance could therefore enhance its attractiveness. While the government’s focus remains on simplification and large-scale deductions may be unlikely, selective relief in these areas could make the new regime far more compelling for a wider segment of taxpayers,” she adds.","The government has increasingly been nudging taxpayers to opt for the new income tax regime. The standard deduction limit may be increased from rs 75,000 to rs 90,000. Fm nirmala sitharaman had in her budget speech last year announced: there will be no income tax payable up to income of rs 12 lakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126527231,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-92248,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Budget 2026: Govt may raise capex spending 10–15%; private investment remains uneven,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-govt-may-raise-capex-spending-1015-private-investment-remains-uneven/articleshow/126527037.cms,"The government is likely to retain its strong focus on public capital expenditure in the upcoming Union Budget 2026, with the capex outlay expected to rise by 10–15 per cent from the current level of Rs 11.21 lakh crore, even as private sector investment continues to remain cautious, experts said, as reported PTI.The Budget, which is scheduled to be tabled in Parliament on February 1, has adequate fiscal headroom to step up public capital spending, and the government should use this opportunity to sustain growth momentum, economists noted.“I believe that the capital expenditure absorption capacity in the economy is not very high. If you want to increase it by 30 per cent overnight, it is not going to happen because you need the capacity of the construction companies, you need the capacity of the heavy earth-moving machinery, you need so many machines,” PwC Partner and Economic Advisory Services leader Ranen Banerjee told PTI.“So, it cannot increase 30 per cent overnight. Therefore, we believe that about a 10 per cent increase on the capex is what we can expect, and about Rs 12 trillion of allocation is what we are expecting,” he said.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed a capital expenditure outlay of Rs 11.21 lakh crore for FY26, after the government is expected to fall short of its target in the current year. Against the Budget estimate of Rs 11.11 lakh crore for FY25, capex spending is estimated at Rs 10.18 lakh crore in the Revised Estimates.According to ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar, the challenge with private capex is not a broad-based slowdown but uneven investment across sectors.Traditional sectors such as cement and steel are seeing expansion, largely driven by higher public investment that has created demand for private players. At the same time, greenfield sectors like data centres, electric vehicles and renewable energy are witnessing strong investment momentum, she said.However, export-oriented sectors and industries facing stiff import competition continue to face a more difficult environment, limiting private investment appetite, Nayar added.On the government’s own spending outlook, Nayar said FY27 could see a stronger capex push, as fiscal flexibility may narrow in subsequent years.“I think FY27 could be a year where we hope that capex will be prioritised by the government simply because FY28 is when the pay revision will come in and it will be much more difficult at that point to really set aside a lot for additional capex,” she said.Asked about the likely pace of growth, Nayar said public capital expenditure is expected to expand faster than the projected nominal GDP growth of 9.5–10 per cent for FY27.“I would at least hope to see a 12–15 per cent capex growth if at all the fiscal space is there within the Budget,” she added.","The budget, which is scheduled to be tabled in parliament on february 1, has adequate fiscal headroom to step up public capital spending.

Budget 2026 expectations: India’s cryptocurrency tax framework deserves a timely recalibration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-indias-cryptocurrency-tax-framework-deserves-a-timely-recalibration/articleshow/126519469.cms,"The upcoming Union Budget offers a moment to consider how crypto taxation can better align incentives with outcomes.

By Nischal Shetty

Crypto taxation in India was introduced at a moment when digital assets were gaining rapid adoption, but regulatory clarity was still evolving globally. In the Union Budget of 2022, the government implemented a flat 30 percent tax on income from virtual digital assets, along with a 1 percent tax deducted at source (TDS) on each transaction. The intent was to create a trail for transactions, and bring an emerging asset class within a defined fiscal framework.Three years later, both the ecosystem and the regulatory environment have matured. India now leads the world in crypto adoption, while global standards around compliance, reporting, and oversight have become clearer. In this context, there is an opportunity to review certain elements of the current tax framework so that it serves its original objectives with present-day realities.The upcoming Union Budget offers a moment to consider how crypto taxation can better align incentives with outcomes. The existing framework is perceived by many participants as relatively stringent.The impact of the 1 percent TDS is an example of this. For long-term investors, the deduction may appear manageable. However, for active traders and liquidity providers operating on thin margins, even small deductions on every transaction can result in capital being locked up.Market-making and arbitrage strategies, which typically operate at margins of 0.01 to 0.05 percent per trade, become difficult to sustain.Industry-reported data indicates that after TDS was introduced in July 2022, trading volumes on Indian exchanges declined sharply. Between July 2022 and July 2023 alone, an estimated ₹3.5 lakh crore of Indian crypto trading activity shifted to offshore platforms that did not deduct TDS.Reduced participation from liquidity providers has led to thinner order books, with Indian platforms often trading at premiums compared to global markets. While the objective of TDS was to enhance transparency, a portion of activity instead moved to peer-to-peer channels and overseas venues beyond India’s immediate supervisory reach.At the same time, India’s regulatory framework has strengthened considerably. Since March 2023, virtual asset service providers have been brought under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and are now reporting entities registered with FIU-IND. Robust know-your-customer norms, suspicious transaction reporting, and actions against non-compliant offshore exchanges are already in effect. So transaction monitoring is no longer dependent on TDS alone. In this environment, a relatively high transaction-level TDS is primarily discouraging. Broadening the onshore tax base could therefore be more effective than relying on transaction-level deductions.In 2024-25, the value of cryptocurrency transactions in India exceeded ₹51,000 crore, based on tax collection numbers of ₹511.8 crore. Lowering the TDS to 0.01% will also enable the record keeping of trading activities but provide relief to users.There are also wider ecosystem considerations. Users who move to unregulated platforms are exposed to higher operational and security risks. Indian cybersecurity firms have flagged losses linked to misleading offshore platforms promoted via social media. Keeping activity within India’s regulated perimeter enables better oversight. Carrying out survey actions under Section 133A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, against global platforms catering to Indian users, has revealed non compliance of TDS provision, with unreported TDS of several crores falling on users. According to Tax India Online Knowledge Foundation, if existing policies remain unchanged, cumulative uncollected TDS could approach ₹40,000 crore over the next five years, making the end user vulnerable due to non reportage.Domestic exchanges have also felt the impact. Customer support and compliance costs have increased for the platforms so that security, and reporting systems are aligned with Indian regulations.Another area that needs consideration is the treatment of losses. At present, losses from crypto transactions cannot be set off or carried forward, even within the same asset class. This creates an asymmetric tax structure that differs from most other financial assets. Allowing limited loss set-offs within the asset class would align crypto taxation more closely with established principles of fair taxation.A combination of targeted adjustments, such as reducing TDS to 0.01 percent and permitting loss set-offs, would not dilute oversight or enforcement. Instead, it could help restore liquidity, improve price discovery, and encourage activity to return to compliant Indian platforms operating under PMLA oversight and FIU-IND reporting norms. A calibrated update could help ensure that India captures economic activity, innovation, and tax revenues domestically, rather than seeing them move elsewhere.The upcoming Budget presents an opportunity to fine-tune the tax framework so that it supports compliant service providers, and protects domestic users. Such an approach would not be a departure from prudence, but a step towards ensuring that India captures the full benefits of a fast-maturing digital asset ecosystem.","The upcoming union budget offers a moment to consider how crypto taxation can better align incentives with outcomes.

Tiger Global's Flipkart stake sale taxable: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tiger-globals-flipkart-stake-sale-taxable-sc/articleshow/126555589.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a setback to private equity player Tiger Global, the Supreme Court Thursday ruled that its $1.6-billion stake sale in Flipkart to Walmart is subject to taxes in India, setting a precedent for investors that use tax treaties.Setting aside a Delhi high court order, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan held that the unlisted shares were transferred through an arrangement that was impermissible under the law.""The revenue has proved that the transactions in the instant case are impermissible tax-avoidance arrangements, and the evidence prima facie establishes that they do not qualify as lawful... The applications preferred by the assessees relate to a transaction designed prima facie for tax avoidance and were rightly rejected as being hit by the threshold jurisdictional bar to maintainability...,"" the 152-page order said.The bench also upheld the revenue department's contention that the mere possession of a Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) does not by itself preclude scrutiny by authorities, where the entity is alleged to be a conduit for tax avoidance.The case has its origins in Tiger Global acquiring shares in Flipkart Singapore between Oct 2011 and April 2015, which were subsequently transferred to Fit Holdings SARL, a Luxembourg entity.In 2018, Tiger Global exited Flipkart when Walmart acquired a controlling stake in the Indian e-commerce company.When the investor sought Authority of Advance Ruling's guidance, it held the transaction was ""prima facie for the avoidance of income tax"" as the actual management and control of the assessee and the other companies was with TGM LLC, an entity based in the US and not Mauritius.""A TRC, the court clarified, is not conclusive evidence of entitlement to treaty benefits when the surrounding facts indicate a lack of commercial substance. The judgment is also likely to have an overriding effect on investments which were grandfathered through India-Mauritius treaty amendment and the same may be questioned on the economic reality. This judgment has far-reaching consequences for private equity, venture capital, and offshore investment structures. It signals the end of mechanical treaty benefit claims based solely on TRCs and formal residency and reinforces India's alignment with global anti-abuse standards,"" added Amit Maheshwari, managing partner at AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm.""One would need to carefully understand the implications arising from the judgment relating to applicability of General Anti Avoidance Rules under the I-T Act, including the observations regarding the grandfathering of capital gains arising on sale of investments made before 1 April 2017 under the provisions of amended DTAA between India and Mauritius. Also of great interest may be the observations in regard to the TRC, applicability of circulars issued under the Act, and indeed the observations of Justice Pardiwala in regard to principles of tax sovereignty,"" said Pranav Sayta, national leader for international tax at consulting firm EY India.",Tiger global's $1.6-billion stake sale in flipkart to walmart is subject to taxes in india.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
