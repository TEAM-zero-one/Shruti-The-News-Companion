As India approaches the FY27 Union Budget, expectations are centred on striking a fine balance between fiscal consolidation and sustaining economic growth. This budget is likely to be less about short-term giveaways and more about long-term opportunities emerging from higher capital expenditure (capex), strategic sectoral priorities and structural reforms. Budget 2026 could mark a defining shift in India’s fiscal framework, while laying the foundation for a durable and investment-led growth cycle in India’s evolving economic landscape.The government is expected to target a gross fiscal deficit of 4.3% of GDP in FY27, marginally lower than 4.4% in FY26. More importantly, India is moving toward using the debt-to-GDP ratio as the primary fiscal anchor, with a stated goal of reducing it to around 50% by FY31 from about 56% currently. This signals a strong commitment to discipline and aligns India with global fiscal best practices. For investors, this means limited chances of big income tax cuts or populist spending. The budget is expected to be anchored around a nominal GDP growth assumption of ~10.1%, enabling the government to support growth priorities without materially straining fiscal finances.The biggest positive from a market perspective is the continued focus on capital expenditure. The Centre's capex is expected to grow by about 10.3% YoY to nearly ₹12.4 trillion, staying close to 3.1% of GDP. Unlike earlier cycles where roads and railways dominated, this budget is likely to widen the capex net. Higher allocations are expected for defence and allied industries, power, nuclear energy, electronics manufacturing, critical minerals and select labour-intensive sectors impacted by global trade disruptions. Revenue expenditure, subsidies and non-essential spending are likely to remain tightly controlled, reinforcing the capex-led growth model.Defence is emerging as one of the strongest beneficiaries of Budget 2026. With defence capex expected to rise sharply (~15% over the planned FY26 base of ~₹1.8tn), and recent approvals by the Defence Acquisition Council already touching multi-year highs, the order pipeline looks robust. Listed players such asare well placed to benefit. The growing ecosystem of defence start-ups, drones (including agri and surveillance drones) and indigenisation under “Make in India” adds a multi-year structural tailwind.While traditional infrastructure remains important, the focus is shifting toward power, nuclear and manufacturing-linked infrastructure. Power sector reforms, grid expansion and energy transition themes continue to offer opportunities. Large diversified infrastructure players such asremain key beneficiaries of sustained public capex.Electronics manufacturing, especially mobiles and allied components, continues to stand out under the PLI framework, while newer schemes such as rare-earth magnets and critical minerals signal the next phase of industrial policy. We expect players likecould be key long –term beneficiaries.Financials are likely to gain indirectly from fiscal discipline, macro stability and steady credit growth expected under Budget 2026, as these factors support consumption and investment demand.remain key beneficiaries of both retail credit expansion and capex financing.On the public sector front, we anticipate continued evolution of the government’s disinvestment and PSU strategy, shifting from outright asset sales toward business revamps and selective stake monetization; this includes the anticipated restructuring of IDBI Bank, potential stake changes in LIC, and consolidation of smaller PSU banks to create larger, more robust entities akin to SBI and HDFC.Well-capitalised lenders such asoffer a combination of balance-sheet strength and stable growth outlook, while large private and diversified financial institutions () with strong asset quality and distribution reach remain attractive plays on the broader economic recovery.Digital technologies that integrate advanced tech into agriculture, healthcare, and related social sectors, should remain key pillars of reform-oriented allocation. The Budget is expected to focus on agri-technology, rural digital infrastructure and sustainability initiatives aimed at improving long-term productivity and market access for farmers. Investors can benefit from continued demand for digital platforms, IT services and fintech solutions driven by higher penetration and affordability. Leading names such asare well placed to ride ongoing digital transformation trends, supporting long-term earnings visibility.With the government focused on fiscal discipline and capex growth instead of tax giveaways, direct support to private consumption could be limited. However, broader GST reforms, labour reforms, digital adoption incentives and targeted PLI schemes still underpin growth in consumption-linked sectors. Infrastructure push and supply-chain incentives signal a favourable long-term backdrop for Electric Vehicle (EV) players. Our preferred picks in this segment are. Further, scalable digital businesses with robust user-base growth and improving monetization including E-commerce ecosystem players (delivery/logistics platforms) likecould be key beneficiaries of increased consumer demand.","Budget 2026 could mark a defining shift in india’s fiscal framework, while laying the foundation for a durable and investment-led growth cycle.

Economic Survey 2025-26: Date, Time

What is the significance of the Economic Survey?

Economic Survey 2025-2026: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to table the Economic Survey ahead of her Union Budget speech. The Parliament’s Budget session began on January 28, 2026 and the first phase is expected to conclude on February 13, 2026. The Union Budget 2026 will be presented by FM Sitharaman on February 1, 2026 - likely the first time when the Budget is presented on a Sunday.Each year, the Economic Survey is closely seen by economists and policy analysts since it offers a very detailed assessment of the Indian economy’s performance over the past year, along with insights into the future growth prospects across various sectors.The Economic Survey is a very comprehensive annual economic review which is prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs under the Ministry of Finance. The Economic Survey bears the name of the Chief Economic Advisor, who at present is Dr. V. Anantha Nageswaran.The Economic Survey presents an in-depth analysis of macroeconomic parameters, key fiscal and financial indicators, and forward-looking assessments. The document also serves as an important reference point, often signalling the broad policy approach and priorities that will likely shape the forthcoming Union Budget for 2026-27.The Economic Survey 2025-2026 will be tabled before Parliament on Thursday, January 29, 2026, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, which will be followed by a media briefing by Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran.The Economic Survey usually takes stock of key macroeconomic trends. This year it may talk about growth resilience despite global headwinds, the threat from Donald Trump’s tariffs, the impact of artificial intelligence on the job market, and the weakening of the rupee against the US dollar.The analysis in the Economic Survey also suggests fresh policy ideas to tackle economic challenges, including poverty alleviation, climate action, improvements in education, infrastructure development, and strengthening the country’s financial system.The Economic Survey was first introduced in 1950-51 as part of the Budget papers, and has since then evolved into a separate document that is tabled ahead of the Union Budget. Each year, its overarching theme draws close attention from policymakers and observers alike.The Survey contains detailed sector-wise reviews along with dedicated chapters on economic concerns.","The economic survey 2025-2026 will be tabled before parliament on thursday, january 29, 2026, between 11:00 am and 12:00 pm.

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

India stands at a pivotal moment as Budget 2026 approaches, and few sectors can accelerate growth as powerfully as Financial Services (FS). India’s real GDP growth is estimated at 7.4% in FY26 led by investment demand and services sector growth. More than a system of payments or lending, the FS sector today acts as the economy’s central engine by allocating capital, pricing risk, and transmitting policy signals across the real economy. When this engine operates efficiently, it amplifies growth across infrastructure, manufacturing, MSMEs, households, and the expanding footprints of the digital ecosystem.A modern, fast‑growing economy depends on strong financial intermediaries. In India, banks, NBFCs, insurers, pension funds, mutual funds, and capital markets channel household and institutional savings into productive investments across the economy. This steady flow of capital drives GDP growth, improves productivity, formalises activity, and supports MSMEs and start‑ups through credit, funding, and risk‑mitigation tools. To sustain this momentum, Budget 2026 must focus on strengthening credit systems, deepening markets, and ensuring a predictable and innovation‑friendly regulatory environment.Continuity of the pace of tax reforms with the mantra of ‘simplification’ being the core objective will play a vital role in shaping India’s competitiveness as a global financial hub. A rationalisation of the tax regime for foreign bank branches—which currently face an effective tax rate of 38.22 percent -- would create a more balanced environment for global institutions. Extending withholding tax exemption on interest received to NBFCs similar to the exemption provided to Banks would introduce operational efficiency and arrest cash flow leakages for NBFCs helping them focus on greater penetration.Judicial clarity and global alignment are equally important. Recent Supreme Court rulings in the Tiger Global and American Express have implications for foreign investors and foreign banks. The global investor community is looking at clear and upfront tax guidance which would provide the predictability needed for investment decisions. The global investor community would be keenly looking at how the Hon’ble Finance Minister balances the expectations of the global investor community in respect of their past as well as the future investments.Alongside these reforms, India has been gaining prominence as an emerging international financial services centre (IFSC) through the development of GIFT City. Past Budgets have provided regulatory and tax relaxations that have enabled strong and steady progress. Global and Indian investors are regularly coming up with newer business models in GIFT City, which needs regulatory and tax amendments for enabling the same. Continuing with the past practice, Budget 2026 should continue to promote GIFT City for development of new business activities and products in GIFT City. The emerging areas of Global / Regional Treasury Centres, Commodity Trading, and Oilfield Equipment leasing will be eagerly looking up to Budget 2026 for regulatory support and tax clarity.Notifying the framework for Variable Capital Company structures would significantly widen the range of fund‑management activities within the IFSC. As the re‑insurance market in GIFT City continues to expand, it will be important to ensure a level playing field for Lloyd’s syndicates to attract larger pools of global capacity. Collectively, these reforms can materially enhance GIFT City’s attractiveness for banks, asset managers, treasury centres, insurers, leasing platforms, and other cross‑border financial participants.Similar to recent Budgets, timely disposal of tax assessments and appeals must remain a priority. With about INR 26.3 lakh crore—around 8 percent of India’s GDP—locked in income‑tax disputes, direct‑tax litigation continues to be a major concern. This issue is particularly significant for the FS sector, where cases often involve legacy matters that require clear and consistent guidance from tax authorities and take years to be resolved. Establishing defined timelines and accountability frameworks would enhance trust and reduce uncertainty for financial institutions and investors.To conclude, India’s FS sector is positioned to power the nation’s next phase of growth. Budget 2026 can accelerate this transition by pairing targeted policy support with competitive tax rules. Strengthening FS institutions, deepening markets, and improving digital and regulatory architecture will expand the economy’s credit capacity, strengthen inclusion, and reinforce India’s emergence as a global financial hub—creating the investment foundation needed for sustainable and long‑term growth. These financial sector reforms will go a long way in not only sustaining GDP growth but also in boosting the per capita income of India’s population.","India stands at a pivotal moment as budget 2026 approaches.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Capex to remain the fulcrum



Debt consolidation and state finances



Savings, insurance and structural reforms



The Union Budget 2026–27 will be framed against an increasingly fragile global backdrop marked by geopolitical flux, volatile financial markets and a sharp rally in commodities, but India is expected to retain its macro stability with a calibrated fiscal strategy and sustained public investment, according to a pre-Budget assessment by State Bank of India Research.SBI Research said the Budget comes at a time when “the domino effects of a new emerging order of realpolitik” are cascading across global markets, with stretched equity and bond valuations reflecting “misplaced trust”, even as a risk-on rally gathers pace in commodities led by precious metals. A key uncertainty, it cautioned, is whether crude oil prices could break out of what it described as an “artificially managed supply glut”.Against this backdrop, SBI Research expects nominal GDP growth for Budget calculations at around 10.5–11% in FY27, noting that rising international commodity prices could percolate into wholesale inflation. Based on this, the fiscal deficit is projected at about 4.2% of GDP, although the bank flagged that the new GDP series could alter fiscal arithmetic.“A bit slower nominal growth may hurt tax revenues in FY27, requiring better expenditure planning,” the report said, adding that GST rationalisation and possible reductions in marginal personal income tax rates could help cushion pressures on the tax base.On government borrowing, SBI Research expects net central borrowing at Rs 11.7 trillion in FY27, alongside repayments of Rs 4.87 trillion, while state gross borrowings may rise to Rs 12.6 trillion with repayments of Rs 4.2 trillion.“RBI would need to do much more OMOs to balance the borrowing requirements,” the report said, underlining the growing role of liquidity management as market borrowings expand.Over the medium term, SBI estimates gross market borrowing of Rs 93.8–95.2 lakh crore over the next five fiscals, averaging Rs 18–19 lakh crore annually, significantly higher than the current run rate. This, it said, makes it “imperative that government also looks at borrowings through alternative and enhancing sources like small savings”.Public investment is expected to remain the centrepiece of the growth strategy. SBI Research said government capital expenditure may cross Rs 12 lakh crore in FY27, implying a year-on-year increase of about 10%.While tax revenues are likely to post only modest growth and non-tax revenues may remain flat, the bank believes continued capex will help sustain domestic demand and crowd in private investment.SBI Research also pointed to the Centre’s medium-term fiscal consolidation path, under which central government debt-to-GDP is projected to decline from 57.1% in FY25 to 56.1% in FY26, with an explicit commitment to place debt on a declining trajectory towards about 50% of GDP by March 2031, in the absence of major exogenous shocks.It said a similar framework needs to be institutionalised at the state level, noting that states account for a significant share of general government debt.“State budgets should explicitly chart medium-term, preferably scenario-based, debt-to-GSDP trajectories, aligned with realistic growth assumptions and development needs, rather than relying solely on annual deficit targets,” the report said, adding that this could find emphasis in the Budget speech.On taxation, SBI Research pushed reforms to boost household financial savings, including parity in tax treatment of interest on deposits with capital gains, a shorter lock-in for tax-saving fixed deposits, and a higher TDS threshold on savings account interest.The report also called for a “plethora of reforms” in the insurance and pensions sector to improve penetration. It flagged concerns around health insurance claims, citing IRDAI data that showed around 69% of complaints in FY25 were related to claims, and said citizens often struggle to receive timely settlements.With climate risks rising, SBI Research highlighted that India faces a protection gap of nearly 93% for natural disasters between 1991 and 2025, making a strong case for a public–private disaster risk pool involving insurers.It also pushed for a transition to a risk-based capital framework in insurance, moving away from “static, formula-driven, one-size-fits-all solvency margins” to a more dynamic, risk-aligned approach.Despite the turbulence in global markets, SBI Research said India continues to remain the bright spot, supported by strong macro fundamentals. The challenge for Budget 2026–27, it noted, will be to balance fiscal consolidation with growth imperatives while navigating an uncertain global environment.","Sbi research expects nominal gdp growth for budget calculations at around 10.5–11% in fy27.

India’s real estate sector continued its strong growth trajectory in 2025, reinforcing its position as a core pillar of the country’s economic expansion.Government-led reforms continued to strengthen transparency and efficiency. Key measures included digitized registration systems, single-window construction approvals, unified RERA dashboards and simplified compliance norms. These interventions reduced delays, improved accountability and encouraged wider institutional participation. Complementary policy frameworks such as Gati Shakti, National Logistics Policy and Data-center incentives supported growth in non-traditional asset classes.The sector currently contributes nearly 8% to national GDP and is expected to contribute 15% to 16% to national GDP by 2047 towards our vision of “Viksit Bharat”. It would need support from the direct tax and indirect tax policies of the government during this journey.Given the government’s objective of housing for all some of the expectations that could be looked at -While the GST rate cuts on construction materials by the 56th GST Council was a welcome move, the real estate industry continues to seek clarity on long-standing issues which significantly influence housing and leasing costs.For example, reforming ITC eligibility for leased assets is not merely an industry demand but an essential step toward aligning GST with its core principle of tax neutrality, ensuring India's continued attractiveness as a global business destination. The inability to claim ITC has significant financial impact on large-scale commercial infrastructure projects. This has a direct impact on setting up Data-center/ Global Capability Centers, mindset of foreign investors, startups and enterprises relying on cost-effective leasing options etc.Many countries, including the UK, Australia, and Singapore, allow ITC on commercial property construction, provided the asset is used for taxable supplies such as commercial leasing. India could benefit from a similar approach, ensuring tax neutrality and eliminating cascading effects. To mitigate concerns about excessive credit claims, the budget could provide for ITC to be allowed in equal instalments over four to five years and could be subject to reversal upon sale of the building, based on a predefined formula.An area of persisting ambiguity is the taxation of joint development arrangements. From taxability to valuation to timing of payment of tax, there is a pressing need to address the appropriate tax treatment of:",India to grow 6 to 8% in real terms in next 5 years: ashwini vaishnaw at davos.

Budget 2026 expectations: technology, R&D and exports

As finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Union Budget 2026 on February 1, defence spending is expected to remain a key focus amid rising geopolitical uncertainty and sustained emphasis on military modernisation.Over the last five years, India’s defence expenditure has followed a clear upward trajectory. Spending rose from Rs 4.85 lakh crore in FY21 to Rs 6.41 lakh crore in FY25 (Revised Estimates).For FY26, the Budget Estimates place defence expenditure at Rs 6.81 lakh crore. This reflects a consistent annual increase, underlining the government’s priority on national security and preparedness.The data shows defence spending has grown by nearly Rs 2 lakh crore since FY21, with sharper increases in recent years as border tensions and global conflicts reshaped security calculations.The rising allocations have increasingly been aligned with modernisation and capital expenditure. As per the PIB release on Budget 2025-26, Rs 1.80 lakh crore, or about 26% of the total defence outlay, was earmarked for capital expenditure, with a strong push for domestic procurement under theinitiative.A significant share of the modernisation budget has been reserved for procurement from Indian industries, including private playersIndustry body FICCI, in its pre-Budget 2026 memorandum, has argued that this trend needs to deepen further, calling for capital outlay to be raised to around 30% of the total defence budget.According to FICCI, future warfare will be “technology-driven, multi-domain and information-centric,” requiring investments beyond traditional platforms.With defence spending already on a rising path, Budget 2026 is expected to focus on qualitative upgrades rather than just headline increases.

From managing risk to enabling resilience

Cotton occupies a critical place in India’s agricultural and industrial economy. It supports millions of farm households, feeds a globally competitive textile sector, and remains one of the country’s most widely cultivated commercial crops. Yet, despite this significance, cotton today faces a paradox; while production continues at scale, productivity gains have stagnated and cultivation risks have intensified.Though cotton anchors India’s agrarian economy, yet faces a critical paradox: while production scale remains vast, productivity has stagnated and farming risks have intensified. This stagnation mirrors a broader national challenge. With India’s R&D intensity hovering at just about 0.7% of GDP, long-gestation crops like cotton lack the deep, continuous investment required to sustain innovation pipelines.While India remains a top global producer, yields have flatlined amidst escalating pest and climate pressures. The defining crisis is the absence of new technology - earlier scientific gains have faded, leaving farmers to battle modern field realities with ageing, inadequate tools.One of the clearest manifestations of this strain is visible in the economics of cotton harvesting. Unlike many other crops, cotton is harvested manually, often through multiple pickings across the season. Picking alone can account for roughly 30–35% of total cultivation costs, making labour the single largest cost component in cotton production.This dependence on manual labour is becoming untenable. Labour scarcity during peak season especially, picking pushes costs higher, creates uncertainty, and impacts farmers' margins. In several regions, timely availability of pickers has become as critical a risk as pests or weather - making mechanisation an absolute necessity, not a choice.But mechanisation cannot succeed with developing machines alone. Cotton plants must be specifically bred for machine compatibility - uniform architecture, synchronized boll opening, appropriate height, and so on. Developing such machinery-ready hybrids demands focused, investment-heavy R&D programs with enormous scientific, technical, and economic challenges.In this context, is why weighted tax deduction on R&D expenditure is essential. It would unlock sustained private investment, accelerate development of mechanisation-suited varieties, and reduce farmers' exposure to labour shocks while improving competitiveness and profitability.Further, a key bottleneck is trash content: machine-harvested kapas often carries 8–12% extraneous matter, compared to much lower levels in manual picking, while markets typically accept cotton with trash below about 2%. Without addressing this gap, mechanization may not help despite reducing dependence on manual labour. Field-level pre-cleaning technologies are therefore essential, enabling farmers to lower trash content at the farm gate and ensure that mechanization strengthens, rather than weakens, farm incomes.Thus, to ensure India’s cotton sector remains competitive, addressing these challenges such as pest resistance, climate resilience, or mechanization, requires sustained, long-term research commitment by the companies. This requires science-based, stable and predictable policy and regulatory frameworks.Cotton innovation involves multi-year trials, validation across regions, and coordination between breeders, engineers, agronomists, and regulators. Here, the issue of ease of research becomes central. When research pathways are unpredictable or approvals are prolonged, timelines stretch and costs escalate. Long-gestation research becomes harder to justify, particularly in a national context where overall R&D intensity is already constrained. The result is not a lack of ideas, but a thinning of serious, sustained research efforts precisely where they are most needed.As India approaches Union Budget 2026, cotton offers a clear illustration of why agricultural research must be treated as strategic infrastructure rather than discretionary spending. Short-term measures, input support, procurement, or relief interventions, play an important role in stabilizing farm incomes. However, they cannot resolve productivity plateaus or structural cost pressures rooted in technological gaps. Those require patient investment in science.At this crucial juncture, two long-standing policy measures warrant immediate attention and swift action.First, the restoration of the 200% weighted tax deduction on R&D expenditure. Agricultural research involves high upfront costs, long timelines, and uncertain outcomes. Weighted tax incentives acknowledge this reality and help sustain investment in problem-solving science, particularly in crops like cotton where innovation cycles are inherently long.Second, GST rationalization for seeds. Seeds are the foundation of productivity, yet their current tax treatment adds avoidable cost to an essential input. Rationalization would ease the burden on farmers while improving liquidity for seed developers, indirectly strengthening the research-to-farm continuum. These measures are not demands in isolation; they are enabling signals that align fiscal policy with the realities of agricultural innovation.Cotton research is ultimately farm-level risk management. When innovation pipelines slow, farmers are forced into higher input use, delayed operations, and greater exposure to labour and market shocks. When science delivers on time, better pest solutions, mechanization-ready hybrids, or improved pre-cleaning—farmers gain stability and predictability.Cotton’s future will be determined less by acreage and more by how effectively seed research helps ensure raw material security for the textile sector in the wake of fast changing economic, ecological and geopolitical realities. Union Budget 2026 is a decisive opportunity: strengthen R&D incentives, rationalize input taxation, and make ease of doing research a policy priority to rebuilding the cotton innovation pipeline.That would reaffirm a simple truth: sustainable agriculture is built not on short-term fixes, but on long-term investment in science that helps farmers cope, compete, and endure.","Though cotton anchors india’s agrarian economy, yet faces a critical paradox.

New Delhi: The country’s industrial output growth soared to a 26-month high in Dec, led by robust expansion in manufacturing and a rebound in mining and electricity, marking the second month of over 7% growth.Data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Wednesday showed the index of industrial production (IIP) rose by 7.8% in Dec, higher than the upwardly revised 7.2% in Nov and above the 3.7% in Dec 2024.The manufacturing sector recorded strong growth, driven by the impact of GST rate cuts. The sector grew by an annual 8.1% in Dec compared to 3.7% in Dec 2024. In manufacturing, the high growth recording industries were computer, electronic and optical products (34.9%), motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers (33.5%) and other transport equipment (25.1%), according to the NSO statement.The mining sector grew by 6.8% in Dec compared to 2.7% in Dec 2024 while the electricity sector rose by 6.3% during the month compared to 6.2% in previous Dec.The capital goods sector, which is a key gauge of investment activity, remained robust growing by 8.1% in Dec compared to 10.5% in Dec last year. The consumer durables sector grew by 12.3% during the month compared to an 8.1% expansion in Dec 2024 while consumer non-durables sector surged by 8.3% in Dec, compared to a contraction of 7.1%.“On the investment front, infrastructure and construction goods continued to register healthy growth, supported by sustained capex at both the Central and state govt levels. Demand-side indicators also strengthened, with consumer durables and non-durables recording healthy output growth. Policy measures such as GST rationalisation, income tax relief, past RBI rate cuts and easing inflationary pressures remain supportive of the consumption outlook,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at ratings agency CareEdge.Sinha said the upcoming budget will be pivotal in shaping domestic economic momentum amid heightened global headwinds. The direction of capex-related policies and their influence on private investment will be key determinants of industrial performance, while lingering uncertainty around US tariffs remains an important risk to monitor, said Sinha.","The index of industrial production (iip) rose by 7.8% in dec, higher than the upwardly revised 7.2% in nov.

How will a person who has an income Rs 12 lakh benefit from new rates?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said.

With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden.Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.",Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: faqs answered. Finance minister nirmala sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime.
