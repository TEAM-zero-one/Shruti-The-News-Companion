India’s hi-voltage transmission network crosses 5 lakh ckm mark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-hi-voltage-transmission-network-crosses-5-lakh-ckm-mark/articleshow/127177524.cms,"Yogi's Davos Push: Uttar Pradesh Signs Landmark MoU For One Gigawatt Green AI Hub In Greater Noida

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over inadequacy of the grid to evacuate power from renewable energy projects, the govt on Thursday said that India’s high-voltage (220 kV and above) power transmission network had crossed the 5 lakh circuit kilometre (ckm) mark with the addition of 628 ckm in Rajasthan earlier this month.With India targeting 500 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030, strengthening the high-voltage inter- and intra-state transmission network is crucial for evacuating green energy and ensuring grid stability. Sources said the govt has planned to expand the high-voltage transmission network to 6.5 lakh ckm by 2032. It has added 2.1 lakh ckm since April 2014. However, it failed to achieve the annual target in the 2024–25 financial year and the figure has been considerably short of target in the ongoing fiscal as well.Officials said that in FY25, only 8,830 ckm of new transmission lines were commissioned, as against a target of 15,253 ckm, reflecting a 42% shortfall, while 6,961 ckm have been added till Dec, as against a target of 15,382 ckm for FY26.According to officials, the world’s largest synchronous national grid crossed the 5 lakh ckm milestone on Jan 14 with the commissioning of a 765-kV transmission line for evacuation of 1,100 MW of green energy from Bhadla, Ramgarh and Fatehgarh solar power complex in the Rajasthan renewable energy zone.The ministry of power, in a statement, said that 40,000 ckm of transmission network is currently being built under inter-state transmission projects, while 27,500 ckm of intra-state transmission projects are under implementation. These are expected to enhance grid reliability and power evacuation capability. While transformation capacity has increased to 1,407 gigavolt ampere (GVA), officials said it is expected to reach 2,345 GVA by 2032.A senior power department official said further strengthening of the transmission network is among the key issues being discussed at a two-day ‘chintan shivir’, a brainstorming session of ministers and senior officials from the Union ministry and state power departments and related public sector undertakings, which began on Thursday at Parwanoo in Himachal Pradesh. Officials said the financial health of power discoms, the final draft of the Electricity Amendment Bill, installation of smart meters, challenges in the generation sector, energy goals and security and new technologies will also be discussed at the Shivir.Nearly 65 state-run and private power distribution companies posted a combined PAT (profit after tax) of ₹2,700 crore in FY25. However, officials said that ₹6.9 lakh crore of accumulated losses and nearly ₹7.2 lakh crore of outstanding debt remain a major cause for concern and will come up for discussion, along with high cross-subsidies, the need for cost-reflective tariffs and improvements in billing and recovery efficiency.Ministers and officials are also likely to discuss comments received from various stakeholders on the draft Electricity Amendment Bill, which is expected to be tabled in Parliament during the upcoming Budget session.","India’s high-voltage (220 kv and above) power transmission network had crossed the 5 lakh circuit kilometre (ckm) mark with the addition of 628 ckm in rajasthan.

Perquisite valuation rules for Electric Vehicles

Relief on Housing Loan Interest Under the New Tax Regime

Timelines for Revised or Belated Returns

Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Finance Minister will present Union Budget 2026 in the backdrop of uncertain geopolitical dynamics, volatile capital markets, diverse regulatory reforms (e.g. new income tax act, labour codes etc.), fluctuating oil prices as well as INR-USD exchange rate and other uncertainties. However, the one thing certain is that the individual taxpayer will be brimming with expectations of a promise of more net disposable income in their hands on a warm Sunday afternoon of 1 February 2026.However, as India prepares to implement the new Income-tax Act from 1 April 2026, expectations of major tax changes may need to be calibrated. Potentially it may be possible that the Budget may focus on micro, practical changes and administrative improvements, such as faster refunds, simpler compliance etc. to improve taxpayer experience and ensure a smooth transition to the new law.One of the most frequently raised expectations is enhancement of the standard deduction, which currently stands at Rs 50,000 under the old tax regime and Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime.With inflation continuing to raise living costs, the salaried taxpayers are hopeful that the deduction limit will be increased to at least Rs 1 lakh. A higher deduction would provide relief to taxpayers at a time when rising living costs are placing increased pressure on the household finances.Also Read | Budget 2026 income tax: Will GST-style fewer tax slabs be brought under new income tax regime? Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly seen as the future of mobility, and in line with their broader ESG commitments, many employers are now encouraging employees to opt for an EV under their company car lease policies. However, the current perquisite valuation rules continue to rely solely on the cubic capacity of the car, an approach that does not account for the distinct nature of EVs, which do not have an engine in the conventional sense.Hence, it may be practical for the government to introduce a separate valuation mechanism specifically for EVs to ensure a suitable tax treatment and to further promote their adoption.Home loan borrowers have long relied on interest related tax deductions to reduce their repayment burden. However, under the new tax regime, individuals cannot offset housing loan interest against salary income, even in the case of a self‑occupied property.With housing prices continuing to rise and the government’s broader aim of promoting home ownership at affordable rates, there is an expectation that the government may in the upcoming budget allow such interest deduction at least on self-occupied property under the new tax regime. This would provide relief to mid‑income taxpayers families and help build further confidence of taxpayers in the new tax regime.Also Read | Budget 2026: Why standard deduction should be hiked under the new income tax regime - explained Under current provisions, taxpayers can file a revised or belated return for a financial year only up to 31 December following the end of that year. However, this timeline often poses challenges, particularly for individual taxpayers with cross-border income or investments, as tax filings in their home or host countries may not be finalized by then. This mismatch can result in unintentional under-reporting or over-reporting of income in India. For instance, a US citizen who becomes an ordinarily resident in India may be required to report global income for parts of two calendar years in a single Indian tax return, even though overseas tax filings are completed later. Given these practical difficulties, extending the deadline for filing revised or belated returns would provide much-needed relief and help ensure accurate reporting.As the government prepares for the landmark shift to the new Income-tax Act in April 2026, the Union Budget presents an opportunity to address a few long‑standing demands of individual taxpayers. While sweeping changes may be unlikely in a year of transition, targeted reforms whether through higher deductions or more flexible timelines could significantly improve the taxpayer experience. Ultimately, the hope is that the Budget will strike the right balance between fiscal prudence and the genuine needs of India’s growing salaried class.","As india prepares to implement the new income-tax act from 1 april 2026, expectations of major tax changes may need to be calibrated.

Access Through Gold Loans

Rationalising Risk Weights to Expand Gold Loan Supply

Reforming SARFAESI Norms to Expand Rural Housing Credit

Bringing Gold Lending Into the Formal Economy

(Shaji Varghese is CEO of Muthoot FinCorp)

India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural economies. One powerful yet underutilised lever in this journey is household gold. In recent years, the value of household gold has more than doubled, significantly increasing family wealth across India. According to a 2025 Morgan Stanley estimate, Indian households hold nearly 34,600 tonnes of gold jewellery, valued at around $3.8 trillion—almost 89 percent of the country’s GDP. Much of this gold has been accumulated over generations or acquired to mark important life milestones.While gold carries immense emotional and cultural significance, in its idle form it contributes little to economic activity. It is therefore imperative that India deploys effective policies to enable household gold to be used productively—without forcing families to relinquish ownership.Gold loans offer precisely this solution. They allow households to unlock the economic value of gold while retaining emotional ownership, making gold a working asset that supports livelihoods, enterprise, and growth.Over the past few years, regulators have taken meaningful steps to introduce balanced regulations that protect customers while supporting sectoral development.These measures, coming into effect from April 1, 2026, create a stronger foundation. However, to unlock the full potential of gold loans for inclusive growth, further reforms are needed.Credit penetration in rural India remains low, particularly among shopkeepers and MSMEs—estimated at nearly six million nationwide. Many continue to lack access to formal finance, even as they need working capital to upgrade infrastructure, manage inventory, and expand offerings.Gold loans are ideally suited to meet these short-term needs. Interest is charged only for the period the loan is utilised, allowing borrowers to repay when cash flows improve and re-borrow as required. This flexible credit cycle supports business growth, encourages financial discipline, and mobilises household savings in a way that benefits both borrowers and the broader economy.Strengthening Last-Mile Credit Through NBFC Branch ExpansionA key reason for low credit penetration in Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural areas is limited physical branch presence. Over time, NBFCs have demonstrated a superior ability to reach underserved regions, tailor products to local needs, and operate efficiently through well-established models.For gold loans in particular, physical branches are essential and cannot be fully replaced by digital channels, unlike unsecured personal loans. Encouraging NBFCs to expand branch networks would significantly improve access and deepen market penetration.Currently, regulatory restrictions and prescriptive guidelines on branch expansion can slow network growth. Liberalising these norms—especially for collateral-backed products like gold loans—would accelerate outreach while maintaining prudential safeguards.NBFCs play a critical role in last-mile credit delivery, particularly for small-ticket and entry-level loans in rural areas. However, all NBFC loans currently carry a uniform 100 percent risk weight, which raises the cost of lending and limits credit supply.Gold loans are regulated by loan-to-value (LTV) norms, similar to home loans, where risk weights vary based on LTV. Extending a similar risk-based framework to gold loans could unlock significant capital, enabling NBFCs to expand credit availability to deserving borrowers.A coordinated approach between the Government and regulators can help create a supportive policy framework that recognises the broader economic and nation-building potential of expanding gold loan credit.Recent stress in unsecured lending segments, including microfinance, has adversely affected credit scores for millions of households. Many of these borrowers experienced temporary or one-time defaults and are now excluded from formal credit.Targeted schemes are needed to help such borrowers re-enter the formal financial system. Ensuring that temporary distress does not lead to permanent exclusion will allow households to regain access to credit and participate productively in the economy.Housing is a powerful economic driver in rural India, with strong linkages to nearly 50 sectors. While banks offer rural housing loans, their reach in smaller ticket sizes—below ₹10–15 lakh—is limited. NBFCs, with their extensive branch networks, are better positioned to serve this segment.However, SARFAESI Act provisions restrict NBFCs’ ability to recover smaller-ticket secured loans, as enforcement is allowed only for outstanding amounts of ₹20 lakh and above. Harmonising SARFAESI applicability for NBFCs in line with banks and housing finance companies would significantly improve credit flow and accelerate rural housing growth.An estimated 60 percent of gold lending remains unregulated. Formal gold loans, by contrast, operate under clear regulatory guidelines and supervision. Allowing greater flexibility in NBFC branch expansion would accelerate formalisation and extend regulated credit to underserved markets.With a strong regulatory framework already in place, wider branch access can help bring millions of borrowers into the formal financial system.The upcoming Budget presents a timely opportunity to build on existing reforms. With continued policy support and regulatory alignment, gold loans can unlock household wealth, deepen rural credit access, and drive inclusive growth across Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural India.","India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to tier-2, tier-3, and rural economies.

Budget 2026- How To Respond to the Global Trade War

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2026 at a time when the global economy is facing headwinds from the trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump. India has been levied with one of the steepest tariffs - 50% for its exports to the US. The implication of this decision is important since America is India’s largest trading partner.An India-US trade deal is still stuck in negotiations - the US wants India to stop buying crude oil from Russia, and it wants India to open up its agriculture and dairy sectors to American products. On both demands, India has maintained a firm stance - decisions on which country to procure crude from is about economics and strategic autonomy, and agriculture and dairy sectors have never been opened for access as part of trade deals.In this backdrop, Budget 2026 assumes significance - how will the Modi government insulate the Indian economy from the impact of Trump’s trade tariffs?India is among the world’s top 5 economies in nominal GDP terms and is on the road to become the third largest after the US and China in the coming years. It is also the world’s fastest growing major economy. With the world’s largest population, the importance of India as a market to sell in cannot be ignored.Importantly, India is largely a domestic demand driven growth story - a fact that somewhat insulates it from external headwinds. Dr DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor at EY says, “It (Indian economy) is in some sense insulated from the ongoing global uncertainties. India's strategy is to diversify its export destinations and become more competitive, so that for the domestic producers, there is cost competitiveness and scale offered through domestic demand over and above which they can export,” he tells TOI.But as it looks to step up its exports, the 50% tariffs from the US are a major impediment.India’s merchandise exports to the US fell 1.83% year-on-year to $6.88 billion in December 2025, while imports rose 7.57% to $4.03 billion, even as exports grew 9.75% during April–December.Despite a 50% US tariff on Indian goods from August 27, Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal has said exports remain on a positive growth path as both sides negotiate a bilateral trade agreement.As Rishi Shah, Partner and Economic Advisory Services Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat notes: Over the past few years, the Union Budget has played a constructive role in engineering an ecosystem for growth, with a decisive tilt toward productive public expenditure, balance-sheet repair and macro stability. This has allowed India to absorb repeated global shocks with relatively limited disruption.Economists surveyed by Times of India Online are of the view that India’s economic growth story is largely domestic driven, which largely insulates it from external headwinds and shocks. However, the exports facing sectors, which are bearing the brunt of the global trade war need relief. Steps to enhance export competitiveness and diversification of basket, customs duty rationalisation, along with relief for MSMEs are needed, feel experts.Most economists also stress the need for continued capital expenditure push while working to reduce fiscal deficit, and focus on job creation.Ranen Banerjee, Partner, Government Sector Leader at PwC India tells TOI, “There are sectors that have a higher exposure to externalities and some of them are labour intensive and many in the MSME segment. Given there cannot be a direct intervention to support them, the budget can look at bringing down their cost of doing business, cost of working capital and also help lay the foundations for competitiveness.”“This could be through higher allocations for the credit guarantee scheme, reducing compliance burdens and creation of common shared infrastructure/facilities that help them improve quality control, meeting export standards in the finished products. The short term pressures on employment in the job intensive sectors affected by global uncertainties could be supported by redirecting the labour to construction through continued higher allocations to capex and concessions to housing and property to spur housing demand,” he says.“Budget 2026 should aim to further boost consumption by following policies that would create jobs and lower the cost of living,” an economist at an industry body told TOI.The economist advocates boosting public investment, crowding in domestic and foreign private capital through investor facilitation, prioritizing affordable housing via a National Urban Planning Authority, and strengthening future-ready education and skilling to expand employment opportunities.Rishi Shah of Grant Thornton Bharat says that Budget 2026 should now return to first principles and reinforce the economy’s internal resilience.First, policy must focus on strengthening businesses by durably lowering the cost of doing business—not through protection, but via regulatory certainty, simpler compliance, faster dispute resolution and continued logistics efficiency gains. In a fragmented global trade environment, competitiveness will matter more than preferential market access, and these measures directly support both domestic activity and export viability.Second, public sector capital expenditure must remain elevated and well-targeted. Beyond its near-term demand impact, public capex expands productive capacity, alleviates infrastructure bottlenecks and improves private investment viability—especially when global financial conditions remain uneven.Third, the budget should sharpen its emphasis on innovation, quality standards and domestic value addition, particularly within manufacturing and MSMEs. Sustained growth will increasingly depend on India’s ability to move up the value chain rather than merely scale volumes.Finally, fiscal credibility remains a macro anchor. Improving expenditure efficiency while maintaining a transparent and credible deficit path is essential to preserve investor confidence and monetary-fiscal coordination. In combination, these priorities can help India de-risk growth from external volatility while laying the groundwork for durable economic transformation.The above four themes are also the broad recommendations of most economists that TOI Online spoke to.Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda notes that uncertainty relating to trade wars is likely to remain until a trade deal is signed and the content examined.“The Budget can buffer certain vulnerable sectors through measures to support the MSME segment. This group largely houses industries like garments, leather products, jewelry, handcrafts, auto parts etc, which are the ones which are susceptible to an impact due to the ongoing tariff regime pursued in the USA,” he advises.Radhika Rao, Executive Director and Senior Economist at DBS Bank is of the view that the centre might prioritise strategic sectors, which include defence, semiconductors, electronics, renewable energy, artificial intelligence/robotics etc.“Budget allocations towards the defence sector have targeted modernisation and expansion of the indigenous manufacturing capacity, with indications of a double-digit increase in the FY27 Budget. An uncertain geopolitical environment also increases the urgency to boost domestic procurement and strengthen the security apparatus. Development of new core technologies will also require a skilled workforce, which can benefit from industry and cross-country collaborations,” she tells TOI.Yuvika Singhal, Economist at QuantEco says that diversification in terms of products and geographics is the biggest insulation. “Friend shoring has emerged as a relevant underlying guiding principle for crafting trade deals that are mutually beneficial. In the past one-year India has successfully concluded trade deals with UK, EFTA, Oman & New Zealand. The icing on the cake would be the signing of the much awaited US-India trade deal. To expedite the conclusion of the same, it would perhaps become imperative for India to revamp its customs duty framework, including the non-trade barriers,” she tells TOI.“In this context, we expect the FY27 Union Budget to notify critical changes to the existing customs rate framework. This would be consistent with the long-standing demand for correcting the inverted duty structure in several manufacturing sectors and promotion of ease of doing business,” she adds.Rumki Majumdar, Economist at Deloitte India recommends that the policies need to be reoriented towards supply-side resilience. This can be done by easing compliance and expanding capacity. She tells TOI that the export market for India should be widened and deepened through effective FTA implementation.She says that public capex should be sustained with a focus on debt-to-GDP discipline to bolster competitiveness and insulate domestic demand.Sachchidanand Shukla - Group Chief Economist at Larsen & Toubro tells TOI, “Budget will do well to reiterate India’s thrust to insulate growth by continuing to lean on buttressing growth via improved quality of expenditure (maintaining focus on Infrastructure, adequate support to needy segments esp the ones hit by Tariffs), transparency (weeded out off-budget borrowings) and communicating the shift to debt/GDP with more clarity and better communication since debt will be the fiscal anchor as against fiscal deficit, which was relatively better understood as the annual operating target. ”“The idea of keeping debt on a declining path may not be as easy to understand or communicate and that may have implications for interest rates and the pricing of government securities,” he adds.Fiscal discipline with emphasis on capital expenditure is a common ask by economists. Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist and Executive Director at Anand Rathi Group, said Budget 2026 should sustain high government capital expenditure to ease infrastructure bottlenecks. Economic growth needs to be supported as global demand softens amid trade tensions.He adds that maintaining a credible fiscal consolidation path is essential to anchor investor confidence.DK Srivastava of EY India also talks of fiscal focus. “There would be some further rationalization on customs duty and there may be some reciprocal commodity by commodity decision that the government takes, but the budget will actually ensure that these growth drivers that have helped the Indian economy in FY 26 will continue to operate. The budget will emphasize continued fiscal consolidation and government capex demand to remain stable and supportive so the overall fiscal policy supports growth,” he says.",Budget 2026 assumes significance - how will the modi government insulate the indian economy from the impact of trump’s trade tariffs?

Deadly High-Speed Train Collision in Southern Spain Kills Dozens, Rescue Operations Ongoing

Here's what to know





MADRID: Multiple train crashes this week have rocked Spain and the tragedies have led to questions about safety on the country's railway system.The first crash involved a high-speed train in southern Spain that derailed on Sunday evening, colliding with another fast train, killing at least 43 people and injuring more than 150.The crash was the deadliest in Spain since a 2013 crash that killed 80 people when a commuter train in the northern region of Galicia hurtled off the rails as it came around a bend going too fast.On Tuesday night, another train crash happened in northeastern Spain on a commuter line near Barcelona. One person was killed.Then, on Thursday, a commuter train crashed in southeastern Spain, lightly injuring 6 passengers.Derailment and collision The Sunday derailment happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails and slammed into an oncoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva with around 200 people, according to rail operator Adif.The head of the second train took the brunt of the impact, Transport Minister Oscar Puente said. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track and sent them plummeting down a four-meter (13-foot) slope.The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) south of Madrid.""The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of meters away,"" Andalusia's regional President Juan Manuel Moreno said.Authorities said they had identified almost all the victims from Sunday's crash.Cause under investigation Explanations about what caused the crash were scant, with an official investigation underway.Alvaro Fernandez, the president of national railway company Renfe, told Spanish public radio RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 250 kph (155 mph) and ""human error could be ruled out.""Transport Minister Puente called the crash ""truly strange"" since it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. But Puente said late Monday that officials had found a broken section of track.""Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence (of the derailment),"" Puente told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser.The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, belonged to Renfe.Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and passed its latest safety check on Jan. 15.The Spanish Union of Railway Drivers sent a letter last August asking Spain's rail operator to investigate flaws on high-speed train lines across the country caused by increased traffic.It warned of potholes, bumps and imbalances in overhead power lines, as well as frequent breakdowns and damage to trains, according to a copy of the letter seen by The Associated Press.The union called for a general strike in the coming weeks to demand more safety assurances.High-speed expansion Spain has spent decades investing heavily in high-speed trains. It currently has the largest rail network in Europe for trains traveling more than 250 kph (155 mph), with more than 3,900 kilometers (2,400 miles) of track, according to the International Union of Railways.The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Officials said that Sunday's collision was the first with deaths on Spain's high-speed rail network since it opened its first line in 1992.Commuter line crashes A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing one person and injuring at least 37 others.A commuter train crashed on Thursday in the southeastern Murcia region after it collided with a crane. Emergency services said six people with minor injuries had been transferred to the hospital.While Spain's high-speed rail network generally runs smoothly, commuter rails are plagued by reliability issues. However, crashes causing injury or death are not common.","Multiple train crashes in spain this week have led to questions about safety. The first crash involved a high-speed train that derailed, colliding with another fast train. On tuesday night, another train crash happened in northeastern spain on a commuter line.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Revive Section 80-IBA to Boost Supply

A Budget for Balanced Growth

(Raj Khosla is Managing Director, MyMoneyMantra)

For India’s urban middle class, owning a home remains the single largest financial aspiration—and increasingly, the most elusive one. Despite rising incomes, homeownership in cities is being squeezed by high land prices, escalating construction costs and policy definitions that no longer reflect market realities. As the Budget approaches, the real estate sector—particularly urban housing—needs a pragmatic reset, with the common homebuyer at its centre.The first and most urgent reform lies in revisiting the definition of affordable housing. The current price cap of ₹45 lakh and size limits of 60–90 sq metres may have been relevant a decade ago, but in Tier 1 cities they are now disconnected from reality. Land prices, compliance costs, and material inflation have moved sharply upward, pushing even modest homes well beyond the official affordability threshold.A revised cap of ₹80–90 lakh and a size limit of up to 120 sq metres would better reflect urban market conditions and consumer expectations. For the common man, this isn’t about buying a luxury apartment—it’s about securing a livable, family-sized home within city limits. Updating this definition would immediately expand the universe of homes that qualify for incentives, unlocking both demand and supply in the mid-income segment.Tax incentives remain one of the most effective tools for improving housing affordability. Yet, the current home loan interest deduction under Section 24(b), capped at ₹2 lakh per year, has remained unchanged despite rising property prices and loan sizes.Raising this limit to ₹5 lakh annually would significantly improve the affordability equation for salaried buyers. For a typical middle-income household servicing a large home loan, this change alone could translate into meaningful monthly savings, improving cash flows and confidence to buy.Equally important is the reintroduction of Section 80EEA, which offered additional tax deductions for first-time homebuyers. Many young buyers today fall just outside the affordable housing bracket but still struggle with high EMIs and down payments. A targeted deduction under 80EEA would encourage this cohort to enter the market, converting renters into owners and reviving end-user demand.Housing policy has traditionally focused on economically weaker sections and lower-income groups—and rightly so. However, the middle-income segment increasingly finds itself without support, despite facing intense affordability stress in urban markets.Extending interest subsidies to first-time buyers who fall outside the affordable housing definition could bridge this gap. Even a modest subsidy can reduce EMIs meaningfully over the life of a loan, making ownership viable without distorting prices. From a common man’s perspective, this signals that policy recognises the pressures faced by the urban middle class—not just the extremes of the market.The revamped PMAY-U 2.0 offers an opportunity to restore confidence in government-backed housing initiatives. Expanding the Credit-Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) with higher interest subsidies for low- and middle-income groups would directly reduce borrowing costs and improve affordability.Unlike upfront incentives, interest subsidies work quietly but powerfully over time, easing repayment stress and lowering default risks. For households balancing education, healthcare and retirement savings, this kind of long-term relief can be the difference between buying now and postponing indefinitely.High GST on construction materials and under-construction properties continues to inflate home prices. A calibrated reduction in GST—especially for mid-income and under-construction homes—could meaningfully lower acquisition costs for buyers while improving project viability for developers.For the common man, this would reflect transparently in the final price, not just on paper. Lower GST can also encourage purchases in the under-construction segment, improving developer cash flows and reducing reliance on high-end luxury launches.Finally, supply-side incentives must return to the policy agenda. The withdrawal of the 100% tax holiday under Section 80-IBA has dampened developer interest in affordable and mid-income housing, tilting supply towards luxury projects with higher margins.Reintroducing this tax holiday would encourage developers to re-enter the volume-driven housing space, improving availability and moderating prices over time. A healthier mix of housing supply is essential if the market is to move away from being luxury-led and towards sustainable, inclusive growth.Together, these measures can unlock pent-up demand, improve price-to-income ratios and restore balance to India’s urban housing market. For the common man, this isn’t about chasing speculative gains—it’s about securing a stable home without overleveraging the future.If the Budget can realign housing policy with ground realities, it can revive confidence, stimulate construction-led employment and reaffirm homeownership as an achievable goal for India’s urban middle class—not a distant dream.","For the common man, this isn’t about chasing speculative gains—it’s about securing a stable home without overleveraging the future. Raj khosla: the first and most urgent reform lies in revisiting the definition of affordable housing.

Budget 2026: How FM can simplify TCS to ease cash flow pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-fm-can-simplify-tcs-to-ease-cash-flow-pressure/articleshow/127052518.cms,"Evolution of TCS

TCS in a world of remittances abroad and big spends

Challenges for taxpayers

The balance required

In daily life, most people focus on how much tax they pay, but rarely on when and how it is collected. An increasingly visible part of India's tax ecosystem is tax collected at source (TCS), which requires a portion of tax to be collected upfront on certain transactions. For many taxpayers, the timing of this collection now matters as much as the final tax amount.TCS has existed for nearly four decades, evolving from a narrow anti-evasion measure into a tool for real time tax monitoring. Initially limited to high-risk sectors such as liquor, timber, tendu leaves, scrap and forest produce, it required a small tax collection at the point of sale to create a transaction trail. As the economy expanded and digital reporting improved, TCS was extended to high value purchases such as motor vehicles above Rs 10 lakh and later to foreign remittances and overseas tour packages, bringing everyday taxpayers into its ambit.To widen and deepen the tax net, the scope of TCS was extended in 2020 to include foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS).Individuals usually remit money abroad for education, medical treatment, overseas tours and other purposes such as gifts, donations, etc. TCS on LRS was introduced not as an additional tax but as an advance collection mechanism, adjustable against final tax liability.The Finance Act, 2025 responded to rising education and travel costs by raising the TCS threshold on LRS remittances from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per financial year and removing TCS on loan-funded overseas education. For self-funded education remittances above Rs 10 lakh, TCS now applies at 5%, reinforcing the intent to avoid burdening genuine education expenses.From April 22, 2025, TCS was also extended to select luxury goods such as watches, yachts, sunglasses, shoes and sportswear, reflecting higher spending in this segment. TCS at 1% applies only where the value of a single item exceeds Rs 10 lakh. Thus, a wristwatch priced at Rs 12 lakh attracts TCS, while two watches costing Rs 6 lakh each do not. The tax is collected at the point of sale and can be claimed as credit while filing the income tax return, enabling tracking of high value purchases without denying tax credit.A key concern with TCS is that even individuals with little or no final tax liability must pay it upfront and wait to claim a refund, resulting in blocked funds and cash flow strain.To address this for salaried taxpayers, changes effective Oct 1, 2024 allow TCS paid to be reported to employers through Form 12BAA, enabling adjustment against monthly tax deductions and easing cash flow pressure. Accurate disclosure of the amount, date and purpose of TCS is essential for this mechanism to work.While this relief benefits salary income earners, taxpayers earning non-salary income must still adjust TCS against advance tax or claim refunds at year end. For example, Kaushal, a self-employed consultant, remits Rs 75 lakh abroad under LRS for his child's education. The TCS collected cannot be adjusted immediately, forcing him to wait until return filing to recover a substantial sum.There are ways to improve this experience without compromising the system's intent. Faster refunds and better digital integration between TCS and TDS could ease cash flow pressures. TCS has strengthened India's tax reporting framework and with thoughtful fine-tuning, it can continue to meet its objectives while remaining responsive to taxpayers' needs. A balanced tax system works best when it ensures both transparency and convenience.(Karmakar is tax partner, EY India; Rajesh Sureshan, director at EY India, also contributed to the article.

Top 5 Benefits of Fewer Income Tax Slabs

Will Budget 2026 Bring Fewer Income Tax Slabs?

Taxpayers in India are looking at Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s speech for announcements related to simplification of income tax slabs, returns, compliance and more. India has two personal tax regimes: old and new, with the latter being the default tax regime that the government is pushing people to adopt.The old income tax regime has fewer tax slabs, and offers more deductions and exemptions. On the other hand, the new income tax regime has the benefit of lower tax rates, higher levels of income at which higher tax rates kick in, but very few deductions and exemptions.Tax experts believe that while the new income tax regime reduces the tax outgo for many taxpayers, the multiple slabs add to confusion. They recommend an approach similar to the one used for GST rates rationalization to make the personal tax regime more friendly for taxpayers.Last year, the government slashed the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on several commodities and reduced the tax slabs to broadly two categories - 5% and 18%. Will something similar be announced for the new income tax regime this Budget?The new income tax regime was introduced in Union Budget 2020 and has since then evolved with lower tax rates, progressive tax slabs and higher rebates. Last year, FM Nirmala Sitharaman made income up to Rs 12 lakh tax free - a limit that goes up to Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers with the inclusion of standard deduction benefits.At present the new income tax regime has as many as seven tax slabs - a fact that makes it somewhat confusing for taxpayers. The new tax regime has multiple slabs starting with a nil rate and then moving through 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% across different income levels.The old income tax regime continues, largely unchanged for the last few years, as the government looks to step up adoption of the new income tax regime. Tax experts widely believe that any changes to the tax regime will now be made under the new income tax regime. But, is there a case to reduce the number of income tax slabs?Tax experts surveyed by Times of India Online are broadly of the view that there is a need for more simplification of the income tax slabs and rates, for a more streamlined and compliance friendly regime. While experts acknowledge that an immediate change in tax slabs may not be possible, given limited fiscal room after last year’s big changes and GST rate cuts, they suggest a progressive move towards a simplified personal tax regime.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India explains that two major changes in the recent past, which include the alignment of the GST structure and revamp of the Income-tax Act, show the government’s clear intention to simplify India’s tax framework.Along with the reforms in GST, the introduction of the Income-tax Act 2025 also reflects this commitment to creating a cleaner and more streamlined regime, as it reduces the number of sections from 819 to 536 and cuts the word count nearly by half, from 5.12 lakh to 2.60 lakh, Surabhi Marwah tells TOI.“Extending this philosophy to personal income tax, rationalising the slab structures into fewer and broader slabs would enhance clarity, reduce litigation, and make compliance easier for taxpayers,” she recommends.Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte India feels that there is a strong case for simplifying personal income tax slabs, given the complex multi-rate structure and rising compliance challenges.Why the need? Viswanathan explains that a streamlined 2-3 slab structure, potentially with a single regime and bigger gaps in slabs and rates, could enhance compliance, reduce litigation, and mirror GST's success.Some tax experts cite global benchmarks and examples to advocate for an income tax regime with fewer tax slabs. Others point to multiple slab tax structures in developed countries.Preeti Sharma, Partner – Tax and Regulatory Services at BDO India notes that while the current income tax slabs structure is progressive, many taxpayers still find it complex.“In many countries, personal income tax systems follow a simpler structure with just three or four slabs such as Denmark, Netherlands. India could gradually move in that direction as well. The experience of GST is often cited in this context, where multiple indirect taxes were replaced with a limited number of tax slabs to simplify the system,” she tells TOI.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax at KPMG in India says that simplification of tax regime has been the stated intent of the government when they had first introduced the new optional tax regime almost five years back.“However, considering various other factors (e.g. inflation, job creation, fiscal deficit etc.) this transition may take time. Further for a country like India – the varied income distribution does make a case for multiple slab structures. Also, internationally many developed countries (e.g., US, UK, Germany etc.) have a multiple slab rate structure,” she says.Chander Talreja, Partner at Vialto Partners believes that the 2-3 slab structure for the new tax regime may not be introduced as it already provides simplified tax slabs. “There are 7 income levels with clearly defined applicable tax rates. The rationale of the said slab rates is to ensure lower tax burden for the individual taxpayers unlike the old regime wherein it is just 4 slabs,” he tells TOI.“For example – the effective tax rate applicable for income falling in tax slab Rs 12-16 lakh under the new tax regime is 15% whereas it is 30% under the old regime. Similarly, the effective tax rate applicable for income of Rs 9 lakh under new tax regime is NIL whereas it is 20% under the old regime,” he explains.Tax experts who spoke to Times of India Online were unanimous in saying that the government does not have immediate room to reduce the number, though the road ahead should be in that direction?Radhika Viswanathan of Deloitte India says that to achieve a 2-3 tax slab structure, the market has to be much more mature. “There has to be a bit of parity between the tax collections at the government level and good purchasing power in the hands of the individuals. Given the tweaking done in last year’s budget, such a simplification might be on the cards, but perhaps not immediately,” she says.Richa Sawhney, Partner, Tax at Grant Thornton Bharat admits that the introduction of 2-3 slab structure for personal income tax will surely simplify the personal taxation regime and make tax calculations easier. “It also aligns with the government policy of simplification of taxation laws and easing compliance,” she tells TOI.But Richa Sawhney is of the view that doing that in the immediate future may not be feasible for the government.“With changes in the direct tax provisions last year, which included the changes in slab rates, the government had anticipated a revenue forgone figure of Rs 1 lakh crore. The latest data on revenue shared by the government shows a near‑flat gross non‑corporate tax collection. So significant change may not be forthcoming in this year’s budget,” she tells TOI.Some tax experts suggest that the government may look to eventually transition to a personal income tax regime that has fewer slabs.“The recent budgets have focused on adjusting rates and income thresholds rather than making structural changes. As a result, a full move to a 2–3 slab personal income tax system may not happen immediately, but the government may gradually reduce the tax slabs over a period of time,” Preeti Sharma of BDO says.Tanu Gupta, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP points out that in an exemption-light regime, it is particularly important to maintain progressivity in tax incidence, especially in the Indian context where equity and ability-to-pay considerations are central to tax policy.At the same time, a simplified slab structure—such as a two- or three-slab framework—can significantly improve transparency, ease of understanding, and voluntary compliance, much like the government’s approach in streamlining the GST rate structure recently, she tells TOI.“Accordingly, the government must strike the right balance between simplicity and fairness by combining a streamlined slab structure with a rate design that remains equitable and just. In doing so, it is essential to ensure that taxpayers are not placed in an adverse position, such as paying higher tax on the same income level compared to the previous year,” she concludes.","Tax experts believe that while the new income tax regime reduces the tax outgo for many taxpayers, the multiple slabs add to confusion. They recommend an approach similar to the one used for gst rates rationalization to make the personal tax regime more friendly for taxpayers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126972044,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-352964,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

What is the Union Budget?



Importance



Process of Union Budget



Rituals and traditions



India, one of the world's top five economies, is set to present its Union Budget in Parliament on February 1 under the PM Modi–led government for the 15th time, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presenting it as mandated under Constitution's Article 112.However, February 1 was not always the date for presenting the Union Budget. For decades, it was traditionally presented on February 28. This long-standing ritual was amended in 2017, when the annual Union budget was presented on February 1, from then onwards it was fixed as the official date for its presentation.February 1 will mark the second full annual budget of the Modi 3.0 government. For Sitharaman, it will be her ninth consecutive Budget, making her second only to former finance minister Morarji Desai, who had also briefly served as prime minister.The Union Budget records the government’s accounts and financial transactions for a year, known as the “fiscal year” - a 12-month period used by governments and businesses for financial reporting. In India, the fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31. The Budget lays out the government’s financial blueprint and is prepared by the finance ministry.The Lok Sabha enjoys the privilege of the passage of the Union Budget, as the Constitution gives the directly elected members of the Lower House the first right to its presentation and decisive authority over money matters and Money Bills.The Budget documents are later laid before the Rajya Sabha for discussion. However, the Rajya Sabha does not have the power to vote on or amend Money Bills, including the Budget; it can only discuss them and make recommendations.The meaning of the Union Budget is defined in Article 112 of the Constitution, which states that the President allows the government’s “estimated receipts and expenditure” for the year. This is referred to as the “annual financial statement.”Broadly, the Union Budget is divided into two parts: the Revenue Budget and the Capital Budget.The Revenue Budget shows how much money the government earns and how much it spends. The money earned is called revenue receipts and comes from two sources, tax and non-tax income. Revenue expenditure is the money spent on the daily running of the government and on services for people. If the government spends more than it earns, it is called a revenue deficit.The Capital Budget refers to government’s money received and money spent on long-term purposes. Capital receipts mainly include loans taken from the public, foreign governments, and the RBI. Capital expenditure is the money spent on building roads, machines, buildings, hospitals, schools, and other development work. When the government’s total spending is more than its total income, it is called a fiscal deficit.Union Budget is a key practice of government's functioning in India, an unskippable practice that takes place every year, exceptions are those general elections-bound year, when Union Budget's presentation gets divided in two -- pre-polls the finance minister passes ""Interim Budget"" and then the new government's finance minister passes final union budget. As it was last seen in 2024-2025 budget due to 18th Lok Sabha elections that was scheduled between April to June.The budget has serious implications for the economy. ITt lays out various financial goals that the government looks forward to achieving over a set period.Allocation of Resources - The preparation of the budget ensures the government's choice of how it allocates resources optimally to fulfil various goals and objectives.The very essence of the resources allocations ensures public welfare and economic progress.The budget shows which sectors the government plans to support. The finance ministry-led government's financial draft opens up on the restrictions or leniency for specific industry or sectors. It also serves as a signal for investors, who may choose to invest in industries receiving a government push. Overall, it reflects the direction in which the economy is headed.The budget also reflects on key issues such as direct and indirect taxes. Some of its provisions affect citizens directly in their day-to-day lives, while others have an indirect impact. The Union Budget helps people plan their finances better for the coming year.It decides income tax slabs and rates, along with deductions and the method used to calculate income tax.The entire Union Budget process begins with the President.President's constitutional role - Under Article 87, the President addresses in a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament -- the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha -- at the start of the first session after a general election and at the beginning of the first session every year. This address sets the tone for the government’s agenda.What the President's address says - The speech outlines the Union government’s policies, priorities, achievements, and plans for the year ahead. Although delivered by the President, it is prepared by the Union Cabinet.Motion of thanks - After the address, a “Motion of Thanks” is moved in both Houses. Members debate it and vote on it, formally acknowledging the President’s speech and the government’s roadmap.Where it takes place - With the new Parliament building, this joint sitting continues in the new chamber. The President's role is crucial, as the office stands at the constitutional apex of both the executive and the legislature. The President’s prior recommendation is required for Money Bills, including the Budget, making this step essential to its presentation.Dahi-cheeni (curd and sugar)- Under President Droupadi Murmu , the custom of dahi-cheeni has gained renewed prominence. Finance minister Sitharaman met the President at Rashtrapati Bhavan on several occasions before presenting the Union Budget, where President Murmu offers dahi-cheeni as a cultural symbol of good luck and blessings for a successful Budget presentation.The halwa ceremony - Before documents of budget are printed and officials enter the confidential “lock-in” time period, the finance minister participates in the halwa ceremony..The bahi-khata (ledger) - The colonial-era briefcase seems to be a part of history now, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the tradition of carrying Budget papers in a red, folded cloth called a bahi-khata.","India set to present its union budget in parliament on february 1 under the pm modi–led government. Finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present it as mandated under constitution's article 112. February 1 was not always the date for presenting the union budget.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
