Old Vs New Income Tax Regime: How Much More Tax Are You Saving Over Years?

These charts by EY have been prepared on the following assumptions:

Section 80C deduction (maximum Rs 1.5 lakh) considered under the old tax regime. Other deductions/ exemptions such as medical insurance, home loan interest, house rent allowance are not considered. Standard deduction of Rs 50000 under the old regime and standard deduction as notified from time to time (Nil, Rs 50,000, Rs 75,000) under new regime is considered.

Each year the Budget speech is eagerly watched and listened to by the common man and middle class taxpayers, seeking answer to a simple query: will my tax burden reduce this year? Even finance ministers presenting the Budget are aware of the populist impact of their speech, in case tax relief measures are announced.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. Will tax slab and tax rate changes be introduced? Sitharaman, who will present her ninth budget, is also the FM who introduced the new income tax regime back in 2020.The choice between the old and the new income tax regime is an important one and every year, taxpayers carefully calculate the tax liability under each before deciding on which one to opt for.Over the years, the new income tax regime has seen several changes, and the tax liability under it has progressively come down at various salary levels, and it has become increasingly more attractive compared to the old regime.In her Budget speech in 2020, FM Nirmala Sitharaman explained the rationale for the introduction of a new income tax regime: the need for simpler compliance.“...The Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and deductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and administration of the Income Tax Act by the tax authorities a burdensome process. It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Income-tax law without taking help from professionals,” she said.Hence, a new and simplified income tax regime was introduced to provide “significant relief” to individual taxpayers. The idea was for a tax regime that offers reduced rates for taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and exemptions.The biggest takeaway was that the 30% tax slab under the new regime kicked in at an income above Rs 15 lakh compared to Rs 10 lakh under the old tax regime.At that time individuals under both regimes earning income up to Rs 5 lakh did not have to pay tax with the benefit of Section 87A.FM Sitharaman explained the gains: In the new tax regime, substantial tax benefit will accrue to a taxpayer depending upon exemptions and deductions claimed by him. For example, a person earning Rs 15 lakh in a year and not availing any deductions etc. will pay only Rs 1,95,000 as compared to Rs 2,73,000 in the old regime. Thus his tax burden shall be reduced by 78,000 in the new regime. He would still be the gainer in the new regime even if he was taking deduction of Rs 1.5 Lakh under various sections of Chapter- VI-A of the Income Tax Act under the old regime.Over the years, the government has introduced substantial changes under the new income tax regime - introduction of standard deduction benefits, higher standard deduction limit of Rs 75,000, evolving tax slabs and tax rates.In the Union Budget 2023, tax slabs under the new regime were further tweaked to:Importantly the following big changes were introduced:In the interim budget of 2024, the standard deduction under the new regime was raised to Rs 75,000.Last year, FM Sitharaman’s Budget brought sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, making it even more attractive for taxpayers. With higher rebate, tax outgo on income up to Rs 12 lakh was reduced to ZERO!Explaining the journey, Sitharaman said, “Right after 2014, the ‘Nil tax’ slab was raised to Rs 2.5 lakh, which was further raised to Rs 5 lakh in 2019 and to Rs 7 lakh in 2023. This is reflective of our government's trust on the middle-class tax payers. I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable up to income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.”Income tax slabs under the new regime saw big changes, with the 30% tax slab now kicking in for incomes above Rs 24 lakh, as against Rs 15 lakh earlier.One noteworthy point is that in all these years since the introduction of the new income tax regime, the old tax regime with higher deductions and exemptions but also higher tax rates continues to function, though without any changes. The intent of the government is clear: with the new tax regime made the default regime, and all changes and benefits of lower taxes, taxpayers are being urged to shift to it.But, how much is the tax benefit under the new tax regime compared to the old regime? The tax outgo has changed in the last 5 years, and at various income levels, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down substantially compared to the old tax regime.For a better understanding, we take a look at how tax outgo has changed over the last five years at various income levels of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 20 lakh, and Rs 40 lakh.If for an income level of Rs 10 lakh, you had to pay Rs 75,400 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 78,000 in FY21 to Rs 54,600 in FY24, Rs 44,200 in FY25 to NIL in FY26! It continues to be Rs 75,400 under the old regime.Similarly, if for an income level of Rs 20 lakh, you had to pay Rs 366,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 351,000 in FY21 to Rs 296,400 in FY24, Rs 278,200 in FY25 to Rs 192,400 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 174,200!The impact is also visible at higher income levels. If for an income level of Rs 40 lakh, you had to pay Rs 990,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 975,000 in FY21 to Rs 920,400 in FY24, Rs 902,200 in FY25 to Rs 787,800 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 202,800!The above charts are broadly indicative, and the tax outgo will depend on your income level, the amount of deductions and exemptions you claim. For an income of over Rs 12 lakh, and above a certain amount of deductions and exemptions, the old regime may be more suitable at various salary levels.Hence, while the above examples offer a clear picture on how the tax benefits have increased over years under the new regime, it is important to calculate the total amount of deductions and exemptions you avail for a better understanding.As an example, at the current tax slabs in the old and new regime, if you have a gross income of more than Rs 24.75 lakh, then the old regime makes sense only if your total deductions and exemptions are over Rs 8 lakh.This level of deductions and exemptions is for the 30% tax slab. It will vary for incomes below Rs 24 lakh.Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India tells TOI, “Over the past few years, the new tax regime has clearly boosted the take‑home pay of most salaried taxpayers due to the rising basic exemption limits and reduced slab rates. In FY 2020-21, for an income of Rs 10 lakh, the tax liability under the new tax regime was slightly higher compared to the old tax regime. However, over the subsequent five years (FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26), the reforms have reversed this picture, resulting in savings of Rs 75,400 in FY 2025-26 under the new tax regime as compared to the old tax regime. ”""For an income of Rs 20 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, the savings in FY 2025-26 are approximately Rs 1.74 lakh and Rs 2.02 lakh respectively as compared to the old tax regime. Now, if we compare savings under the new tax regime over the six-year period (FY 2020-21 to FY 2025-26), savings have risen significantly — around Rs 78,000 at an income of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 1.58 lakh at Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1.87 lakh at Rs 40 lakh. With substantial taxpayers going ahead with the default/new tax regime, further slab adjustments in Budget 2026 could accelerate this trend,” he adds.While a certain percentage of taxpayers continue to benefit from the old tax regime, for example those who claim high levels of House Rent Allowance, or those who have a home loan, over 70% of tax returns filed for AY 2024-25 were under the new regime. Tax experts expect more taxpayers to switch to the new income tax regime in the ongoing financial year, with the Rs 12 lakh zero tax level prompting many to shift.However, experts note that the government may look to introduce some popular deductions and exemptions such as Section 80C and home loan interest benefits to incentivise savings and housing.",Finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present the union budget on february 1. She introduced the new income tax regime back in 2020. The biggest takeaway was that the 30% tax slab under the new regime kicked in at an income above rs 15 lakh compared to rs 10 lakh under the old tax regime.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127475885,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-113754,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Tax Simplification

(Kuldip Kumar is Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP)

As the Union Budget approaches, expectations of major tax giveaways appear muted. However, this Budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the Government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform amid a challenging economic environment.The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive US trade agreement, geopolitical tensions, and continued foreign institutional investor outflows are likely to influence policy decisions. Measures announced in this year’s Budget are therefore expected to align closely with the Government’s broader economic and reform framework.Accordingly, incentivising businesses particularly export-oriented sectors and accelerating employment generation are likely to receive focused attention in this Budget.Last year’s Budget delivered meaningful tax relief through revisions in personal income-tax slabs and enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, leaving limited headroom for further concessions.These changes were introduced under the new tax regime, while the old tax regime was left unchanged.This approach was intended to encourage taxpayers still following the old regime to transition to the simpler new tax system.For FY 2023–24, nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime, and this proportion is expected to increase further in the current year.Does this mean the old tax regime could be phased out entirely? Perhaps not immediately, especially since the new tax regime has also been incorporated into the Income Tax Act, 2025.However, given the continued instances of misuse and claims of incorrect deductions under the old regime, it would not be surprising if the Government eventually considers doing away with it altogether.In the 2024 Budget, the Government made significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including revisions to holding periods and tax rates, with the objective of simplification. While some asset classes benefited, tax rates on listed securities both short-term and long-term and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), were increased.Given the growing participation of retail investors in Indian capital markets, there is a case for reviewing these measures. While challenging from a revenue perspective, the Government could consider moderating capital gains tax rates on listed securities or enhancing the basic exemption limit for long-term capital gains, currently set at ₹1.25 lakh. Further, permitting set-off of long-term capital losses against short-term capital gains in Budget 2026 would improve tax equity and align treatment of capital assets.Fiscal Discipline Remains an Important ConsiderationThe Government is expected to adhere firmly to its fiscal consolidation path, leaving limited scope for aggressive fiscal expansion. That said, carefully calibrated policy measures particularly those aimed at stimulating consumption and job creation could strengthen growth momentum and improve tax buoyancy. As with most fiscal initiatives, the benefits of such measures are likely to become visible only after a time lag.Tax simplification remains an ongoing journey. While significant progress has been achieved through digitisation and pre-filled data, several pain points persist:Clubbing provisions continue to complicate joint ownership of assets between spouses, despite the sound financial logic behind such arrangements. Introducing an option for joint tax filing, as practiced in countries like the United States, could significantly ease compliance.Notional taxation on vacant properties is often perceived as inequitable and warrants reconsideration.TDS and TCS mechanisms, though effective for tracking transactions, frequently result in excessive deductions and cash-flow strain for taxpayers, especially where final tax liability is substantially lower.Pre-filled tax returns could be further expanded, particularly for salaried taxpayers without business income, reducing manual intervention and errors.Despite the delegation of appellate powers to Joint Commissioners, a substantial backlog of tax appeals continues to persist. Introducing clearly defined timelines and enhancing accountability would help restore taxpayer confidence.Similarly, the practice of adjusting refunds against disputed demands often for several years requires urgent reform.Refunds granted in favour of taxpayers should be released automatically, without the need for repeated follow-ups or grievances.Trust as the Cornerstone of ComplianceRecent initiatives where tax authorities proactively alert taxpayers to potential mismatches mark a positive shift towards a trust-based compliance framework. The Government has already introduced the Taxpayers’ Charter; effective enforcement of its principles on the ground would benefit both sides in improving compliance for the Government while offering peace of mind to the taxpayers.While Budget 2026 may not be about headline-grabbing tax cuts, it is likely to outline how the Government intends to navigate uncertainty, sustain growth, reinforce fiscal discipline, and deepen structural reforms.In that sense, this Budget may prove to be less about immediate relief and more about building long-term economic resilience.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations appear muted.

What to know about the multiple train crashes in Spain this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/what-to-know-about-the-multiple-train-crashes-in-spain-this-week/articleshow/127161659.cms,"Spain train crash

Deadly High-Speed Train Collision in Southern Spain Kills Dozens, Rescue Operations Ongoing

Here's what to know





MADRID: Multiple train crashes this week have rocked Spain and the tragedies have led to questions about safety on the country's railway system.The first crash involved a high-speed train in southern Spain that derailed on Sunday evening, colliding with another fast train, killing at least 43 people and injuring more than 150.The crash was the deadliest in Spain since a 2013 crash that killed 80 people when a commuter train in the northern region of Galicia hurtled off the rails as it came around a bend going too fast.On Tuesday night, another train crash happened in northeastern Spain on a commuter line near Barcelona. One person was killed.Then, on Thursday, a commuter train crashed in southeastern Spain, lightly injuring 6 passengers.Derailment and collision The Sunday derailment happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails and slammed into an oncoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva with around 200 people, according to rail operator Adif.The head of the second train took the brunt of the impact, Transport Minister Oscar Puente said. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track and sent them plummeting down a four-meter (13-foot) slope.The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) south of Madrid.""The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of meters away,"" Andalusia's regional President Juan Manuel Moreno said.Authorities said they had identified almost all the victims from Sunday's crash.Cause under investigation Explanations about what caused the crash were scant, with an official investigation underway.Alvaro Fernandez, the president of national railway company Renfe, told Spanish public radio RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 250 kph (155 mph) and ""human error could be ruled out.""Transport Minister Puente called the crash ""truly strange"" since it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. But Puente said late Monday that officials had found a broken section of track.""Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence (of the derailment),"" Puente told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser.The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, belonged to Renfe.Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and passed its latest safety check on Jan. 15.The Spanish Union of Railway Drivers sent a letter last August asking Spain's rail operator to investigate flaws on high-speed train lines across the country caused by increased traffic.It warned of potholes, bumps and imbalances in overhead power lines, as well as frequent breakdowns and damage to trains, according to a copy of the letter seen by The Associated Press.The union called for a general strike in the coming weeks to demand more safety assurances.High-speed expansion Spain has spent decades investing heavily in high-speed trains. It currently has the largest rail network in Europe for trains traveling more than 250 kph (155 mph), with more than 3,900 kilometers (2,400 miles) of track, according to the International Union of Railways.The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Officials said that Sunday's collision was the first with deaths on Spain's high-speed rail network since it opened its first line in 1992.Commuter line crashes A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing one person and injuring at least 37 others.A commuter train crashed on Thursday in the southeastern Murcia region after it collided with a crane. Emergency services said six people with minor injuries had been transferred to the hospital.While Spain's high-speed rail network generally runs smoothly, commuter rails are plagued by reliability issues. However, crashes causing injury or death are not common.","Multiple train crashes in spain this week have led to questions about safety.

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Bring sale of AIF units at par with sale of shares.

Government as venture debt provider.

Invest wisely in deep tech:

For taxation:

a) Introduce taxation at household level.

b) Widen India’s tax net.

(Devendra Agrawal, Founder, Dexter Capital Advisors, a boutique investment bank)

The recent Supreme Court judgement that has gone against Tiger Global may dampen the confidence of any global investor because anything that’s agreed in the past is open for interpretation. And while that may lead to short-term benefit of recovering the taxes from one investor, in the long run it might have a negative impact on the larger investor community. They may feel the country may not be trusted with the laws laid by the previous governments. The budget should provide clarity or simplify the laws, especially for global investors.Ideally, the government should unleash private capital for startups. The recent SEBI regulations for angel investing have increased the accreditation. Earlier, any individual/HUFs/Family Trusts/Sole proprietorships with net worth greater than Rs 2 crore (excluding the value of their primary residence) could be angel investors. Now, the net worth has to be equal or greater than Rs 7.5 cr, out of which at least Rs 3.75 cr is in the form of financial assets (excluding the value of their primary residence).If someone keeps PPP (purchasing power parity) in mind, it is ridiculously high and removes a number of people from the purview of investing.The government should definitely make a uniform policy for accredited investors but with fewer norms. And before angel investors, I think, the government should look at F&Os as they are even riskier and more speculative. Angel investing drives capital formation.When any investor invests in any Alternate Investment Fund (AIF), the investor gets units of AIF. Now, often these investments are illiquid and AIF units can't be easily transferred. If an investor gets a willing buyer to transfer the AIF unit, another challenge is that AIF units are valued on Fair Market Value (FMV).In comparison, when underlined securities like shares in a company are sold, the transaction does not need to be at FMV, as long as they are sold above book value.So, there's a disparity between sale of IAF units vs sale of shares of underlying companies held by these AIFs.Doing away this disparity can bring selling of AIF units at par with selling shares and would increase liquidity in a situation where an investor in AIF wants to sell AIF units.This would definitely bring more liquidity, increase participation of investors in alternate investment funds.This is completely as per the tax laws of the country. It's just that the finance ministry has not taken this into consideration in record.The government recently approved Rs 5,000 crore in equity support for the SIDBI to help expand credit flow to the MSME sector. The government invests in startups at a 6% rate with secured assets. To help more startups raise capital from the government and for the government to benefit from it, the government may consider investing at an increased rate – 8% – but without a secured asset as long as the startup is certified and thoroughly evaluated.This could help in bringing down India’s very high venture debt, at 13-18%. The government could provide, say, a tech-driven company which has built a prototype, an 8% yield and can have a warrant structure. So that such a portfolio asset has mortality. Those warrants will yield a much higher rate of return even if a small percentage, like less than 10% of these companies, become wildly successful. So, the government could become a de facto venture debt provider or a collateral-free loan provider.The government recently built a Rs 1 lakh crore fund for deep tech without having a very clear definition of deep tech. This amount is slightly on the higher side in terms of deep tech. The government could probably allocate a certain portion of this fund towards deep tech and the remaining fund could be allocated towards other avenues as well.We should applaud the Finance Minister and the government for two big releases. First, for rationalizing taxes to INR 12 lakh for the common man. Second, the GST reform. However, there are two recommendations that I would like to make:India follows an individual-focused income tax system, where each person’s annual income is evaluated and then taxed.Introducing taxation at household level will give assesses the scope for rationalizing/reducing their tax burden. Assesses should have the option of filing their returns as a household or as an individual.If the cumulative income of a household is lesser than a particular threshold, then taxation should be lesser. For example, if a household consisting of a married couple--where both husband and wife are earning—has a cumulative income of Rs 30 lakh then the tax rate could be 20% and not the current 30%.The idea behind household-level taxation is that the family’s ability to pay depends on the shared expenses, not just individual income. This concept could definitely be explored and introduced.Less than 4% of the population pays income tax in India. This increases the tax burden on the salaried class, middle class. In comparison, ~60% of households in the US pay federal income tax and ~10-14% of the Chinese working population pays income tax. The government and other stakeholders should find a way to bring more working people under the tax bracket to reduce the overall tax burden on the salaried class. I feel one way to do this could be to incentivize high tax payers by publicly recognizing and rewarding them.","The recent supreme court judgement that has gone against tiger global may dampen the confidence of any global investor.

1. Rationalise

TDS on Bond Interest Income

(Coupon)

2. Introduce a Fair and Predictable Tax Regime for Bond Interest

3. Create a Uniform Distribution Framework for Bonds

4. Flattening of the Government Bond yield curve

(Vishal Goenka is Co‑Founder, IndiaBonds)

As India aspires to build a resilient, diversified, and globally competitive financial system, the role of a deep and vibrant bond market cannot be overstated. This is also evident in NITI Aayog’s recent report on ‘Deepening the Corporate Bond Market’ which sets the policy roadmap for next 5 years. Fixed income is not just a portfolio stabiliser for households; it is also the backbone of long‑term capital formation for India’s growth ambitions.Over the past few years, SEBI’s regulatory reforms such as the introduction of Online Bond Platform Providers (OBPPs), electronic bidding platforms, ₹10,000 min. face value for bonds, and improved disclosure standards have laid a strong foundation. However, to truly democratise bond investing and meaningfully increase retail participation, the Union Budget 2026 presents an important opportunity to address a few structural bottlenecks for Indian investors.The introduction of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on bond interest income in Union Budget 2023 has unintentionally added friction for retail investors. While the intent was to improve tax compliance, the outcome has been increased complexity in return calculations (XIRR) and cash‑flow mismatches for investors. There was no TDS on interest from listed corporate bonds from 2008 to 2023.Unlike fixed deposits, bond investments often involve secondary market trades, accrued interest adjustments, and varying holding periods.The application of TDS in such cases makes it harder for investors to assess their actual post‑tax returns and increases the operational burden of reconciliation while filing their ITR or writing to companies directly for deductions due via 15G/15H forms.Removing TDS on bond interest income would simplify the investment process, improve transparency in yield computation, and encourage investors without compromising tax collection, as interest income would continue to be fully taxable at the time of filing returns.Currently, interest earned from bonds is taxed at the investor’s applicable slab rate, unlike equities where a clear distinction exists between short‑term and long‑term capital gains with concessional tax rates. In fact, tax on interest from bond investments at slab rate may be even higher than those paid on debt mutual funds at flat 20% This creates an uneven playing field and could discourage long‑term participation in corporate bonds.For many retail investors earning annual returns in the range of 7–12%, slab‑rate taxation significantly erodes post‑tax outcomes, making bonds appear less attractive despite their lower volatility and capital preservation characteristics.A simplified and predictable tax framework—such as a flat tax rate of around 20% on bond interest income would bring parity across asset classes. This would encourage households to allocate more savings to bonds, support long‑term investing behaviour, and help channel domestic capital into India’s growing economy.While mutual funds, equities and insurance products operate under well‑defined, standardised distribution frameworks, bond distribution in India remains fragmented across multiple participant types and channels. This lack of uniformity limits scalability, restricts investor trust, and creates uncertainty for intermediaries.A clear, regulator‑approved distribution framework for corporate bonds—similar to the Authorised Person (AP) structure in equities and AMFI Registration Numbers (ARNs) in mutual funds—can help enforce fit‑and‑proper criteria, define roles and accountability, and standardise disclosure and suitability practices across the industry.For effective transmission of rate cuts by RBI into the economy, flattening of the government bond yield curve is essential. Post RBI rate cuts last year of 125 bps, the 10y bond has barely moved 20bps lower and in fact yields on 15y bonds have moved higher. A lot of this is due to technical supply and deteriorating sentiment due to a weakening rupee. Achievement around fiscal deficit numbers and the government’s future borrowing program would bring the confidence in markets on the longer end of the bond curve and bring yields down. Financial prudence will be closely watched at the budget to encourage the bond market.Union Budget 2026 has the opportunity to send a strong signal: that bonds are not just institutional instruments, but a core part of India’s household investment landscape. Enabling this shift will be critical as India moves towards its next phase of economic growth – Viksit Bharat 2047.","Currently, interest earned from bonds is taxed at the investor’s applicable slab rate, unlike equities where a clear distinction exists.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

The directions of the Supreme Court in the judgment are under examination,"" minister of state for labour & employment Rameswar Teli said in a written reply to Rajya Sabha.Teli was replying to a question on whether the government is aware about the Supreme Court verdict of November 4 on EPF pension scheme and by when it will implement the verdict and instruct the EPFO (Employees Provident Fund Organisation) to take actions for giving higher pension.In another written reply, Teli said the court judgement has legal, financial, actuarial and logistical implications.The scheme has provided for an extension of four months' time for eligible employees to opt for enhanced pension.The apex court order provides that employees who were existing EPS-95 members as on September 1, 2014 can contribute up to 8.33 per cent of their actual salaries, as against 8.33 per cent of the pensionable salary capped at Rs 15,000 a month, towards pension.It had also struck down the requirement in the 2014 amendments mandating employer contribution of 1.16 per cent of the salary exceeding Rs 15,000 per month.This will facilitate the subscribers to contribute higher to the scheme and get enhanced benefits accordingly.There are more than six crore subscribers of the retirement fund body. A large number of contributing members of the pension scheme would benefit from opting for contribution on wages higher than threshold of Rs 15,000 per month.The minster also said EPFO has a corpus of Rs 18,64,136 crore. This amount consists of Rs 11,37,096.72 crore in Employees' Provident Fund Scheme, 1952; Rs 6,89,210.72 crore in Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995 and Rs 37,828.56 crore in Employees' Deposit-Linked Insurance Scheme, 1976, as on March 31, 2022.","Rameswar teli says the directions of the supreme court in the judgment are under examination.

GAAR exemption to boost

tax certainty

Relief from transfer pricing disputes

Removing TDS on payments to IFSC units

With global banks, broker-dealers and capital markets players weighing India as an offshore financial base, Deloitte has urged the government to use Budget 2026 to have parity rulesa among players, remove tax asymmetries and compliance frictions that are limiting the scale-up of IFSC GIFT City as a full-service international BFSI hub.According to Deloitte, the International Financial Services Centre at GIFT City has emerged as a focal point of India’s economic ambitions in banking, capital markets, insurance and allied financial services. The International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) is tasked with developing IFSCs into diversified, globally competitive hubs that serve both India and the wider regional financial ecosystem.Deloitte said this objective rests on building a pro-business environment supported by a progressive regulatory framework, advanced technology and infrastructure, and a strong pool of skilled financial professionals.“To further enhance IFSC GIFT City’s stature as a premier international financial services hub, certain tax and regulatory refinements may be considered in the Budget,” said Vijay Mani, Partner and Banking & Capital Markets Leader, Deloitte India.One of the key recommendations is to grant broker-dealers and finance companies operating from IFSC GIFT City the same tax treatment as International Banking Units (IBUs) set up by foreign banks.While the IFSCA already permits IBUs and SEBI-registered FPIs operating from GIFT City to issue Offshore Derivative Instruments (ODIs) and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives with Indian underlying securities, the income-tax law currently provides broader exemptions to IBUs than to non-bank entities.Although the Income-tax Act was amended in 2025 to exempt non-resident investors from tax on income earned from ODIs and OTCs issued by non-bank entities from GIFT City, Deloitte noted that capital gains exemptions remain restricted to the investment divisions of IBUs of foreign banks.“The Income-tax law does not confer a similar tax treatment to broker-dealers and finance companies that operate from IFSC GIFT City,” Deloitte said, recommending that such entities be treated on par with IBUs for capital gains tax exemptions. This, it said, would help bring offshore access products markets onshore to India.Deloitte has also sought exemption from the applicability of India’s General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) for IFSC units and transactions involving them.Citing the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan 5 on harmful tax practices, Deloitte noted that IFSC units are already required to demonstrate significant economic substance, including physical offices, employees and regulated operations under IFSCA oversight.“In this context, and to provide tax certainty while attracting more businesses to IFSC–GIFT City, an exemption from the applicability of Indian GAAR provisions should be granted,” Deloitte said, covering both IFSC units and arrangements entered into with them.Another major concern flagged relates to section 92C(4) of the Income-tax Act, which denies IFSC units the benefit of the 100 percent income-tax holiday under section 80LA on income enhanced through transfer pricing adjustments.Deloitte warned that this provision could lead to unnecessary litigation and undermine global confidence in the tax certainty offered to IFSC units.“This creates an impression that even if an IFSC unit is entitled to a 100 percent income-tax holiday, it may still be required to pay taxes in India due to transfer pricing adjustments,” said Russell Gaitonde, Partner, Deloitte India. He added that exempting IFSC units from section 92C(4) would strengthen India’s credibility as a financial hub.Deloitte has also recommended removing tax deduction at source (TDS) on all payments made to IFSC units that are eligible for the 10-year, 100 percent tax deduction under section 80LA.While a CBDT notification issued in March 2024 already provides TDS exemption for certain specified payments, Deloitte said extending this relief to all payments would significantly reduce compliance burdens and improve ease of doing business.“Considering that the income of IFSC units is not taxable, all payments made to units in IFSC on which section 80LA deduction is available should be exempted from TDS,” Deloitte said, adding that reporting safeguards could continue to ensure regulatory oversight.The recommendation is also relevant for foreign banks operating IBUs in GIFT City, regardless of whether they have obtained nil withholding tax orders under section 195(3).Deloitte said these measures, if incorporated in Budget 2026, would enhance tax certainty, attract global financial institutions and help IFSC GIFT City emerge as a competitive alternative to established offshore financial centres.","Deloitte has urged the government to use budget 2026 to have parity rulesa among players.

Income tax relief still on taxpayers’ wishlist

Customs reform and ease of doing business

Fiscal consolidation, defence and development push

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her ninth consecutive Union Budget on February 1, with expectations centred on tax reforms, a revamp of the customs duty structure and measures to support economic growth amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty.The Budget is also expected to outline a clear roadmap for lowering India’s debt-to-GDP ratio, marking a shift in fiscal strategy from deficit management to debt reduction.After last year’s major relief, including the hike in the income tax exemption limit to Rs 12 lakh and GST rate cuts, individual taxpayers are hoping for further easing, particularly through an increase in the standard deduction.With the new and simplified Income Tax Act, 2025, coming into force from April 1, the industry is also seeking clarity on transition provisions, rules and FAQs to ensure smoother implementation, as per news agency PTI.There is also an expectation that the government may announce incentives, such as a higher standard deduction, to encourage more taxpayers to shift to the new tax regime, which offers lower rates but fewer exemptions. Rationalisation of TDS categories into fewer slabs is another key demand.A major focus area is likely to be the overhaul of the customs duty regime, on the lines of GST rationalisation.This could include fewer duty rates, procedural simplification and a possible amnesty scheme to unlock nearly Rs 1.53 lakh crore stuck in disputes.The Budget is expected to spell out steps to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio starting 2026-27, alongside higher defence spending in view of rising global tensions.Other expectations include provisions for the 8th Pay Commission, increased devolution of taxes to states as per the 16th Finance Commission, and higher allocations for MSMEs and tariff-sensitive sectors such as gems and jewellery, garments and leather.Funding for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earths, and outlays for Viksit Bharat employment and livelihood schemes are also high on the wishlist.","Nirmala sitharaman is set to present her ninth consecutive union budget on february 1.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
