"I-T department flags crypto risks, opposes entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-t-department-flags-crypto-risks-opposes-entry/articleshow/126402100.cms,"NEW DELHI: The income tax department on Wednesday flagged major risks associated with virtual digital assets (VDA), such as cryptocurrency , joining the Reserve Bank of India in opposing the entry of these instruments.In a presentation to the parliamentary standing committee of finance, the tax authorities flagged as to how anonymous, borderless and near-instant value transfer made it possible to move funds through a system without regulated financial intermediaries, a person familiar with the discussions told TOI.Besides, offshore exchanges, private wallets and decentralised platforms made it very difficult for the authorities to detect taxable income and also made the holdings opaque since the beneficial owners were not easily known.Jurisdictional limitations with offshore VDA activity were also flagged as multiple jurisdictions may be involved, with little ability to check flows, making verification and recovery of tax dues virtually impossible. Although there have been efforts in recent months on sharing of information, it remains difficult, inhibiting the ability of tax officials to undertake proper assessment and reconstruction of transaction chains.India is among a group of countries which have so far been reluctant to allow cryptocurrency and stablecoin despite intense lobbying and pressure from some govts. Earlier, on multiple occasions, RBI had flagged its concerns, including the lack of any underlying asset making it a risky bet for investors, and even enforcement agencies are wary especially due to VDAs being instruments that can be used for money laundering and terror financing.The tax department said that since crypto platforms operate overseas, enforcement action may be tough, including issuing summons, or TDS collection. Many of the exchanges are also unregistered with the Financial Intelligence Unit and are outside the ambit of the tax department.Indian tax authorities have sought to build in safeguards, including TDS, to track beneficiaries and have also mandated registration of entities dealing in crypto and other VDAs.","In a presentation to the parliamentary standing committee of finance, the tax authorities flagged as to how anonymous, borderless and near-instant value transfer made it possible to move funds.

Why reform is required

For a country that prides itself on a thriving middle class, India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. Over the past few years, a series of amendments—presented as “rationalisations”—have quietly created a minefield for salaried employees who believed they were doing the right thing by saving for their future.Three provisions stand out for the burden they impose: taxation of employer contributions to provident and superannuation funds beyond ₹7.5 lakh; yearly taxation of accretions on such excess contributions; and taxation of interest earned on the employee’s own PF contributions above ₹2.5 lakh. In isolation each may appear technical. Together, they are reshaping retirement planning in ways that leave employees with little clarity, greater financial anxiety, and a rising tax bill on income they do not even receive today.The first shock for employees came with the Finance Act, 2020, which capped employer contributions to recognised PF, approved superannuation funds and NPS at ₹7.5 lakh per year. Anything above that—common for senior professionals, mid-level employees in high-cost cities, and those in organisations with generous retirement policies—became taxable as a perquisite.But what stings more is that annual accretion—interest, dividend or similar growth—on this “excess contribution” is also taxed. This is a tax on notional income, long before the employee sees a rupee of it.Many describe this as an upfront penalty on saving. Unlike bonuses or cash payments, retirement contributions are locked in for the long term. Yet tax is now collected today on money that may only be received decades later. That mismatch betweenandhas become a major pain point.When exemption isn’t really exemptionThe hardship intensifies when the National Pension System comes into play. While the government justified taxing excess employer contributions by calling PF, superannuation and NPS an “EEE regime”, the law doesn’t fully support that claim.Under Section 10(12A), up to 60% of the NPS corpus can be withdrawn tax-free upon closure of the account or opting out of NPS. The remaining 40% must be used to purchase an annuity plan from a life insurance company, and the pension received from this annuity is fully taxable. Employees therefore argue that the premise of an entirely exempt regime is not accurate.The Finance Act, 2021 introduced another hit: PF interest earned on the employee’s own contribution beyond ₹2.5 lakh per year is taxable.For many mid-career employees, PF is the only disciplined savings instrument they rely on. A high PF contribution isn’t a luxury; it is a way to secure the future in the absence of universal social security.Yet the law now characterises high contributions—even when mandatory or part of salary structure—as an attempt to “enjoy full exemption”. The sting is sharper for those whose basic salary is high enough that the statutory 12% PF contribution itself may cross the ₹2.5 lakh threshold, triggering tax on interest even when the employee never intended to “over-contribute”. This change is seen as especially harsh in a country where inflation erodes purchasing power and pension adequacy is already a concern.“Also, these changes all appear to be part of the ultimate aim of the government to do away with all deductions and exemptions and make the ‘new tax regime’ the only regime available for all taxpayers,” says Ameet Patel, partner, Manohar Chowdhry & Associates.Across these provisions, a consistent theme emerges:India now taxes retirement savings more aggressively. Employees who save diligently, especially mid- to senior-level workers, face:The result is that long-term savings face multiple tax points.There is growing consensus across industry bodies that these provisions need urgent review. The argument is not about giving employees a windfall—it is about ensuring fairness and a safety net. With an ageing population, lack of a universal social security system applicable to all citizens, and rising cost of living, the existing provisions are detrimental . India’s salaried class feels squeezed—not because they don’t want to pay taxes, but because the system increasingly treats retirement savings as a luxury rather than a necessity. What was once a predictable, trusted savings pathway is now layered with caps, tax triggers, and compliance complications.“And this compounds the problems that the ageing population faces when insurance companies either refuse to issue new health policies to senior citizens or charge such high premia on the policies that having a Mediclaim policy becomes extremely expensive for such retired persons. As and when such a person needs large amounts to be paid to hospitals for medical treatments, the depleted savings are often inadequate and the entire family is put under huge financial stress,” concludes Patel.",India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. A series of amendments have quietly created a minefield for salaried employees who believed they were doing the right thing by saving for their future.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126356780,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-44462,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The latest GDP numbers at current prices will provide cheer to the Centre’s budget team as it works out the final set of numbers for the current fiscal year.Although the nominal GDP growth was estimated at 8%, slower than the 10.1% assumed at the time of presenting the budget, the latest data released by the National Statistics Office on Wednesday estimated full year GDP at Rs 3,57,13,886 crore, marginally higher than the Centre’s projection of Rs 3,56,97,923 crore.The Centre had budgeted for a fiscal deficit of Rs 5,23,846 crore, or 4.4% of GDP. Based on the NSO’s first advance estimate, it will be marginally lower, provided govt is able to stick to its receipts and expenditure projections.While the tax revenue growth has been weak, there is support from higher dividend transfer by RBI to govt. Moreover, in the fiscal year so far, govt has gone slow on revenue expenditure, while strongly pushing capital expenditure.What complicates matters is the slower growth in nominal GDP due to low inflation that will have a bearing on taxes.“While the tax revenue growth has been weak, there is support from higher dividend transfer by RBI to govt. Moreover, in the fiscal year so far, govt has gone slow on revenue expenditure, even while strongly pushing the capital expenditure,” added Rajni Sinha, chief economist at CareEdge.In the last budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced direct tax cuts and yet budgeted to stick to the deficit reduction plan.But the move to reduce GST rates on 375 items is expected to impact collections, both for the Centre and the states.Sitharaman has, however, stuck to her deficit targets in the post-Covid period, giving analysts hope that this year’s revised estimates will be no different.“Nominal growth, on the other hand, will be softer at 8% this fiscal compared with 9.8% in fiscal 2025. The gap between real and nominal GDP growth estimates, at 0.6 percentage point, is at its lowest level in the 2011-12 series.

But, is investment in SCSS sufficient for retirees? How do other investment options like bank fixed deposits, small savings schemes, mutual funds compare on a return and taxation basis? We break it down for you:

Senior Citizens Savings Schemes (SCSS): Eligibility, Investment Limits, Taxation - Top Points

The Senior Citizens Savings Scheme is open to resident Indians - any individual who is 60 years and above at the time of opening the account.

In special cases, individuals aged 55 years or above but below 60 years may also open an SCSS account if they have retired on superannuation or otherwise. However, this can be done when the SCSS account is opened within three months of receiving their retirement benefits.

Retired members of the defence services, excluding civilian defence staff, are also permitted to open an account on attaining the age of 50 years, subject to compliance with the prescribed conditions.

Also, the spouse of a government employee who attained the age of 50 years and died in harness may open an account under this scheme.

A joint SCSS can also be opened but in this case the entire deposit is treated as belonging solely to the first account holder.

For an SCSS account, the minimum account opening balance is Rs 1,000. The total investment account across all accounts cannot exceed Rs 30 lakh. Both spouses can open individual accounts or joint accounts with one another, subject to a maximum deposit of Rs 30 lakh per account, provided that they both meet the eligibility criteria independently.

SCSS accounts lock in the money for a period of 5 years and can be prematurely closed subject to certain conditions.

Senior Citizens Savings Scheme Scheme - Top Points

In case any amount above the maximum limit is deposited, it is refunded and the interest on such an excess amount is payable only at the Post Office Savings Account rate for the period from the date of excess deposit until the date of refund.

Investments made under the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme are eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 - which means that individuals filing their tax return under the old tax regime can avail this tax benefit.

Tax is deducted at source (TDS) if the total interest earned across all accounts, including SCSS, exceeds the prescribed threshold during a financial year, unless Form 15G or Form 15H is submitted, as applicable.

An account holder may extend the SCSS account for additional blocks of three years, any number of times. The extension must be requested within one year from the date of maturity or from the end of each three-year extension period, using the prescribed form at the concerned post office.

The extended account earns interest at the rate applicable on the date of original maturity or the date of extended maturity, as the case may be. If the account is closed before one year from the date of extension, a deduction of 1 percent of the deposit is made.

The extension is considered effective from the original maturity date, regardless of when the application is submitted.

Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS): Is it a good investment bet?

How does SCSS compare to bank FDs for senior citizens?

SCSS offers a fixed 8.2% annual interest rate as compared to bank FDs which are currently offering interest rates in the range of 6 to 7.25 % depending on the bank. Both have fully taxable interest but SCSS principal of up to Rs 1.5 lakh qualifies for Section 80C deduction, unlike most FDs (only 5-year tax-saver FDs qualify). SCSS proves to be better on a post tax basis because of its higher interest rate.

SCSS vs other investment options & the right portfolio mix

Post office monthly Savings Scheme: Provides fixed monthly interest income at 7.4% per year with a fixed 5 year tenure. There is no tax benefit for this scheme Bank FDs : Generally, banks and NBFCs offer an additional interest rate of 0.50% over the normal fixed deposit rates. The tenure is flexible as investment can be done from 7 days to 10 years duration. Mutual funds: For senior citizens, who focus on capital safety, low-equity options such as Debt Funds and Conservative Hybrid Funds are generally more suitable.

How SCSS compares to other options

Is SCSS sufficient for retirement needs?

Senior Citizens Savings Scheme or SCSS is a popular Post Office investment and savings scheme for senior citizens and retired individuals. The government-backed scheme is seen as a guaranteed cushion for regular interest income flow, especially for individuals who are looking for high interest rates but low risk options.SCSS accounts help earn interest payments on a quarterly basis and with the investment limit doubled to Rs 30 lakh from Rs 15 lakh a few years ago, Senior Citizens Savings Scheme continues to attract substantial flows.The interest on your SCSS account is calculated and paid on a quarterly basis from the date of deposit, for the quarters ending on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December.According to the rules, the interest amount is credited to the SCSS depositor’s savings account on 1 April, 1 July, 1 October, and 1 January, respectively.Account holders may opt for automatic credit of interest to their savings account or through the ECS facility.Any interest not claimed in a quarter does not earn further interest.At the current interest rate of 8.2%, if a senior citizen were to invest the maximum limit of Rs 30 lakh, the quarterly interest earnings would stand at Rs 61,500, which is Rs 2.46 lakh in a year.Over a period of 5 years, the total interest earnings on the Rs 30 lakh investment will stand at Rs 12,30,000/-Experts are of the view that the guaranteed returns and an interest rate higher than most investment products makes SCSS an essential part of a senior citizen’s investment portfolio.Mohit Gang, Co-founder and CEO of Moneyfront explains that SCSS being a government-backed scheme works in its favour. “The scheme is currently offering 8.2% interest, which is higher than fixed deposit interest rates from all the banks,” he notes.“SCSS offers a regular income to senior citizens in the form of quarterly interest payouts on deposits up to Rs 30 lakh for a 5-year lock-in which is extendable by another 3 years. The deposit amount can also be claimed as a deduction under Section 80C,” he tells TOI listing the advantages of the scheme.Rohit Shah, Certified Financial Planner & Founder of Getting You Rich points out that the interest rate for SCSS is among the highest in government-backed small savings. It also typically beats senior-citizen bank fixed deposits on safety‑adjusted return, he says.“The appeal is clear: sovereign guarantee, quarterly interest for regular income, capital protection, and Section 80C benefit on investment up to Rs 1.5 lakh. For risk‑averse retirees who want predictable cash flows, it is a strong core product,” Rohit Shah tells TOI.When SCSS is compared with bank fixed deposits on a post-tax basis, the picture becomes interesting. While both instruments generate interest income that is fully taxable as per the investor's income tax slab, SCSS has a clear edge with its 8.2% rate compared to typical bank FD rates of around 7-7.5% for seniors.“More importantly, SCSS offers rate certainty. So once you lock in the 8.2%, it stays fixed for the entire 5-year tenure, regardless of future rate movements,” says Dev Ashish, SEBI Registered Investment Advisor and founder of StableInvestor.com.Mohit Gang of Moneyfront also notes that SCSS proves to be better than bank fixed deposits on a post-tax, inflation-adjusted return basis for senior citizens in India, primarily due to its higher interest rate and tax deduction benefits.Senior‑citizen bank FDs generally offer around 6.5–7%. Some NBFC and corporate FDs may match or exceed SCSS’s 8.2%, but they come with higher credit and liquidity risk, which many retirees should avoid, says Rohit Shah.“Thanks to its rate advantage of roughly 100 bps over most bank FDs, SCSS will typically deliver superior post‑tax income for the same risk level. However, adjusted for inflation, both SCSS and FDs still struggle to fully keep pace with real‑life inflation, especially in healthcare and services,” he adds.According to Dev Ashish, there is one practical reality that often gets overlooked. Most retirees don't have substantial income sources beyond their investments.Consider a senior citizen couple parking Rs 60 lakh in SCSS (Rs 30 lakh each). At 8.2%, this generates Rs 4.92 lakh in annual interest income.Even if we add another Rs 3-4 lakh from other sources, their total income typically stays well below Rs 8-9 lakh annually.Under the new income tax regime with its Rs 12 lakh tax-free threshold (via enhanced standard deduction and Section 87A rebate for income up to Rs 12 lakh), many retired couples will end up paying zero income tax on their investment income. This dramatically improves the post-tax returns from SCSS, he says.“So while we discuss taxation of interest income, the ground reality is that for a large section of middle-class retirees without pension or rental income, the effective tax impact on SCSS returns is often negligible. This makes the 8.2% rate even more attractive - you're essentially getting the full gross return as your net return. This is a significant advantage that shouldn't be underestimated when comparing SCSS with other investment options where capital gains are taxed irrespective of the quantum of gains,” he adds.So, what are the alternatives to SCSS, how do they compare on a post-tax basis and what should be the right portfolio mix for senior citizens? Experts are of the view that SCSS is a very good investment option, others can be made use of for portfolio diversification.Mohit Gang elaborates:Rohit Shah lists some of the alternatives worth considering:•⁠ ⁠Government of India/RBI floating‑rate savings bonds (7‑year, floating coupon).•⁠ ⁠NSC (National Savings Certificates), with attractive compounded rates but lower liquidity.•⁠ ⁠Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS), which offers monthly payouts at slightly lower yields.“NSC can marginally outperform SCSS on returns but locks in money for longer and does not provide quarterly income. POMIS is useful for steady income but generally yields less than SCSS,” he says.According to Dev Ashish, the real question isn't just whether SCSS is good in isolation, but rather it's about understanding where it fits in a senior citizen's overall retirement portfolio, which not only needs to cater to their income needs but also keep an eye on moderate growth to ensure portfolio longevity in line with retirees’ life expectancy.He says that for someone worried about longevity risk and running out of money, parking a portfolio in annuities can also provide peace of mind, even if rates aren't the highest.“While SCSS, in my view, is an excellent debt option - safe, high-yielding, and tax-efficient, it is still advisable not to treat it as the entire portfolio and rather a core part of the fixed-income (debt) side of the portfolio. It's best to combine it with liquidity buffers and modest equity exposure for sustainable retirement, beat long-term inflation and preserve purchasing power,” Dev Ashish tells TOI.The approach he advocates is a bucketing strategy:The first bucket (typically 60-70% of the retirement corpus) should comprise debt instruments like SCSS, POMIS, PPF, debt funds, and annuities. This bucket generates regular income for day-to-day expenses. SCSS fits perfectly here as a core holding.But the second bucket is equally critical. This is the growth bucket where equity allocation (20-30% for most retirees) should be invested in well-diversified equity funds. Why? Because without equity exposure, your portfolio will struggle to beat inflation over a 20-30 year retirement period. The goal isn't to chase returns but to ensure you don't run out of money before running out of years.Mohit Gang is of the view that SCSS can serve as a core part of retirement but not as a standalone component in the portfolio because of limitations such as Rs 30 lakh individual limit, fully taxable interest and no equity-linked growth.He recommends an asset mix of 30% in SCSS + 30% in debt mutual funds + 20% in hybrid mutual funds + 20% Equity Funds.Rohit Shah also says that SCSS should be a core component, not the only one. “A sensible 60+ retirement portfolio should blend SCSS with other fixed‑income options (quality FDs, bonds, annuities) and a calibrated exposure to growth assets such as equity or conservative hybrid funds,” he tells TOI.The exact allocation must depend on each retiree’s risk profile, health, other income sources and legacy goals. The key is simple: use SCSS for stability and income, and complement it with carefully chosen products that offer liquidity and long‑term inflation protection, he advises.Bottom line - SCSS is a great investment product for senior citizens, but it is by no means sufficient and must be supplemented with other avenues.",The senior citizens savings scheme is open to resident indians. The total investment account across all accounts cannot exceed rs 30 lakh. Scss offers a fixed 8.2% annual interest rate as compared to bank fds which are currently offering interest rates in the range of 6 to 7.25 % depending on the bank.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126392936,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50270,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the central excise act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from rs 2,050 to rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is likely to present the Union Budget 2026 on February 1, which falls on Sunday, marking a significant milestone as she delivers her ninth consecutive Budget. This will be the second full Budget of the Modi 3.0 government, following the first full Budget presented in 2025.Notably, Budget used to presented on February 28 until 2017, when the modi government decided to shift the date to 1st of the month, to ensure quicker implementation.The Budget is expected to focus on sustaining economic momentum while offering relief to the middle class, which continues to grapple with high taxes, elevated living costs, and tightening household finances.With Budget 2026, Sitharaman moves closer to the all-time record of 10 Union Budgets presented by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai. Having already presented eight consecutive Budgets, including the interim Budget in February 2024, she will now become the only finance minister to have delivered nine consecutive Budgets under a single prime minister.So, here's a breakdown of India's history with regards to budgetIndia’s first Union Budget after Independence was presented on November 26, 1947, by the country’s first finance minister, R.K.Shanmukham Chetty.For decades, the Budget was presented at 5 pm on the last working day of February, a colonial-era practice that aligned announcements with UK working hours. India’s time zone, our hours and 30 minutes ahead of British Summer Time, ensured the Budget reached London during business hours.In 1999, then finance minister Yashwant Sinha, under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government, moved the Budget presentation to 11 am, a convention that continues today.In 2017, the government advanced the Budget date from February 28 to February 1 to enable faster Parliamentary approval and ensure implementation from the start of the financial year on April 1. Earlier, procedural delays often pushed implementation to May or June.Before becoming Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh served as finance minister under Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao and presented five consecutive Budgets between 1991 and 1995. His 1991 Budget remains historic for ushering in India’s economic liberalisation.Nirmala Sitharaman holds the record for the longest Budget speech. Her February 1, 2020 address lasted 2 hours and 40 minutes, before she concluded with two pages still unread.The shortest Budget speech was delivered by Hirubhai Mulljibhai Patel in 1977, when his interim Budget speech ran to just 800 words.","India’s first union budget after independence was presented on november 26, 1947.

Return Filing: An archaic requirement

Challenges relating to furnishing a

Tax Residency Certificate

Recommendations:

A threshold limit for seeking the TRC would help ease this burden.

Or allow non-resident taxpayers to submit TRCs from previous years (for example, the past one or two years) along with Form 10F.

Alternatively allow submission of documents other than TRC to substantiate residency of a particular country.

Challenges relating to online furnishing of Form 10F

Recommendation:

Offline furnishing of Form 10F should be permitted, as was allowed earlier.

Practical Pain Points

India’s economic footprint extends far beyond its borders. Millions of Indians living abroad continue to hold property, investments, and financial interests back home. Foreign nationals and global investors, too, increasingly engage with Indian businesses. Yet, for all the cross-border activity, India’s tax system still places a disproportionately heavy compliance burden on those who qualify as non-residents under tax law.As Budget 2026 approaches, industry bodies, tax experts, and non-resident taxpayers are urging the government to rationalize the rules. Their central message is simple: when income is minimal, passive, or already subject to tax deducted at source (TDS), compliance should be simple and easy.At present, non-resident individuals must file an Indian tax return if their total income exceeds Rs. 2.5 lakh — even when every rupee of that income has already suffered TDS and there is no additional tax liability arising in India. This includes small interest earnings, or dividend income.Tax experts point out that this leads to return filings with no additional tax payable, clogging the system and adding cost and effort for taxpayers who may have no other financial connection to India.Recommendation: Perhaps Budget 2026 provisions could provide some leeway and exemption in filing a tax return, if no tax is required to be paid and the non-resident has no business income in India.A non-resident taxpayer can claim the benefit of a tax treaty, which often provides a lower tax rate — for instance, on dividend income from shares held in India. Under section 90(2) of the Income-tax Act, the provisions that are more favourable to the taxpayer prevail. Thus, if the treaty prescribes a lower rate than domestic law, the treaty rate applies.However, section 90(4) requires the taxpayer to furnish a Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) in order to access treaty benefits, regardless of the nature or quantum of income. When the amounts involved are very small, the requirement to obtain a TRC can create unnecessary hardship for both the non-resident recipient and the resident payer, as the process involves time and cost.Mahesh Nayak, tax partner at CNK & Associates points to several other challenges. “In addition, non-resident taxpayers must currently file Form 10F electronically on the e-filing portal to claim tax treaty relief. They are also required to provide a TRC from foreign tax authorities covering the entire financial year to establish residency in the other country. In practice, many foreign tax authorities do not issue TRCs certifying future residency. Further, in certain jurisdictions, obtaining a TRC involves incurring a significant cost to the individual taxpayer and hence, asking for multiple TRCs for recurring payments becomes a costly affair, he says.Nayak points out that submission of documents other than TRC to substantiate the tax residency of a particular jurisdiction (country) should be permitted. The objective of a TRC is only to determine that the taxpayer is a resident of a particular country and therefore, if one can substantiate the tax residency through some other document, it should suffice, as held by Tribunals. “For example, in the US, a citizen is considered as a tax resident. Therefore, in such a situation, if one can provide a copy of the passport, clearly demonstrating US citizenship, that should suffice the eligibility of the taxpayer to claim the benefit of the India – US tax treaty. Copies of the passport can also be used to help determine the number of days stay in a particular jurisdiction, which can help determine tax residency in jurisdictions which determine tax residency based on number of days stay in that particular year,” he explains.If the TRC provided by the tax authorities of the relevant jurisdiction does not contain all the information as required under the Indian tax rules, the non-resident is required to provide the said details in a declaration in Form 10F, which is to be furnished electronically.“There are practical challenges for a non-resident taxpayer, who does not have a PAN in India, to furnish Form 10F as at times, the OTP is not sent to the foreign mobile number of the taxpayer. This creates an unnecessary hassle for a mere filing of a declaration along with the TRC,” states Nayak.Non-residents must maintain a bank account in India to pay taxes and to receive tax refunds, even when they reside abroad and hold no other Indian assets. The final step in income-tax return filing — e-verification — is linked to Indian bank accounts, Aadhaar-linked mobile numbers, or certain digital signatures. Non-residents without Indian mobile numbers often struggle to complete filings within the stipulated deadline.Budget 2026 provides the perfect moment to modernize India’s approach — and to acknowledge that, for millions of global Indians and foreign nationals, “ease of compliance” is a reality.","At present, non-resident individuals must file an indian tax return if their total income exceeds rs. 2.5 lakh.

1. Re-introducing tax incentives for the self-employed under the new tax regime can provide a much-needed nudge towards retirement planning.

2.

Formalising retirement savings for gig and platform workers through mandatory contributions deserves priority.

3.

Revisiting the ₹7.5 lakh cap on tax-exempt employer contributions can materially improve retirement adequacy for salaried employees.

4.

Making NPS tie-up mandatory for private sector employers can significantly expand coverage.

5.

Enabling interoperability between EPF and NPS would provide flexibility and empower individual choice.

As India aspires to become a developed economy by 2047, one of the most critical yet under-discussed pillars is retirement security. Despite rapid financialisation of household savings, India’s pension assets stand at only about 14% of GDP, significantly lower than comparable economies. The upcoming Union Budget offers an opportunity to accelerate India’s journey towards becoming a ‘pensioned society’ by strengthening and widening the National Pension System (NPS).Nearly 58% of India’s workforce is self-employed, as per the Economic Survey 2024-25. Unlike salaried employees—who benefit from EPF, corporate NPS and superannuation—the self-employed largely remain outside formal retirement systems. Section 80CCD(1B), which allowed an additional deduction of ₹50,000 for NPS contributions, acted as a strong behavioural trigger for this segment under the old tax regime. Its absence in the new tax regime has diluted that incentive.Re-introducing 80CCD(1B) under the new regime, with a higher limit of up to ₹1.2 lakh annually, would encourage early participation in retirement savings.Global experience shows that upfront tax incentives play a decisive role in driving adoption of long-term products like pensions. Over time, this would reduce old-age dependency and fiscal pressures on the State.India’s gig workforce—estimated at nearly 1 crore today and projected to reach 2.35 crore by 2029-30 —represents a fast-growing but vulnerable segment. While the Code on Social Security, 2020 recognises gig and platform workers and provides for insurance and health benefits, structured retirement savings remain absent.A modest mandatory contribution of 2–3% by digital platforms into NPS can meaningfully address this gap. Given the nature of gig work, voluntary retirement savings often take a back seat to immediate income needs. A default, system-driven contribution mechanism would help these workers build a long-term corpus without affecting their day-to-day liquidity. This step would also align well with the Government’s broader inclusion and social security agenda.Currently, the combined employer contribution to EPF, superannuation and NPS is capped at ₹7.5 lakh per annum. In practice, a significant portion of this limit is consumed by EPF and superannuation, leaving limited headroom for NPS contributions - even though NPS allows up to 14% of basic salary as employer contribution. As a result, senior management and key decision-makers often find NPS less attractive, which in turn affects adoption across organisations.Removing NPS from this overall cap—or creating a separate sub-limit for NPS—would enhance retirement replacement rates, potentially increasing them to around 65% when combined with other retirement instruments. This would also encourage leadership within corporates to actively champion NPS adoption.While EPF is mandatory, NPS remains optional, despite its low cost, transparency and market-linked returns. Today, only about 21,000 corporates offer employer NPS, compared to nearly 8 lakh establishments registered with EPFO. Making NPS tie-up mandatory for companies above a certain workforce threshold - say, 100 employees - would substantially widen coverage among private sector employees. A blended approach combining EPF, superannuation and NPS can meaningfully enhance long-term retirement outcomes, while still preserving choice and diversification.India’s workforce is young, mobile and increasingly financially aware. While EPF offers fixed returns and capital protection, NPS provides market-linked growth, low costs and the flexibility to customize asset allocation based on age and risk appetite. Although policy intent to allow tax-neutral transfers from recognised provident funds to NPS was articulated earlier, operational enablement - especially for EPF - remains incomplete.Allowing seamless, tax-neutral transfers between EPF and NPS would give employees the freedom to design retirement solutions aligned to their life stage and financial goals, while also channelising long-term savings into productive capital formation.The Union Budget has a unique opportunity to place retirement security firmly at the center of India’s economic agenda. Targeted tax incentives, inclusion of emerging workforce segments, rationalisation of contribution limits, and greater system flexibility can collectively deepen NPS adoption. These measures would not only strengthen household financial resilience but also support long-term capital formation-creating a virtuous cycle for both citizens and the economy.",The union budget has a unique opportunity to place retirement security firmly at the center of india’s economic agenda.

Ensuring Retirement Products Compete on Merit

Encouraging Long-Term Wealth Building Through Parity

Enhancing Affordability of Social and Rural Insurance through Stamp Duty Reforms

(Tarun Chugh is Managing Director and CEO, Bajaj Life Insurance)

As India charts its economic course for the coming year, the insurance sector remains a key pillar in household financial planning and risk mitigation. Recent regulatory efforts and initiatives have supported sectoral growth, yet broad measures of insurance engagement show there is still significant ground to cover. According to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s annual report, India’s overall insurance penetration stood at 3.7 percent of GDP in FY24, with life insurance coverage at 2.8 percent. This level remains below the global average of over 7 percent. As per a PwC India report on insurance inclusion, in rural India, where around 65 percent of the population resides, less than 10 percent of people have life insurance coverage.These insights serve as a reminder that despite progress, access to financial protection is still limited for large sections of the population. With this context, the upcoming Budget offers an opportunity to strengthen policy support. My recommendations below aim to enhance customer outcomes, improve long term savings participation, and support national goals of financial inclusion and resilience.India’s pension ecosystem continues to face a significant coverage gap.While the National Pension System and other formal pension schemes continue to expand, India's formal pension coverage remains below 25% of the workforce according to the Mercer-CFA Institute Global Pension Index 2025. The report ranks the country 45th out of 47 nations for pension adequacy. Life insurance annuity products and the National Pension System both aim to support retirement income, yet their tax treatment differs considerably.Insurance annuity payouts are taxed on the full amount, including the principal that has already been taxed during the earning years. NPS subscribers, on the other hand, receive additional deductions for self-contribution and employer contribution. This difference in treatment often influences consumer decisions more than product suitability.A more aligned and tax efficient framework across financial products, for example taxing only the returns on annuity payouts and extending comparable deductions to insurance annuity pension products, would allow individuals to choose based on their long term needs rather than tax benefits. Such alignment would encourage more Indians to build structured retirement plans.Over the last few years, high-value traditional insurance policies have received different treatment. For example, for all policies whose annual aggregate premium is higher than Rs. 5 lakh, the maturity proceeds are now taxed at regular income tax rates. These policies, which provide significant life cover in addition to disciplined wealth accumulation, started to be considered less attractive when compared to other alternatives of investment.Meanwhile, high-value Unit Linked insurance policies, whose annual aggregate premium is higher than Rs. 2.5 lakh premium get long-term capital gains treatment, usually more generous and tax efficient. Therefore, introducing similar tax treatment of capital gain on high-value traditional insurance policies as well and bringing both to the same tax treatment would create consistency, simplify the tax code, and encourage more people-particularly business owners, double-income families, and senior professionals to combine protection with savings.As insurance companies strive to meet rural coverage requirements, affordability becomes crucial. Even modest transaction costs such as stamp duty can influence pricing for low ticket products. Exempting rural and social sector policies from stamp duty, similar to the exemption already provided under PMJJBY, would help improve affordability and support deeper penetration.Life insurance can play an important role in shaping India’s long-term financial resilience. While the sector has made progress in expanding access and adapting to changing customer needs, data shows that penetration and coverage gaps persist. Thoughtful policy changes in the upcoming budget can support a more efficient, equitable, and inclusive insurance ecosystem.In the end, financial security should not remain a privilege of a few but be strengthened as a shared foundation for every household.","India’s pension ecosystem continues to face a significant coverage gap.

Budget 2026: Introduction of optional joint taxation for married couples can be a game changer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-introduction-of-optional-joint-taxation-for-married-couples-can-be-a-game-changer/articleshow/126155653.cms,"ICAI proposes that married couples be given the option to file a single, joint return. (AI image)

What is the proposal about?

Why ICAI recommends joint taxation

It simplifies tax compliance and household filing. Joint filing could reduce paperwork and make it easier for couples to manage their tax affairs together.

It could relieve tax burden for many households — especially those with a single earning member. Under joint taxation, the exemption thresholds and effective liability could be more favourable.

It aligns India with global practices. Many countries – such as the US and some European countries (such as Germany, Spain, Portugal) allow joint filing or joint assessment for married couples.

How joint taxation might work (proposed model)

Tax slabs (for joint filers) might be restructured. For example, one proposed model sets no tax up to ₹6 lakh (for the couple), 5% for ₹6–14 lakh, and ascending slabs for higher income.

Standard deductions (for salaried earners), exemptions and surcharge thresholds may be adjusted — e.g. increased surcharge threshold, separate standard deductions for both spouses if salaried.

The option to choose — i.e., couples could opt to file jointly only if it benefits them; otherwise, they’d continue filing individually, retaining flexibility.

What needs careful design — and possible concerns

System-level overhaul required: Current tax filing, TDS/TCS, PAN-based tracking systems are designed for individuals. Joint filing may require re-designing data architecture, reconciliations, challans, and return-processing.

Current tax filing, TDS/TCS, PAN-based tracking systems are designed for individuals. Joint filing may require re-designing data architecture, reconciliations, challans, and return-processing. Risk of revenue leakage or misuse: If exemption limits and deductions are doubled or significantly enhanced for couples, there could be a potential for tax avoidance through income-shifting, especially in households with skewed income distribution.

If exemption limits and deductions are doubled or significantly enhanced for couples, there could be a potential for tax avoidance through income-shifting, especially in households with skewed income distribution. Complexity with deductions & exemptions: Handling categories like house-property income, home-loan interest, investments under 80C, medical insurance deduction, etc., for two individuals in one return would require clear guidelines — especially because current laws treat individuals separately.

Handling categories like house-property income, home-loan interest, investments under 80C, medical insurance deduction, etc., for two individuals in one return would require clear guidelines — especially because current laws treat individuals separately. Fairness to dual-income couples: For couples where both work, joint taxation may not offer much advantage — or could even increase tax liability if their combined income pushes them into higher slabs. The optional nature would allow couples to choose the regime that’s most beneficial.

What could this mean for Indian households — a few scenarios

Household type



Possible benefits under joint taxation



Single-earner couple (spouse unemployed / homemaker)



Lower tax liability — combined exemption could reduce tax burden; simpler ITR filing and compliance.



Dual-earner couple with modest incomes



Could benefit from higher basic exemption + standard deductions; might still pay less than two separate returns depending on slab thresholds.



High-income dual-earner couple



Possibly limited benefit: combined income might push into higher slab — need careful evaluation.



Families with children, home-loan, medical expenses



Joint filing could allow better optimization of deductions (standard deduction, 80C, 80D, housing benefit) if structured well.





Why this proposal matters — beyond tax savings

It recognises a household as a unit — acknowledging that many expenses (household, children, assets) are shared, so taxing couples as a unit can make tax treatment more equitable.

It simplifies tax compliance — fewer returns to file, less paperwork, consolidated records, which is especially beneficial for small earners or nuclear families.

It aligns India with global practices — many economies allow joint filing, and this could modernise India’s tax code for contemporary family structures.

It could increase compliance and reduce evasion — by discouraging income splitting and spreading income artificially across family members to reduce taxes.

Conclusion

Pre-budget suggestions are pouring in, in the North Block. As the government gears up to present the 2026 budget, one proposal stands out for its potential impact on millions of households: optional joint taxation for married couples. It has been suggested by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and if adopted by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), it could mark a significant shift in how personal income tax is structured — and how families plan their finances.Currently, under the Indian tax system, every individual — married or not — is taxed separately. Each spouse must file their own income tax return, even if they have shared income or joint expensesICAI proposes that married couples be given the option to file a single, joint return — combining their incomes and deductions — instead of two separate ones. In other words: a married couple could choose what makes financial sense for them each year — file individually, or jointly.According to ICAI’s submission:The couple would file a single consolidated Income tax return (ITR) under the joint-filing option.The idea is attractive, but implementing joint taxation in India isn’t just a technical tweak. There are challenges to consider:The proposal for optional joint taxation of married couples — as submitted by ICAI in its pre-Budget 2026-27 memorandum — represents a potential paradigm shift in India’s personal tax framework.It seeks not just to ease compliance, but to recognise households (not just individuals) as fundamental economic units.For many Indian families — especially those with a single earner, homemaker spouse, children, home-loan or shared expenses — this could translate into lighter tax burden, improved financial well-being, and simpler tax compliance. On the policy side, it could bring India a step closer to global practices and make the tax system more equitable, transparent, and modern.","Icai proposes that married couples be given the option to file a single, joint return.

By Parizad Sirwalla

Budget 2025 income tax: In the run up to the Budget 2025, individual taxpayers were eagerly looking forward to favorable tax reforms. The FM seems to have brought some cheer to them through her proposals.Recognizing the contributions of the middle class and with an objective to eventually phase out the old tax regime, various changes have been introduced in the new tax regime. The basic exemption limit has been increased from INR 3 lakhs to INR 4 lakhs. In a significant shift, the highest slab is increased from INR 15 lakhs to 24 lakhs. The other slabs and tax rates have been realigned and a new tax rate of 25% has been included. Income threshold for rebate under 87A available to resident taxpayers has been increased from INR 7 lakhs to INR 12 lakhs. For computing this threshold, special rate income (such as capital gains, lottery winnings etc.) has been specifically excluded, to also address certain ambiguities in the earlier interpretation.With these changes, all the taxpayers in the new tax regime have some reason to celebrate, irrespective of income levels.As an illustration, a person with income up to 12 lakhs can now enjoy annual tax savings of INR 80,000 (excluding cess). At the same time, an individual with income of 18 lakhs has a tax savings upto INR 110,000 (excluding cess). The savings would be higher for income levels where surcharge is applicable.Few amendments have been made with a view to simplify certain provisions. Earlier, in case of vacant properties, annual income could be considered as NIL for up to two self-occupied properties (SOP). While there is no change in above, to qualify as SOP, currently there is a condition that the taxpayer should not be able to reside therein due to his business or employment or profession and that taxpayer is staying in a premises not owned by him. This condition has now been done away with.NPS Vatsalya Scheme launched in September 2024, enabled parents and guardians to start a NPS for their minor children, which on attaining majority, would be transferred to the child's name with the accumulated corpus. As a welcome measure, the Budget has extended the deduction of INR 50,000 under section 80CCD (available in the old tax regime) to also include contributions towards this scheme. Further, it has been specified that partial withdrawals up to 25 per cent from the scheme, allowed for specified reasons, shall not be taxable.Currently, a deduction is allowed to an individual for any amount deposited in the National Saving Scheme (NSS), prior to 1 April 1992. Any withdrawals from the scheme are held as taxable. As a notification dated 29 August 2024 specified that the balances would not earn interest, this made the depositors keen to withdraw the NSS balance. Based on various representations received, the FM has now exempted the withdrawals done post 29 August 2024, for which deduction was allowed earlier, to provide them the much-required relief.Striking a balance between fiscal prudence and the theme of “Trust first, Scrutinize later”, the Government has enhanced timelines for filing updated returns by two more years by paying additional taxes of 60 and 70 percent respectively.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
