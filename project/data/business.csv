NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways has told the Central Information Commission (CIC) that the classification and methodology of fixing fares of different classes in passenger train falls in the domain of ""trade secret/intellectual property rights"", and therefore, cannot be disclosed under the Right to Information Act.This was disclosed while the CIC dismissed an application seeking detailed information on the base fare calculation mechanism for train tickets, including dynamic pricing and the impact of Tatkal bookings, with specific reference to Paschim Superfast Express.The online application filed on Jan 25, 2024, had asked railways to specify the components, parameters, dynamic pricing mechanisms, seasonal variations or other relevant factors influencing base fare calculation for tickets.In its reply, the central public information officer (CPIO) of the Railway Board stated that fares were charged based on class and the difference of fares in various classes was based on facilities provided. ""In so far as classification and methodology of fare fixation of different classes is concerned, the policy mechanism falls in the domain of trade secret/intellectual property rights and, as such its disclosure is not considered appropriate in public interest,"" the CPIO stated.The CPIO said that such information need not be shared under terms of Section 8(i)(d) of the RTl Act and added that this position had been upheld and reiterated by the Central Information Commission (CIC) in earlier orders.Section 8 of the RTI Act lists exemptions for information that does not have to be disclosed, protecting sensitive data like national security, trade secrets and personal privacy.""It is a known fact that the Indian Railways are run as a commercial utility and at the same time it being an instrumentality of state are required to discharge various social obligations in national interest,"" the railways said.The commission noted that the public information officer had already provided all disclosable information and general principles of railway rating policies, and was not required to create or interpret data beyond available records.Finding no infirmity in the reply and noting the appellant's absence during the hearing, information commissioner Swagat Das said no further intervention was required and disposed of the appeal.","The indian railways has told the central information commission that the classification and methodology of fixing fares of different classes in passenger train falls in the domain of ""trade secret/intellectual property rights"" the cic dismissed an application seeking detailed information on the base fare calculation mechanism for train tickets.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126536138,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-794308,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Budget 2026: Will tax provisions ease for crypto assets?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-will-tax-provisions-ease-for-crypto-assets/articleshow/126525033.cms,"Losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.

Key concerns flagged:

Use of offshore exchanges, private wallets, and decentralised platforms complicates enforcement and obscures transaction trails, hindering accurate tax assessment and recovery.

:

Allowing set-off of losses between different VDAs, even if not against other income

Providing statutory guidance on the situs of VDAs, especially for non-residents

Reviewing the impact of 1% TDS on market liquidity

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has raised fresh concerns about the risks posed by virtual digital assets (VDAs) such as cryptocurrencies, aligning its stance with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The tax department’s warning presented recently to a Parliamentary Standing Committee of Finance underscores regulatory agencies' growing scepticism about cryptocurrencies fit within India’s financial and taxation framework. It highlights revenue risks, enforcement gaps and potential misuse for evasion or illicit finance.The tax regime in India, for VDAs can be considered as one of the most stringent in the world.The Finance Act, 2022, ushered in a bespoke tax regime for VDAs by inserting section 115-BBH into the Income-tax Act, 1961 (I-T Act). Income from the transfer of VDAs is taxed at a flat 30%, plus surcharge and cess, regardless of the holding period. The law allows only the cost of acquisition as a deduction, barring transaction fees, exchange charges or other expenses.More critically, losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.Losses also cannot be carried forward. A parallel provision mandates 1% tax deduction at source (TDS) on transfers beyond specified thresholds, further tightening liquidity. To illustrate: For a salaried individual, a 1% TDS is applicable on transfer of the VDAs if the transaction amount exceeds ­10,000.Various associations have in their pre budget submissions, argued that disallowing set-off of losses between VDAs is economically distortive and ultimately counterproductive for tax revenues.The argument is simple: when losses are ring-fenced, but gains are fully taxed, risk-taking is penalised asymmetrically. This has reportedly contributed to trading volumes migrating offshore, exchanges shifting operations overseas and Indian investors being pushed into cross-border structures that raise FEMA and compliance complexities.The result is a tax structure that treats crypto trading far more harshly than equities, real estate or even speculative assets, despite its growing mainstream adoption.While section 115-BBH of the I-T Act, applies equally to residents and non-residents, tax provisions are not clear on a crucial issue: where is a VDA located? For non-residents, taxability hinges on whether income accrues or arises in India (the provisions of sections 5 and 9 of the I-T Act and the relevant tax treaty provisions come into play).Unlike shares or immovable property, VDAs lack a clearly identifiable physical or legal location. In the absence of legislative clarity on the situs of crypto assets, non-resident taxation risks becoming a fertile ground for disputes particularly where trading occurs on global exchanges, assets are held in offshore wallets and sale proceeds are received outside India.Experts point out that clarity is essential to avoid avoidable litigation. Jurisdictions such as the UK offer guidance by linking the situs of crypto assets to the residential status of the beneficial owner, an approach India could adapt.Individuals dealing in cryptocurrencies are required to disclose income from virtual digital assets in Schedule VDA of their annual income tax returns — typically ITR-2 or ITR-3, depending on their income profile. The schedule seeks granular information, including the date of acquisition and transfer, cost of acquisition and sale consideration. Accurate reporting is crucial, as any under-reporting or misreporting of VDA income can attract penalties, apart from interest on unpaid tax.Possible reforms being discussed in policy circles include:","Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities.

In a pre-Budget 2026 survey, most tax experts who spoke to Times of India Online said that the government may look to eventually do away with the old income tax regime, though the transition is likely to happen in a phased manner.

Will The Old Tax Regime Be Phased Out?

New Vs Old Income Tax Regime

Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2026 on February 1, 2026 and like every year common man and taxpayers, especially salaried, are watching out for possible changes on the income tax front - both in the new and the old income tax regime. One big factor when it comes to income tax and tax outgo is the regime under which you choose to file your income tax return - old regime or new regime it's an important choice.Ever since the new income tax regime was introduced a few years ago, one question that has played in the minds of taxpayers is: will the old income tax regime cease to be an option soon?The new and old income tax regimes differ on one basic fundamental: the former has lower tax rates at higher levels of income compared to the old tax regime and fewer deductions and exemptions.For example; the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime is higher. With the Section 87A rebate, the level of tax free income for salaried taxpayers goes to Rs 12.75 lakh (including standard deduction)! Simply put; an individual earning Rs 1 lakh a month needs to pay ZERO tax!On the other hand, the option to avail deductions and exemptions under the old income tax regime work in its favour, though over the last few years the government has increasingly made the new income tax regime more lucrative.Some of the common income tax exemptions and deductions available under the old income tax regime are: Section 80C benefits (up to Rs 1.5 lakh for popular investments such as Provident Fund, PPF), Section 80D for medical insurance, NPS contributions, House Rent Allowance (HRA), Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), Section 80 TTA (interest on bank deposits etc.), home loan interest benefits.To get a better understanding of the future of the old income tax regime, let’s understand why the new income tax regime was introduced. Fundamentally, the government wants to move towards an income tax return regime with minimal deductions and exemptions to simplify the filing process and reduce the need for maintaining records and paperwork.In her Budget 2020 speech FM Nirmala Sitharaman had introduced the new income tax regime saying, “Currently the Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and deductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and administration of the Income Tax Act by the tax authorities a burdensome process. It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Income-tax law without taking help from professionals. In order to provide significant relief to the individual taxpayers and to simplify the Income-tax law, I propose to bring a new and simplified personal income tax regime wherein income tax rates will be significantly reduced for the individual taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and exemptions. ”As Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax at KPMG in India explains: When the new tax regime was introduced for the first time from FY 2020-21 it was then indicated by the government that there was a long-term intent to phase out the plethora of exemptions/deductions.Over the years, the government has in fact made the new tax regime - which disallows many widely claimed exemptions/ deductions under the old tax regime - increasingly more lucrative for individual taxpayers over the years.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India points out: recent data shows that for Assessment Year 2024‑25, around 72% of filers opted for the new tax regime, indicating broad acceptance of the simplified framework.“Given this trajectory, any move to retire the old regime, if considered, would likely be phased, allowing a cooling‑off period to support a smooth transition for taxpayers,” she tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner at Vialto Partners notes that the past two Budgets have reinforced the trends of trying to make the new income tax regime more popular, through more favourable new personal tax regime changes, including higher basic exemption and rebate limits in 2025, and increased standard deduction and NPS employer-contribution benefits in 2024.What’s interesting to note is that if 72% of taxpayers had opted for the new income tax regime by FY2025, the number will likely go up for FY 2025-26 after FM Nirmala Sitharaman tweaked tax slabs under the new income tax regime in last year’s Union Budget, and also made income up to Rs 12 lakh tax free.Some experts are of the view that exemptions and deductions are important especially when it comes to encouraging savings and providing home loan related tax benefits. However, a gradual phasing out of the old tax regime, with stagnation is seen.Preeti Sharma, Partner – Tax and Regulatory Services at BDO India told TOI, “The government has clearly shown its preference for the new income tax regime and has made it the default tax regime. However, an immediate abolition of the old tax regime is unlikely.”Why is the old income tax regime still relevant for many? The old tax regime continues to be beneficial for a certain group of taxpayers, particularly those who claim deductions such as House Rent Allowance (HRA), home-loan interest and benefits under Sections 80C and 80D, and especially for salaried taxpayers who claim deductions under Chapter VI-A.“As a result, the government is expected to follow a gradual approach, continuing with both tax regimes while nudging taxpayers towards the new tax regime,” she said.As Parizad Sirwalla of KPMG points out: many of the deductions (allowed under old regime) are basis long term commitment (e.g., renting a house/ buying a house, PPF, Life Insurance premium etc.) and hence complete deletion of old tax regime may have an impact on these long-term savings/ investment/ expenditure by the common man.“Additionally, prior to the New Income Tax Act being published there was expectation that the new Act may be a signal to do away with the old regime – however the final Act that has been passed continues the old tax regime as optional,” she says.Chander Talreja of Vialto Partners says that the government has given flexibility to the taxpayers to choose the best regime applicable for their case depending upon their personal situation and individual circumstances.“Few may find the old regime beneficial as a lot of deductions and exemptions help them to save tax and also ensure that they don’t hit the income ceiling where the surcharge becomes applicable,” he tells TOI.“Moreover, the government would also factor that there is a huge market for housing loans, various investments etc. which qualify for section 80C benefit and not allowing tax benefits for these may hamper their market demand. Hence, the flexibility to opt between the regimes would continue for some time,” he adds.On the other hand, Tanu Gupta, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP finds merit in ending the old income tax regime to avoid confusion.She notes that while the government may not completely eliminate the old tax regime from the law, it is already moving toward making the new regime so attractive that the old regime could automatically become redundant.“Although the old regime still finds a place in the newly enacted Income Tax Act 2025, the changes introduced in last year’s budget—such as tweaking the slabs, raising the Section 87A rebate to Rs 12 lakh, and capping the surcharge at 25% for incomes above Rs 5 crore, while leaving the old regime unchanged—represent a significant step toward making the new tax regime beneficial for most taxpayers,” she told TOI.“For FY 2023–24, 72% of taxpayers opted for the new regime, and this percentage is expected to be significantly higher for FY 2025–26,” she adds.Tanu Gupta is of the view that two income tax regimes cause confusion, beating the purpose of simplification of tax filing. “Evaluating options by comparing the old and new regimes, and for business income taxpayers being allowed to switch only once in a lifetime, only adds to the confusion, contrary to the tax policy objective of simplification,” she says.“There have even been instances where tax officers, while processing returns under Section 143, inadvertently applied the old regime despite the taxpayer choosing the new regime, causing inconvenience and additional administrative burden. Therefore, there is merit in putting a final end to the old tax regime rather than letting it fade naturally by becoming redundant,” she explains.Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director, Deloitte India sees a gradual stagnation of the old income tax regime. This is evident from the fact that one has to not only explicitly opt for the old income tax regime, it has not seen periodic updates to its slab rates and standard deduction.“The introduction of the Income Tax Act 2025 aims for simplicity. Keeping two parallel systems forever contradicts the goal of simplification. Hence, we may expect the old regime to remain for another 2-3 years to allow long-term investors (with 15-year PPF accounts or longer period home loans) to transition smoothly. However, it is increasingly becoming a legacy option unattractive for most taxpayers,” she tells TOI.Akhil Chandna, Partner and Global People Solutions Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat anticipates a gradual phase-out of the old regime over time.“Recent budget announcements have consistently enhanced the attractiveness of the new regime—through higher rebate limits and inclusion of standard deductions—while leaving the old regime unchanged. Consequently, the old tax regime is expected to become redundant in the coming years,” he says.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations: finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present the union budget 2026 on february 1, 2026.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

New Income Tax Regime: What Tax Relief Was Announced Last Time?

But, after last year’s tax slab tweaks, is there still a case to make the new tax regime more attractive so that more taxpayers switch over? What are the top things that can be done?

Will New Income Tax Regime Be Made More Lucrative?

New Tax Regime: What More Can Be Done?

Firstly, the standard deduction limit may be increased from Rs 75,000 to Rs 90,000/-

Secondly, the employer’s contribution to the NPS is allowed as a deduction under the new income tax regime. For the non-salaried individuals, while this deduction is not applicable, they do not even get any deduction for their own contribution. This is a hardship and the government may consider introducing deduction in respect of an individual's contribution to NPS under section 80CCD(1B), currently capped at Rs 50,000. This will benefit salaried as well as non-salaried individuals.

Will FM Nirmala Sitharaman provide more reason to cheer for salaried and middle class taxpayers two years in a row? 2025 was a year of tax reforms - massive overhaul of the new income tax regime, introduction of the New Income Tax Act, and finally sweeping GST rate cuts and slabs rationalization. But what will Budget 2026 bring on the income tax front?The government has increasingly been nudging taxpayers to opt for the new income tax regime. For one - it was made the default regime two years ago, which means you have to explicitly opt for the old tax regime and in case you fail to file your income tax return within the due date, you are automatically switched to the new regime.Like every year, there is always an expectation of the common man from the government to rejig the tax slabs and provide more net disposable income in their hands. Going by the past trends any changes that are likely to be introduced would be limited to the new income tax regime.FM Nirmala Sitharaman had in her Budget speech last year announced: There will be no income tax payable up to income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The income tax slabs and rates under the new income tax regime were also revised to hike the basic tax exemption limit from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh.As FM Sitharaman said: A taxpayer in the new regime with an income of Rs 12 lakh will get a benefit of Rs 80,000 in tax (which is 100% of tax payable as per existing rates).A person having income of Rs 18 lakh will get a benefit of Rs 70,000 in tax (30% of tax payable as per existing rates).A person with an income of Rs 25 lakh gets a benefit of Rs 1,10,000 (25% of his tax payable as per existing rates).One important point to note is that after the changes made in Budget 2025, such as higher tax rebates and revised tax slabs, the new income tax Regime has become much more attractive for most taxpayers. Hence the adoption of the new regime is expected to be much higher when income tax returns for the ongoing financial year are filed later this year.Tax experts surveyed by Times of India Online are mostly of the view that no major changes to the income tax regime are likely in this year’s Budget.As Preeti Sharma, Partner – Tax and Regulatory Services, BDO India, if a taxpayer cannot claim sufficient deductions, the new income tax regime usually results in a lower tax burden.“Since the Government has already made major improvements to the new income tax regime in Budget 2025, big changes to tax slabs are unlikely in this year's Budget,” she opines.The growing preference for the new income tax regime is already visible. Out of 7.28 crore income tax returns filed for AY 2024–25, around 72% were filed under the new income tax Regime, while only 28% chose the old tax regime. “This shows that most taxpayers now find the new tax regime simpler and more tax efficient,” Preeti Sharma said.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India also doesn’t expect any changes in the new income tax regime to be announced in this year’s budget. “The new tax regime has already been liberalised with lower slabs and higher rebates. In Parliament, the Minister of State for Finance clarified that the Personal Income-tax regime (without deductions) has been recently simplified with liberal slabs and increased rebates by Finance Act, 2025. The minister said that there is no further proposal under consideration in this regard’,” she told TOI.“Thus, the immediate focus is likely to be on stability and a smooth transition rather than introducing additional reforms. Any further refinements, if considered, are expected to follow a phased approach, aligning with the broader objective of tax certainty and compliance simplification,” she added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India believes that given the significant overhaul in slab rates last year, it may be highly optimistic to expect a significant change to income slabs or tax rates this year as well.“More realistically, the focus may possibly be on incremental measures from ease of interpretation and rationalizing of compliances,” she tells TOI.Tanu Gupta, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP feels that every tax relief is always welcome! In the past, the government has often provided further relief only to those who opted for the new tax regime while leaving the old regime unchanged, and this is likely the path it may continue to follow, she says.“Considering the significant tax relief provided last year, as well as the relief extended through changes in GST rates during the year, the government may leave personal tax rates unchanged this time. Additionally, there is pressure on government tax collections, and it needs more resources to support exports and businesses in navigating an uncertain global economic environment,” she tells TOI.In recent years, the government has introduced several changes to the new income tax regime to make it more attractive for taxpayers. However, experts point out that despite the tax slabs being revised and rationalised, a section of taxpayers continues to opt for the old tax regime due to the availability of many deductions.While not expecting any major changes, Preeti Sharma of BDO India said that the government may come with the minor changes under the new income tax regime to make it even more attractive, especially for middle-class taxpayers.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners says that to make the new income tax regime more attractive, the government may take steps to revisit the limit of deductions allowed in the new regime or consider introducing a new one. He lists the following moves:Akhil Chandna, Partner and Global People Solutions Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat also advocates for a hike in standard deduction limit. “To encourage broader adoption of the new regime, it is expected that the government may further increase the standard deduction limit. Additionally, certain reasonable deductions - such as those for health insurance and home loan interest - may also be allowed under the new regime,” he tells TOI.Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte India sees scope for some limited measures for additional relief to taxpayers.Despite the significant relief for resident taxpayers earning up to Rs 12 lakh (who now pay zero tax), taxpayers in the 12 lakhs to Rs 30 lakhs bracket, particularly those with home loans and insurance often continue to find the old regime more beneficial. To bridge this gap and accelerate a full transition to the new regime, the government could consider a few targeted measures, she says.Currently, the new regime does not allow any deduction for interest on self-occupied house property. “Introducing even a capped deduction (for example, up to Rs 2 lakhs) would significantly improve its appeal for millions of homeowners. Similarly, while employer contributions to NPS can be reduced from taxable income, employee contributions cannot, and allowing the same would bring parity and encourage retirement savings,” she tells TOI.“Further, with health insurance premiums rising year after year, many taxpayers incur substantial costs without any tax benefit under the new regime; a limited deduction for medical insurance could therefore enhance its attractiveness. While the government’s focus remains on simplification and large-scale deductions may be unlikely, selective relief in these areas could make the new regime far more compelling for a wider segment of taxpayers,” she adds.","The government has increasingly been nudging taxpayers to opt for the new income tax regime. The standard deduction limit may be increased from rs 75,000 to rs 90,000. Fm nirmala sitharaman had in her budget speech last year announced: there will be no income tax payable up to income of rs 12 lakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126527231,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-92248,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Budget 2026: Govt may raise capex spending 10–15%; private investment remains uneven,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-govt-may-raise-capex-spending-1015-private-investment-remains-uneven/articleshow/126527037.cms,"The government is likely to retain its strong focus on public capital expenditure in the upcoming Union Budget 2026, with the capex outlay expected to rise by 10–15 per cent from the current level of Rs 11.21 lakh crore, even as private sector investment continues to remain cautious, experts said, as reported PTI.The Budget, which is scheduled to be tabled in Parliament on February 1, has adequate fiscal headroom to step up public capital spending, and the government should use this opportunity to sustain growth momentum, economists noted.“I believe that the capital expenditure absorption capacity in the economy is not very high. If you want to increase it by 30 per cent overnight, it is not going to happen because you need the capacity of the construction companies, you need the capacity of the heavy earth-moving machinery, you need so many machines,” PwC Partner and Economic Advisory Services leader Ranen Banerjee told PTI.“So, it cannot increase 30 per cent overnight. Therefore, we believe that about a 10 per cent increase on the capex is what we can expect, and about Rs 12 trillion of allocation is what we are expecting,” he said.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed a capital expenditure outlay of Rs 11.21 lakh crore for FY26, after the government is expected to fall short of its target in the current year. Against the Budget estimate of Rs 11.11 lakh crore for FY25, capex spending is estimated at Rs 10.18 lakh crore in the Revised Estimates.According to ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar, the challenge with private capex is not a broad-based slowdown but uneven investment across sectors.Traditional sectors such as cement and steel are seeing expansion, largely driven by higher public investment that has created demand for private players. At the same time, greenfield sectors like data centres, electric vehicles and renewable energy are witnessing strong investment momentum, she said.However, export-oriented sectors and industries facing stiff import competition continue to face a more difficult environment, limiting private investment appetite, Nayar added.On the government’s own spending outlook, Nayar said FY27 could see a stronger capex push, as fiscal flexibility may narrow in subsequent years.“I think FY27 could be a year where we hope that capex will be prioritised by the government simply because FY28 is when the pay revision will come in and it will be much more difficult at that point to really set aside a lot for additional capex,” she said.Asked about the likely pace of growth, Nayar said public capital expenditure is expected to expand faster than the projected nominal GDP growth of 9.5–10 per cent for FY27.“I would at least hope to see a 12–15 per cent capex growth if at all the fiscal space is there within the Budget,” she added.","The budget, which is scheduled to be tabled in parliament on february 1, has adequate fiscal headroom to step up public capital spending. The government should use this opportunity to sustain growth momentum, economists noted. Icra chief economist aditi nayar said the challenge with private capex is not a broad-based slowdown but uneven investment across sectors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126527095,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-496428,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Budget 2026 expectations: India’s cryptocurrency tax framework deserves a timely recalibration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-indias-cryptocurrency-tax-framework-deserves-a-timely-recalibration/articleshow/126519469.cms,"The upcoming Union Budget offers a moment to consider how crypto taxation can better align incentives with outcomes.

Crypto taxation in India was introduced at a moment when digital assets were gaining rapid adoption, but regulatory clarity was still evolving globally. In the Union Budget of 2022, the government implemented a flat 30 percent tax on income from virtual digital assets, along with a 1 percent tax deducted at source (TDS) on each transaction. The intent was to create a trail for transactions, and bring an emerging asset class within a defined fiscal framework.Three years later, both the ecosystem and the regulatory environment have matured. India now leads the world in crypto adoption, while global standards around compliance, reporting, and oversight have become clearer. In this context, there is an opportunity to review certain elements of the current tax framework so that it serves its original objectives with present-day realities.The upcoming Union Budget offers a moment to consider how crypto taxation can better align incentives with outcomes. The existing framework is perceived by many participants as relatively stringent.The impact of the 1 percent TDS is an example of this. For long-term investors, the deduction may appear manageable. However, for active traders and liquidity providers operating on thin margins, even small deductions on every transaction can result in capital being locked up.Market-making and arbitrage strategies, which typically operate at margins of 0.01 to 0.05 percent per trade, become difficult to sustain.Industry-reported data indicates that after TDS was introduced in July 2022, trading volumes on Indian exchanges declined sharply. Between July 2022 and July 2023 alone, an estimated ₹3.5 lakh crore of Indian crypto trading activity shifted to offshore platforms that did not deduct TDS.Reduced participation from liquidity providers has led to thinner order books, with Indian platforms often trading at premiums compared to global markets. While the objective of TDS was to enhance transparency, a portion of activity instead moved to peer-to-peer channels and overseas venues beyond India’s immediate supervisory reach.At the same time, India’s regulatory framework has strengthened considerably. Since March 2023, virtual asset service providers have been brought under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and are now reporting entities registered with FIU-IND. Robust know-your-customer norms, suspicious transaction reporting, and actions against non-compliant offshore exchanges are already in effect. So transaction monitoring is no longer dependent on TDS alone. In this environment, a relatively high transaction-level TDS is primarily discouraging. Broadening the onshore tax base could therefore be more effective than relying on transaction-level deductions.In 2024-25, the value of cryptocurrency transactions in India exceeded ₹51,000 crore, based on tax collection numbers of ₹511.8 crore. Lowering the TDS to 0.01% will also enable the record keeping of trading activities but provide relief to users.There are also wider ecosystem considerations. Users who move to unregulated platforms are exposed to higher operational and security risks. Indian cybersecurity firms have flagged losses linked to misleading offshore platforms promoted via social media. Keeping activity within India’s regulated perimeter enables better oversight. Carrying out survey actions under Section 133A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, against global platforms catering to Indian users, has revealed non compliance of TDS provision, with unreported TDS of several crores falling on users. According to Tax India Online Knowledge Foundation, if existing policies remain unchanged, cumulative uncollected TDS could approach ₹40,000 crore over the next five years, making the end user vulnerable due to non reportage.Domestic exchanges have also felt the impact. Customer support and compliance costs have increased for the platforms so that security, and reporting systems are aligned with Indian regulations.Another area that needs consideration is the treatment of losses. At present, losses from crypto transactions cannot be set off or carried forward, even within the same asset class. This creates an asymmetric tax structure that differs from most other financial assets. Allowing limited loss set-offs within the asset class would align crypto taxation more closely with established principles of fair taxation.A combination of targeted adjustments, such as reducing TDS to 0.01 percent and permitting loss set-offs, would not dilute oversight or enforcement. Instead, it could help restore liquidity, improve price discovery, and encourage activity to return to compliant Indian platforms operating under PMLA oversight and FIU-IND reporting norms. A calibrated update could help ensure that India captures economic activity, innovation, and tax revenues domestically, rather than seeing them move elsewhere.The upcoming Budget presents an opportunity to fine-tune the tax framework so that it supports compliant service providers, and protects domestic users. Such an approach would not be a departure from prudence, but a step towards ensuring that India captures the full benefits of a fast-maturing digital asset ecosystem.","The upcoming union budget offers a moment to consider how crypto taxation can better align incentives with outcomes.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
