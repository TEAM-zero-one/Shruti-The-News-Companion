Jairam Ramesh reacts to new GST rate cuts:

NEW DELHI: Congress on Thursday called the latest cuts on GST approved by the Centre as ""8 years too late.""In a social media pot on X, former Union minister P Chidambaram said that the prevailing taxes should not have been introduced in the first place.""The GST rationalisation and the reduction in rates on a range of goods and services are WELCOME but 8 years TOO LATE The current design of GST and the rates prevailing until today ought not to have been introduced in the first place,"" Chidambaram said.""We have been crying hoarse for the last 8 years against the design and rates of GST, but our pleas fell on deaf years,"" he added.This comes a day after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping Goods and Services Tax rate cuts effective September 22. The GST revamp brings a majority of items in the 5% and 18% slabs, with several items now facing 0% or nil tax and some added to the 40% 'sin tax' slab.""For common man and middle class items, there is a complete reduction from 18% and 12 to 5%. Items such as hair oil, toilet, soap bars, soap bars, shampoos, toothbrushes, toothpaste, bicycles, tableware, kitchenware and other household articles are now at 5%,"" FM Sitharaman said. ""UHT milk, paneer, all the Indian breads will see nil rate,"" she added.The changes in GST rates on services and goods other than cigarettes, chewing tobacco products, unmanufactured tobacco and beedi will be effective from Sept 22.The 56th Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting commenced on Wednesday to review potential rate reductions and category adjustments for numerous items under the indirect taxation system. The extensive 56th GST Council meeting, spanning 10.5 hours, provided a platform for the Centre and states to deliberate and discuss crucial tax proposals.The GST Council endorsed a transition from the existing four-tier GST framework (5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent) to a simplified two-rate structure of 5 and 18 per cent. Additionally, certain items like high-end vehicles, tobacco and cigarettes will attract a special 40 per cent rate.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Thursday reacted to the Sitharaman’s announcements on GST rate cuts. He said that the reforms fall short of delivering the comprehensive GST 2.0 that the party has long advocated.In a post on X, he said, ""The Indian National Congress has for long been advocating for a GST 2.0 that reduces the number of rates, cuts the rates on a large number of items of mass consumption, minimises evasion, mis-classification, and disputes, does away with inverted duty structure (lower tax on output as compared to inputs), eases the compliance burden on MSMEs, and expands GST coverage.""He criticized the timing of the announcements, pointing out that the prime minister had already outlined the key decisions in his Independence Day speech, raising questions about the GST Council’s role as a constitutional body.While the cuts may benefit consumers, Ramesh said it remains unclear whether they will stimulate private investment, especially in manufacturing, or ease the compliance burden on MSMEs. He also highlighted that states’ demand for extended compensation to safeguard revenues remains unaddressed.",Former union minister p chidambaram said that the prevailing taxes should not have been introduced in the first place.

The UAE has introduced two new ministerial decisions aimed at clarifying how corporate tax rules apply to Free Zone businesses, providing much-needed precision on qualifying activities and acceptable pricing benchmarks. The move replaces a 2023 framework, expands tax-free eligibility, and reinforces the country’s position as a transparent, globally aligned business hub.On September 3, 2025, the UAE Ministry of Finance issued Ministerial Decision No. (229) of 2025 and Ministerial Decision No. (230) of 2025, both of which reshape the landscape of corporate tax treatment for businesses operating within Free Zones.Ministerial Decision No. (229) of 2025 repeals the earlier Ministerial Decision No. 265 of 2023, establishing updated definitions for Qualifying Activities and Excluded Activities under the UAE’s corporate tax law. These updates are particularly significant for companies seeking to benefit from the zero per cent corporate tax rate offered to qualifying Free Zone entities.Complementing this is Ministerial Decision No. (230) of 2025, which formally specifies the Recognised Price Reporting Agencies that companies must use to determine fair market value for qualifying commodities.This ensures transparency in pricing and compliance with international standards.Together, these decisions aim to give Free Zone entities greater legal certainty, enable tax-compliant operational planning, and eliminate ambiguities in the law.A key change introduced by the new framework is a broadened definition of Qualifying Commodity Trading, a core income stream for many Free Zone firms. Previously limited to commodities in raw form, the scope now includes a wider array of goods such as:Crucially, the update allows these items to qualify even if not in raw form, as long as a transparent, quoted price is available from a recognised source, either a commodity exchange or one of the Price Reporting Agencies identified in Ministerial Decision No. (230) of 2025.The changes not only broaden eligibility but also reflect a push toward sustainability and green finance, with the inclusion of carbon credits under the environmental commodities category.Beyond commodities, the Ministry has also provided clarity on treasury and financing services. These now officially include:This flexibility is particularly useful for holding companies and multinational groups, many of whom centralise their treasury operations within UAE Free Zones.Another clarification relates to distribution activities. Companies based in designated Free Zones may now distribute goods or materials to public benefit entities without breaching the de minimis threshold. This threshold is a set value, usually for imported items, below which no customs duties or taxes are charged because collecting them would cost more than the tax itself. This rule helps make sure that businesses don’t lose their zero-tax benefits when doing socially important work.The new decisions follow the introduction of the UAE’s federal corporate tax regime, which took effect on June 1, 2023. Under the law, companies with taxable profits exceeding AED 375,000 (approximately $102,110) are subject to a standard 9% corporate tax rate. Profits below that threshold are taxed at zero per cent.However, businesses in UAE Free Zones can still benefit from a zero per cent rate on qualifying income, provided they meet specific conditions.Previously defined qualifying activities included:Income from non-qualifying activities or from excluded transactions, such as dealings with the mainland or unrelated parties outside scope, remains taxable at the standard 9% rate.Compliance is not optional: failure to meet qualifying criteria in the first year can disqualify a business from tax exemption for four subsequent years. Therefore, companies are strongly encouraged to reassess their operations, documentation, and transfer pricing in advance of the 2025 filing deadlines.Also read: Companies in select free zones can now buy and own property in Dubai under new deal The issuance of these two decisions comes at a time when the UAE is actively balancing its economic competitiveness with the need for transparency and global tax alignment, including adherence to the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) framework.The UAE Ministry of Finance, established under Federal Decree No. (2) of 1971, plays a central role in shaping the country’s fiscal and economic development. Under the leadership of His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and His Excellency Mohamed bin Hadi Al Hussaini, Minister of State for Financial Affairs, the Ministry is tasked with enhancing federal budget execution, managing national financial policy, and supporting international economic interests.The Ministry operates through five sectors:Free Zones remain integral to the UAE’s economic strategy, hosting thousands of global companies across sectors such as logistics, energy, manufacturing, and finance. There are over 40 Free Zones in the UAE, with more than 30 in Dubai alone, including notable examples like:These zones offer numerous advantages: 100% foreign ownership, full repatriation of profits, no customs duties, no personal income tax, and fast-tracked business setup. Their autonomy and sector-specific focus are central to the UAE’s appeal as a destination for foreign direct investment.The Ministry has reaffirmed that the updated tax rules aim to preserve the benefits of Free Zones while closing potential loopholes. By aligning tax incentives with clear qualifying criteria and transparent, verifiable pricing, the UAE underscores that its zero-tax benefits remain attractive, so long as businesses operate within well-defined, internationally recognized standards.","Uae free zones offer tax breaks, full foreign ownership, and sector-specific benefits.

FM's pro-people pitch helped bring all stateson board for GST cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fms-pro-people-pitch-helped-bring-all-stateson-board-for-gst-cuts/articleshow/123709179.cms,"From Healthcare to MSMEs Business Bodies Cheer GST 2.0 as Big Push for Self-Reliance, Relief





NEW DELHI: The Centre's single-mindedness helped it get states sign off on the massive cuts in GST rates Wednesday, making it likely that the lower prices of a whole range of goods and services become a reality much before by Diwali.While states such as Karnataka and Kerala were vocal inside when the GST Council met at Sushma Swaraj Bhawan, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman pushed for finalising the rate cuts on Wednesday itself, though another full-day session was planned. NDA-led states were, obviously, in favour of the move that stood to benefit consumers across the country, but the finance minister managed to bring others around by framing the proposal as a pro-people move.Sitharaman, who at the instance of PM Narendra Modi, was working on the measures from Feb itself, had done all the groundwork through a series of meetings with officials from the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, and the revenue department, identifying each item used by the 'aam aadmi' so that the burden was lowered.All this came while the budget was being discussed in Parliament, and the new income tax law was being written under the direct supervision of Sitharaman.Once the contours were ready, the finance ministry presented it before the PM.After the GST Council meeting the finance minister confirmed that the PM had been urging her for the revamp for several months.With the Prime Minister convinced about the plan and a detailed blueprint ready, he decided to announce it in his Independence Day speech, making it tough for opposition states to go against the move which was pro-consumer. After all, these same states, including West Bengal, Kerala, Karnataka, Jharkhand and Punjab, had been arguing for making the regime more taxpayer friendly.Days after the PM's speech, the Centre shared its blueprint with states with the FM herself making a pitch before the group of ministers on rate rationalisation. It also gave the opposition states time to come up with other options.Instead, all they did was raise the issue of loss to states - a stand that Sitharaman questioned Wednesday, arguing that the GST Council was a forum where the Centre and states sat together and all stood to gain and lose equally. Besides, she said that the GST kitty is split 50:50 with states getting 41% of the revenue that flows to the Centre.While she complimented the state finance ministers during her press conference late Wednesday, it took considerable effort to get them on board as Karnataka and Kerala kept raising the issue of ""revenue loss"".At the press conference, revenue secretary Arvind Shrivastava articulated how the tax cuts were meant to boost overall economic activity, improve compliance, boost demand and generate tax buoyancy, thus offsetting any fiscal impact.Apart from lifting sentiments at a time when the tariffs imposed by the US had dampened the mood, the timing also coincides with elections in crucial states such as Bihar and West Bengal, giving BJP an opportunity to launch a massive outreach.","The centre's single-mindedness helped it get states sign off on the massive cuts in gst rates wednesday.

NEW DELHI: The GST rate rejig comes not just as a reduction in taxes on various components of the farm sector, but also as a nudge to reforms in sustainable farming, fisheries and dairy which may ultimately benefit marginal and small farmers.The sector will see reduction in GST from 12%-18% to 5% on drip irrigation systems, sprinklers, agricultural machinery, specified bio- pesticides, micro nutrients, fish oil, fish extract, composting machines (vital for producing organic manures and ensuring eco-friendly pond management), preserved fish and shrimp products; reduction from 18% to 5% on key fertiliser inputs (sulphuric acid, nitric acid, and ammonia); and either full exemption or reduction of tax to 5% on different milk or milk products.Analysis shows this will reduce input cost at farm level and drive sustainable growth, encouraging farmers to opt for drip irrigation systems and sprinklers. It will attract investments, specifically in manufacturing of farm machinery such as tractors, irrigation systems and composting equipment.Since the GST on bio-pesticides has also been reduced, it will encourage farmers to shift toward safer options, contributing to the improvement of soil health and increase in output.This along with a reform-based push for efficient and judicious use of water for irrigation through drips and sprinklers will go a long way towards sustainable farming.Similarly, significant tax rate rationalisation in the fisheries sector will help in reduction of operational costs, enhance competitiveness in domestic and export markets, and directly benefit millions of fish farmers and other stakeholders.The revised GST structure on shrimp products will soften the blow shrimp farmers and exporters received from the enhanced US tariff.The dairy sector too saw a significant change. Ultra-High Temperature milk and paneer/chhena (pre-packaged and labelled) will have zero tax while the rest of milk products, including icecreams, cheese, ghee, dairy spreads and condensed milk, will now attract 5% GST.","The gst rate rejig comes not just as a reduction in taxes on various components of the farm sector, but also as a nudge to reforms in sustainable farming, fisheries and dairy.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS .In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

By Parizad Sirwalla

Budget 2025 income tax: In the run up to the Budget 2025, individual taxpayers were eagerly looking forward to favorable tax reforms. The FM seems to have brought some cheer to them through her proposals.Recognizing the contributions of the middle class and with an objective to eventually phase out the old tax regime, various changes have been introduced in the new tax regime. The basic exemption limit has been increased from INR 3 lakhs to INR 4 lakhs. In a significant shift, the highest slab is increased from INR 15 lakhs to 24 lakhs. The other slabs and tax rates have been realigned and a new tax rate of 25% has been included. Income threshold for rebate under 87A available to resident taxpayers has been increased from INR 7 lakhs to INR 12 lakhs. For computing this threshold, special rate income (such as capital gains, lottery winnings etc.) has been specifically excluded, to also address certain ambiguities in the earlier interpretation.With these changes, all the taxpayers in the new tax regime have some reason to celebrate, irrespective of income levels.As an illustration, a person with income up to 12 lakhs can now enjoy annual tax savings of INR 80,000 (excluding cess). At the same time, an individual with income of 18 lakhs has a tax savings upto INR 110,000 (excluding cess). The savings would be higher for income levels where surcharge is applicable.Few amendments have been made with a view to simplify certain provisions. Earlier, in case of vacant properties, annual income could be considered as NIL for up to two self-occupied properties (SOP). While there is no change in above, to qualify as SOP, currently there is a condition that the taxpayer should not be able to reside therein due to his business or employment or profession and that taxpayer is staying in a premises not owned by him. This condition has now been done away with.NPS Vatsalya Scheme launched in September 2024, enabled parents and guardians to start a NPS for their minor children, which on attaining majority, would be transferred to the child's name with the accumulated corpus. As a welcome measure, the Budget has extended the deduction of INR 50,000 under section 80CCD (available in the old tax regime) to also include contributions towards this scheme. Further, it has been specified that partial withdrawals up to 25 per cent from the scheme, allowed for specified reasons, shall not be taxable.Currently, a deduction is allowed to an individual for any amount deposited in the National Saving Scheme (NSS), prior to 1 April 1992. Any withdrawals from the scheme are held as taxable. As a notification dated 29 August 2024 specified that the balances would not earn interest, this made the depositors keen to withdraw the NSS balance. Based on various representations received, the FM has now exempted the withdrawals done post 29 August 2024, for which deduction was allowed earlier, to provide them the much-required relief.Striking a balance between fiscal prudence and the theme of “Trust first, Scrutinize later”, the Government has enhanced timelines for filing updated returns by two more years by paying additional taxes of 60 and 70 percent respectively. This will help boost tax revenues through voluntary compliance.Consistency and clarity has been provided in the taxability of redemption proceeds of all un-exempted ULIPs, by including them in the definition of equity - oriented fund, which was earlier only with respect to certain unexempted ULIPs.There has been a rationalization of the various TCS/ TDS thresholds including on remittances under Liberalized remittance scheme (from INR 700,000 to INR 10,00,000 and NIL in the case of remittance for education financed by a specified loans) and interest income for senior citizens (from existing INR 50,000 to INR 100,000). This will positively impact their cash flows.The higher TDS is proposed to be continued on assesses having invalid PAN/ non-PAN holders. However, it is proposed to remove the higher TDS/TCS on non-filers of return of income with an attempt for ease of doing business and reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers.The FM has also promised to table the much-awaited New Income Tax Bill which aims at simplicity and reduced litigation, in the next week. All in all, the Budget endeavors to take steps to reinforce confidence and optimism in the taxpayers.","Income threshold for rebate under 87a available to resident taxpayers has been increased from inr 7 lakhs to inr 12 lakhs. With these changes, all the taxpayers in the new tax regime have some reason to celebrate, irrespective of income levels.

Although, we are still the fastest growing large economy in the world, not only we have to maintain this growth, but we have to push it up. We have addressed both the supply-side and demand-side and tried in a non inflationary way to maximise growth, accelerate growth.I think it's up to the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to take a call on that. But, on the fiscal side, we have done our bit. We have kept the promise of fiscal consolidation. FM had announced that it will be 4.9% in this year and we have been able to achieve 4.8%. FM had said fiscal consolidation path will mean we'll bring it to 4.5% next year. We are proposing 4.4% and there was also an announcement that thereafter we will have a glide path in terms of the debt-to-GDP level and a visibility would be given on how it will go forward.That has also been included in the FRBM statement.In a way, the Budget has provided whatever stimulations are required. We are not providing a stimulus at the cost of the deficit by increasing the deficit. So, we are giving sufficient sort of comfort to the monetary authority. However, they would have to take a call based on whatever.I would say consumption is one part. However, we are not really prescribing how taxpayers, who have got this money back in a way, how they will behave. Basically, the decision making is transferred to taxpayers, who have got this relief. They may choose to consume, save or invest directly in either of the three situations we have. It will have a salutary and good effect on the economy because if they choose to consume, it will boost demand. If they choose to invest indirectly, they are supporting the banks to extend more credit. Because, banks can give credit only when they have got increased deposits. And, if they choose to directly invest, for example in a house, they also participate in investments. In that case, it will work like an investment multiplier anyway. So, it will be a combination of consumption and investment multiplier, with a positive impact on savings. Overall, I would say it will be a growth-booster.A large economy like India has to have all engines firing. You cannot simply say we will only go for agriculture, not for manufacturing. Or, we will go for manufacturing and not for services. Therefore all three are required. If you see all the proposals on supply side, we have tried to see how we can speed up production, how we can speed up productivity and how we can spur employment. So, it is employment-led growth. In agriculture, we have taken steps to boost pulses productivity and increase credit limit for farmers. Everywhere we have said how we can boost production and productivity. We are saying let there be a growth path for MSMEs. Let there be more credit available for MSMEs. Let their participation in exports be more. Let there be more support for them in terms of innovation and research. Our tax policy is supporting labour intensive sectors.It is proposed to be done before Feb 13. We are not changing the policy through it. The same thing will be carried forward because after passing, this bill will be applicable from a future date. We wanted to reform right away. So, those reforms have been brought in this bill through amendments. There are so many redundant provisions. There are a number of changes. More than 4,000 changes have happened since 1962, when this act was enacted. In 63 years, the finance sector changed, plus there were many taxation laws and amendment bills. Things get complicated to read and they may also create interpretation problems. There could be many interpretation problems or litigations. If you have more readability, if you have clarity, there will be less litigation.","Finance secretary tuhin kanta pandey said the 2025-26 budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/latest-income-tax-slabs-2025-26-how-much-tax-do-individuals-earning-slightly-above-rs-12-lakh-have-to-pay-marginal-relief-calculations-explained/articleshow/117911656.cms,"Budget 2025 income tax: The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs. 12,75,000/-.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 post Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ZERO or NIL tax liability for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in the Union Budget 2025 under the new income tax regime. For salaried individuals, including the standard deduction, this limit is Rs 12.75 lakh under the new regime.But what about individuals with taxable income slightly above Rs 12 lakh? Will they have to pay more income tax than their additional earnings above Rs 12 lakh? Will someone earning Rs 12,10,000 face a Rs 61,500 tax burden versus an individual earning Rs 10,000 less who will pay nothing?There's good news! Here's where the concept of marginal relief comes us. Individuals with income slightly above Rs 12 lakh, which is the nil tax threshold, will receive fair treatment through marginal tax relief.For example, for a person having income of Rs 12, 10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax works out to be Rs 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakh + 10% of 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10,000).

The Narendra Modi government, having provided substantial relief in personal income tax and customs tariff rationalisation in the Union Budget 2025, is now expected to initiate efforts to streamline the goods and services tax (GST) framework for easier implementation and adherence, according to officials.The primary objective will be to restructure the tax slabs to ensure meaningful outcomes, they indicated.The GST structure comprises four slabs-5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, with special rates for certain items like precious metals and additional cess on sin goods.The 5% slab currently covers 21% of GST items, whilst 12% applies to 19%, 18% to 44%, and 28% to 3% of items.According to an ET report, the government intends to discuss simplification and rationalisation with the group of ministers (GoM) tasked with reviewing rates, according to a source close to the discussions.The source noted that whilst the GoM has primarily concentrated on slab adjustments for goods, a comprehensive simplification requires fundamental restructuring of the current system.The GST Council established the GoM for rate rationalisation in September 2021. Despite numerous meetings, the GoM has not yet presented its final recommendations.Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The GoM is considering proposals including elimination of dual rates for items like pens and sunglasses based on price thresholds.

For an annual income of Rs 13.7 lakh, with basic salary at 50% (Rs 6.85 lakh), the NPS contribution at 14% would amount to Rs 95,900. Combined with the Rs 75,000 standard deduction, this eliminates tax liability on the entire Rs 13.7 lakh.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 after Budget 2025: Zero income tax on Rs 13.7 lakh salary? Don’t rub your eyes! Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget 2025 speech announced that there will be NIL or zero income tax for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh. But did you know that for salaried individuals, the tax-free annual income can reach Rs 13.7 lakh, compared to Rs 12 lakh for others!“I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000,” FM Sitharaman announced in her Union Budget speech.This advantage of no tax till Rs 13.7 lakh income stems from the Rs 75,000 standard deduction and National Pension System (NPS) investments. Section 80CCD(2) allows tax deduction of up to 14% of basic salary invested in NPS, whilst the old tax regime offers 10%.According to an ET analysis, a salaried individual with Rs 13.7 lakh yearly income can achieve tax savings of approximately Rs 96,000 through NPS contributions. It’s important to note that this benefit requires employer participation in NPS as part of cost to the company, as employees cannot opt independently.It’s interesting to note that despite this opportunity existing for nearly a decade, only 2.2 million individuals have enrolled. ""Only a few corporates are interested in rolling out the NPS benefit, and even fewer employees are willing to enrol in it,"" said Sudhir Kaushik, chief executive of tax filing portal Taxspanner.com.Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? The extended NPS lock-in period and withdrawal limitations at maturity discourage many investors. Pre-retirement withdrawals are restricted to exceptional circumstances. Upon maturity, only 60% can be withdrawn, whilst 40% must be invested in an annuity for lifetime pension.Financial experts consider these restrictions beneficial. ""The lack of liquidity in NPS is not necessarily bad because the money is at the right place. Investment returns can be enormous if held for the long term,"" said Sriram Iyer, chief executive of HDFC Pension.NPS provides additional benefits, including asset mix selection, fund switching options, and pension fund manager changes without tax implications. It maintains the industry's lowest fund management charges at 0.09% annually, compared to 1-1.5% for the most economical mutual funds. This has enabled NPS funds to outperform mutual funds in similar categories.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh!

As a common man of India, I would like to compliment and thank Hon’ble Finance Minister (FM) for being considerate towards the middle class and salaried taxpayers who generally feel neglected. The projected fiscal deficit of 4.4% for the next year (as against revised fiscal deficit of 4.8% for the current year) reflects a well thought through approach. The 2025 budget presented by the FM strikes a perfect balance between maintaining fiscal responsibility and managing taxpayers’ expectations.To begin with, the FM is keen to sunset the Old Personal Tax Regime (OPTR) as all the tax benefits are now proposed under New Personal Tax Regime (NPTR). With the proposed changes, NPTR will now become far more appealing for individuals as it would mean availing beneficial tax rates and no tax declaration or providing/ maintaining tax deduction and exemption proofs. Just to share perspective, last year only 28% of taxpayers opted for OPTR which will substantially decline in coming years as OPTR will only be beneficial if you are in the 30% tax bracket with over INR 8 lakh of eligible deductions and exemptions.Even the slab rates are easy to remember, slab changes with every block of 4 lakh and corresponding tax rates changes 5% up to six blocks with highest slab being 30 percent. Salaried individuals with a gross salary of up to INR 12.75 lakh will have zero tax under NPTR. To illustrate further, an individual earning income of, say, INR 24 lakh per annum, who had previously opted for NPTR will now enjoy a tax saving of INR 114,400 and much more compared to OPTR.Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The FM has taken conscious effort to bring down administrative burden and tried to rationalize on various aspects like penalty will be in abeyance till the final order is passed by the tax department. Now taxpayers have an opportunity to file an Updated Income Tax Return (UITR) with applicable penalty slabs based on the period of delay, up to four years in case they have missed reporting any income. By extending the option of filing UITR, Government is further encouraging such suo-moto filings, thereby enhancing its revenue streams, and providing an opportunity for taxpayers to be compliant.Further, the FM has proposed increasing TDS threshold on interest paid to senior citizens from INR 50,000 to INR 100,000, benefiting those who rely on traditional savings like term deposits and post office schemes by allowing them to retain more interest income. Additionally, TDS on dividends will now apply only if the amount exceeds INR 10,000, resulting in higher disposable income for active investors and more opportunities for reinvestment.In 2020, the Government introduced foreign remittance tracking mechanism by levying Tax Collection at Source (TCS) under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). While foreign remittances up to USD 250,000 per annum is permitted under the LRS, currently, TCS is applied on remittances above INR 7 lakh. With the proposed increase in threshold from INR 7 lakh to INR 10 lakh, Government aims to alleviate the financial burden on individuals remitting funds for various purposes.Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? For families who are supporting their children to pursue higher education overseas by borrowing from banks, the current TCS requirement of 0.5% on remittances exceeding INR 7 lakh adds to their financial strain. With interest rates on education loans usually exceeding 8% per annum, additional TCS meant lesser funds. With the budget proposing to scrap TCS on education-related remittances funded through financial institutions, the Government is promoting access to global educational opportunities, aligning with the vision of ""Viksit Bharat” and contributing to a more skilled workforce.By introducing the National Pension Scheme (NPS) Vatsalya last year, the Government provided an initiative for parents or guardians to open NPS accounts for their minor children. The FM expanded tax benefits for NPS to include contributions of up to INR 50,000 in NPS Vatsalya under OPTR.Regarding Income from house property, the proposal allows taxpayers to claim up to two properties as self-occupied without any conditions. This change offers relief to those with a second property that may remain vacant for various reasons. This is again testimony to avoid ambiguity and litigation.While no change in the tax rates on crypto transactions, it is proposed to be included in the definition of Virtual Digital Assets and prescribed reporting entities will furnish information in a specified statement.Further, the ambiguity about taxing the redemption of unit-linked insurance with high premiums policies has now been clarified i.e., long term capital gains at 12.5%.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime For millions of middle-class taxpayers, this budget represents more than just a change in policy; it serves as a financial lifeline. This shift in focus towards the middle class is particularly significant in a time when rising costs and inflation have put pressure on their finances. As they navigate the challenges of daily life, the tangible benefits of this fiscal relief will enable them to participate more actively in the economy, ultimately contributing to a cycle of growth and stability.To conclude - As one said, “Income tax is the hardest thing in the world to understand”, the FM has taken the challenge seriously and is moving in the right direction to simplify the same. The budget has provided a preview of a simplified tax system in the country, serving as a teaser for the New Income Tax Bill set to be unveiled next week. If today's budget is any indication, we can anticipate a more tax-friendly and simplified compliance-oriented tax framework soon.",The 2025 budget presented by the fm strikes a perfect balance between maintaining fiscal responsibility and managing taxpayers’ expectations.

NEW DELHI: A day after the sweeping reforms in the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed, what he called, the ""Diwali Dhamaka"", and said they are part of a string of reforms introduced by his govt to fulfil people's aspirations and boost growth.""If I sum up the reforms, I can only say it will make India look great. There are five gems attached to the economy: first the tax system became much simpler; second, the quality of life of the citizens would get better; third, both consumption and growth will get a new booster; fourth ease of doing business will boost investment and jobs; and fifth, the partnership between the states and Centre will strengthen cooperative federalism,"" he said.The use of ""Diwali Dhamaka"" was seen as a reference to the deadline the PM had set for the benefits of the reduced rates on a whole range of goods and services to reach the consumers during the month-long festive season which has traditionally seen surge in consumer spend.The Prime Minister, who was speaking at an event to felicitate the winners of National Teachers' Award, recalled the reduction of income tax rates in this year's budget which have meant that incomes of up to Rs 12 lakh are exempt from tax.Modi said GST reforms will help local industries and, as a consequence, promote Swadeshi, while he urged teachers and students to take this movement forward.The PM criticised the Congress regime for heavily taxing the common people. ""There was so much tax in the Congress era. The condition was such that even Congressmen children's toffees were taxed at 21%,"" he said.The GST reforms announced by govt Wednesday have brought most of the goods under a two-tier tax structure of 5% and 18%, while keeping sin goods under 40% tax. The new reformed duties will come into effect on Sept 22, which is the first day of Navratri.Modi also slammed the previous Congress govts for levying high taxes on kitchen essentials and items related to farming and agriculture, or even medicines which have been brought down to 5% or NIL.""Had that regime continued, you would have been paying Rs 20-25 tax on every purchase worth Rs 100. But the aim of our govt is to ensure maximum savings in the lives of common people, and to make people's lives better,"" the PM said.He also referred to the law passed by Parliament recently banning online betting and gambling. This, he said, would safeguard the future of the country's youth. ""Gaming is not bad, but gambling is, and the future of our youth must be safeguarded,"" he said, adding that India can dominate the global online gaming market if it works in the right manner.","Pm modi hails gst reforms as 'double dhamaka of happiness before diwali', slams cong-era taxes.

NEW DELHI: Govt has drawn up elaborate plans to monitor price changes following Wednesday's move to slash GST on nearly 400 items, while expecting industry to pass on the benefits to consumers from Sept 22.Senior govt officials told TOI the indirect tax authorities are collecting current prices of goods and services and will compare them with prices once the new GST rates kick in. ""The transmission of cuts can take a few days as adjustments are needed, but govt will be watching,"" the official said.NDA MPs have been asked to keep a tab to ensure the gains are not pocketed by companies. ""The objective is to ensure consumers start getting the benefits during Navratra, and the impact of changes is tangibly felt by Diwali,"" said an official, referring to the cutoff date set by PM Modi. Industry sources said finance ministry has reached out to some of them with this message.While the law lets govt use anti-profiteering clauses, it wants industry to voluntarily share gains with consumers.Govt expects competition to take care of price cuts in most sectors with officials arguing that industry recognises that those who don't pass on the benefits will suffer as consumers are sure to switch to those who reduce prices.There are, however, concerns that some of the sectors, where cartelisation has been a concern, and insurance, where industry is worried over the withdrawal of input tax credit, may not transfer all the gains to the consumer.An official said public sector insurance companies, which include the four general insurers and the behemoth LIC, have been asked to pass on the entire benefit of exemption to consumers - a move that will make it tough for private players to avoid doing so. The GST Council led by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has decided to exempt life and health insurance purchased by individuals from GST, a huge gain given that these covers currently attract 18% tax.With the GST on cement has been lowered from 28% to 18%, a long-standing demand from the sector, the price of every bag is expected to come down by Rs 25 to Rs 30, JM Financial estimated.""The good news is that every sector has committed that in the interest of consumers, faster growth and expanding the market, they will pass on the entire benefit to consumers. It is difficult for a set of companies to come together and hold back the benefit since consumers know GST has been lowered,"" commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said.Several companies, including Amul, Mondelez, Godrej Consumer Products and Colgate, have committed to ensuring that cuts flow through to shoppers. Meanwhile, industry chambers called on companies to reduce prices, in line with the tax cuts. Ficci senior vice-president Anant Goenka said the lobby group will work with its members to ensure the benefits are passed on to consumers.CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee, too, said that industry will act swiftly to lower prices and lift demand and create jobs.""Assocham encourages industry to pass on these benefits to the consumers, which will help increase consumption and thereby drive a virtuous economic cycle,"" added the industry body's president Sanjay Nayar.","Nda mps have been asked to keep a tab to ensure the gains are not pocketed by companies.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.

New Income Tax Bill 2025 : Representing a historic milestone in India’s tax landscape, Hon. Finance Minister – Madam Nirmala Sitharaman has presented the Income Tax Bill, 2025 (Bill) in the Parliament on 13 February 2025.The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago. With passage of time there were multiple amendments made to the law. Many believed this resulted in the current Act becoming difficult to read, complex to interpret and resulted in unwarranted litigation as well. Hence, it was indeed an opportune time to embark on an exercise to simplify the same. While an attempt was made to this effect a decade ago with the draft Direct Tax Code (DTC) – it never became legislation.Globally as well, countries like the UK, Australia etc., had undertaken similar exercises to enhance clarity and compliance in their taxation laws. Hence, a new simplified income tax law in India was definitely the need of the hour.Also Read | ITR filing with latest income tax slabs post Budget 2025: Will taxpayers with income below Rs 12 lakh have to file tax return? The Bill is prepared by investing more than 60,000 man-hours and has 23 chapters and 2.6 lakh words in comparison to 46 chapters and 5.12 lakh words respectively when compared with the Current Act. The number of Sections has also dramatically reduced from 800 plus sections to 536 Sections only.Secondly the language used in the Bill at many places is extremely lucid and is reader friendly as it has tables and formulas as against the traditional verbose style.One of the most significant aspects of the Bill is the elimination of the concepts of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. India is trying to join the league of comparable tax jurisdictions by using one single term ‘tax year’. The current terms of previous year and assessment year was apparently leading to mistakes by taxpayers while filing forms/ challans etc. With now only one term “tax year” it will hopefully avoid confusion.Largely, there are no changes to the definition of residency or even salary related provisions for that matter. In fact the choice of the two tax regimes continues to be available to individual taxpayers. There is no change to the tax rates and capital gains tax regime also remains the same.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: Top 30 FAQs every taxpayer should check TDS and TCS provisions have been made easier to comprehend by providing tables instead of the existing provisions which have lengthy texts that are open to interpretation issues and quite often difficult to understand. The Bill now also gives the ability for individuals to apply for a Lower or NIL rate of TCS while they purchase a car, pay for foreign tour, or make remittance abroad under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the Reserve Bank of India.It is also interesting to note that elaborate provisions have been enunciated for dealing with transition from the current Act to the new law.There is a clear focus on encouragement of compliance with the mantra of “Trust first, scrutinize later” – as stated by Hon. FM in her recent Feb 2025 Budget speech.As and when the Bill is enacted, the administrative measures for implementing them will be made operational (e.g., publishing of rules, IT infrastructure revamp etc.), keeping in mind the convenience of taxpayers and all stakeholders. For the common man, it is anticipated that the Bill will help in easy understanding of law and smoother tax compliances.","New income tax bill: largely, there are no changes to the definition of residency or even salary related provisions for that matter.
