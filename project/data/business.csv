"Railways sees FY27 passenger, freight earnings rise, but FY26 falls short of Budget target",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railways-lowers-target-for-passenger-revenue-may-earn-less-from-freight-too/articleshow/127960773.cms,"Union railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw (PTI photo)

to Rs 75,368 crore

NEW DELHI: Railways has estimated its earnings from passenger movement at Rs 87,300 crore in 2026-27, little over 9% more than the revised estimate (RE) of current financial year as it continues to introduce more new-age Vande Bharat chair car and sleeper trains, and Amrit Bharat trains, in addition to to adding of other conventional trains.However, it has lowered the revenue from passenger transport for this year than the Budget Estimate (BE) of Rs 92,800 crore, due to nearly 10.6% fall in kms that people travelled or will travel by March 2026.Similarly, in the freight segment, the ministry has estimated earning of around Rs 1.88 lakh crore in FY 27, same that osf BE of FY26 and 6% higher than the RE of current fiscal year. Data also show that railways is likely to end up generating around Rs 1.78 lakh crore by March, around 5.5% less than the target it had set for the current year.Significantly, the revenue from goods transport is set to fall short of target despite railways not lowering the freight loading target of 1,700 million for this year. Data indicates that the revenue fall is due to a reduction of around 1% fall in the distance of goods transported by railways, meaning there may be a shorter distance than what railways had initially estimated.Responding to a question on the earnings of the national transporter, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Monday it has continued to increase revenue both from passenger and freight movement. He added that the revenue from passenger movement has increased from Rs 70,693 crore in FY 24in 2024-25 and the RE for FY 26 is Rs 80,000 crore. Similarly, in the freight segment, revenue has increased from Rs 1.68 lakh crore in FY 24 to Rs 1.71 lakh crore in 2024-25 and it has been pegged at Rs 1.78 lakh crore in the RE of this fiscal year.On why the railways is unlikely to meet the BE target, Vaishnaw said govt always sets an “aspirational” target so that everyone works hard to perform better than earlier. He added that railways has continued registering net revenue for the past three years, which shows how well the national transporter is running its day-to-day operations.As per the Budget document, with higher income, railways estimates to improve its operating ratio (OR) from 98.82% in the current fiscal year to 98.4% in FY 27. OR indicates the money spent for earning every Rs 100. The railways aims to close the next fiscal with Rs 3,000 crore net revenue, around 35% higher than Rs 1,957 crore estimates for FY 26.","Railways has estimated its earnings from passenger movement at rs 87,300 crore in 2026-27.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday accused the BJP-led central government of denying funds to the state, and said her government had still ensured in the budget that welfare and development programmes continued.Speaking at a press conference a day after the state budget was announced, Banerjee said, “Despite the state being financially deprived by the Centre, we have brought in a pro-people budget.”The chief minister also criticised the Union Budget and compared it with the state’s budget, saying, “Our budget is pro-people, not directionless and rudderless like the Union Budget.”A day earlier, the West Bengal Assembly presented an interim budget of Rs 4.06 lakh crore for the 2026-27 financial year. The budget comes less than three months before the Assembly elections.The budget includes cash support and allowance increases for women, youth and frontline workers. One of the key announcements was an increase in the monthly grant under the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme by Rs 500 from February this year. The state has allocated Rs 15,000 crore for the scheme.The move is seen as a major welfare measure, especially for women, who make up nearly half of the state’s voters. The scheme has been a key programme of the Trinamool Congress government.","West bengal assembly presented an interim budget of rs 4.06 lakh crore for the 2026-27 financial year.

CBDT chairman told told PTI in a post-Budget interaction.“And insofar as presumptive tax cases, about 97 per cent of the taxpayers have moved to the new tax regime. For corporates, about 60 per cent of the income is now being reflected in the new tax regime,” Agrawal said.The CBDT chief said policy changes announced in the FY27 Budget, particularly related to Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT), could further accelerate migration to the new system.MAT, which applies to companies, is calculated at 15 per cent of book profits when it exceeds normal tax liability. The Budget has proposed treating MAT as final tax and reducing the rate to 14 per cent from 15 per cent for companies continuing under the old regime.On the proposed increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT), Agrawal said the measure is expected to moderate aggressive derivatives trading activity among retail participants.“Only time would tell how much it would curb, but this is an attempt from the department and the government to actually at least address this issue and flag this issue,” he said.Under Budget 2026-27 proposals, STT on futures contracts will be increased to 0.05 per cent from 0.02 per cent. STT on options premium and options exercise is proposed to be raised to 0.15 per cent from 0.1 per cent and 0.125 per cent, respectively.Agrawal said he remains confident that the revised direct tax collection target of Rs 24.21 lakh crore for FY26 will be achieved.The old tax regime refers to the pre-2020 income tax structure, which allows multiple deductions and exemptions but carries higher tax rates.

Maximising returns

MUMBAI: Life Insurance Corporation will soon take measures to increase the yield on its real estate assets, which have a book value of Rs 16,000 crore post-revaluation and a market value of over Rs 45,000 crore. Officials said that while real estate typically yields 3-4%, the capital gains are much higher. The corporation has also shelved plans to acquire a strategic stake in a health insurance company.Addressing a press conference after the board meeting, the corporation’s MD & CEO R Doraiswamy said LIC has decided to go slow on its earlier announced plan of entering the health insurance business, which was announced by his predecessor.“There was a plan to enter as a strategic investor in a standalone health insurance company to understand the market. But while evaluating options, we find it is not immediately required. So we are not moving fast. As and when we find a suitable opportunity, we will look at it,” he said.Officials said LIC is reviewing its entire real estate portfolio to identify ways to enhance yields. It indicated that selling properties is not the immediate priority and the focus is on strengthening income generation from the assets.Officials said the insurer is also open to examining new structures, including options such as Reit-like models, although no decision has been taken yet.In her Budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the govt would accelerate recycling of significant real estate assets of central public sector enterprises through the setting up of dedicated Reits.For the quarter ended Dec 2025, the corporation reported standalone net profit of Rs 12,958 crore, up 17.2% from Rs 11,056 crore in the corresponding year-ago period.Profit before tax rose 16.7% to Rs 12,897 crore from Rs 11,056 crore, according to the insurer’s reviewed standalone financial results. Net premium income rose 17.5% to Rs 1,25,613 crore from Rs 1,06,891 crore, supported by growth in new business and single premium products.The corporation has not yet taken a call on selling stake in NSE, where it is a major shareholder, in the forthcoming IPO.","Life insurance corporation will soon take measures to increase the yield on its real estate assets.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Traders bristle at higher STT



The other losers



The indirect tax tweaks you’ll feel in daily life



So where does populism fit in?



If past Union Budget s were shaped by tax reforms and progressive personal tax restructuring, then Budget 2026 is more about firefighting, shielding the economy from global shocks, managing uncertainty and rebuilding confidence amid a volatile international environment.With no dramatic fiscal stress to respond to, Budget 2026 shifted attention to longer-term priorities while maintaining continuity in fiscal management.In the past years, the government had already delivered significant personal income tax relief, including raising the exemption limit to spur consumption, and had steadily ramped up capital expenditure to position infrastructure and connectivity as key engines of growth.This year, the emphasis was less on fresh giveaways and more on preparing the ground for the next growth cycle.The Budget came at a time when the global economy was adjusting to the growing weight of the Global South, with India on the threshold of becoming the world’s third-largest economy.Such a transition inevitably brought trade frictions, protectionist pressures and geopolitical realignments. Against this backdrop, India made notable progress on the trade front, including a landmark, win-win agreement with the European Union, even as it grappled with higher tariffs and shifting global trade rules.The Budget also underlined the urgency of scaling up investments in artificial intelligence, accelerating innovation and adoption, and equipping India’s youth with new-age skills.The proposals aligned closely with the expectations set out in the Economic Survey 2025–26, with a clear push to lower input costs and enhance manufacturing competitiveness through rationalisation of customs duties, easier access to finance and measures to attract non-resident capital.That shift in confidence explained why this year’s Budget resisted headline-grabbing populism. There were no sweeping giveaways, no dramatic income-tax cuts and no sudden expansion of welfare promises.Taken together, Budget 2026 was less about managing immediate risks and more about building resilience and capability for the years ahead. It reflected an economy that was cautiously confident, forward-looking and focused on shaping its place in a rapidly changing global order.The emphasis was firmly on public investment, long-term structural reforms and improving the efficiency of existing systems.Budget 2026 is about setting the direction!One of the clearest markers of non-populism is the fiscal stance.Budget 2025 prioritised consolidation in an uncertain global environment, pegging the fiscal deficit at 4.4% of GDP. Budget 2026 continues along the same path, estimating the deficit at a slightly lower 4.3% of GDP for FY27.More importantly, the government has added clarity on its medium-term intent. The Budget explicitly outlines a glide path towards a 50% ±1% debt-to-GDP ratio by 2030, a level that offers long-term fiscal credibility without choking growth.DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor, EY India, told TOI that, ""The pace of fiscal consolidation has moderated in the FY27 Budget. After achieving a reduction of 40 basis points from 4.8% of GDP in FY25 to 4.4% in FY26 (RE), the reduction in FY27 (BE) is only 10 basis points, taking the FY27 fiscal deficit to 4.3% of GDP.""""This moderation is due to a fall in the GoI’s gross tax revenues to GDP ratio… which translates into a fall in GoI’s non-debt receipts relative to GDP,"" he added.If there is one area where Budget 2026 is emphatic, it is capital expenditure.Public capex rises to Rs 12.2 lakh crore for FY27, up from Rs 11.2 lakh crore in the current year and just Rs 2 lakh crore in FY15. Over a decade, this marks a structural shift towards state-led asset creation as the main engine of growth.But this year’s Budget goes beyond simply writing bigger cheques. The emphasis is equally on how capital is deployed and how private investment is drawn in alongside public spending.New institutional mechanisms aim to reduce risk and improve returns for private players, while innovative approaches to asset monetisation seek to unlock value from existing public assets.At the same time, continued investment in freight corridors, inland waterways and coastal shipping underscores a push to improve logistics efficiency.Taken together, these measures signal a shift from ""how much we spend"" to ""how effectively we spend"".Support for manufacturing is another area where Budget 2026 moves away from populism.While Budget 2025 relied heavily on sector-specific incentives, Budget 2026 broadens the approach by strengthening supporting systems. Electronics, semiconductors, defence manufacturing and supply chains receive targeted support, largely via customs duty tweaks rather than blanket subsidies.Defence sees a sharp rise, with an allocation of Rs 7.84 lakh crore for FY27, up 15.3% from last year. The focus remains on modernisation, capacity building and domestic procurement rather than symbolic announcements.Agriculture follows a familiar path. The emphasis is on productivity, technology adoption and value chains across fisheries, horticulture and allied activities. There are no major market reforms or income-linked populist support mechanisms.In social sectors—health, education, skills, tourism and culture—the Budget favours targeted capacity creation over universal giveaways, from medical hubs and allied health professionals to creative economy labs and university townships.For individual taxpayers, Budget 2026 stands out more for continuity than change.Income-tax slabs remain unchanged under both old and new regimes. There is no tinkering with surcharge or cess. This follows last year’s major relief, which exempted income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime.Rather than fresh tax cuts, the Budget focuses on simplifying the tax system and easing compliance.A key step in this direction is the rollout of the New Income Tax Act, 2025, which will come into effect from April 2026. The government has indicated that the new law will be supported by simpler rules and redesigned return forms aimed at reducing complexity and errors.Taxpayers will also get more breathing room through extended timelines for filing returns and for making revisions, a move intended to reduce penalties arising from procedural lapses.In addition, approvals for lower or nil tax deduction at source (TDS) will increasingly be handled through automated, rule-based systems, limiting discretion and speeding up the process.The Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) has been lowered to 14% from the earlier rate of 15%.Relief has also been provided on the outward flow of funds, with a reduction in tax collected at source (TCS) on overseas travel, foreign education and medical remittances.At the same time, individuals who did not disclose foreign non-immovable assets valued below Rs 20 lakh will receive immunity from prosecution, with retrospective effect from October 1, 2024.The philosophy is clear: make compliance easier, not flashier.Not everyone walks away happy. One area where Budget 2026 clearly hurt sentiment was the stock market.Market sentiment took a hit in the immediate aftermath of Budget 2026, with the sharpest reaction coming from the increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options.The announcement sparked heavy selling on Budget day, especially in stocks linked to trading activity, as higher transaction costs directly impact the profitability of frequent and leveraged trades.Both Indian benchmark indices, the Nifty50 and the BSE Sensex, plunged over 2% during the special trading session on Sunday.The Nifty50 closed at 24,825.45, down 593 points or 2.33%, while the BSE Sensex ended at 80,722.94, shedding 1,843 points or 2.23%.For active traders, the move is an undeniable negative, raising costs in a segment that thrives on high volumes and thin margins. However, seen through a policy lens, the intent appears less about extracting easy tax revenue and more about cooling excessive speculation in derivatives markets.""The only real negative in the Budget is the increase in STT on derivatives, and that’s what the market is reacting to in the short term. Overall, once the STT headline settles, the Budget should be seen as growth supportive,"" said Amisha Vora, PL Capital – Prabhudas Lilladher.Poll-bound states have voiced sharp dissatisfaction with the Union Budget, alleging a lack of targeted support. Last year, when Bihar was heading into assembly elections, the Centre announced the National Makhana Board with an initial allocation of Rs 100 crore.In contrast, this Budget avoided such election-linked announcements, drawing criticism from chief ministers of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, who said their states were overlooked.At the same time, shifting geopolitical priorities are visible in the numbers. The Budget makes no provision for Iran’s Chabahar port project and sharply cuts development assistance to Bangladesh, reflecting strained regional ties.On the corporate tax side, promoters face tighter scrutiny, with higher taxes on buybacks. The government has made clear that the move is aimed at curbing what it described as the ""improper use"" of buybacks as a tax-efficient route.Meanwhile, from May 1, 2026, the National Calamity Contingent Duty on chewing tobacco, jarda scented tobacco and other tobacco products, including gutkha, will be raised from 25% to 60%, even as the effective incidence is proposed to be kept at 25%.While direct taxes stay stable, indirect tax measures in Budget 2026 are expected to quietly influence everyday spending and consumer experience.One of the more immediate changes affects personal imports. The tariff rate on all dutiable goods brought in for personal use has been reduced from 20% to 10%. Once updated baggage rules are notified, this could lower the cost of items purchased abroad or carried back during international travel.Healthcare also sees some relief through customs duty exemptions.Basic customs duty has been removed on 17 drugs and medicines, and duty-free personal imports of drugs and food have been extended to cover seven additional rare diseases. For patients dealing with chronic or rare conditions, these steps could translate into lower out-of-pocket expenses over time.Changes to tax collection on overseas spending are likely to ease cash-flow pressures for families.The tax collected at source (TCS) on overseas tour packages has been cut to 2%, while TCS on remittances for foreign education and medical treatment has also been reduced to the same level.This directly benefits households sending children abroad for studies or incurring medical expenses overseas. The Budget also signals longer-term cost moderation through support for domestic manufacturing and clean energy.Customs duty exemptions on components used in microwave ovens, lithium-ion battery manufacturing and solar glass inputs are aimed at strengthening local production.While these may not result in immediate price reductions, they are designed to lower costs gradually and reduce import dependence.In the energy and transport space, duty exemptions on aviation components, incentives for biogas-blended CNG, and a renewed push for waterways and coastal shipping are intended to bring down logistics and fuel-related costs.Such measures typically take time to show results but eventually influence the prices of everyday goods through cheaper transportation.Beyond changes in duty rates, the Budget places strong emphasis on process reforms at customs.A single digital window for cargo clearance, faster approvals for food, drugs and plant products, immediate clearance for goods without compliance requirements, and wider use of AI-based non-intrusive scanning are expected to reduce delays and uncertainty.While these reforms operate behind the scenes, they reduce delays, costs and uncertainty, benefits consumers often feel without noticing the policy behind them.Compared to the last five Budgets, Budget 2026 ranks low on traditional populism. Between FY2021-22 and FY2025-26, India’s tax framework was steadily reshaped through headline-grabbing measures, particularly progressive personal tax relief that directly targeted middle-class sentiment.Middle-class taxpayers benefited from steady personal tax cuts, welfare outlays were expanded, and pandemic-era safety nets were reinforced.The new income-tax regime introduced in 2020 was gradually strengthened: Budgets 2021 and 2022 largely held rates steady, Budget 2023 made the new regime the default option while simplifying slabs and raising the basic exemption, and Budget 2024 enhanced the standard deduction for salaried taxpayers to Rs 75,000.Budget 2025 marked a clear break, dramatically lowering the direct tax burden on the middle class by fully exempting income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried individuals after deduction).Budget 2026, by contrast stands apart from that trajectory. Instead of extending tax relief or unveiling crowd-pleasing announcements, it reflects a shift in intent.Budget 2026 assumes that political capital has already been spent. It avoids large, vote-catching measures and instead doubles down on execution, predictability and long-term growth architecture.What makes finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth Budget distinctive is its refusal to choose between growth and discipline. Instead, it attempts a third path: sustained public investment backed by predictable fiscal behaviour.Effective capital expenditure keeps rising, revenue deficits continue to compress, and governance shifts toward automation, trust and verification rather than control.This is not a Budget designed to dominate headlines. It is designed to influence outcomes gradually and durably. Taken together, Budget 2026 reads less like a populist spectacle and more like a blueprint focused on systems, execution and changes that will matter quietly over time.The Budget also came amid clear momentum in India–US economic ties. Days before its presentation, signals from both sides pointed to progress, with commerce minister Piyush Goyal describing efforts to close the ""father of all deals.""That momentum crystallised on February 2, when US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would cut reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods to 18% following a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, effectively sealing the agreement.","Budget 2026 was less about managing immediate risks and more about building resilience and capability for the years ahead. It reflected an economy that was cautiously confident, forward-looking and focused on shaping its place in a rapidly changing global order.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127889118,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-77586,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

The Union Budget 2026 was largely in line with our modest expectations and underscored continuity in the government’s fiscal approach over the past five years, rather than delivering any high-impact near-term stimulus. The policy thrust remains firmly tilted toward public capex, with capital expenditure budgeted to rise 11.5% YoY to Rs 12.2t in FY27E, supporting sectors leveraged to the investment cycle.A key highlight was the government’s intent to attract global investment into data centres, which could drive incremental opportunities across digital infrastructure and utilities. Further, strategic sectors such as semiconductors and electronics manufacturing services, defence, chemicals, and select industrial manufacturing stand out as potential beneficiaries, aided by targeted incentives, production-linked schemes, and the development of dedicated industrial parks—reinforcing a constructive medium-term investment outlook.For the healthcare sector, the budget not only provides financial assistance but also highlights the government’s efforts to prepare Indian companies to gain business on global healthcare platforms.The measures to market ‘India’ for medical tourism, supported with enhancing the resource pool (doctors/nurses), would enable increased international patient flow. The government will support states in establishing five regional medical hubs in partnership with the private sector, which is expected to be supportive for large hospital operators with strong operational presence.The Union Budget 2026-27 reinforces the government’s commitment to promoting clean and emerging technologies across the energy value chain.Viability gap funding (VGF) support for battery energy storage systems (BESS) is proposed to increase sharply to Rs 10b, a tenfold rise from Rs 1b in FY26RE, which is positive for IPPs such as ACME Solar, which have undertaken BESS projects.The capital outlay for Defense was hiked to Rs 2.2t for FY27 (up 18% YoY) vs. Rs 1.9t in FY26RE. The Sharp 18% year-on-year increase in defense capital expenditure directly benefits indigenized defense electronics and order inflows.Bharat Electronics is well-positioned to capitalize on sizable orders including QRSAM, Akash-NG, next-generation corvettes, and base programs.Capital expenditure remains the central pillar of the Budget’s growth strategy. Central government capex rises to about Rs 12.2t in FY27, registering an 11.5% increase over the revised estimates for FY26.Larsen & Toubro’s prospect pipeline stands at a healthy Rs 5.9t, up 7% YoY, diversified across infrastructure, hydrocarbons, carbon, and hi-tech segments. Strategic focus on urban development, renewables, gas, AI, and data centres supports strong opportunity visibility across domestic and international markets.We are optimistic about the domestic tourism industry, with demand consistently exceeding pre-Covid levels. Hotel companies expanding into tier-II and below cities will benefit from the government’s push for tourism.Lemon Tree Hotels continues to demonstrate resilient performance, driven by strong ARR growth and strategic property additions. Aurika Mumbai and other flagship properties are expected to drive double-digit RevPAR growth in 2HFY26.The fact that the government would continue its infrastructure push is a key indirect positive for auto and auto ancillaries. The increase in PLI allocation, move toward establishment of rare earth corridor and provision of 4k e-buses for East Tourism highlight its continued focus on EV transition.We expect the auto segment to sustain its momentum on the back of a positive consumer sentiment, both in urban and rural and steady economic growth expected in FY27.The Union Budget 2026-27 gives a substantial manufacturing push (electronics and infrastructure) that should support demand for cables & wires. Long-term tax holiday until 2047 for foreign companies that provide cloud services globally using data centre infrastructure located in India – will attract investment in Indian data centre capacity, which would drive growth for cables. Polycab remains a strong structural play on India’s electrification, infrastructure and real estate upcycle.The Union Budget 2026-27 announcements and initiatives are aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and competitiveness in the Indian EMS sector. The introduction of an ISM 2.0, Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS), Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS), EMC/EMC2.0 and doubling of outlay under the ECMS scheme promote cost-efficient manufacturing.These steps should position India as a growing hub for electronics production, offering significant growth opportunities. EMS companies will leverage these initiatives by expanding domestic production.Capex for FY27BE is pegged at Rs 12.2t, compared to Rs 11.0t in FY26RE. The infrastructure sector accounts for ~60% of the total domestic steel demand, with construction at ~20% and automobiles at ~8%.Domestic steel demand is expected to improve with higher capex and recent GST rate cuts on auto, consumer durables and other sectors. Tata Steel is well placed to benefit from improving steel realizations, operating efficiencies, and robust domestic demand.Cement demand has improved after remaining weak for 1.5 years. Industry volume grew ~7-8% YoY in 3QFY26, with strong demand momentum after the monsoon and festive periods.The government's increased allocation to overall capex (up ~12% to Rs 12.2t vs. 2025-26RE) is expected to indirectly benefit cement demand. We now estimate industry volume growth to be ~8% YoY in FY26E (vs. earlier estimate of 6-7%). We believe Ultratech is well positioned to leverage the strong demand uptrend given its large scale of operation and strong brand equity.","The union budget 2026 reinforces the government’s commitment to promoting clean and emerging technologies across the energy value chain.

Stock market's panic-stricken sentiment on Budget Day

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

The Budget for FY 2026-27 is a mix of cautious and reform- oriented measures for stock market investors. The government proposed tougher norms for trading in futures and options, along with new opportunities for foreign Indian investors.During her speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an increase in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on Futures and Options (F&O), a change in the taxation regime for share buybacks, and improved access for non-resident Indians to equities.In a move aimed at discouraging excessive speculation in derivatives, the government has proposed a steep increase in Securities Transaction Tax on futures and options trades.The STT on futures will rise to 0.05 per cent from 0.02 per cent, while the tax on options premium and exercise of options will both increase to 0.15 per cent. Currently, these stand at 0.1 per cent and 0.125 per cent, respectively.Market participants say the higher transaction costs could dampen trading volumes, particularly among retail traders, arbitrageurs and short-term participants. The move comes amid regulatory concerns that a large majority of individual traders in the F&O segment continue to incur losses.Policymakers appear to be prioritising moderation in derivatives activity over revenue gains, especially as higher taxes may themselves reduce volumes.""The measured increase in STT on futures and options reflects a clear intent to curb excessive speculation, fostering a more stable market and encouraging sustainable participation from long-term retail and institutional investors,"" Vishal Kampani, vice chairman and managing director at JM Financial Ltd, told TOI.Meanwhile, talking about retail investors' perspective, Archit Gupta, Founder and CEO, ClearTax told TOI, ""The Budget’s hike in STT, by 150% on Futures and 50% on Options, sends a clear signal: the government wants to slow down excessive short-term trading. Even though STT collections stayed flat at around Rs 45,000 crore (from FY2425 to FY2625) against a Rs 78,000 crore target, the bigger story lies in the investor behaviour. Retail participation hasn’t fallen; it has evolved. With over 21 crore demat accounts and record SIP inflows of Rs 31,000 crore+ in 2025, we’re seeing a shift from frequent trading to long-term investing. The policy choice is clear - support steady capital formation over short-term transaction revenue.""The Budget also overhauled the taxation on share buybacks in a move said to be aimed at protecting minority shareholders and curb tax arbitrage by promoters.Share buyback, also known as share repurchase, is a process through which a company purchases its own outstanding shares from the market or directly from its shareholders. The primary reason for share buybacks is to distribute excess cash to the shareholders, improve financial ratios such as EPS, and/or express confidence in the future business operations of the company.In extension, a buyback tax is a imposed on companies when they repurchase their own shares from shareholders. Governments typically use this tax to discourage firms from returning profits through buybacks instead of distributing them as dividends.Buybacks will now be taxed as capital gains in the hands of all shareholders, replacing the earlier structure that often led to uneven tax outcomes. However, to control misuse, promoters will face an additional buyback tax, pushing the effective tax rate to 22 per cent for corporate promoters and 30 per cent for non-corporate promoters. ""Change in taxation of buyback was brought in to address the improper use of buyback route by promoters,"" said Sitharaman.Experts believe this could make buybacks less attractive for promoter groups and encourage companies to reconsider capital allocation strategies, possibly shifting toward dividends, capital expenditure or research and development. For individual investors, however, the change could mean a more favourable tax treatment compared to being taxed at the highest income slab rates earlier.Roop Bhootra, Whole-time Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers, said the proposal benefits individual shareholders, as their tax burden would fall from the highest slab rate of 30 per cent to capital gains tax rates — 20 per cent for short-term and 12.5 per cent for long-term gains. However, he noted that the move is negative for corporates, as it discourages buybacks and may prompt companies to deploy reserves toward capital expenditure or research and development instead, as quoted by PTI.The buyback tax framework currently in force was introduced in Budget 2024 and became effective from October 1, 2024. Under these rules, the tax burden on share buybacks was shifted from companies to shareholders. Amounts received by shareholders from a buyback are treated as dividend income and taxed according to the shareholder’s applicable income tax slab. The company undertaking the buyback is required to deduct Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) before making the payment.For resident individuals, TDS is deducted at 10 per cent if the buyback proceeds are Rs 5,000 or more. For non-resident individuals, TDS is deducted at 20 per cent, subject to relief under an applicable tax treaty.At the same time, the cost of acquisition of the shares tendered in the buyback is treated as a capital loss in the hands of the shareholder. This loss may be classified as short-term or long-term depending on the holding period and can be set off against other capital gains or carried forward for up to eight assessment years.In a market-friendly reform, the government has proposed allowing individual Persons Resident Outside India (PROI) to invest in shares of listed Indian companies through the Portfolio Investment Scheme.The investment limit for an individual PROI will be raised to 10 per cent from 5 per cent, while the overall cap for all such investors will increase to 24 per cent from the current 10 per cent.Market experts said the move could broaden India’s investor base, improve liquidity and bring in more stable, long-term capital. By attracting overseas Indians who understand domestic market dynamics, the reform may also help reduce dependence on more volatile institutional flows and support currency stability over time.To discourage borrowing for investments in the stock market and mutual funds, the finance minister has proposed disallowing the deduction of interest paid on such loans against investment income.Currently, investors who take loans to buy shares or mutual fund units can claim the interest paid as a deduction—up to 20% of the income earned—against dividends or other investment income, with the remaining amount taxed under ‘income from other sources’. Under the proposed change, this tax benefit would be withdrawn.Ameet Patel, chief risk partner at Manohar Chowdhry & Associates, said the move aligns with the government’s repeated concerns over excessive speculation in capital markets. “Time and again, we have heard from regulators and the government that there is too much speculation in the capital markets, which is not in the interest of common investors. This proposal is a clear move to discourage investors from borrowing money to invest in securities,” he said.Stock markets reacted sharply to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget 2026 speech, with the Nifty50 falling below 25,000 and the BSE Sensex dropping over 1,600 points in early trading. Investors were spooked by the hike in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options, which raised trading costs and prompted aggressive selling in brokerage, exchange, and high-volume market stocks. The performance did not improve much by closing. Sensex was at 1,546.84 points to close at 80,722.94, while the Nifty fell 495.20 points to settle at 24,825.45.The downturn quickly spread beyond derivatives-related counters, with heavyweights like Reliance Industries and State Bank of India also declining. Small- and mid-cap indices fell 2–3 per cent, reflecting broad-based risk aversion.While Budget 2026 supports infrastructure, manufacturing, and digital-led growth, the absence of capital gains tax relief and the STT hike create short-term headwinds.Narendra Solanki, Head of Fundamental Research – Investment Services at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Limited, talked about his view on why the stock markets were reacting sharply. “Markets witnessed a knee-jerk reaction following the unexpected hike in STT on Futures and Options, as hopes of a reduction in capital gains tax had already been priced in,” he said.Meanwhile, Somil Mehta, Head of Retail research at Mirae Asset Sharekhan gave his insights on how to navigate the volatality now saying, ""The Budget is clearly supportive of infrastructure, manufacturing, and digital-led themes. However, the absence of capital gains tax relief and the increase in STT create near-term headwinds for the broader market. Investors should remain selective, focus on quality sectors with strong policy visibility, and avoid aggressive short-term bets. """"Defensive allocation and long-term positioning remain key in navigating post-Budget volatility. Markets were expecting relief on LTCG and STCG taxation, but no proposals were announced, which may result in continued FII selling. Adding to the pressure, the hike in STT on futures and options acts as a broad-based negative for market sentiment. Positive sectors to watch Railways, Electronics, Semiconductors, Pharma, Metals & Mining, and Data Centers. Strategy is to stay diversified, focus on structural growth sectors, and maintain a cautious approach in the near term,"" he added.","The government has proposed a steep increase in securities transaction tax on futures and options trades. The move comes amid regulatory concerns that a large majority of individual traders in the f&o segment continue to incur losses. Market participants say the higher transaction costs could dampen trading volumes, particularly among retail traders.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127839645,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1614578,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
"Budget eases transfer pricing norms, signals friendlier tax regime for tech MNCs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-eases-transfer-pricing-norms-signals-friendlier-tax-regime-for-tech-mncs/articleshow/127862330.cms,"Budget 2026: Indian FM’s Huge Income Tax Announcement | Latest Slabs, Old & New Regime Rates

The Budget has rolled out a sweeping reset of India’s transfer pricing framework, aiming to cut litigation, improve tax certainty and make the country a more attractive base for multinational companies (MNCs) and global capability centres.Presenting the proposals, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced far-reaching reforms to safe harbour rules and Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs), with a sharp focus on the IT and technology-driven sectors.A key change is the consolidation of software development, IT-enabled services, KPO and contract R&D into a single category of “Information Technology Services”, with a uniform safe harbour margin of 15.5%. This replaces multiple, higher margins and is expected to address long-standing disputes around classification and profitability. Safe harbour refers to prescribed pricing margins under which tax authorities accept a company’s transfer pricing without scrutiny, giving taxpayers certainty and protection from disputes.The eligibility threshold for opting into safe harbour has also been raised sharply from Rs.300 crore to Rs. 2,000 crore, significantly widening coverage to include mid-sized and large IT service providers. Applications will move to an automated, rule-based approval process, eliminating officer-level examination, and companies can lock in safe harbour for up to five consecutive years.“These changes are expected to significantly reduce disputes and compliance burden for many multinational IT companies and global capability centres operating from India,” said Ameya Kunte, founder of Globeview Advisors, adding that the reduction in acceptable margins from the earlier 17–18% range to 15.5% is a major sweetener for industry.According to CBDT data, a total of 815 Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) have been concluded till March 2025. The 174 APAs signed in 2024-25 is the highest ever in a single year since the APA regime was launched in 2012. APAs help eliminate long-drawn disputes over transfer pricing by setting agreed pricing methodologies in advance.The budget proposals strengthen the APA program. It proposes fast-tracking unilateral APAs for IT services, with an endeavour to conclude cases within two years, extendable by six months at the taxpayer’s request — a sharp improvement over historical timelines that often stretched beyond three years.Another significant reform allows associated enterprises of an APA-covered taxpayer to file modified returns within three months of the agreement being signed, aligning group-level tax positions.“The amendment gives associated enterprises a statutory route to align their own returns with the agreed pricing. This may reduce instances of economic double taxation within the group and materially strengthen the effectiveness of the APA programme,” said Rahul Charkha, partner, Economic Laws Practice.To curb procedural disputes, the Budget also replaces the existing 60-day deadline for transfer pricing officers to pass orders with a clearer month-based timeline, a move aimed at eliminating interpretational litigation over limitation periods.Industry experts see the package as a decisive shift towards certainty-led tax administration. “The expansion of safe harbour, automated approvals and faster APAs reflect a strong policy intent to simplify compliance and significantly reduce litigation,” said Sandeep Bhalla, partner, Dhruva Advisors.","The budget has rolled out a sweeping reset of india’s transfer pricing framework. It aims to cut litigation, improve tax certainty and make the country a more attractive base for multinational companies.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveiled the Union Budget 2026 on February 1, setting out a clear roadmap for individual taxpayers. While personal income tax rates and the broader structure of taxation stays untouched, the Budget introduced a range of reforms to further simplify the process for taxpayers. The measures focus on easing return-filing timelines, reducing tax collection at source on select transactions, and addressing long-standing practical difficulties faced by small taxpayers. The Budget also had measures for foreign asset holders.The finance minister said that the government completed a comprehensive overhaul of the existing tax law and is preparing taxpayers for a smoother transition. “In July 2024, I announced a comprehensive review of the Income Tax Act, 1961. This was completed in a record time and the Income Tax Act, 2025 will come into effect from 1st April, 2026,” she said.She added that compliance under the new framework is expected to be simpler. “The simplified Income Tax Rules and Forms will be notified shortly, giving adequate time to taxpayers to acquaint themselves with its requirements. The forms have been redesigned such that ordinary citizens can comply without difficulty,” Sitharaman said.The slab rates for individuals under both the new and old tax regimes will remain untouched in Budget 2026-2027. There are no proposed changes to education cess or surcharge either.Filing timelines for returns have been revised. Individuals filing ITR-1 and ITR-2 will continue to have a deadline of July 31, while non-audit business cases and trusts will now be allowed to file returns up to August 31. The window for revising returns will also be extended from December 31 to March 31, subjected to payment of a nominal fee.Tax collected at source on overseas tour packages will be reduced to a flat 2%, replacing the earlier 5% and 20 percent rates, irrespective of the amount spent. TCS on remittances for self-funded foreign education and overseas medical treatment under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme will also be reduced from 5% to 2%.For small taxpayers seeking nil or lower TDS certificates, a fully automated, rule-based approval mechanism will be introduced, replacing the current application-based process involving tax officers.Manpower services will now clearly fall under payments to contractors for TDS purposes, removing any confusion. TDS on these services will be charged at either 1% or 2%.To simplify matters for taxpayers holding securities across multiple companies, the FM proposed depositories to be collected Form 15G or Form 15H from investors and submit it directly to the respective companies.A one-time, six-month foreign asset disclosure scheme has been proposed to address issues faced by students, young professionals, tech employees and individuals relocating to or returning to India. The scheme covers two categories of taxpayers.At the same time, individuals who did not disclose foreign non-immovable assets valued below Rs 20 lakh will receive immunity from prosecution, with retrospective effect from October 1, 2024.Persons resident outside India will be permitted to invest in listed Indian equities through the Portfolio Investment Scheme, with the individual investment limit raised from 5% to 10% and the overall cap increased from 10% to 24%.For sale of immovable property involving non-residents, resident buyers can deduct and deposit tax deducted at source (TDS) using PAN-based challan, removing the need for a TAN and thus simplifying compliance.To attract global expertise, an exemption on foreign-sourced income has been granted to experts visiting India for up to five years, subject to conditions. The individual must have been a non-resident for the preceding five years, provide services under a government-notified scheme and meet other prescribed requirements.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman unveiled the union budget 2026 on february 1, setting out a clear roadmap for individual taxpayers.

How will a person who has an income Rs 12 lakh benefit from new rates?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said.

With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden.Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime.
