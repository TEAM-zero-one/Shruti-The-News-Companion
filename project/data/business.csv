Those using ITR 3 and 4, including bizmen, professionals, freelancers and those under presumptive taxation, will get extra month to file returns, with the deadline extended to Aug 31,

CBDT chairman Ravi Agrawal

tells TOI . Excerpts:

What will be your strategy to achieve the target?

What kind of red flags?

What about widening the tax base?

What is the volume of data and how do you handle and ensure security of this data?

What would be the deadline for filing tax for a certain category of taxpayers?

How many taxpayers have shifted to the new tax regime?

There was some adverse market reaction on STT on the first day. Has that settled down? Will it be reviewed?

■ The target for the next year is based on a nominal GDP growth of 10%, and above that is tax buoyancy (tax growth as a ratio of GDP expansion). The tax buoyancy that is being projected is reasonable. Therefore, we should not find any problem in achieving that target.We have ushered in a lot of initiatives to bring in trust, and taxpayers are responding to it. There is greater focus on promoting better compliance because that means more conversion of data into revenue. If you can do that, it helps widen the tax base and also deepen it.We will have a new Income Tax Act, which is simpler. The sentiment will be positive and that will help bring more clarity into the processes and trigger higher compliance. We will notify rules and forms in Feb. It will simplify processes in the sense that forms will be made smarter and aligned with tax returns or audit reports to take care of disconnects and discrepancies, if any. It will be easy to identify red flags.■ Red flags like incorrect claims or not incorporating certain income. We have data and we can tally that. Analytics will help. The process will be strengthened. All this will send a strong message to the taxpayer community that you need to be consistent.That process has been initiated, and people are responding to it.■ When you talk about widening, there is also an element of deepening. Deepening is when I ought to report X, but I have reported X by 2. In that case, the return should reflect higher income than what has been shown. Widening is to expand base. It is not just about people who file returns, but also those who have paid taxes (via TDS or TCS) but did not file returns.There is a third category too: where you have certain information and those people have neither made a tax payment nor filed returns. You need to move scientifically; deep analysis has to be done, and where data is mature, you can act. Our NUDGE exercise is a step in that direction.We have got a very satisfactory response. In the last two years, 1.1 crore people have either updated their returns or revised them, yielding additional revenue of Rs 8,800 crore. Of this, Rs 1,750 crore are cases where refund claims have been reduced. All this has been done in a very non-intrusive way and based on data available with us. Widening and deepening depend on TDS outreach and data sharing among departments.■ There are 650 crore data pieces of transactions that the department handles on a yearly basis. We are in favour of getting more data. The department is only using data on transactions that have been done. The data is 100% secure and there is a process.■ Right now, for ITR 1 to 4 and part of ITR 5 that is not audited, the due date is July 31. For ITR 1 and 2, we will retain July 31, and for ITR 3 and 4, we will shift it to August 31. We often get complaints about bunching. This is how you stagger compliance and make it easier. We will allow taxpayers to revise till March.■ In assessment year 2024-25 (FY24), it was 76%, and in AY 25-26 (FY25), 88% of taxpayers moved to the new tax regime.■ The market shows that. There is nothing as of now.","Those using itr 3 and 4, including bizmen, professionals, freelancers, will get extra month to file returns, with the deadline extended to aug 31.

A Chance to Build a Future-Ready Indirect Tax System

India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities. While GST and Customs digitalisation have undeniably transformed the landscape, companies continue to face operational bottlenecks that slow down activity, tie up working capital and drive up compliance costs. These factors directly affect the country’s ease of doing business.In this backdrop, the 56th GST Council meeting marked significant progress by tackling several long-standing pain points. Union Budget 2026 now has an opportunity to build on this momentum and deliver a tax ecosystem that is faster, more consistent and easier for businesses to navigate.A key long pending ask and expectation from the upcoming Budget is a more flexible and business-friendly input tax credit (ITC) system. Companies have long argued that credits representing taxes genuinely paid and used in business operations should be freely available or refunded.Two specific asks remain critical:Allowing smoother credit flow across GST registrations would also unlock meaningful liquidity for enterprises.The recent GST Council decision to treat intermediary services as exports (therefore removing the GST levy) is a welcome step and industry now awaits its formal implementation as a part of the budget process.Businesses are also expecting similar clarity for R&D and testing services, which currently attract 18% GST because place-of-performance rules prevent them from being classified as exports. A consistent and globally aligned export definition would boost India’s competitiveness in high-value service segments.Compliance complexity remains a major concern with an expectation that multiplicity of proceedings would be addressed. A single, centralised audit and faceless assessment system, similar to the efficient model used under the erstwhile service tax regime, would give pan India businesses one point of engagement, reduce repetitive scrutiny and minimise conflicting interpretations across States.Large taxpayers would particularly benefit from a centralized single point of contact approach by way of:A uniform, risk-based audit framework would further enhance consistency and limit unnecessary scrutiny. Equally important is a more calibrated enforcement approach; one that acts firmly against evasion but avoids punitive measures such as asset attachments or frequent detention of goods in cases involving interpretational differences or procedural lapses. A clearer differentiation between wilful violations and good-faith positions will go a long way in restoring business confidence.For India’s smallest enterprises, current GST registration thresholds (₹20 lakh for services and ₹40 lakh for goods) no longer reflect today’s cost structures. Near-decade-high inflation has pushed many micro-businesses into the GST net perhaps far earlier than intended. Raising the threshold to reflect current realities would preserve working capital and support MSME viability.On the Customs side, businesses continue to face prolonged timelines in dispute resolution, with legacy cases stretching for years and delaying investment decisions. A time-bound settlement mechanism, similar to earlier dispute-resolution schemes, would help clear the backlog and allow both industry and the department to focus on priority matters.Businesses are also seeking greater certainty through longer-validity advance rulings and simpler renewals, so long-term projects are not disrupted by tax disputes merely on account of lapse of time.Operational friction also remains a day-to-day challenge at the border. Even after goods are cleared, companies often face manual processes to pay differential duties or correct documents for host of reasons including price variation, corrections. Allowing digital payments and online amendments, and ensuring such payments qualify for GST credit, would reduce compliance effort and minimise cash-flow disruptions.Cross-border businesses are also looking for clearer, time-bound guidelines around Special Valuation Branch (SVB) proceedings. While scrutiny of related-party pricing is necessary, inconsistent practices often create uncertainty for global supply chains. Predictable timelines and uniform standards are essential if India is to position itself as a reliable global hub.Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units seeking to sell into the domestic market face a structural disadvantage, as duties are levied without fully recognising that these units often use domestic inputs. Aligning duty calculations to reflect only the imported content, and/ or extending select benefits available under free trade agreements, would improve capacity utilisation and offer SEZs a more level playing field vis-à-vis foreign suppliers.Budget 2026 offers an opportunity not just for incremental fixes but for meaningful reform that strengthens India’s indirect tax architecture. The foundation laid by GST and recent digitalisation efforts is robust. What businesses now need is a system that is simpler, more consistent and aligned with the needs of a rapidly expanding economy.If India gets this right, indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.","Indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.

Union Budget 2026-27 shakes up NRI money: What Indians in UAE must do now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/union-budget-2026-27-shakes-up-nri-money-what-indians-in-uae-must-do-now/articleshow/127882046.cms,"India Budget 2026-27: NRI Investment, Property, Remittance Changes for UAE Residents

Easier and larger equity investments

Individual PROIs can now invest up to 10% directly in a listed Indian company (up from 5%).

The aggregate cap, total share that all PROIs can hold, has been raised to 24% from 10%.

Budget 2026 Overview: What Citizens And Businesses Should Know

Simpler tax compliance in property sales

TDS for sales of immovable property by NRIs will now be deducted and deposited using the resident buyer’s PAN, instead of needing a separate TAN. This streamlines compliance and reduces friction in cross-border property deals.

For diaspora Indians holding real estate in India, this is a significant administrative simplification that can cut delays and costs in selling or transferring property.

Cost-effective overseas travel and education remittances

TCS on overseas tour packages has been cut to 2% (from 5–20%).

Under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), TCS for education and medical payments is also now 2%.

Expanded investment access and portfolio options

NRIs can directly invest in Indian equities under the PIS framework, a pathway previously less accessible without intermediaries.

This supports a trend where diaspora investors are increasingly engaging with domestic markets, not just through mutual funds or FPIs but through direct share ownership, enhancing their financial footprint in India.

Compliance relief and tax procedure simplification

TDS on property sales by NRIs will be streamlined via PAN.

Certain foreign asset disclosure requirements have been relaxed with a one-time amnesty window, allowing individuals to regularise previously undisclosed overseas assets, albeit with penalties for larger values.

Tax filing processes, including extended deadlines and automated procedures, were introduced to reduce compliance burdens.

Why this matters for NRIs in the UAE

Lower TCS means more cost-effective travel and education remittances, a big deal for families and students abroad.

Simpler property tax compliance removes administrative barriers that often delay deals.

Higher investment limits give UAE-based Indians a broader role in India’s equity markets.

As India’s Union Budget 2026–27 was unveiled on February 01, 2026, NRIs including millions living in the UAE found a mix of relief, opportunities and compliance changes that could reshape how they invest, remit money, sell property and engage with the Indian economy. Read on as we breakdown the practical implications for UAE-based NRIs in finance, property and cross-border money flowsOne of the most talked-about changes is that the investment limit for Persons Resident Outside India (PROIs), a category that includes NRIs, has been doubled:This means that UAE-based Indians can build larger stakes in Indian equities without going through complex foreign portfolio investor (FPI) routes, offering greater flexibility for long-term wealth creation and portfolio diversification.Property transactions involving NRIs have long been cumbersome due to procedural requirements like obtaining a Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) account number (TAN). Budget 2026 eliminates this hurdle:The Budget introduces substantial reductions in Tax Collected at Source ( TCS ), a tax levied on certain overseas remittances, including travel, education and medical treatment:For UAE NRIs who frequently send money home for children’s studies, family trips or healthcare, this lowers the upfront tax cost and improves cash flow, especially for large remittances.The budget also aims to broaden how NRIs can invest in India beyond traditional routes:Several procedural reforms benefit NRIs, particularly those balancing cross-border income reporting and asset holdings:These changes signal the government’s intent to ease administrative pressure on NRIs and align cross-border financial activity with modern standards.The budget’s philosophy goes beyond narrow tax tweaks: it reflects a continuity and stability approach that appeals to global Indian investors and expatriates. Financial leaders have described the Budget 2026 as pragmatic and growth-oriented, easing tax burdens while ensuring fiscal discipline, which boosts investor confidence in India’s long-term economic trajectory, a critical factor for NRIs considering large investments or business engagements.This is especially relevant in the UAE, where many Indians balance overseas income with Indian assets, equities and property portfolios. The absence of new taxes on remittances or overseas income, confirmed by analysts, signals that India is not tightening access but rather fine-tuning it for global engagement.For many diaspora Indians in the UAE, a community marked by significant remittances, property ownership and cross-border investments, Budget 2026 represents a shift toward ease, access and cost efficiency:Compliance modernisation reduces friction for NRIs juggling dual economic identities. In short, this budget makes India more welcoming to its global diaspora, not by cutting benefits recklessly, but by reducing barriers and aligning policy with the realities of cross-border economic life.For UAE-based Indians, the Union Budget 2026 is not just another fiscal exercise, it is a diaspora-friendly, growth-oriented package that simplifies taxation, expands investment opportunity and eases the cost of global financial ties to India. Whether you are investing in Indian stocks, selling property back home, paying for children’s education or planning travel, the new rules offer relief and a clearer framework for engagement.","India’s union budget 2026–27 was unveiled on february 01, 2026.
