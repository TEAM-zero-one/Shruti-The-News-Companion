Rahul Gandhi Targets Modi Over Us Textile Tariffs, Bjp Fires Back

NEW DELHI: Accusing the Modi govt of fudging data to present a rosy picture, Congress on Tuesday expressed concern over the state of the Indian economy in the wake of what it called is questionable growth and production coupled with rising inequality and dimming welfare.Ahead of the President’s joint address to Parliament, economic survey and Union budget, Congress released its “real state of the economy 2026 report” to put “facts” before the people as the govt would indulge in “propaganda” in the coming days.Congress spokespersons Rajeev Gowda and Amitabh Dubey released the annual report with the title “inequality on the rise, welfare in retreat”.“IMF gave India’s statistics a C grade. 0.5% inflation rate is not the reality of people’s lives. Former economic advisor Arvind Subramanian calculates that GDP figures are at least 2.5% higher than actual reality,” the spokespersons said.Questioning govt data, Gowda said manufacturing in the first half of 2025-26 grew at 8.4%, but the Index of Eight Core Industries showed only 2.9% growth. At the same time, he said the Rupee has been Asia’s worst performing currency in 2025.Congress said the most alarming fact is that between 2017-18 and 2023-24, the share of workers in manufacturing fell from 12.1% to 11.4%, while it rose in agriculture from 44.1% to 46.1%.“Job growth is concentrated in low value, informal, and gig economy,” it said.Expressing concern over “rising inequality”, Gowda said the top 10% capture 58% of national income while the bottom half receives only 15%. He said the top 10% own 65% of India's wealth. Alongside, he said, four of five Indians subsist on less than Rs 200 per day.Gowda and Dubey said net household financial savings are at a five-decade low of 5.2% while household debt has sharply risen to 41% from 35% in 2019.Congress said the best welfare net for the poor was MGNREGA but the job scheme has now been dismantled which will hurt the deprived sections the most.","Congress accuses the modi govt of fudging data to present a rosy picture.

End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

NEW DELHI: Union minister of parliamentary affairs Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday made it clear that the government will not roll back the newly introduced VB–GRAM–G law, stating that the Parliament cannot “reverse gear” on legislation already placed before the nation.The statement comes even as opposition parties pressed for wider debates during the upcoming Budget Session Rijiju was speaking to reporters after an all-party meeting held ahead of the Budget Session of Parliament. The meeting was chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh and attended by senior leaders, including Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha JP Nadda, ministers Arjun Ram Meghwal and L Murugan and floor leaders of various parties.“Once law is before the nation, we have to follow it. We can’t reverse gear and go back to the past. It cannot happen,” he said.Setting the government’s priorities for the session, Rijiju said the focus would remain on budgetary business. “We have noted the suggestions given by floor leaders of various parties. As per the rules, the discussions should revolve around the Budget only,” he said.He said the Budget Session, the first Parliament session of the year, will begin with the President’s address to a joint sitting, followed by the tabling of the Economic Survey on January 29 and presentation of the Union Budget on February 1.“Since this is a Budget Session, the main focus of this session will be on the budget,” Rijiju said, while urging parties to ensure smooth functioning of Parliament.Responding to opposition demands for discussions on multiple issues, including new UGC guidelines, Rijiju said the government was not averse to debate but stressed constitutional responsibilities.“Why should we talk about just one issue? The government is always ready to discuss various issues. However, this is Budget Session, we have to pass the Budget, run the country, serve the people,” he said.The union minister also rejected allegations that the legislative agenda was not shared in advance. “Government business is shared after the President’s address in the first session of the year,” Rijiju said.Emphasising parliamentary conduct, the minister said, “We are elected to raise people’s issues and have freedom of speech, but it is also our duty to listen,” adding that various issues could be raised during the debate on the motion of thanks to the President’s address and during Budget discussions.Opposition parties, however, reiterated their demands for wider debates during the Budget Session, stating that several issues of public importance must be discussed on the floor of Parliament.Speaking after the all-party meeting, Trinamool Congress MP Sagarika Ghose said that her party had strongly pushed for a discussion on the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process in West Bengal. She alleged that the manner in which the exercise is being conducted raises serious concerns.“On behalf of the Trinamool Congress and the All India Trinamool Congress, we reiterated in the all-party meeting that the ongoing SIR process in West Bengal must be discussed on the floor of Parliament during the Budget Session,” Ghose said.She further claimed that the exercise lacks transparency and neutrality and flagged large-scale discrepancies. “A so-called ‘logical discrepancy list’ has been prepared, containing the names of around 1.5 crore people, and this too must be debated. More than 130 people have reportedly lost their lives during the SIR exercise, and this issue must also be discussed in Parliament,” she said.Raising broader concerns, Ghose said opposition-ruled states were being unfairly treated. “Funds meant for states, especially opposition-ruled states, cannot be withheld in this manner and must be released. The misuse of central agencies in poll-bound states, including the filing of ED cases, must also be taken up for discussion,” she said.Emphasising the role of the opposition, Ghose added, “Parliament is not a one-way street. The opposition must be given an opportunity to speak, and its voice must be heard. Bills cannot be passed in two or three minutes; they should be sent to committees and sufficient time should be given for proper study.”Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) MP ET Mohammed Basheer also said that key issues needed parliamentary discussion. “Parliament has become a mockery. I have raised several issues, including SIR, that must be discussed during the Budget Session,” he said.Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Sasmit Patra said his party would raise multiple concerns during the session. “The first relates to farmers and their welfare, and the second relates to the situation in Odisha,” he said, adding that farmers were under distress, law and order was deteriorating in the state, youth unemployment remained a major concern, and employment opportunities under the new GRAM-G bill were limited.The remarks came amid opposition criticism of the Centre’s proposal to repeal the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and replace it with the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–GRAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill, listed in the supplementary business for the session, seeks to expand guaranteed rural employment from 100 to 125 days and align rural development with the government’s Viksit Bharat 2047 vision.",Kiren rijiju says government will not roll back the newly introduced vb–gram–g law.

The Next Phase of

Tax Simplification

Administrative Reforms

(Kuldip Kumar is Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP)

As the Union Budget approaches, expectations of major tax giveaways appear muted. However, this Budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the Government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform amid a challenging economic environment.The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive US trade agreement, geopolitical tensions, and continued foreign institutional investor outflows are likely to influence policy decisions. Measures announced in this year’s Budget are therefore expected to align closely with the Government’s broader economic and reform framework.Accordingly, incentivising businesses particularly export-oriented sectors and accelerating employment generation are likely to receive focused attention in this Budget.Last year’s Budget delivered meaningful tax relief through revisions in personal income-tax slabs and enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, leaving limited headroom for further concessions.These changes were introduced under the new tax regime, while the old tax regime was left unchanged.This approach was intended to encourage taxpayers still following the old regime to transition to the simpler new tax system.For FY 2023–24, nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime, and this proportion is expected to increase further in the current year.Does this mean the old tax regime could be phased out entirely? Perhaps not immediately, especially since the new tax regime has also been incorporated into the Income Tax Act, 2025.However, given the continued instances of misuse and claims of incorrect deductions under the old regime, it would not be surprising if the Government eventually considers doing away with it altogether.In the 2024 Budget, the Government made significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including revisions to holding periods and tax rates, with the objective of simplification. While some asset classes benefited, tax rates on listed securities both short-term and long-term and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), were increased.Given the growing participation of retail investors in Indian capital markets, there is a case for reviewing these measures. While challenging from a revenue perspective, the Government could consider moderating capital gains tax rates on listed securities or enhancing the basic exemption limit for long-term capital gains, currently set at ₹1.25 lakh. Further, permitting set-off of long-term capital losses against short-term capital gains in Budget 2026 would improve tax equity and align treatment of capital assets.Fiscal Discipline Remains an Important ConsiderationThe Government is expected to adhere firmly to its fiscal consolidation path, leaving limited scope for aggressive fiscal expansion. That said, carefully calibrated policy measures particularly those aimed at stimulating consumption and job creation could strengthen growth momentum and improve tax buoyancy. As with most fiscal initiatives, the benefits of such measures are likely to become visible only after a time lag.Tax simplification remains an ongoing journey. While significant progress has been achieved through digitisation and pre-filled data, several pain points persist:Clubbing provisions continue to complicate joint ownership of assets between spouses, despite the sound financial logic behind such arrangements. Introducing an option for joint tax filing, as practiced in countries like the United States, could significantly ease compliance.Notional taxation on vacant properties is often perceived as inequitable and warrants reconsideration.TDS and TCS mechanisms, though effective for tracking transactions, frequently result in excessive deductions and cash-flow strain for taxpayers, especially where final tax liability is substantially lower.Pre-filled tax returns could be further expanded, particularly for salaried taxpayers without business income, reducing manual intervention and errors.Despite the delegation of appellate powers to Joint Commissioners, a substantial backlog of tax appeals continues to persist. Introducing clearly defined timelines and enhancing accountability would help restore taxpayer confidence.Similarly, the practice of adjusting refunds against disputed demands often for several years requires urgent reform.Refunds granted in favour of taxpayers should be released automatically, without the need for repeated follow-ups or grievances.Trust as the Cornerstone of ComplianceRecent initiatives where tax authorities proactively alert taxpayers to potential mismatches mark a positive shift towards a trust-based compliance framework. The Government has already introduced the Taxpayers’ Charter; effective enforcement of its principles on the ground would benefit both sides in improving compliance for the Government while offering peace of mind to the taxpayers.While Budget 2026 may not be about headline-grabbing tax cuts, it is likely to outline how the Government intends to navigate uncertainty, sustain growth, reinforce fiscal discipline, and deepen structural reforms.In that sense, this Budget may prove to be less about immediate relief and more about building long-term economic resilience.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations appear muted.

1. Rationalise

TDS on Bond Interest Income

(Coupon)

2. Introduce a Fair and Predictable Tax Regime for Bond Interest

3. Create a Uniform Distribution Framework for Bonds

4. Flattening of the Government Bond yield curve

(Vishal Goenka is Co‑Founder, IndiaBonds)

As India aspires to build a resilient, diversified, and globally competitive financial system, the role of a deep and vibrant bond market cannot be overstated. This is also evident in NITI Aayog’s recent report on ‘Deepening the Corporate Bond Market’ which sets the policy roadmap for next 5 years. Fixed income is not just a portfolio stabiliser for households; it is also the backbone of long‑term capital formation for India’s growth ambitions.Over the past few years, SEBI’s regulatory reforms such as the introduction of Online Bond Platform Providers (OBPPs), electronic bidding platforms, ₹10,000 min. face value for bonds, and improved disclosure standards have laid a strong foundation. However, to truly democratise bond investing and meaningfully increase retail participation, the Union Budget 2026 presents an important opportunity to address a few structural bottlenecks for Indian investors.The introduction of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on bond interest income in Union Budget 2023 has unintentionally added friction for retail investors. While the intent was to improve tax compliance, the outcome has been increased complexity in return calculations (XIRR) and cash‑flow mismatches for investors. There was no TDS on interest from listed corporate bonds from 2008 to 2023.Unlike fixed deposits, bond investments often involve secondary market trades, accrued interest adjustments, and varying holding periods.The application of TDS in such cases makes it harder for investors to assess their actual post‑tax returns and increases the operational burden of reconciliation while filing their ITR or writing to companies directly for deductions due via 15G/15H forms.Removing TDS on bond interest income would simplify the investment process, improve transparency in yield computation, and encourage investors without compromising tax collection, as interest income would continue to be fully taxable at the time of filing returns.Currently, interest earned from bonds is taxed at the investor’s applicable slab rate, unlike equities where a clear distinction exists between short‑term and long‑term capital gains with concessional tax rates. In fact, tax on interest from bond investments at slab rate may be even higher than those paid on debt mutual funds at flat 20% This creates an uneven playing field and could discourage long‑term participation in corporate bonds.For many retail investors earning annual returns in the range of 7–12%, slab‑rate taxation significantly erodes post‑tax outcomes, making bonds appear less attractive despite their lower volatility and capital preservation characteristics.A simplified and predictable tax framework—such as a flat tax rate of around 20% on bond interest income would bring parity across asset classes. This would encourage households to allocate more savings to bonds, support long‑term investing behaviour, and help channel domestic capital into India’s growing economy.While mutual funds, equities and insurance products operate under well‑defined, standardised distribution frameworks, bond distribution in India remains fragmented across multiple participant types and channels. This lack of uniformity limits scalability, restricts investor trust, and creates uncertainty for intermediaries.A clear, regulator‑approved distribution framework for corporate bonds—similar to the Authorised Person (AP) structure in equities and AMFI Registration Numbers (ARNs) in mutual funds—can help enforce fit‑and‑proper criteria, define roles and accountability, and standardise disclosure and suitability practices across the industry.For effective transmission of rate cuts by RBI into the economy, flattening of the government bond yield curve is essential. Post RBI rate cuts last year of 125 bps, the 10y bond has barely moved 20bps lower and in fact yields on 15y bonds have moved higher. A lot of this is due to technical supply and deteriorating sentiment due to a weakening rupee. Achievement around fiscal deficit numbers and the government’s future borrowing program would bring the confidence in markets on the longer end of the bond curve and bring yields down. Financial prudence will be closely watched at the budget to encourage the bond market.Union Budget 2026 has the opportunity to send a strong signal: that bonds are not just institutional instruments, but a core part of India’s household investment landscape. Enabling this shift will be critical as India moves towards its next phase of economic growth – Viksit Bharat 2047.","Currently, interest earned from bonds is taxed at the investor’s applicable slab rate, unlike equities where a clear distinction exists.

Financial services as a growth engine: What Budget 2026 must deliver,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/financial-services-as-a-growth-engine-what-budget-2026-must-deliver/articleshow/127641361.cms,"A modern, fast‑growing economy depends on strong financial intermediaries.

India stands at a pivotal moment as Budget 2026 approaches, and few sectors can accelerate growth as powerfully as Financial Services (FS). India’s real GDP growth is estimated at 7.4% in FY26 led by investment demand and services sector growth. More than a system of payments or lending, the FS sector today acts as the economy’s central engine by allocating capital, pricing risk, and transmitting policy signals across the real economy. When this engine operates efficiently, it amplifies growth across infrastructure, manufacturing, MSMEs, households, and the expanding footprints of the digital ecosystem.A modern, fast‑growing economy depends on strong financial intermediaries. In India, banks, NBFCs, insurers, pension funds, mutual funds, and capital markets channel household and institutional savings into productive investments across the economy. This steady flow of capital drives GDP growth, improves productivity, formalises activity, and supports MSMEs and start‑ups through credit, funding, and risk‑mitigation tools. To sustain this momentum, Budget 2026 must focus on strengthening credit systems, deepening markets, and ensuring a predictable and innovation‑friendly regulatory environment.Continuity of the pace of tax reforms with the mantra of ‘simplification’ being the core objective will play a vital role in shaping India’s competitiveness as a global financial hub. A rationalisation of the tax regime for foreign bank branches—which currently face an effective tax rate of 38.22 percent -- would create a more balanced environment for global institutions. Extending withholding tax exemption on interest received to NBFCs similar to the exemption provided to Banks would introduce operational efficiency and arrest cash flow leakages for NBFCs helping them focus on greater penetration.Judicial clarity and global alignment are equally important. Recent Supreme Court rulings in the Tiger Global and American Express have implications for foreign investors and foreign banks. The global investor community is looking at clear and upfront tax guidance which would provide the predictability needed for investment decisions. The global investor community would be keenly looking at how the Hon’ble Finance Minister balances the expectations of the global investor community in respect of their past as well as the future investments.Alongside these reforms, India has been gaining prominence as an emerging international financial services centre (IFSC) through the development of GIFT City. Past Budgets have provided regulatory and tax relaxations that have enabled strong and steady progress. Global and Indian investors are regularly coming up with newer business models in GIFT City, which needs regulatory and tax amendments for enabling the same. Continuing with the past practice, Budget 2026 should continue to promote GIFT City for development of new business activities and products in GIFT City. The emerging areas of Global / Regional Treasury Centres, Commodity Trading, and Oilfield Equipment leasing will be eagerly looking up to Budget 2026 for regulatory support and tax clarity.Notifying the framework for Variable Capital Company structures would significantly widen the range of fund‑management activities within the IFSC. As the re‑insurance market in GIFT City continues to expand, it will be important to ensure a level playing field for Lloyd’s syndicates to attract larger pools of global capacity. Collectively, these reforms can materially enhance GIFT City’s attractiveness for banks, asset managers, treasury centres, insurers, leasing platforms, and other cross‑border financial participants.Similar to recent Budgets, timely disposal of tax assessments and appeals must remain a priority. With about INR 26.3 lakh crore—around 8 percent of India’s GDP—locked in income‑tax disputes, direct‑tax litigation continues to be a major concern. This issue is particularly significant for the FS sector, where cases often involve legacy matters that require clear and consistent guidance from tax authorities and take years to be resolved. Establishing defined timelines and accountability frameworks would enhance trust and reduce uncertainty for financial institutions and investors.To conclude, India’s FS sector is positioned to power the nation’s next phase of growth. Budget 2026 can accelerate this transition by pairing targeted policy support with competitive tax rules. Strengthening FS institutions, deepening markets, and improving digital and regulatory architecture will expand the economy’s credit capacity, strengthen inclusion, and reinforce India’s emergence as a global financial hub—creating the investment foundation needed for sustainable and long‑term growth. These financial sector reforms will go a long way in not only sustaining GDP growth but also in boosting the per capita income of India’s population.","A modern, fast‑growing economy depends on strong financial intermediaries.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform.

Budget 2026: Experts seek clearer rules on tax deduction for foreign banks’ HO expenses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-experts-seek-clearer-rules-on-tax-deduction-for-foreign-banks-ho-expenses/articleshow/127616265.cms,"AI image

As the Union Budget approaches, tax experts from the banking and capital markets sector have called for clearer rules and an updated framework for claiming tax deductions on head office (HO) expenditure incurred by foreign banks operating in India through branch structures.Deloitte India's Vijay Mani, Partner, Banking & Capital Markets Leader, and Russell Gaitonde, Partner, shared their expectations and recommendations regarding the issue.Explaining how such structures operate, they said, “The HO of foreign banks provides shared management services such as business strategy guidelines, accounting, HR, Payroll, IT and legal support, to its Indian Branches. For some foreign banks, such services are provided by their regional hubs based in Singapore/Hong Kong. Common expenses are allocated among group entities using appropriate allocation keys. ”They pointed out that Indian tax law already permits deduction of such costs, but within limits. “Section 44C of the Act allows a non-resident taxpayer (e.g. a foreign bank that operates in India through the branch office form of presence) to claim a tax deduction in India for HO expenditure incurred while computing its business income.The tax deduction is permitted to the extent of the lower of (i) the actual expenditure incurred, or (ii) 5 percent of the Adjusted Total Income (ATI) of the taxpayer,” they said.According to them, branch offices are often heavily reliant on their global headquarters, especially in the early years. “Generally, a Branch office has dependency on its HO in the initial years of setting up its business in the host country, as well as in subsequent years to implement the strategies of the HO and operational adaptabilities developed by the HO,” they noted.They also flagged practical challenges around documentation and assessments. “The burden of proof of the correct claim of HO expenditure is on the non-resident taxpayer, for which the non-resident taxpayer procures a certificate from an overseas Chartered Accountant (CA), which confirms the nature and quantum of HO expenditure,” they said, adding that, “The CBDT has not prescribed any guidance as regards what documentary evidence is to be maintained by the non-resident taxpayer, for claiming the aforesaid tax deduction under section 44C. ”This lack of standardisation, they said, leads to disputes. “This often leads to non-resident taxpayers following different practices when it comes to providing documentary evidence for claiming the aforesaid tax deduction and obtaining such overseas CA certificates in different formats, which are sometimes challenged by the Indian Revenue authorities (IRA).”To address this, they urged the government to bring in clearer rules. “With a view to reducing tax litigation in India on this issue and providing tax certainty, it is important for the CBDT to issue clear guidance on the documentary evidence that can be maintained by non-resident taxpayers for claiming a tax deduction in India for HO expenditure, as well as a format of certificate that can be provided by the non-resident taxpayer,” they said.Among the specific measures suggested is a rule recognising overseas auditor certificates. “Firstly, a Rule should be introduced in the Income Tax Rules, 1962 (the IT Rules) that will provide that the IRA (including the TPOs) should accept a certificate to be issued by the overseas statutory auditor of a non-resident taxpayer as conclusive evidence to enable the taxpayer claim a tax deduction in India under section 44C of the Act, towards HO expenditure that is incurred by the taxpayer outside India,” they said. They also recommended that “the CBDT can prescribe the format of the certificate to be procured by the non-resident taxpayer.”They further proposed expanding the scope of eligible expenses in line with evolving business models. “The CBDT can consider issuing a clarification expanding the illustrative list of expenses that fall within the definition of ‘HO expenditure’ for the purposes of section 44C. The CBDT should consult with industry prior to finalising the aforesaid list, so as to get insights into the types of new-age expenses that can fall within the ambit of section 44C (e.g. , technology-related expenses),” they said.They also called for a review of the long-standing deduction cap. “The existing cap of 5 percent of ATI was set in 1976 when section 44C was first introduced in the statute books. There has been a significant passage of time (i.e., nearly 50 years) since the setting of this limit,” they said. “It is time to re-examine the 5 percent tax deductibility cap… it is recommended that the overall cap prescribed in section 44C(a) be increased from the existing 5 percent of ATI to 10 percent of ATI, to keep pace with the expenditure patterns of modern businesses. ”With cross-border banking operations becoming more integrated and technology-driven, the experts said the Budget presents an opportunity to reduce disputes and provide long-awaited clarity on HO expense deductions.","Tax experts from the banking and capital markets sector have called for clearer rules and an updated framework for claiming tax deductions on head office expenditure. Indian tax law already permits deduction of such costs, but within limits.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127619171,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-944339,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

The first formal step involves the budget division of the ministry of finance issuing a circular to ministries, departments, state governments, Union Territories and public-sector bodies.

These guidelines ask departments to submit their projected revenue estimates and expenditure demands for the upcoming financial year, along with an analysis of past spending and receipts.

Then, officials from different departments compile the detailed projections, to help determine the likely fiscal deficit. At this stage, the Chief Economic Advisor plays a key role by guiding the government on the broader economic outlook and fiscal policy decisions.

After this, the proposals are reviewed carefully, followed by intense discussions to ensure that they are in line with the government’s overall fiscal plan.

Once the figures are examined and approved, they are forwarded to the ministry of finance, which allocates resources across ministries and sectors. If any disagreement arises over fund allocation, the matter is referred to the Union Cabinet or the Prime Minister for resolution.

The process also includes extensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders. Through the Department of Economic Affairs and the Department of Revenue, discussions are held with business owners, farmers, economists, foreign institutional investors and other interest groups to factor in the diverse needs of the economy.

A key part of this exercise is the series of pre-Budget meetings led by the finance minister. These include consultations with state finance ministers, industry bodies such as FICCI, CII, ASSOCHAM and NASSCOM, startups, farmers’ organisations, trade unions, NGOs, top economists and think-tanks.

The feedback gathered during these meetings helps shape spending priorities and policy measures.

By January, following these consultations, expenditure ceilings for each ministry are locked in by the finance minister in consultation with the Prime Minister’s Office. The Revenue Secretary then presents the final fiscal deficit calculations, after which the Union Cabinet gives its approval.

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present Budget 2026 for the ninth consecutive time and everyone is wondering what her red bahikhata might just be holding for the public. Expectations are high among taxpayers, businesses and other stakeholders, but many are not aware of what goes in making a Budget. The basic groundwork remains out of sight, with months of consultations, calculations and policy fine-tuning underway before the FM rises to speak in Parliament.The groundwork for the Budget, set to be presented on February 1, 2026, began months back.The process for Union Budget 2026–27 stretches over several months and brings together multiple ministries, states and stakeholders. Far more than a financial statement, the Union Budget reflects the country’s economic performance over the previous year and sets out the government’s aspirations for the coming fiscal year.Covering the period from April 1 to March 31, it lays out expected expenditures, revenue projections and policy priorities for the year ahead.In simple terms, a budget plan is an estimate of costs and revenues over a specific period.However, its preparation is an intricate and carefully sequenced process that typically begins around August or September, nearly six months before Budget Day.The Budget moves into its final phase with the traditional halwa ceremony, marking the start of printing the Budget papers. From then on, officials involved remain under strict confidentiality until the Budget is presented in Parliament.Prepared under Article 112 of the Constitution, the Union Budget is the government’s yearly statement of expected income and spending. On February 1, the finance minister will table it in the Lok Sabha, laying out revenue plans, spending priorities and key reforms for 2026–27.","The groundwork for the budget, set to be presented on february 1, 2026, began months back.

According to a report by the State Bank of India, this Budget can be an opportunity for the central government to introduce reforms in taxation, insurance and pension schemes aimed at boosting household savings, easing compliance challenges, and enhancing social security coverage.The report threw light on falling bank deposits as a share of household financial savings, falling from 38.7% in FY24 to 35.2% in FY25. To encourage greater participation in the banking system, SBI has recommended a range of tax relief measures.The report called for the tax treatment of interest income on bank deposits to be aligned with long-term and short-term capital gains. “To boost financial savings: (a) tax treatment for interest on deposits should be at par with LTCG and STCG,” it stated.Additionally, the report suggested to cut down the lock-in period for tax-saving fixed deposits to three years, making them equivalent to Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS), with the aim of improving deposit mobilisation. The bank also proposed that the upcoming Budget should either remove TDS on savings bank deposit interest or raise the threshold to ease the burden on small savers.On the indirect tax front, SBI has urged changes to the GST provisions related to Input Service Distributors (ISD), in order to provide clarity and limit litigation.It recommended replacing the phrase “for or on behalf of distinct persons” with “for the benefit of distinct persons” in the GST Act, 2017, along with deleting certain provisions and adding an explanation to Section 20(3) to allow banks to accept ISD distributions without disputes over valuation.The report highlighted practical difficulties for banks in applying GST TDS on payments such as interchange fees routed through settlement agencies including NPCI, Visa and MasterCard. As these payments are settled in real time, banks must pay GST TDS before receiving detailed invoices and later claim refunds. SBI suggested that GST TDS should not apply to banking services.On the insurance front, SBI drew attention to falling penetration rates, which fell to 3.7% in FY25 from 4% in FY23 and 4.2% in FY22, according to IRDAI data. The report also expressed concern over the decline in life insurance penetration in the context of IRDAI’s “Insurance for All by 2047” goal. It noted that around 69% of complaints in FY25 were related to claims, pointing to the need for reforms, particularly in health insurance.SBI concluded that implementing these measures in the Budget 2026 would not only support long-term economic stability but also enhance the financial wellbeing of households across the country.",State bank of india has recommended tax relief measures to encourage greater participation in the banking system.

From Rs 99,159 crore in FY21, allocations increased to Rs 1,23,551 crore in FY22 before jumping to Rs 2,17,089 crore in FY23. The upward trend continued in FY24 at Rs 2,75,986 crore and Rs 2,80,519 crore in FY25 (Revised Estimates). For FY26, the Budget Estimates place the outlay at Rs 2,87,333 crore, underlining roads as a central pillar of capital expenditure-led growth.This funding push has coincided with a rapid expansion of India’s national highway network, which has grown by about 61% over the past decade to 1,46,560 km. The focus has shifted beyond just length to quality, with a surge in access-controlled expressways and four-lane-and-above highways. Operational high-speed corridors and expressways have expanded dramatically, while wider highways now form a much larger share of the network.Looking ahead, MoRTH has lined up a 13,400-km pipeline of projects to be developed under the public-private partnership (PPP) model over the next three years, involving an estimated investment of Rs 8.3 lakh crore. Asset monetisation remains a parallel strategy, with highways being bundled under models such as Toll-Operate-Transfer and InvIT structures. The proposed Raajmarg InvIT is expected to bring operational stretches to the market to unlock fresh capital.Yet, challenges persist. Slower project approvals, land acquisition requirements, including the norm of 80% land in hand before work begins, quality concerns, cost overruns and contractual disputes continue to weigh on execution.Against this backdrop, expectations from Budget 2026 include faster approval mechanisms through an umbrella framework, sustained capital expenditure and a clearer roadmap for monetisation.","Budgetary support for the sector has nearly tripled since fy21.

How will a person who has an income Rs 12 lakh benefit from new rates?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said.

With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden.Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.",Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: faqs answered. Finance minister nirmala sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime.
