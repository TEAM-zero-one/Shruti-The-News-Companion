Old Vs New Income Tax Regime: How Much More Tax Are You Saving Over Years?

These charts by EY have been prepared on the following assumptions:

Section 80C deduction (maximum Rs 1.5 lakh) considered under the old tax regime. Other deductions/ exemptions such as medical insurance, home loan interest, house rent allowance are not considered. Standard deduction of Rs 50000 under the old regime and standard deduction as notified from time to time (Nil, Rs 50,000, Rs 75,000) under new regime is considered.

Each year the Budget speech is eagerly watched and listened to by the common man and middle class taxpayers, seeking answer to a simple query: will my tax burden reduce this year? Even finance ministers presenting the Budget are aware of the populist impact of their speech, in case tax relief measures are announced.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. Will tax slab and tax rate changes be introduced? Sitharaman, who will present her ninth budget, is also the FM who introduced the new income tax regime back in 2020.The choice between the old and the new income tax regime is an important one and every year, taxpayers carefully calculate the tax liability under each before deciding on which one to opt for.Over the years, the new income tax regime has seen several changes, and the tax liability under it has progressively come down at various salary levels, and it has become increasingly more attractive compared to the old regime.In her Budget speech in 2020, FM Nirmala Sitharaman explained the rationale for the introduction of a new income tax regime: the need for simpler compliance.“...The Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and deductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and administration of the Income Tax Act by the tax authorities a burdensome process. It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Income-tax law without taking help from professionals,” she said.Hence, a new and simplified income tax regime was introduced to provide “significant relief” to individual taxpayers. The idea was for a tax regime that offers reduced rates for taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and exemptions.The biggest takeaway was that the 30% tax slab under the new regime kicked in at an income above Rs 15 lakh compared to Rs 10 lakh under the old tax regime.At that time individuals under both regimes earning income up to Rs 5 lakh did not have to pay tax with the benefit of Section 87A.FM Sitharaman explained the gains: In the new tax regime, substantial tax benefit will accrue to a taxpayer depending upon exemptions and deductions claimed by him. For example, a person earning Rs 15 lakh in a year and not availing any deductions etc. will pay only Rs 1,95,000 as compared to Rs 2,73,000 in the old regime. Thus his tax burden shall be reduced by 78,000 in the new regime. He would still be the gainer in the new regime even if he was taking deduction of Rs 1.5 Lakh under various sections of Chapter- VI-A of the Income Tax Act under the old regime.Over the years, the government has introduced substantial changes under the new income tax regime - introduction of standard deduction benefits, higher standard deduction limit of Rs 75,000, evolving tax slabs and tax rates.In the Union Budget 2023, tax slabs under the new regime were further tweaked to:Importantly the following big changes were introduced:In the interim budget of 2024, the standard deduction under the new regime was raised to Rs 75,000.Last year, FM Sitharaman’s Budget brought sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, making it even more attractive for taxpayers. With higher rebate, tax outgo on income up to Rs 12 lakh was reduced to ZERO!Explaining the journey, Sitharaman said, “Right after 2014, the ‘Nil tax’ slab was raised to Rs 2.5 lakh, which was further raised to Rs 5 lakh in 2019 and to Rs 7 lakh in 2023. This is reflective of our government's trust on the middle-class tax payers. I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable up to income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.”Income tax slabs under the new regime saw big changes, with the 30% tax slab now kicking in for incomes above Rs 24 lakh, as against Rs 15 lakh earlier.One noteworthy point is that in all these years since the introduction of the new income tax regime, the old tax regime with higher deductions and exemptions but also higher tax rates continues to function, though without any changes. The intent of the government is clear: with the new tax regime made the default regime, and all changes and benefits of lower taxes, taxpayers are being urged to shift to it.But, how much is the tax benefit under the new tax regime compared to the old regime? The tax outgo has changed in the last 5 years, and at various income levels, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down substantially compared to the old tax regime.For a better understanding, we take a look at how tax outgo has changed over the last five years at various income levels of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 20 lakh, and Rs 40 lakh.If for an income level of Rs 10 lakh, you had to pay Rs 75,400 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 78,000 in FY21 to Rs 54,600 in FY24, Rs 44,200 in FY25 to NIL in FY26! It continues to be Rs 75,400 under the old regime.Similarly, if for an income level of Rs 20 lakh, you had to pay Rs 366,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 351,000 in FY21 to Rs 296,400 in FY24, Rs 278,200 in FY25 to Rs 192,400 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 174,200!The impact is also visible at higher income levels. If for an income level of Rs 40 lakh, you had to pay Rs 990,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 975,000 in FY21 to Rs 920,400 in FY24, Rs 902,200 in FY25 to Rs 787,800 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 202,800!The above charts are broadly indicative, and the tax outgo will depend on your income level, the amount of deductions and exemptions you claim. For an income of over Rs 12 lakh, and above a certain amount of deductions and exemptions, the old regime may be more suitable at various salary levels.Hence, while the above examples offer a clear picture on how the tax benefits have increased over years under the new regime, it is important to calculate the total amount of deductions and exemptions you avail for a better understanding.As an example, at the current tax slabs in the old and new regime, if you have a gross income of more than Rs 24.75 lakh, then the old regime makes sense only if your total deductions and exemptions are over Rs 8 lakh.This level of deductions and exemptions is for the 30% tax slab. It will vary for incomes below Rs 24 lakh.Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India tells TOI, “Over the past few years, the new tax regime has clearly boosted the take‑home pay of most salaried taxpayers due to the rising basic exemption limits and reduced slab rates. In FY 2020-21, for an income of Rs 10 lakh, the tax liability under the new tax regime was slightly higher compared to the old tax regime. However, over the subsequent five years (FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26), the reforms have reversed this picture, resulting in savings of Rs 75,400 in FY 2025-26 under the new tax regime as compared to the old tax regime. ”""For an income of Rs 20 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, the savings in FY 2025-26 are approximately Rs 1.74 lakh and Rs 2.02 lakh respectively as compared to the old tax regime. Now, if we compare savings under the new tax regime over the six-year period (FY 2020-21 to FY 2025-26), savings have risen significantly — around Rs 78,000 at an income of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 1.58 lakh at Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1.87 lakh at Rs 40 lakh. With substantial taxpayers going ahead with the default/new tax regime, further slab adjustments in Budget 2026 could accelerate this trend,” he adds.While a certain percentage of taxpayers continue to benefit from the old tax regime, for example those who claim high levels of House Rent Allowance, or those who have a home loan, over 70% of tax returns filed for AY 2024-25 were under the new regime. Tax experts expect more taxpayers to switch to the new income tax regime in the ongoing financial year, with the Rs 12 lakh zero tax level prompting many to shift.However, experts note that the government may look to introduce some popular deductions and exemptions such as Section 80C and home loan interest benefits to incentivise savings and housing.",Finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present the union budget on february 1. The choice between the old and the new income tax regime is an important one. Each year the budget speech is eagerly watched and listened to by the common man and middle class taxpayers.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127475885,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-113754,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Reforming SARFAESI Norms to Expand Rural Housing Credit

Bringing Gold Lending Into the Formal Economy

(Shaji Varghese is CEO of Muthoot FinCorp)

India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural economies. One powerful yet underutilised lever in this journey is household gold. In recent years, the value of household gold has more than doubled, significantly increasing family wealth across India. According to a 2025 Morgan Stanley estimate, Indian households hold nearly 34,600 tonnes of gold jewellery, valued at around $3.8 trillion—almost 89 percent of the country’s GDP. Much of this gold has been accumulated over generations or acquired to mark important life milestones.While gold carries immense emotional and cultural significance, in its idle form it contributes little to economic activity. It is therefore imperative that India deploys effective policies to enable household gold to be used productively—without forcing families to relinquish ownership.Gold loans offer precisely this solution. They allow households to unlock the economic value of gold while retaining emotional ownership, making gold a working asset that supports livelihoods, enterprise, and growth.Over the past few years, regulators have taken meaningful steps to introduce balanced regulations that protect customers while supporting sectoral development.These measures, coming into effect from April 1, 2026, create a stronger foundation. However, to unlock the full potential of gold loans for inclusive growth, further reforms are needed.Credit penetration in rural India remains low, particularly among shopkeepers and MSMEs—estimated at nearly six million nationwide. Many continue to lack access to formal finance, even as they need working capital to upgrade infrastructure, manage inventory, and expand offerings.Gold loans are ideally suited to meet these short-term needs. Interest is charged only for the period the loan is utilised, allowing borrowers to repay when cash flows improve and re-borrow as required. This flexible credit cycle supports business growth, encourages financial discipline, and mobilises household savings in a way that benefits both borrowers and the broader economy.Strengthening Last-Mile Credit Through NBFC Branch ExpansionA key reason for low credit penetration in Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural areas is limited physical branch presence. Over time, NBFCs have demonstrated a superior ability to reach underserved regions, tailor products to local needs, and operate efficiently through well-established models.For gold loans in particular, physical branches are essential and cannot be fully replaced by digital channels, unlike unsecured personal loans. Encouraging NBFCs to expand branch networks would significantly improve access and deepen market penetration.Currently, regulatory restrictions and prescriptive guidelines on branch expansion can slow network growth. Liberalising these norms—especially for collateral-backed products like gold loans—would accelerate outreach while maintaining prudential safeguards.NBFCs play a critical role in last-mile credit delivery, particularly for small-ticket and entry-level loans in rural areas. However, all NBFC loans currently carry a uniform 100 percent risk weight, which raises the cost of lending and limits credit supply.Gold loans are regulated by loan-to-value (LTV) norms, similar to home loans, where risk weights vary based on LTV. Extending a similar risk-based framework to gold loans could unlock significant capital, enabling NBFCs to expand credit availability to deserving borrowers.A coordinated approach between the Government and regulators can help create a supportive policy framework that recognises the broader economic and nation-building potential of expanding gold loan credit.Recent stress in unsecured lending segments, including microfinance, has adversely affected credit scores for millions of households. Many of these borrowers experienced temporary or one-time defaults and are now excluded from formal credit.Targeted schemes are needed to help such borrowers re-enter the formal financial system. Ensuring that temporary distress does not lead to permanent exclusion will allow households to regain access to credit and participate productively in the economy.Housing is a powerful economic driver in rural India, with strong linkages to nearly 50 sectors. While banks offer rural housing loans, their reach in smaller ticket sizes—below ₹10–15 lakh—is limited. NBFCs, with their extensive branch networks, are better positioned to serve this segment.However, SARFAESI Act provisions restrict NBFCs’ ability to recover smaller-ticket secured loans, as enforcement is allowed only for outstanding amounts of ₹20 lakh and above. Harmonising SARFAESI applicability for NBFCs in line with banks and housing finance companies would significantly improve credit flow and accelerate rural housing growth.An estimated 60 percent of gold lending remains unregulated. Formal gold loans, by contrast, operate under clear regulatory guidelines and supervision. Allowing greater flexibility in NBFC branch expansion would accelerate formalisation and extend regulated credit to underserved markets.With a strong regulatory framework already in place, wider branch access can help bring millions of borrowers into the formal financial system.The upcoming Budget presents a timely opportunity to build on existing reforms. With continued policy support and regulatory alignment, gold loans can unlock household wealth, deepen rural credit access, and drive inclusive growth across Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural India.","India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to tier-2, tier-3, and rural economies.

For the Union Budget 2026-2027, India’s gems and jewellery industry is urging the government for a mix of GST cuts, customs reforms and policy changes to counter global trade headwinds and improve export competitiveness.In its pre-Budget memorandum submitted to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) highlighted measures aimed at lowering costs for exporters and strengthening India’s role in the global diamond trade and value discovery ecosystem.“The global gem and jewellery trade is undergoing a major transformation. With high US tariffs, evolving consumer preferences, and shifting global supply chains, it is imperative that India maintains its competitive edge,” GJEPC chairman Kirit Bhansali said.According to Bhansali, the proposals focus on enhancing cost efficiency, reinforcing Special Economic Zone (SEZ) operations and improving policy frameworks that support investment and skill development. He said that with supportive reforms and a stable trade environment, India could both withstand current global pressures and drive the next phase of growth in the international jewellery market.The Council flagged concerns over the existing 4% Safe Harbour tax, stating that it remains too high and discourages international trade.The agency also called for rationalisation of import duties on cut and polished diamonds as well as coloured gemstones to help Indian exporters remain competitive globally.In addition, the GJEPC has sought amendments to the Customs Act, 1962, to bring customs procedures in line with the needs of a fast-evolving, export-oriented gems and jewellery sector. Its recommendations include risk-based customs clearance, AI-enabled digital appraisals and self-certification for trusted exporters to improve efficiency, transparency and turnaround time.Separately, the All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC) has made its own representation to the government, focusing on GST rationalisation, hallmarking, direct tax reforms and sector-wide improvements.“GST on gold and silver jewellery should be rationalised to 1.25 per cent from 3 per cent, which will help restore proportionality, reduce financial stress on households, and enable a wider base of taxed transactions,” GJC chairman Rajesh Rokde said.The GJC has also proposed exempting capital gains tax on exchanges of hallmarked jewellery, provided the proceeds from the sale are immediately reinvested in new jewellery purchases, thereby ensuring continuity of asset holding.Another key demand relates to the Tourist GST Refund scheme. The Council has urged the government to operationalise the scheme at the earliest by notifying the required rules and setting up digital claim and verification systems at major international gateways. It suggested starting with a phased pilot at Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru airports, citing higher levels of jewellery sales and foreign tourist arrivals.“Foreign tourists, particularly from the Middle East, Europe and the United States, face a tax-inclusive price disadvantage while purchasing jewellery in India as compared to regional competitors like the UAE and Singapore, where such refunds are efficiently processed through automated airport systems,"" Rokde said. The expert further highlighted that this results in a lost opportunity for India ""wherein foreign buyers either defer purchases or procure jewellery abroad, converting India's competitive craftsmanship into exported retail demand losses. ”","India’s gems and jewellery industry is urging the government for a mix of gst cuts, customs reforms and policy changes to counter global trade headwinds.

Deadly High-Speed Train Collision in Southern Spain Kills Dozens, Rescue Operations Ongoing

Here's what to know





MADRID: Multiple train crashes this week have rocked Spain and the tragedies have led to questions about safety on the country's railway system.The first crash involved a high-speed train in southern Spain that derailed on Sunday evening, colliding with another fast train, killing at least 43 people and injuring more than 150.The crash was the deadliest in Spain since a 2013 crash that killed 80 people when a commuter train in the northern region of Galicia hurtled off the rails as it came around a bend going too fast.On Tuesday night, another train crash happened in northeastern Spain on a commuter line near Barcelona. One person was killed.Then, on Thursday, a commuter train crashed in southeastern Spain, lightly injuring 6 passengers.Derailment and collision The Sunday derailment happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails and slammed into an oncoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva with around 200 people, according to rail operator Adif.The head of the second train took the brunt of the impact, Transport Minister Oscar Puente said. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track and sent them plummeting down a four-meter (13-foot) slope.The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) south of Madrid.""The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of meters away,"" Andalusia's regional President Juan Manuel Moreno said.Authorities said they had identified almost all the victims from Sunday's crash.Cause under investigation Explanations about what caused the crash were scant, with an official investigation underway.Alvaro Fernandez, the president of national railway company Renfe, told Spanish public radio RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 250 kph (155 mph) and ""human error could be ruled out.""Transport Minister Puente called the crash ""truly strange"" since it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. But Puente said late Monday that officials had found a broken section of track.""Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence (of the derailment),"" Puente told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser.The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, belonged to Renfe.Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and passed its latest safety check on Jan. 15.The Spanish Union of Railway Drivers sent a letter last August asking Spain's rail operator to investigate flaws on high-speed train lines across the country caused by increased traffic.It warned of potholes, bumps and imbalances in overhead power lines, as well as frequent breakdowns and damage to trains, according to a copy of the letter seen by The Associated Press.The union called for a general strike in the coming weeks to demand more safety assurances.High-speed expansion Spain has spent decades investing heavily in high-speed trains. It currently has the largest rail network in Europe for trains traveling more than 250 kph (155 mph), with more than 3,900 kilometers (2,400 miles) of track, according to the International Union of Railways.The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Officials said that Sunday's collision was the first with deaths on Spain's high-speed rail network since it opened its first line in 1992.Commuter line crashes A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing one person and injuring at least 37 others.A commuter train crashed on Thursday in the southeastern Murcia region after it collided with a crane. Emergency services said six people with minor injuries had been transferred to the hospital.While Spain's high-speed rail network generally runs smoothly, commuter rails are plagued by reliability issues. However, crashes causing injury or death are not common.","Multiple train crashes in spain this week have led to questions about safety.

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Bring sale of AIF units at par with sale of shares.

Government as venture debt provider.

Invest wisely in deep tech:

For taxation:

a) Introduce taxation at household level.

b) Widen India’s tax net.

(Devendra Agrawal, Founder, Dexter Capital Advisors, a boutique investment bank)

The recent Supreme Court judgement that has gone against Tiger Global may dampen the confidence of any global investor because anything that’s agreed in the past is open for interpretation. And while that may lead to short-term benefit of recovering the taxes from one investor, in the long run it might have a negative impact on the larger investor community. They may feel the country may not be trusted with the laws laid by the previous governments. The budget should provide clarity or simplify the laws, especially for global investors.Ideally, the government should unleash private capital for startups. The recent SEBI regulations for angel investing have increased the accreditation. Earlier, any individual/HUFs/Family Trusts/Sole proprietorships with net worth greater than Rs 2 crore (excluding the value of their primary residence) could be angel investors. Now, the net worth has to be equal or greater than Rs 7.5 cr, out of which at least Rs 3.75 cr is in the form of financial assets (excluding the value of their primary residence).If someone keeps PPP (purchasing power parity) in mind, it is ridiculously high and removes a number of people from the purview of investing.The government should definitely make a uniform policy for accredited investors but with fewer norms. And before angel investors, I think, the government should look at F&Os as they are even riskier and more speculative. Angel investing drives capital formation.When any investor invests in any Alternate Investment Fund (AIF), the investor gets units of AIF. Now, often these investments are illiquid and AIF units can't be easily transferred. If an investor gets a willing buyer to transfer the AIF unit, another challenge is that AIF units are valued on Fair Market Value (FMV).In comparison, when underlined securities like shares in a company are sold, the transaction does not need to be at FMV, as long as they are sold above book value.So, there's a disparity between sale of IAF units vs sale of shares of underlying companies held by these AIFs.Doing away this disparity can bring selling of AIF units at par with selling shares and would increase liquidity in a situation where an investor in AIF wants to sell AIF units.This would definitely bring more liquidity, increase participation of investors in alternate investment funds.This is completely as per the tax laws of the country. It's just that the finance ministry has not taken this into consideration in record.The government recently approved Rs 5,000 crore in equity support for the SIDBI to help expand credit flow to the MSME sector. The government invests in startups at a 6% rate with secured assets. To help more startups raise capital from the government and for the government to benefit from it, the government may consider investing at an increased rate – 8% – but without a secured asset as long as the startup is certified and thoroughly evaluated.This could help in bringing down India’s very high venture debt, at 13-18%. The government could provide, say, a tech-driven company which has built a prototype, an 8% yield and can have a warrant structure. So that such a portfolio asset has mortality. Those warrants will yield a much higher rate of return even if a small percentage, like less than 10% of these companies, become wildly successful. So, the government could become a de facto venture debt provider or a collateral-free loan provider.The government recently built a Rs 1 lakh crore fund for deep tech without having a very clear definition of deep tech. This amount is slightly on the higher side in terms of deep tech. The government could probably allocate a certain portion of this fund towards deep tech and the remaining fund could be allocated towards other avenues as well.We should applaud the Finance Minister and the government for two big releases. First, for rationalizing taxes to INR 12 lakh for the common man. Second, the GST reform. However, there are two recommendations that I would like to make:India follows an individual-focused income tax system, where each person’s annual income is evaluated and then taxed.Introducing taxation at household level will give assesses the scope for rationalizing/reducing their tax burden. Assesses should have the option of filing their returns as a household or as an individual.If the cumulative income of a household is lesser than a particular threshold, then taxation should be lesser. For example, if a household consisting of a married couple--where both husband and wife are earning—has a cumulative income of Rs 30 lakh then the tax rate could be 20% and not the current 30%.The idea behind household-level taxation is that the family’s ability to pay depends on the shared expenses, not just individual income. This concept could definitely be explored and introduced.Less than 4% of the population pays income tax in India. This increases the tax burden on the salaried class, middle class. In comparison, ~60% of households in the US pay federal income tax and ~10-14% of the Chinese working population pays income tax. The government and other stakeholders should find a way to bring more working people under the tax bracket to reduce the overall tax burden on the salaried class. I feel one way to do this could be to incentivize high tax payers by publicly recognizing and rewarding them.","The recent supreme court judgement that has gone against tiger global may dampen the confidence of any global investor.

As the Union Budget approaches, expectations of major tax giveaways appear muted. However, this Budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the Government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform amid a challenging economic environment.The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive US trade agreement, geopolitical tensions, and continued foreign institutional investor outflows are likely to influence policy decisions. Measures announced in this year’s Budget are therefore expected to align closely with the Government’s broader economic and reform framework.Accordingly, incentivising businesses particularly export-oriented sectors and accelerating employment generation are likely to receive focused attention in this Budget.Last year’s Budget delivered meaningful tax relief through revisions in personal income-tax slabs and enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, leaving limited headroom for further concessions.These changes were introduced under the new tax regime, while the old tax regime was left unchanged.This approach was intended to encourage taxpayers still following the old regime to transition to the simpler new tax system.For FY 2023–24, nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime, and this proportion is expected to increase further in the current year.Does this mean the old tax regime could be phased out entirely? Perhaps not immediately, especially since the new tax regime has also been incorporated into the Income Tax Act, 2025.However, given the continued instances of misuse and claims of incorrect deductions under the old regime, it would not be surprising if the Government eventually considers doing away with it altogether.In the 2024 Budget, the Government made significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including revisions to holding periods and tax rates, with the objective of simplification. While some asset classes benefited, tax rates on listed securities both short-term and long-term and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), were increased.Given the growing participation of retail investors in Indian capital markets, there is a case for reviewing these measures. While challenging from a revenue perspective, the Government could consider moderating capital gains tax rates on listed securities or enhancing the basic exemption limit for long-term capital gains, currently set at ₹1.25 lakh. Further, permitting set-off of long-term capital losses against short-term capital gains in Budget 2026 would improve tax equity and align treatment of capital assets.Fiscal Discipline Remains an Important ConsiderationThe Government is expected to adhere firmly to its fiscal consolidation path, leaving limited scope for aggressive fiscal expansion. That said, carefully calibrated policy measures particularly those aimed at stimulating consumption and job creation could strengthen growth momentum and improve tax buoyancy. As with most fiscal initiatives, the benefits of such measures are likely to become visible only after a time lag.Tax simplification remains an ongoing journey. While significant progress has been achieved through digitisation and pre-filled data, several pain points persist:Clubbing provisions continue to complicate joint ownership of assets between spouses, despite the sound financial logic behind such arrangements. Introducing an option for joint tax filing, as practiced in countries like the United States, could significantly ease compliance.Notional taxation on vacant properties is often perceived as inequitable and warrants reconsideration.TDS and TCS mechanisms, though effective for tracking transactions, frequently result in excessive deductions and cash-flow strain for taxpayers, especially where final tax liability is substantially lower.Pre-filled tax returns could be further expanded, particularly for salaried taxpayers without business income, reducing manual intervention and errors.Despite the delegation of appellate powers to Joint Commissioners, a substantial backlog of tax appeals continues to persist. Introducing clearly defined timelines and enhancing accountability would help restore taxpayer confidence.Similarly, the practice of adjusting refunds against disputed demands often for several years requires urgent reform.Refunds granted in favour of taxpayers should be released automatically, without the need for repeated follow-ups or grievances.Trust as the Cornerstone of ComplianceRecent initiatives where tax authorities proactively alert taxpayers to potential mismatches mark a positive shift towards a trust-based compliance framework. The Government has already introduced the Taxpayers’ Charter; effective enforcement of its principles on the ground would benefit both sides in improving compliance for the Government while offering peace of mind to the taxpayers.While Budget 2026 may not be about headline-grabbing tax cuts, it is likely to outline how the Government intends to navigate uncertainty, sustain growth, reinforce fiscal discipline, and deepen structural reforms.In that sense, this Budget may prove to be less about immediate relief and more about building long-term economic resilience.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations appear muted. This budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive us trade agreement, geopolitical tensions are likely to influence policy decisions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127522778,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-44452,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

MUMBAI: A study of state finances by RBI shows that while the fiscal deficit of Indian states has widened modestly in recent years, funding patterns have become more market-driven and disciplined, with growth headroom differing sharply between younger and more mature states.The consolidated gross fiscal deficit of states peaked at 4.1% of GDP in 2020-21 during the pandemic, before easing to below 3% for three years and rising again to 3.3% in 2024-25. RBI said the recent widening was driven by weaker revenue receipts, largely due to lower grants from the Centre, and higher capital spending. Part of the breach above 3% reflects 50-year, interest-free loans from the Centre, which are above normal borrowing limits. For 2025-26, states have budgeted the deficit at 3.3% of GDP, with higher revenues offset by higher expenditure.The consolidated deficit remains within the Centre's ceiling of 3.5% of GDP, which includes a 0.5% allowance linked to power sector reforms. However, state-level positions vary widely. Sixteen states have budgeted deficits above 3% of GSDP for 2025-26, with 13 of them exceeding 3.5%, highlighting uneven fiscal space across states.Market borrowing has emerged as the main source of funding. According to RBI's study, market loans are expected to finance about 76% of the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2025-26, compared with just over half before 2016-17. Gross market borrowing rose 6.6% to Rs 10.7 lakh crore in 2024-25 and is budgeted at Rs 12.5 lakh crore in 2025-26. By end-Sept 2025, states had raised Rs 4.7 lakh crore, 21% higher than a year earlier.The borrowing profile has also improved. States have increasingly issued longer-maturity securities, with a rising share of bonds beyond 10 and 15 years, and some issuing paper of over 20 years. Borrowing costs eased, with the weighted average yield falling to 7.2% in 2024-25 from 7.5% a year earlier, while spreads over central govt securities narrowed to 30 basis points.The quality of state finances has strengthened as well. The share of revenue deficit in the gross fiscal deficit has dropped from 46.1% in 2020-21 to a budgeted 6.9% in 2025-26, while the share of capital expenditure in total spending has risen from 13.4% to 18%.Demography is emerging as a key differentiator. Younger states such as Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh have greater scope to expand revenues on the back of a growing working-age population, while intermediate states like Maharashtra and Karnataka must balance growth with preparation for ageing. For ageing states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, fiscal pressures are set to rise as tax bases narrow and pension and healthcare costs increase, forcing a rethink of revenue and workforce policies.","Fiscal deficit of indian states has widened modestly in recent years.

MUMBAI: Chiefs of India's consumer companies are seeking more tax cuts, wider measures to put money in the hands of the middle-class and support consumption, which has begun to look up after months of sluggishness but runs the risk of being buffeted by external macro factors.CEOs are also pinning hopes on the Budget to provide for measures to shield local industries against volatile commodity prices. ""The Budget can support recovery in consumption by strengthening purchasing power, particularly in price-sensitive urban and rural markets. At the same time, allocate budget and take initiatives to improve agri/farm sector to ensure steady input prices which can help FMCG companies manage costs without passing them on to consumers,"" said Mayank Shah, vice-president at Parle Products.There should be a focus on increasing disposable incomes and supporting middle-class first-time buyers of consumer durables, a sector where consumption has been hit by adverse commodity costs and currency depreciation (import costs go up when rupee weakens), said Kamal Nandi, business head and EVP at appliances business of Godrej Enterprises Group.""Additionally, measures that help ease cost pressures - such as stable import duties on essential raw materials and support for domestic manufacturing will allow companies to avoid passing the full benefit of cost inflation to consumers,"" Nandi said.There are a few large, mass-consumption FMCG categories, especially in home care that continue to be taxed at 18% and could move to a lower slab such as 5% to aid demand, said Sudhir Sitapati, MD & CEO at Godrej Consumer Products.The industry is also looking for meaningful support to manage input-cost volatility, particularly in categories impacted by inverted duty structures under GST which lock up working capital and add to cost pressures for manufacturers, added Prashant Peres, GM, India at Mars Snacking. ""Budget 2026 should focus on tariff rationalisation and accelerated infrastructure investments to strengthen the momentum on broad based growth,"" said Sudhanshu Vats, MD, Pidilite Industries.","Chiefs of india's consumer companies are seeking more tax cuts, wider measures to put money in the hands of the middle-class.

NEW DELHI: Amid outflows, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have sought a review of the taxes applicable on them, especially capital gains.Those familiar with the deliberations said the issue has been raised with market regulator Sebi as well as govt officials with certainty in tax policies being underlined repeatedly.Apart from high cost of trading in India due to several levies and charges - brokerage, stamp duty, securities transaction tax (STT), Sebi turnover fees, exchange transaction fees and custody fees - representatives of FPIs have also argued that for certain overseas investors, there is double taxation due to capital gains tax.These players have argued that FPIs face capital gains tax on their investments in Indian securities. Besides, investors in these funds can be taxed again in their home countries when they receive the distribution from the FPI. Further, they have argued that foreign tax credits - capital gains tax paid by FPIs to be used as credits to offset taxes on the investors in the investor's home country - are often unavailable or difficult to obtain in practice.""This is because of the way investments are typically made (through funds), and also due to the complex foreign tax credit regimes,"" a tax expert said.The funds have argued that India remains among a few countries globally that levies STT as well as capital gains tax, which was not the case until 2018. Before 2004, capital gains on listed equity securities were taxable in India, but LTCG was abolished in this segment when STT was introduced in 2004. In 2018, LTCG on listed equity transactions made a comeback - at 10% over a specified threshold, which was increased to 12.5% last year.A tax specialist at a leading consulting firm said that to the higher cost, there is a loss of attractiveness for the Indian market at this time. In addition, computation related issues, restrictions on set-off of capital losses under specific situations and delays in refunds have been flagged.So far this year, FPIs have sold equity of Rs 33,600 crore on a net basis, the highest monthly sales since Aug when they were sellers to the tune of Rs 35,000 crore. In 2025, FPIs' net sales were pegged at nearly Rs 1.7 lakh crore, according to data on the NSDL website.","Foreign portfolio investors (fpis) have sought a review of the taxes applicable on them, especially capital gains.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Focus on private investments: Investments by the Government may not be sustainable for long-term sectoral needs and growth. It is therefore important that private investments are channelised to bring innovative technology, efficiency, and service. Based on the learnings from PPP initiatives, the Indian Railways needs to bring innovative models which are investor-friendly with a proper risk allocation framework for regulatory, financing, construction, traffic, and operational risks. This would lead to wider private sector participation and create a pipeline of projects that add to the railways’ delivery capacity while promoting innovation, newer technology adoption, and efficient O&M practices. As railway projects have high capital costs and socio-economic constraints, cost recovery should include non-tariff measures like non-fare revenue and land value capturing to enhance viability and project returns. Manufacturing growth: The success in manufacturing rolling stocks like Vande Bharat, passenger coaches such as metros, and automatic train protection systems like Kavach should be encouraged and replicated across the rail industry through private sector led innovations and advanced technologies in rolling stocks, tracks, signalling, and electrical systems. To make India a global rail component manufacturing hub, capacity or production-linked incentives need to be explored for advanced technology components and systems. Industry-aligned commercial structure: The present fare and tariff structure needs to be better aligned to the business needs of the freight sector. It is therefore important to align the tariff policy with innovative models which incentivise rail freight, long-term industry commitment, and promote efficiency and competition. These could include introducing a multi-operator regime, dynamic pricing, per train pricing schemes rather than tonnage, time-tabled services, value-added services, return load discount, and multi-modal integration. This would help the railways in bringing non-bulk commodities like containerised movement, auto carriers, and parcels/light-weight shipments, including e-commerce, which are growing at a larger pace than the traditional bulk commodities. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs): DFCs have demonstrated the opportunity for the Indian Railways to provide efficient and faster freight services. New corridors need to be implemented while ensuring that the services in freight corridors are further optimised through higher capacity and speed capable rolling stocks along with intermodal freight terminals across its network/feeder network. Future corridors may be planned in a targeted time-bound manner involving private and public investments. Supportive institutional structure: The measures outlined above highlight the importance of the right institutional structure to drive innovative models for achieving customer satisfaction, incentivisation of efficiency, transparency in business, flexibility in operations, disciplined implementation, etc. An enabling regulatory framework is required to bring more transparency and confidence, and marry social obligations with business needs. There is a mismatch between rolling stocks and infrastructure, passenger trains lack track infrastructure, and goods trains lack the type of wagons required to match the operational speed attainable. As a result, assets and investments made are being underutilised. The implementation of safety works such as Kavach 4.0 and advanced signalling systems is slow. The learnings from the implementation of 100% electrification works should be reviewed and repurposed for the implementation of advanced signalling systems.

The transport and logistics sector serves as the backbone for India’s Viksit Bharat @2047 vision. As our national carrier, the railways connect remote places, while providing a sustainable and economic mode of travel.Today, India has the fourth largest railway network and is the second biggest freight carrier in the world. The recent budgets have played a key role in supporting this infrastructure by allocating Rs 2 to 2.5 lakh crores for the last two to three years.While investments in infrastructure creation of track and rolling stock have been significant, average train speeds have remained in the range of 20–25 kmph for freight and 50–52 kmph for mail/express passenger over the last ten years. Large public investment has yet to trigger significant private sector involvement in aspects like track, rail station, and manufacturing units. Competition with other modes, especially expressways, requires a clear value proposition to increase freight rail share from below 30% to the ambitious 45% target by 2030.Thus, though budgetary support on infrastructure build remains critical, linking these investments to structural reforms will be essential.It is therefore suggested that the Government focus on the following areas to drive one of its important growth engines—the railways.It is therefore important that the budget drives a transformative agenda for capital recycling models and private sector investments both in capital creation and operations. In addition, it should introduce industry-friendly tariff structures, incentivise rail-linked industries, and provide a robust framework for the introduction of an institutional structure which promotes investments in assets, competition, efficiency, and innovation in services supported by human capital development. By doing so, the budget will enable the Indian Railways to become a strong contributor to the goal of achieving Viksit Bharat @2047.","While investments in infrastructure creation of track and rolling stock have been significant, average train speeds have remained 50–52 kmph for mail/express passengers.

What can we hope for in 2026?

Each year, the Union Budget draws the nation’s attention as it defines the country’s economic direction for the new financial year. As Finance Minister wields the fiscal scalpel, focussed on tax rates, rebalancing expenditure, and setting priorities, every Indian household, business and policymaker watches keenly to understand what they will gain or lose.Past budgets have marked significant personal income tax relief, which included raising the exemption limit to incentivise consumption. Capital expenditure has consistently risen, marking the importance of infrastructure and connectivity as engines of growth.Looking at Budget 2026, to be presented on February 1, expectations would be that it would be yet another opportunity to deepen reforms by pushing manufacturing competitiveness, improving human capital, modernising tax and trade regimes, and reinforcing investment in emerging technologies that will lay out a roadmap for resilient, inclusive, and innovation-led growth.Here is a quick rundown of the key changes that have been seen in the past 5 years and what is the scope for FY 2026-27.Over the last five budgets, FY 2021-22 through FY 2025-26, India’s tax landscape has been shaped by progressive personal tax restructuring, targeted corporate tax continuity, and evolving indirect tax policy. In the earlier part of this period, the new income tax regime introduced in the 2020 Union Budget continued to evolve.While Budgets 2021 and 2022 left core slabs largely unchanged, Budget 2023 made the new tax regime the default choice on the income-tax e-filing portal and enhanced its structure with fewer slabs, a higher basic exemption and a standard deduction to benefit individual taxpayers.Budget 2024 further sweetened relief for salaried employees with the standard deduction for salaried individuals under the new regime raised to Rs 75,000/- from Rs 50,000.Next year, Budget 2025 saw one of the most significant tax reforms to date. Personal income tax up to Rs 12 lakh was made fully exempt under the new regime (meaning Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers after standard deduction), with restructured slabs above that threshold, substantially lowering the direct tax burden for the middle class.As for indirect taxes, GST (Goods and Services Tax), first introduced in 2017, also had some changes. The most significant reform came last year, when the GST rate structure was simplified from multiple slabs to a two-tier system of 5 per cent and 18 per cent, along with a 40 per cent levy on select luxury or “sin” goods. Although not part of the Budget presentation, it was a move aimed at reducing complexity and easing the tax burden for both consumers and businesses and will surely be a factor setting the tone for the upcoming Budget.Looking toward Budget 2026, expectations remain on refinements to the tax regime and compliance ease, such as fewer income tax slabs under the new regime and further indirect tax rationalisation, rather than broad rate reductions, as fiscal space is balanced against growth priorities.Speaking on the tax reforms and scope in the upcoming budget, Sanjiv Malhotra, Senior Advisor - Head of Tax Practice at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, talked to TOI and put light on the reality of the GST reforms and what he believes the government needs to do now. “Post pandemic India has experienced robust tax collections (both for direct and indirect taxes) and with a bullish GDP growth expectation for FY 2026, Government should have been able to make ample fiscal space without compromising too much on the fiscal deficit targets. FY 2025-26, however, is witnessing weaker tax collections both on income tax and GST,” he said.Further talking about the hit to government revenue, Malhotra added, “GST rationalisation in 2025 has hit the Government’s wallet hard and the same does not seem to have been off-set by stronger direct tax collections. Thus, the fiscal space seems to be limited. However, creative reallocation of funds can always create room for additional spendings in identified priority sectors.”Meanwhile, Sumit Singhania, Partner, Deloitte India also talked to TOI about real impact on tax collections but had an optimistic outlook. “The fiscal deficit target for FY26 was pegged at 4.4 percent in Budget 2025. Going by quarterly macro data, this target looks within the reach. Direct tax collections for the current fiscal is showing strong momentum 8%y-o-y growth YTD) even as GST collections growth may be subdued owing to a recent set of structural reforms. That said, overall tax and non-tax revenues growth is indeed encouraging and will help the government’s fiscal consolidation target on track. It’s quite likely that the fiscal deficit target for FY27 could be between 4.1 and 4.3 percent,” he said.He further talked about the scope for changes that he believes exist.Over the past five Union Budgets, infrastructure-led capital expenditure has moved from a counter-cyclical recovery tool to a significant piece in India’s growth strategy. Central capex allocation rose sharply from about Rs 5.54 lakh crore in FY 2021-22 to Rs 7.5 lakh crore in FY 2022-23, before crossing the Rs 10 lakh crore mark in FY 2023-24, a jump of nearly 37 per cent year-on-year. The interim FY 2024-25 Budget sustained this trajectory at around Rs 11.1 lakh crore, and FY 2025-26 pushed it further to roughly Rs 11.2 lakh crore, equivalent to just over 3 per cent of GDP. A large share of this outlay has consistently flowed into transport infrastructure, particularly roads and railways.Railways, in particular, show the long-term impact of sustained capex. With annual capital support rising to about Rs 2.6 lakh crore in recent budgets, a decade-long investment cycle has delivered visible system upgrades, including the rollout of more than 160 Vande Bharat trains and new Amrit Bharat services, rapid electrification of over 99 per cent of the broad-gauge network, and the phased deployment of the Kavach automatic train protection system to improve safety. Capacity augmentation, track renewal and station redevelopment have progressed alongside fleet expansion, with thousands of new coaches planned over FY 2025-26 and FY 2026-27.Another key part of capex and infrastructure growth is roads and highways. Since FY 2021-22, allocation for roads and highways has grown sharply. In that year, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways’ total expenditure was modest compared with later levels, but by FY 2022-23, capital support had jumped significantly, largely driven by a steep increase in capital expenditure for national highways.In FY 2023-24, the ministry’s budget allocation was around Rs 2.7 lakh crore, up by roughly 36 per cent from the previous year, with the National Highways Authority of India receiving around Rs 1.62 lakh crore for expanding and upgrading the network. The interim FY 2024-25 budget maintained this, allocating approximately Rs 2.78 lakh crore to the sector, while FY 2025-26 continued at similar levels around Rs 2.87 lakh crore, even as commitments shifted toward new project awards and expressway development. These sustained allocations have supported expansion of the national highway network, increased daily construction targets and major corridor projects.The key policy question ahead of Budget 2026 is fiscal sustainability. Although capital expenditure has remained high even as the fiscal deficit is steered lower, sustaining double-digit growth in outlays could prove difficult if tax revenues soften. The emphasis may therefore shift from rapid expansion to better asset utilisation, safety improvements and timely completion of ongoing projects, ensuring earlier investments translate into productivity gains without overstretching public finances.In this context, Budget 2026 could prioritise faster execution over simply higher allocations. The government may also present a clearer roadmap for asset monetisation to mobilise resources without widening the deficit. Industry groups such as the Confederation of Indian Industry have proposed a National Infrastructure Guarantee Corporation to enhance investor confidence, reduce financing costs and unlock stalled infrastructure projects.Talking about possible changes to Railways and infrastructure and what other sectors could have increased allocation, Anurag Gupta, Partner, Deloitte India told TOI, “While the growing trend in budgetary support is expected to continue in Budget 2026, greater reliance on PPPs would be critical to meet the ambitious investments goals laid out over next 10 years by IR. Apart from Railways, we expect growth across social infra sectors like water and sanitation. Lastly, capacity creation must also be complemented with seamless infrastructure service delivery and quality of infrastructure.”In the past few years, defence budget allocations have risen steadily, even as broader fiscal pressures have shaped allocations.In FY 2021-22, the defence budget hike was modest amid pandemic pressures, but it grew in FY 2022-23 to around Rs 5.25 lakh crore as the government prioritised operational readiness and modernisation.Meanwhile the allocations for FY 2023-24 was increased to around Rs 5.94 lakh crore, showing continued growth in investments in equipment as well as force development. The FY 2024-25 budget further raised the defence allocation to nearly Rs 6.22 lakh crore, making defence the second-largest ministry allocation and boosting capital outlay for modernisation and domestic procurement under the self-reliance agenda. In the FY 2025-26, the defence budget stood at a high of 6.81 lakh crore rupees, which signified a rise of nearly 9.5 percent compared to the budget figure of the previous year, with nearly 1.80 lakh crore rupees earmarked for buying newer defence equipment like aircraft, ships, etc.Throughout this period, revenue expenditure on salaries, maintenance and pensions has continued to account for a large share of the total, even as capital allocations emphasise modernisation and indigenous procurement under initiatives such as Make in India. The rising budget and sustained support for domestic defence production have coincided with record increases in defence production and exports, showing a shift toward self-reliance in military hardware.For Budget 2026, defence spending is expected to prioritise military preparedness and modernisation, in the backdrop of Operation Sindoor in May 2025. According to FICCI’s pre-Budget recommendations, India’s heightened external security environment and advances by adversaries in AI-enabled warfare, hypersonic systems, UAV swarms, and multi-domain operations make a strong, modern, and well-resourced defence architecture a strategic imperative. The industry body suggests increasing capital outlay to 30 per cent of the defence budget from 26 per cent, boosting frontline assets, UAVs, electronic warfare systems, and border air-defence capabilities, while also raising the DRDO allocation by Rs 10,000 crore to support frontier technologies, private sector collaboration, and deep-tech innovation.FICCI also mentioned indigenisation under Atmanirbhar Bharat, recommending expansion of Defence Industrial Corridors, including a proposed Eastern India corridor, to spur R&D, job creation, and global defence exports, which have grown at a CAGR of 46 per cent between 2016–17 and 2023–24. Establishing a Defence Export Promotion Council was also suggested to coordinate among DPSUs, private manufacturers, and foreign buyers, helping India reach its target of Rs 50,000 crore in exports by 2028–29.Over the past budgets, support for manufacturing under the Make in India agenda has increasingly centred on Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes and allied incentives aimed at boosting domestic production, investment and exports.PLI was introduced in the Budget for the first time in 2021 (after launch in 2020) with Rs 1.97 lakh crore allocation across 13 sectors.As of August-2025, 806 PLI applications have been approved across different sectors. Actual investments of around Rs 1.76 lakh crore have been realised and incremental production and sales are estimated at over Rs 16.5 lakh crore, generating more than 12 lakh jobs (direct and indirect).Incentives of Rs 21,500 crore approx. have been disbursed so far, aiding medical devices, pharmaceuticals and electronics expand capacity and exports, even as some sub-programmes face delays in payouts or delivery.Certain PLI initiatives, such as high-efficiency solar and advanced battery cells, have seen slower uptake so far, illustrating that outcomes vary significantly by sector.Overall, the PLI framework has strengthened manufacturing activity and global competitiveness, particularly in mobile and bulk drugs, though visible returns depend on sector readiness, compliance timelines, and efficient incentive disbursement, setting the stage for refinements in support as Budget 2026 approaches.Over the past five budgets, India’s welfare and subsidy allocations, particularly for food, fertiliser and fuel have been sharply recalibrated from the pandemic peak to more normalised levels. In FY 2021‑22, food and fertiliser subsidies remained elevated under pandemic relief measures, including free grains under PMGKAY, keeping the combined subsidy bill above pre-pandemic levels.Then, according to the Budget documents, total subsidies on food, fertilisers and petroleum were pegged at Rs 5,21,585 crore in the revised estimates for 2022–23, up from Rs 4,46,149 crore in the previous year. Food subsidy saw a marginal dip to Rs 2,87,194 crore from Rs 2,88,969 crore. In contrast, fertiliser subsidy surged to Rs 2,25,220 crore from Rs 1,53,758 crore, driven by higher support for both urea and phosphatic & potassic (P&K) nutrients. Petroleum subsidy also increased, rising to Rs 9,171 crore from Rs 3,423 crore.For the following fiscal year, total subsidies on food, fertilisers and petroleum were projected to decline by 28 per cent to Rs 3,74,707 crore, down from Rs 5,21,585 crore in 2022–23. Fertiliser subsidy was estimated to fall to Rs 1,75,100 crore from Rs 2,25,220 crore, while petroleum subsidy was expected to drop sharply to Rs 2,257 crore from Rs 9,171 crore. Food subsidy was also expected to have a reduction to Rs 1,97,350 crore, compared with Rs 2,87,194 crore a year earlier, following the discontinuation of the pandemic-era free foodgrain scheme.The interim FY 2024‑25 Budget allocated about Rs 4.09 lakh crore, with slight declines in fertiliser subsidies, while FY 2025‑26 saw total subsidies at roughly Rs 4.26 lakh crore, with food at Rs 2.03 lakh crore and fertiliser at Rs 1.67 lakh crore.For Budget 2026, subsidy provisions are expected to remain focused on targeted welfare delivery and efficiency rather than large expansions. With pandemic-time emergency relief measures mostly withdrawn, allocations may centre on the Public Distribution System, fertiliser support aligned with global price trends, and existing LPG or clean energy subsidy frameworks.Over the past five budgets, agriculture and rural development have been seen as fiscal priorities, FM Nirmala Sitharaman calling it the “first engine” of the country's development during the 2025-26 budget presentation.In Budget 2021-22 foundational schemes such as the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, expanded e-NAM mandis and micro-irrigation support were emphasised upon amid pandemic recovery. By Budget 2023-24, the government had increased allocations for the agriculture ministry to roughly Rs 1.25 lakh crore, including significant releases under PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi with more than Rs 2.8 lakh crore disbursed to over 11 crore farmers via direct benefit transfer. This year also saw higher spending on rural employment and insurance outlays to stabilise farm incomes.Subsequently, in the budget of FY 2024-25, the aggregate allocations funded to the agriculture and allied areas increased by an additional 4.5 per cent to Rs 1.40 lakh crores, with the latter registering double-digit growth. Similarly, the budget of 2025-26 proposed an allocation of about Rs 1.37 lakh crores and launching missions like rural prosperity, underemployment, skilling, and self-reliance.Throughout this period, rural safety nets such as MGNREGA remained stable, supporting work on rural infrastructure that increasingly benefited agricultural productivity, as evidenced by rising utilisation of funds for land development, irrigation and water harvesting.Looking into the expectations from Budget 2026, it would include the continued income support, raising the limit of subsidised credit (e.g., raising the limit on Kisan credit cards), building on the productivity and value chain missions, and a stronger impetus to rural resilience and employment generation to fuel growth in the agrarian economy.Based on the past budgets, there is a pattern emerging: a rise in capital expenditure, providing relief to the taxpayers, supporting the manufacturing sector, and providing impetus to welfare measures, all with the aim of cutting the fiscal deficit. Budget 2026 is likely to be a repeat performance of the above balancing act, as the economy is witnessing a pick-up in infrastructure, defence, and manufacturing sectors along with a fine-tuning of subsidies and taxes.Sanjiv Malhotra, Senior Advisor - Head of Tax Practice, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas told TOI, “Few sectors wherein I will place my bets (for increased allocations) will be defense, hi-tech manufacturing and skill development.”Thus, these signals indicate that Budget 2026 will likely focus on targeted investments and fiscal prudence, aiming to sustain growth while strengthening strategic sectors.","The union budget defines the country’s economic direction for the new financial year. Past budgets have marked significant personal income tax relief. Capital expenditure has consistently risen, marking the importance of infrastructure and connectivity as engines of growth.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127390670,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1557926,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
"Budget 2026: CREDAI pitches national rental housing mission; seeks tax relief, higher home loan deduction",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-credai-pitches-national-rental-housing-mission-seeks-tax-relief-higher-home-loan-deduction/articleshow/127389738.cms,"Realtors’ apex body CREDAI has urged the government to launch a National Rental Housing Mission in the upcoming Union Budget, proposing fiscal incentives for developers and tax relief for tenants to boost the underdeveloped organised rental housing market.In its Budget wishlist, CREDAI said rapid urbanisation and rising migrant inflows have sharply increased demand for rental homes, but supply remains inadequate, PTI reported. It recommended a national mission to create large-scale affordable rental housing in tier-1 and tier-2 cities, backed by incentives for developers, institutional participation and tenant-level tax benefits. Such a move would help formalise the rental market, curb informal settlements and support workforce mobility, the body said.CREDAI also reiterated its long-pending demand to raise the deduction limit on interest paid on home loans to Rs 5 lakh from the current Rs 2 lakh, and to revise the definition of affordable housing, including the area norms and the Rs 45 lakh price cap.“Housing remains a critical engine of economic growth, employment generation and urban transformation. To keep pace with India’s rapid urbanisation, it is vital to strengthen affordability, expand access to formal finance, and develop a robust rental housing ecosystem,” Shekhar Patel, President of CREDAI, said.The association flagged that the current definition of affordable housing has not been updated since 2017 and no longer reflects market realities. At present, affordable homes are capped at 60 square metres carpet area in metros and 90 square metres in non-metros, with a maximum value of Rs 45 lakh, and attract 1% GST.“The existing thresholds do not align with sharply higher land and construction costs,” CREDAI said, proposing that carpet area limits be raised to 90 square metres in metros and 120 square metres in non-metros, while removing the value cap entirely.Other real estate executives also outlined Budget expectations. Manoj Gaur, CMD of Gaurs Group, called for industry status for real estate, citing its large contribution to GDP and its position as the country’s second-largest employment generator.Shivam Agarwal, VP – Strategic Growth at Sattva Group, sought single-window clearances for Global Capability Centres (GCCs) to accelerate foreign investment, noting that GCCs are a key driver of office space demand.Ashok Kapur, Chairman of Krisumi Corporation, urged tax incentives and policy support for green and sustainable buildings, while Kirthi Chilukuri, Founder and MD of Stonecraft Group, called for stronger demand-side support for homebuyers to revive housing growth.",Realtors' apex body credai has urged the government to launch a national rental housing mission in the upcoming union budget.

Winners, laggards and sector signals

(With inputs from agencies)

The date for the presentation of the Union Budget is drawing closer and everyone is speculating what Nirmala Sitharaman 's bahikhata might just be holding. More than just a government financial statement, the event is a roadmap for taxation, spending and public policy that influences how the economy performs over the next year. The Budget announcements are tracked by both common man and Dalal Street, looking for tax rate changes, spending priorities and sectoral allocations, as they affect everything from household disposable income to corporate profitability and investment flows.As India prepares for the Union Budget 2026 to be presented on February 1, Sunday, the lessons and impacts from last year’s Budget 2025-26 help explain why this day matters so much for individuals, industries and financial markets.For ordinary people, Budget announcements have an immediate impact as they are affected by alterations in income tax, subsidies, welfare spendings. These key points affect everyone as they determine how much money families have left after meeting their tax obligations.For instance, last time in Budget 2025, the government offered major relief to common people, exempting annual income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new tax regime and restructuring slabs.This move increased disposable income for many middle-class households at a time when budgets were under pressure. Higher disposable income generally means stronger demand for goods and services.On the sectoral front, segments such as retail, automobiles, housing and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) benefit when consumers feel more confident about spending. Policy support for housing and homebuyers further strengthens construction activity and related industries, showing how tax decisions ripple through the wider economy.The February 1 announcement will serve as a major indicator of economic growth, corporate earnings and government finances for investors. Announcements on taxation, capital expenditure, subsidies and the fiscal deficit shape expectations about future economic performance. This year, even with tax relief and reforms, the government stuck to fiscal discipline, targeting a fiscal deficit of 4.4% of GDP for FY26, down from 4.8% in the current year.Market behaviour on Budget day highlighted this sensitivity. During the special trading session, the Sensex and Nifty opened higher but turned volatile after the speech. Both indices swung sharply through the day before ending almost flat, showing how quickly sentiment can change as investors process policy signals.The sectoral impact was uneven. Consumer, FMCG, automobile and consumer durable stocks gained on expectations of stronger demand. Insurance stocks drew support after the foreign direct investment limit in the sector was raised to 100%, potentially improving capital flows. Healthcare, green energy, agriculture-linked firms and water management companies also benefited from targeted measures.However, railway, defence and some infrastructure stocks disappointed investors. Although overall infrastructure allocations remained large, the increase in capital spending was modest, falling short of hopes for a major push.","Budget announcements are tracked by both common man and dalal street.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
