Draft Income Tax Rules 2026: The Income Tax Department has released a new set of draft income tax rules, which once finalised, will be applicable for financial year 2026-27. There are several changes in the draft income tax rules that impact the way you pay income tax, withdraw cash, pay in cash etc. and the need to quote your PAN card number for a variety of transactions.Following the release of the draft rules, the government has invited comments and suggestions from stakeholders, with February 22, 2026 set as the deadline for submitting feedback. After reviewing the responses received, the revised rules will be finalised, formally notified, and are expected to take effect from April 1, 2026.Under the proposed framework, the threshold limits for several transactions requiring PAN Card details to be disclosed have undergone a change.One of the main changes related to mandatory quoting of PAN Card relates to the limit for quoting PAN in transactions involving the purchase or sale of immovable property has been raised from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh.Also Read | Draft Income Tax Rules 2026 explained: How you can save Rs 1.41 lakh tax outgo - top points on HRA, PAN changes Similarly, the requirement to disclose PAN for cash deposits has been modified, increasing the threshold from Rs 50,000 in a single day to cash deposits of Rs 10 lakh or more during a financial year in a bank, cooperative bank, or post office.The draft also proposes that PAN Card details be shared if the total cash withdrawals reach Rs 10 lakh or more in a financial year across one or multiple accounts held by an individual.Under the current rules, PAN must be quoted when cash deposits of more than Rs 50,000 in a single day at a bank or post office are made. The draft income tax rules seek to revise this by introducing a higher threshold, requiring PAN details to be shared when total cash deposits are of Rs 10 lakh or more during a financial year across multiple accounts. The same annual limit has also been proposed for cash withdrawals, making PAN mandatory once withdrawals reach Rs 10 lakh in a financial year.If you buy a motor vehicle at present, the PAN Card details are required for all, excluding motorcycles. However, as per the proposed new income tax rules, PAN disclosure is compulsory only when the value of your motor vehicle or motorcycle is over Rs 5 lakh.Currently, PAN must be provided for payments made towards hotel or restaurant bills of over Rs 50,000. The draft rules suggest increasing this threshold to Rs 1 lakh.Existing regulations require PAN to be quoted for property transactions valued above Rs 10 lakh. The proposal recommends raising this limit to Rs 20 lakh.At present, PAN Card details are required when insurance premium payments are made above Rs 50,000. The draft income tax rules broaden this requirement. They extend the need for PAN Card to any account-based relationship maintained with insurance companies.","There are several changes in the draft income tax rules that impact the way you pay income tax.

What people expect





BHOPAL: The government in Madhya Pradesh is set to present its Budget for 2026–27 on Wednesday, with finance minister Jagdish Devda scheduled to begin his speech in the Assembly at 11 am.A day ahead of the presentation, the state government sought a loan of Rs 5,600 crore to meet its expenditure needs. This came even as the state’s Economic Survey projected a growth rate of 8.04%.The Economic Survey, tabled in the Assembly on Tuesday by Mr Devda, showed that the state’s total debt has risen to ₹4.90 lakh crore. This is higher than the total Budget size of ₹4.21 lakh crore for 2025–26. A supplementary Budget was also passed to cover additional expenses for the current financial year.The report sought to address concerns over rising debt, stating that the amount borrowed by the state government in a year has never exceeded the limit set by the Reserve Bank of India.Ahead of the Budget, ordinary citizens said they were hoping for measures that address everyday concerns, including employment, healthcare and infrastructure.Rohan Verma, a final-year commerce student in Bhopal, said training programmes should be linked to real employment opportunities.“Training must be connected with actual jobs so that students can build stable careers in the state,” he said.Senior citizens called for a smoother and more transparent pension system. Professor Sharad Naik, from the civil engineering department of a private college, said timely pensions and stronger safety measures were essential. “The elderly should be able to live with dignity and financial security,” he said.Aarti Mishra, a homemaker, said government hospitals needed better facilities. “There should be proper doctors, medicines and cleanliness in government hospitals so that families do not have to depend on expensive private treatment,” she said.Expectations from the Budget reflect broader public concerns that go beyond industry and investment, focusing instead on jobs, social security and basic services.","The state government sought a loan of rs 5,600 crore to meet its expenditure needs.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Union Budget 2026: Government’s sankalp to build a Healthy India and shape a Viksit Bharat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2026-governments-sankalp-to-build-a-healthy-india-and-shape-a-viksit-bharat/articleshow/128431447.cms,"By Bhanu Prakash Kalmath SJ

Budget 2026 Sets Long-Term Direction For India’s Economic Growth: Kidwai

(Bhanu Prakash Kalmath SJ is Partner and Healthcare Industry Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat)

Union Budget 2026 signals a decisive pivot in India’s health policy to build the full stack required for an innovation-led, patient-centred health economy. The government’s priorities are visible in three simultaneous moves: elevating India from a generics-first market to a credible biologics and biosimilars hub; scaling clinical trials and regulatory infrastructure to global standards; and strengthening preventive care and service delivery in areas where the system remains thin—mental health, emergency and trauma care, allied health manpower for Viksit Bharat, and integrative care that can anchor medical value tourism. Put simply, this is a capability-building budget: it lays the rails for discovering, testing, approving, and delivering advanced therapies at scale.This direction closely aligns with what the Economic Survey 2025–26 has flagged about the double burden of increasing Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and communicable diseases (CDs) though the CDs are declining. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers now account for over 57 per cent of all deaths, while overweight and obesity affect 24 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men - clear markers of lifestyle-driven risk accumulating across the working-age population.The Budget also reinforces the need to shift the health system from being largely treatment-led to one that prioritises prevention, early intervention, and behavioural health, reflecting growing concern around rising digital addiction and its mental-health implications highlighted in the Survey.The headline announcement, Biopharma SHAKTI, with an outlay of ₹10,000 crore over five years, aims to enhance domestic manufacturing capability in the emerging biopharma market requiring significant capital- and talent investments. It seeks to move India up the pharmaceutical value chain, from volume-driven generics to complex therapies. The proposed expansion and upgrading of NIPERs, creation of over 1,000 accredited clinical trial sites, and strengthening of the CDSCO through specialised scientific cadres together address long-standing bottlenecks in skills, trials, and regulatory timelines. Long-awaited reforms in the clinical trials ecosystem are a welcome move and could further attract global pharma Global Capability Centres (GCC) to India who are moving up the value chain to be an integral part of the R&D.Affordability and ease of living receive immediate attention as well. Exempting basic customs duty on 17 cancer drugs and extending duty-free personal imports to seven additional rare diseases provide near-term relief from out-of-pocket costs while domestic biopharma capacity scales up, an important intervention given that one in nine Indians faces a lifetime risk of cancer.On the service delivery side, the establishment of NIMHANS-2 in North India, upgrades of mental health institutes in Ranchi and Tezpur to regional apex centres, and a 50 per cent expansion of emergency and trauma care capacity across district hospitals directly address geographic inequities in mental health access and the catastrophic expenditures that medical emergencies often trigger. These choices emphasise behavioural health pressures, including anxiety and depression linked to excessive screen time, now increasingly visible among younger cohorts.Manpower- critical to both care delivery and prevention- is another binding constraint the Budget seeks to ease. Upgrading allied health institutions, adding 100,000 Allied Health Professionals across ten disciplines, and training 1.5 lakh caregivers in areas such as geriatric care, wellness, yoga, and assistive technologies will provide the operating muscle hospitals and home-care ecosystems need to translate infrastructure investments into improved throughput and quality.The Budget also reinforces India’s integrative and export-oriented healthcare vision. Proposals to establish five Regional Medical Hubs and strengthen AYUSH- including three new All India Institutes of Ayurveda, upgraded pharmacies and drug-testing laboratories, and an enhanced WHO Global Traditional Medicine Centre- aim to meet growing global demand while supporting farmers, skilled youth, and evidence-based traditional medicine. Importantly, this positions AYUSH not only as a cultural asset but also as a preventive and wellness pillar within the broader health system.Where does this leave the industry, and what will India gain if execution matches intent? In the near term, patients should see lower landed prices for select oncology and rare-disease therapies, hospitals should gain staffing depth that improves operating performance, and more clinical trials should begin and conclude in India with clearer and more predictable regulatory reviews. Over the medium term, domestic biopharma can move up the value chain, medical hubs can translate into sustained medical tourism revenues, and strengthened mental-health and emergency networks can begin to reduce avoidable mortality and catastrophic health spending.As India builds #HealthyIndia to shape a #Vibrant Bharat, further increasing the budget on public health expenditure as a share of GDP and greater support to encourage Research & Development in India would naturally strengthen the framework laid out in this Budget, particularly as the country seeks to deepen innovation and preventive care. Many themes - such as reducing the cost of cancer care, expanding mental-health and emergency infrastructure, strengthening the health workforce, and advancing the ‘Heal in India’ vision to grow medical tourism- also reflect continuity with previous budgets.Overall, Budget 2026 represents a systems-level push. By combining manufacturing, prevention, workforce development, affordability, and integrative care, it moves India closer to becoming a high value products producer at low cost and also a credible hub for prevention, innovation, and advanced healthcare delivery - an essential foundation for a healthier, more resilient, and Viksit Bharat.”","Union budget 2026 signals a decisive pivot in india’s health policy to build the full stack required for an innovation-led, patient-centred health economy.

Budget 2026 Overview: What Citizens And Businesses Should Know

(Smritikona Dutta is Tax Partner, EY India. Inputs from Annubhav Kapoor, Senior Tax Professional, EY India)

India’s Union Budget 2026–27 signals a steady but deliberate shift toward the Government’s three stated ‘kartavyas’ of accelerating economic growth, building human capability, and widening access to amenities and resources. The administration has stated that the threefold approach can be achieved through an investment friendly, technology driven and compliance simplified growth. At a time of severe global disruptions, the government’s ability to keep the fiscal deficit below 4.5% of GDP stands out as an appreciable display of fiscal discipline, crucial for maintaining investor trust and protecting sovereign ratings.This discipline is even more notable considering the strain on revenue collections due to wider income tax slabs announced last year, the rollout of GST 2.0, and multiple free-trade agreements, while expected to boost export competitiveness, are likely to weigh on the Government’s revenue streams over the coming years. Within this context, the Budget maintains its momentum on infrastructure creation while addressing structural and systemic rigidities that have long constrained ease of doing business.The record capital outlay for railways encompassing high-speed passenger and freight corridors and introduction of India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) 2.0 alongwith enhanced allocations towards the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme.The aforesaid steps collectively lay the groundwork for long-term industrial and logistical capacity. Certain additional measures such as tax clarity for data centre operations and deductions linked to rare earth mineral extraction reinforce the Government’s intent to encourage domestic manufacturing in strategically important sectors.The GST side saw a lighter set of direct announcements, consistent with the post-GST Council tradition of treating GST reforms as a collaborative inter-governmental process rather than a Budget-exclusive domain. Still, much awaited legislative changes have been brought in through the omission of intermediary service provisions and alignment of post-sale discounts, easing longstanding compliance concerns for manufacturers and service exporters. Provisional refunds under the inverted duty structure mechanism should offer some relief to MSMEs facing liquidity pressures. However, the industry’s broader expectation of including capital goods and input services within the inverted duty refund framework still remains.Customs related measures such as rollout of customs integrated system for all customs processes, increase in personal duty-free baggage limits and exemption on certain health care drugs/medicines would help in reducing tax burden on individual consumers. On a business side, additional benefits for authorised economic operators, the extension of advance ruling validity, simpler warehousing procedures and removal of the 10 lakh cap on courier exports collectively reduce interpretative ambiguity and are likely to lower classification related disputes. These moves help simplify duty planning and facilitate smoother cross border trade.A request for redressal of many legacy disputes through an amnesty style scheme was widely expected. Yet, the absence of any such mechanism indicates the government’s cautious stance on revenue foregone. Instead, emphasis seems to be on preventing new disputes through digital consistency and a clarified tax regime.Among the impactful announcements is the relief extended to Special Economic Zones. Although SEZ exports remain substantial, manufacturers have struggled with under-utilised capacity and limited domestic sales flexibility. The decision to allow eligible SEZ manufacturing units to sell a limited portion of their output into the domestic market at concessional duty rates marks a major shift. Under the earlier regime, such sales were treated as imports and taxed at full output duty levels. The new relaxation is expected to ease inventory accumulation challenges being presently faced by manufacturing SEZ’s due to geopolitical tariffs.Collectively, the post-Budget indirect tax landscape reflects a pathway towards focusing on operational improvements, supply chain facilitation and targeted competitiveness enhancement rather than across the board tax relief. The policy direction being unmistakable: a gradual, technology driven, investment aligned tax regime that balances fiscal stability with long term efficiency.",The government’s ability to keep the fiscal deficit below 4.5% of gdp stands out as an appreciable display of fiscal discipline.

India’s effort to strengthen its manufacturing foundation has steadily progressed over the past decade through a series of significant policy measures. A major milestone was the launch of the Make in India initiative in 2014, designed to encourage investment, spur innovation, and improve ease of doing business. Labour reforms also moved forward with the rollout of the four Labour Codes on 21 November 2025, merging 29 Central labour laws to streamline compliance and create a modern, resilient workforce framework. Complementing these domestic reforms, India has simultaneously intensified its global trade engagement through a renewed focus on Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Together, these reforms laid the foundation for the renewed manufacturing push outlined in Union Budget 2026.The Budget 2026 places manufacturing as a strategic and frontier sector for sustaining economic growth. The government framed the Budget as a continuation of structural reforms aimed at improving productivity, boosting competitiveness, and strengthening resilience against global disruptions.In light of the rapid progress under the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme, the Budget proposes expanding its allocation to ₹40,000 crore, reaffirming India’s ambition to enhance domestic value addition and secure its place in global electronics supply chains.To compliment this, income tax holiday is being provided for five years to non-residents providing capital goods, equipment, or tooling to contract manufacturer operating in customs-bonded zones. This will help reduce costs which were being incurred on specialised equipment. Safe harbour provisions have been extended to non-residents for component warehousing in a bonded warehouse at a profit margin of 2 percent of the invoice value with a resulting tax incidence of 0.7 percent. This will harness efficiency of just-in-time logistics for the sector.A key highlight is the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) 2.0, to produce equipment and materials, design full-stack Indian IP, and fortify supply chains signalling the country’s ongoing commitment to building a robust domestic semiconductor ecosystem.There is tremendous potential for the aviation sector with rise in airports and regional connectivity under the UDAN schemes. To build sustainable ecosystem it is important to manufacture aircrafts and undertake MRO activities within the country. With this vision basic customs duty is exempted on parts and components imported for manufacture of aircraft. Further, basic customs duty on raw materials imported for manufacture of parts used in maintenance, repair or overhaul requirements in defence units is also exempted. The government has also proposed a seaplane VGF scheme to support operations and indigenise manufacturing of seaplanes.A Scheme for Rare Earth Permanent Magnets, launched in late 2025, is now complemented by proposed support for Rare Earth Corridors across mineral-rich states to promote mining, processing, research and manufacturing.The Budget also introduces Biopharma SHAKTI—a five-year, ₹10,000 crore programme to position India as a global hub for biopharma manufacturing by strengthening capabilities in biologics and biosimilars.To boost the chemicals sector, the government has launched a scheme supporting States in developing chemical parks to expand domestic production.The capital goods sector, often the silent driver of productivity, receives a comprehensive support package. This includes the establishment of Hi-Tech Tool Rooms by Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) as digital service hubs for precision components, a scheme for advanced construction and infrastructure equipment. ₹10,000 crore over five-years is also allocated to develop a competitive container manufacturing ecosystem. These interventions aim to reduce import dependence, shorten supply chains, and lower costs.Beyond advanced manufacturing, the Budget extends support to labour-intensive sectors such as textiles. It also introduces a dedicated thrust to develop India into a global centre for high-quality, affordable sports goods.A Scheme has been proposed to revive 200 legacy industrial clusters to improve their cost competitiveness and efficiency through infrastructure and technology upgradation.Impetus to the manufacturing sector is also provided through taxes. Basic customs duty exemptions have been extended across emerging sectors, including lithium-ion cell battery storage systems, critical mineral processing equipment, raw material for wind turbines and nuclear power plants.In essence, the Union Budget 2026 represents a holistic manufacturing-led growth strategy. It marries structural reforms with targeted fiscal incentives, embraces both advanced and traditional industries, and puts exports and global competitiveness at the centre of its vision. The new set of measures and focus on emerging sectors has the potential to deepen the country’s industrial capabilities and strengthen its position in global value chains. On ground execution and collaboration could mark a transformative chapter in India’s industrial journey.","The budget 2026 places manufacturing as a strategic and frontier sector for sustaining economic growth.

India’s Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Budget 2026-27 on 1 February 2026, the ninth of her tenure, terming it as a unique Yuva Shakti-driven Budget.Rather than announcing sweeping tax reductions, the Budget reinforced continuity from last year and focused more on administrative simplification, extending selective relief against the backdrop of substantial tax changes in recent years. There is substantial thrust on promoting ease of compliance for the ordinary taxpayer. This article highlights below some of these proposals.The Hon’ble FM has chosen to retain stability in income tax slabs and rates. The structure applicable for FY 2025–26 continues unchanged in FY 2026-27, under which salaried individuals effectively pay no tax on income up to approximately INR 12 lakhs after considering standard deduction of INR 75,000 and applicable rebates.In line with expectations, the new Income Tax Act 2025, which supersedes the long-standing Act of 1961, will now be effective from 1 April 2026. The new Act was drafted with a valiant attempt at simplification of provisions by reducing jargon and using layman language instead for easier comprehension. The related Income Tax Rules and Forms are expected to be notified shortly, to provide taxpayers sufficient time to familiarize themselves with the new requirements.It would be critical to have these, including the electronic versions, tested and released at the earliest so that tax filing truly becomes a smooth experience for taxpayers.Tax return deadlines have been extended to 31 August in case of non-audit business cases. Other categories of individual taxpayers filing ITR1 and ITR2 will continue to follow the deadline of 31 July. The extended deadline will give some breathing space to such taxpayers to finalise their books of accounts and gather details of business income.Another helpful reform in this year’s Budget permits taxpayers to submit revised income tax returns up to the next 31 March, extending the previous deadline of 31 December. With a nominal fee of INR 1000/ 5000 (depending on income of below/ above INR 5 lakhs), this extension provides taxpayers with greater flexibility and reduces the time pressure for correcting errors. This will be particularly useful for globally mobile taxpayers who have income and reporting requirements of foreign income and assets arising in tax jurisdictions outside India whose tax years are calendar years. It will also allow them to avail tax treaty relief in cases of double taxation.To encourage voluntary compliance and reduce litigation, taxpayers will now be permitted to file Updated returns even after reassessment proceedings have begun, subject to payment of an additional 10% tax over and above the prescribed additional tax. Furthermore, updated returns can be filed even where there is a reduction in claimed losses.Over the past few years, after the introduction of the Black Money law, reporting of Foreign Assets and Income had become a stressful exercise for many people who did not have organised data at their disposal. Consequently, there have been multiple instances of taxpayers missing disclosure requirements. To give some relief to such taxpayers, a six-month tax amnesty scheme has been introduced to facilitate reporting of undisclosed foreign assets/income by certain categories of taxpayers like students, young professionals, tech employees, relocated NRIs, etc.In cases where the taxpayer has acquired such foreign asset from identified sources of income earned in India or abroad, reporting can be done upon a fee payment of INR 1 lakh if the maximum value (FMV) of assets covered is INR 5 crores. In cases where the taxpayer is unable to substantiate the source of funds for acquiring such asset(s), the amnesty scheme permits disclosure of assets, and any income arising therefrom, of a maximum aggregate value of INR 1 crore. The value of the asset would be at FMV and the tax payable will be 60% of such FMV/value. No further penalty is leviable.Budget 2026 has rationalised various Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) provisions, making them less burdensome:These changes make funds more accessible for genuine personal needs instead of getting locked up for refund claims later.In case of taxpayers holding securities in multiple companies, depositories will now be able to accept Form 15G/15H from the investor and provide it directly to various relevant companies. This will eliminate the hassle of tracking multiple investments and missing submissions by taxpayers.The Budget proposes a major overhaul of criminal prosecution provisions under the Act with the aim to minimise unnecessary litigation while maintaining a careful balance for deterrence in some serious offences. In a very welcome move, assessment and penalty proceedings are proposed to be merged into a single order. In addition, it is proposed to remove interest liability on penalties during the pendency of initial appeal proceedings and also lower deposit requirements for tax demands under appeal from the existing 20% to 10%.In order to facilitate Indian businesses in specific sectors to avail of services of foreign experts with specialised skills, compliance has been made easier for such non-resident individuals. It is proposed to exempt income earned outside India (which is not deemed to accrue or arise in India) for a period of 5 consecutive tax years beginning with the first year of services. To be eligible for this relaxation, the individual should be non-resident in India for the last 5 years preceding the start of such services in India.The applicable Schemes are yet to be notified by the Government, but clearly this amendment will be welcomed by industries which need specialised experts to come and work in India. Measures like these will also make India an attractive destination for foreign experts to come and work in India.This Budget was more about consolidation of tax reforms and progress along the path laid out last year. With hardly any big bang changes, it has focused on procedural reforms and simplification under the New Income-tax Act, 2025. There were a few missed chances for greater simplification, e.g. in the area of capital gains, or TDS on rent payments to non-resident landlords, etc. We also hope that the related rules forms are released at the earliest to ensure taxpayers get adequate time to absorb and adopt these changes right from the start of the new tax year.","India’s union finance minister nirmala sitharaman presented the budget 2026-27 on 1 february 2026, terming it as a unique yuva shakti-driven budget. Rather than announcing sweeping tax reductions, the budget reinforced continuity from last year and focused more on administrative simplification.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128106395,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-44452,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Budget 2026 Signals Infra First Strategy With Public Capital Expenditure Raised To ₹12.2 Lakh Crore

(Chintan Patel is Partner- Deal Advisory and Head of Real Estate & Hospitality and Transport & Logistics, KPMG in India and Aman Mehta is Vice President – M&A Consulting, KPMG in India)

The Union Budget 2026–27 reinforces a push towards infrastructure driven economic growth, setting a constructive backdrop for India’s real estate sector. While the budget does not introduce direct demand-side incentives for housing, its sharp focus on infrastructure, manufacturing, urban development and tourism is expected to create strong indirect momentum across residential, commercial, industrial and hospitality real estate segments.A key positive for the sector is the continued scale-up of public capital expenditure, with infrastructure outlay rising to INR 12.2 lakh crore from INR 11.2 lakh crore (FY 25-26). Sustained investment in transport networks and urban infrastructure is likely to unlock new real estate growth corridors, particularly beyond the traditional metro markets. The emphasis on strengthening Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities with populations exceeding five lakh recognizes their emerging role as economic centers and is expected to support incremental demand for various real estate asset classes in these locations.The Budget has in addition also proposed the development of seven high‑speed rail corridors connecting major urban and economic centers, aimed at improving inter‑city mobility and acting as growth catalysts along peripheral and secondary micro-markets. In parallel, the creation of City Economic Regions (CERs) across Tier‑2 and Tier‑3 cities, backed by INR 5,000 crore investments per CER across five years, seeks to strengthen infrastructure and accelerate their transition into regional economic hubs, with positive implications for the real estate sector. Measures such as the proposed Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund and continued monetization of CPSE real estate assets through REIT structures are likely to improve private sector participation and liquidity within the infrastructure and real estate sector.The accelerated push toward manufacturing across sectors such as biopharma, electronics, chemicals, textiles, rare earths, and construction equipment is expected to significantly influence the industrial and logistics landscape. The expansion of manufacturing ecosystems, revitalization of legacy industrial clusters, and development of modern plug‑and‑play industrial parks will not only drive sustained long‑term demand for industrial land, warehousing and R&D infrastructure but also enhance the overall growth outlook for the real estate sector across multiple regions.The Budget underscores tourism‑led economic development with a focus on healthcare, heritage and eco‑tourism. Key proposals include the establishment of five regional medical hubs, development of 15 archaeological and heritage sites as experiential cultural destinations. Additionally, the proposal of Buddhist circuits across the North‑Eastern states is expected to strengthen spiritual tourism and support hospitality‑led regional growth.In the budget, while direct tax incentives remain limited, there is a stronger emphasis on a predictable, rules‑based tax regime aimed at resolving long‑standing procedural bottlenecks and transfer‑pricing disputes. This shift enhances investor confidence, lowers risk premiums for foreign capital, and supports more resilient financial markets. The Budget also introduces multi‑decade tax clarity for foreign cloud service providers, who are procuring data center services from India, ensuring non‑taxation on eligible cloud‑related income until 2047. Additionally, the introduction of a 15 per cent on cost safe harbor margin for Indian data‑center entities servicing overseas affiliates strengthens India’s positioning as a competitive hub for hyperscale cloud infrastructure. These measures are likely to attract long term capital into digital infrastructure including new entrants in the data center space.Tax compliance has been eased for resident buyers purchasing immovable property from non‑residents. The removal of the requirement to obtain a TAN, allowing TDS deposits through the buyer’s PAN, streamlines cross‑border transactions and reduces administrative friction.A notable aspect of the Union Budget 2026 was the continued absence of direct tax incentives for the residential real estate sector including on the homebuyer’s ask for increasing the INR 2 lakh cap on interest deduction for self-occupied properties. Despite long‑standing industry expectations, the Budget did not introduce any new exemptions, relief, credit of GST paid on inputs by developers or confer infrastructure status to the real estate sector, measures that stakeholders have consistently advocated to boost sectoral growth.Overall, the Union Budget 2026–27 positions real estate as a downstream beneficiary of infrastructure-led growth. While near-term residential stimulus may be limited, the structural measures announced provide a strong foundation for a geographically diversified and long-term expansion of the sector.","Union budget 2026–27 positions real estate as a downstream beneficiary of infrastructure-led growth.

Carry-Forward Expectations

India’s real estate sector continued its growth momentum in 2025, reaffirming its position as a core pillar of the country's economic expansion. Currently contributing nearly 8% to GDP, the sector is projected to contribute 15-16% by 2047, aligning with India’s vision of “Viksit Bharat”. The Budget reinforces this trajectory through infrastructure-led development, policy & tax reforms, though some sector-specific expectations remain unaddressed.Proposal to monetize public sector real estate assets through dedicated REITs is expected to unlock value from idle assets, deepen institutional participation & enable efficient capital recycling across the sector.The government has reiterated its commitment to Tier 2 & Tier 3 cities, including temple towns, by allocating INR 5,000 crore over 5 years per City Economic Region. This is likely to stimulate urbanisation beyond metros & drive housing demand.Another notable thrust is on industrial & logistics corridors, supported by development of university townships integrating research institutions, skill centres & residential infrastructure.This integrated approach is expected to boost employment generation while creating demand for commercial & residential real estate.Further, development of dedicated rail freight corridors, textile & chemical parks will have positive spillover effects on industrial real estate, warehousing & allied infrastructure.For self-occupied properties, prior-period interest on housing loans continues to be deductible in 5 equal installments after construction completion. This prior-period interest has now been aligned with the Old Regime, with the overall interest deduction capped at INR 2 lakh per annum.Resident individuals & HUFs purchasing property from non-resident sellers can now deduct TDS by quoting PAN without the requirement to obtain a TAN.Consideration received on buy-back of shares will now be taxed as capital gains instead of dividends, with entitlement to capital loss on the cost of shares. However, promoters will be subject to an additional levy, resulting in higher effective tax rate for them.The Budget aligns income-tax provisions for compulsory acquisition of land under Right to Fair Compensation & Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation & Resettlement Act, 2013, bringing clarity & consistency.MAT has been proposed to be reduced from 15% to 14%.For domestic companies continuing under the old tax regime post March 31, 2026, MAT paid will be treated as final tax liability, with no new MAT credit generation. Existing MAT credit as on March 31, 2026 will not be available for set-off unless the company transitions to the new regime.Companies migrating to the new regime during or after FY 2026–27 will be allowed to utilise MAT credit, subject to set-off capped at 25% of normal tax liability per year & carry forward permitted for 15 years from the date of generation.The MAT amendments are designed to encourage migration to the new tax regime. However, as REIT unitholder dividend exemptions remain linked to SPVs under the old regime, REIT managers will need to carefully evaluate the cost-benefit implications.The Budget also promotes foreign investment in Indian data centres by introducing a tax holiday for foreign companies until March 31, 2047 on income from procuring data centre services from specified Indian facilities. Services to Indian users must be routed through an Indian reseller entity.Additionally, the government has proposed the convergence of the Income Computation and Disclosure Standards (ICDS) with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) through a joint Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)–Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) committee, along with a comprehensive review of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules to align them with India’s evolving economic priorities.Even as the reforms strengthen the sector’s overall framework, certain areas could be candidates for future refinement, including affordable housing incentives, interest deduction limits under the new regime, sector-specific relief for hospitality and tourism, and flexibility in ITC utilisation for leased assets.Overall, the Budget presents a largely positive outlook for the real estate sector, driven by infrastructure expansion, regional development & tax rationalisation. The government’s proactive engagement with industry stakeholders throughout the year rather than relying solely on annual budget announcements offers optimism that pending sectoral expectations may be addressed as India progresses toward its Viksit Bharat 2047 vision.","India’s real estate sector continued its growth momentum in 2025, reaffirming its position as a core pillar of the country's economic expansion.

Announced against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions, the Union Budget 2026–27 carried expectations of reinforcing India’s global standing—especially in light of recently concluded Foreign Trade Agreements. The Budget 2026 continues to advance India’s long‑term strategic narrative: strengthening manufacturing as the core engine of growth while simultaneously expanding the country’s capabilities in services and digital trade.The Finance Minister reaffirmed the centrality of manufacturing to India’s economic strategy. Large‑scale investments in textiles, semiconductors, rare‑earth mining, infrastructure, and MSME development signal the Government’s intent to build resilient, future‑ready industrial capacity. These interventions align strongly with India’s aspiration to emerge as a global manufacturing hub.Complementing manufacturing, the Budget underscores the Sankalp for accelerating and sustaining economic growth, fulfilling citizen aspirations, and advancing the vision ofwithin the framework of the three. This focus manifests in initiatives aimed at strengthening the services ecosystem and positioning India deeper within global value chains.Several targeted interventions demonstrate this intent. In a major relief to the IT sector, the Government has introduced several tax reforms, including but not limited to consolidating services under a single category of IT Services with a common safe‑harbour margin of 15.5 percent, increasing the safe-harbour threshold from ₹300 crore to ₹2,000 crore to ease compliance for large taxpayers, and introducing tax holidays until 2047 for foreign companies offering cloud services through India‑based data centres, with a 15 percent safe‑harbour for related entities providing supporting data‑center operations. These key reforms would aid in creating long‑term policy predictability and reinforce India’s digital infrastructure competitiveness.As regards providing a push to the creative industries, establishment of AVGC Content Creator Lab in schools and colleges is likely to accelerate skill development in animation, gaming, VFX, and digital content creation industries which are already experiencing exponential global demand.In terms of alleviating the tourism and hospitality needs of India, a National Institute of Hospitality is proposed which would integrate academia, industry, and the Government. This move is expected to uplift service standards, aligning India’s hospitality workforce with global benchmarks, scale up India’s tourism offerings, boost employment, and enhance economic contribution from both domestic and international tourism.With education and healthcare forming the backbone of any resilient economy, the Budget’s initiatives—such as the creation of a High‑Powered “Education to Employment and Enterprise” Standing Committee and the upgrading of existing institutions alongside the establishment of new centres for training Allied Health Professionals—represent critical forward‑looking interventions. These measures are expected to significantly narrow the skill gap by aligning academic curricula with evolving industry needs, ensuring that learners acquire job‑ready competencies. Together, they will not only enhance employability but also strengthen the quality and preparedness of India’s future workforce, positioning the country to meet the growing demands of a rapidly transforming economic landscape.On a separate note, the Budget lays out a forward‑looking roadmap for strengthening maritime and inland logistics. The introduction of new Dedicated Freight Corridors connecting the East and the West, along with 20 new National Waterways to improve connectivity between mineral belts, industrial hubs, and ports, signals a major push toward integrated transport infrastructure. The proposed development of a ship‑repair ecosystem for inland waterways and the launch of the Coastal Cargo Promotion Scheme—aimed at doubling the share of coastal and inland waterway cargo by 2047 - further demonstrates the Government’s commitment to modernizing multimodal logistics.Reflecting a clear shift from policing to facilitating trade, the Budget introduces a series of trust‑based governance measures aimed at enhancing efficiency, predictability, and transparency within customs processes.Key reforms include the extension of the duty‑deferral period for Tier 2 and Tier 3 AEOs from the current 15 days to 30 days, providing businesses with improved cash‑flow flexibility and reduced working‑capital strain. Additionally, the validity of binding advance rulings has been increased from 3 to 5 years, offering greater certainty to importers and exporters in planning their tax positions. The Government has also proposed recognizing regular, compliant importers within customs risk‑assessment systems, thereby reducing repetitive verification and enabling faster cargo clearance for trusted entities in addition to streamlining the overall Customs Integrated System.While the journey toward fully meeting expectations on Customs simplification has only begun, the initiatives announced in the Budget mark a clear and progressive shift toward enhancing ease of doing business and improving predictability across trade processes. These reforms reinforce the Government’s intent to build a more efficient, trust‑based regulatory environment for importers and exporters alike.It is also noteworthy that the Budget continues to advance India’s agenda of becoming a more attractive investment destination. Key measures include permitting Persons Resident Outside India (PROIs) to invest in listed Indian equities through the Portfolio Investment Scheme, rationalizing TDS/TCS rates to reduce compliance burden, and decriminalizing procedural lapses such as non‑production of books of account or delays in tax deduction payments. Collectively, these steps strengthen investor confidence, improve regulatory clarity, and align with India’s broader objective of fostering a transparent, growth‑oriented business ecosystem under the broader vision ofOverall, the Budget 2026–27 has been delivered with clarity, balance, and a long‑term vision. It successfully addresses expectations across sectors—strengthening manufacturing, deepening services capability, modernizing logistics, and promoting trust‑based governance. This year’s Budget, in many ways, sets the tone for India’s next phase of economic transformation.","Decoding budget 2026-27: delivering clarity, balance, and a long‑term vision (ai image) by rajeev dimri and kunal kohli, kpmg in india.

How will a person who has an income Rs 12 lakh benefit from new rates?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said.

With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden.Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.",Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: faqs answered. Finance minister nirmala sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime.
