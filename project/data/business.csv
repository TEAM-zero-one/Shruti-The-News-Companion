on the income tax front? We take a look at the top 5 expectations.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Income Tax Slabs FY 2026-27 & Rebate Under Section 87A

Income up to Rs 4 lakh is exempt from tax - so the basic exemption limit is Rs 4 lakh. There is an ask among taxpayers that this limit be hiked further to reduce compliance burden.

Income in the Rs 4 lakh to Rs 8 lakh bracket attracts a 5% tax.

Income in the Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh bracket attracts a 10% tax.

Income ranging from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 16 lakh is taxed at 15%, rising to 20% for income between Rs 16 lakh and Rs 20 lakh. Those earning between Rs 20 lakh and rs 24 lakh are taxed at 25%.

Any income above Rs 24 lakh is taxed at the highest slab rate of 30%. Salaried taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to raise the income threshold for 30% tax bracket to Rs 30 lakh.

At present income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers) is tax free after availing rebate under Section 87A. Tax experts suggest that this limit can be hiked to Rs 15 lakh.

Standard Deduction

Home Loan Interest

self-occupied residential property

Section 80C

Tax Filing Compliance

Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget speech in the hope of more tax relief. Last year, FM Sitharaman announced major changes in the new income tax regime, and while tax experts believe that there is little fiscal room in Budget 2026 for any big tax income tweaks, there is also a hope that some changes may be brought about to further boost consumption.At present the income tax slabs under the new tax regime are:Several taxpayers continue to file tax returns under the old income tax regime. They want the government to reduce tax rates and hike basic exemption limit under that regime as well.Standard deduction limits under the old and the new income tax regimes differ. Those filing tax under the old income tax regime get the benefit of Rs 50,000 standard deduction, while those under the new income tax regime can avail a higher standard deduction of Rs 75,000. Tax experts are of the view that there is a case to hike the standard deduction limit, especially under the new tax regime which offers very few deductions and exemptions.Individual taxpayers can avail tax deduction on the interest paid on a home loan under the old income tax regime. The interest you pay on a home loan for yourcan be deducted from your taxable income up to ₹2 lakh per year (or actual interest paid if less). Tax experts are of the view that to encourage housing sector, this benefit should also be available under the new tax regime.Section 80C is a popular exemption available under the old income tax regime, but its limit of Rs 1.5 lakh has remained unchanged for many years now. The exemption is for investments made in Provident Fund, Public Provident Fund (PPF), mutual funds and other popular investment options. Tax experts believe that to incentivise savings, there is a case to not only hike this limit, but also include this exemption benefit under the new income tax regime to encourage adoption.The government has been focusing on ease of income tax return filing, but taxpayers believe that e-filing of returns still needs to be made easier. The tax compliance mechanism, grievance redressal system, and tax queries related to mismatches in the Annual Information Statement (AIS), Form 16, Form 26AS needs to be made less complicated, say tax experts.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations: like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to fm nirmala sitharaman’s union budget speech in the hope of more tax relief.

Both exchanges said market hours will remain unchanged, following the standard schedule for a regular trading session.Gold and silver futures also hit the lower circuit limits ahead of the Union Budget 2026–27 presentation.The BSE added that while key segments such as equity, futures and options, and commodity derivatives will operate normally, certain specialised sessions will be suspended.“Trading Members may note that trading in the T+0 Settlement Session and Auction Session for settlement default will not be conducted on Sunday, February 01, 2026,” the exchange said.Trading on a Sunday is uncommon for Dalal Street, as both exchanges typically remain shut on weekends and designated public holidays. February 1 will therefore be among the rare Sundays when markets are open for regular trading.Talking about investor expectations, Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited said, “Investors don’t have expectations of any major tax reliefs in this Budget since the 2025 Budget delivered huge income tax reliefs.Some tweaking of certain taxes is likely. If there is an increase in exemption for long-term capital gains tax from Rs 1.25 lakhs presently to a higher limit that would be a positive. From the market perspective, a fiscally prudent, growth-oriented Budget is desirable. There are rumours of exemption from long-term capital gains tax for certain categories of FIIs. If this happens, it can trigger a rally in the market.”Further mentioning sectors that’ll be in focus, he added, “Higher allocation for defense is a given and, therefore, defense stocks will continue to be in focus. A thrust area of the Budget can be exports, particularly manufacturing exports which the Economic Survey harps on. Therefore, export segments are likely to be on the radar of investors. Announcements relating to PSU bank mergers; disinvestment in PSUs will be keenly watched. Aside from the Budget, the crash in precious metal prices may bring investors back into equity.""A look at market trends over the past decade shows that Budgets have sparked strong rallies, but many have led to muted moves or even declines.Markets generally respond well when the Budget emphasises growth, infrastructure spending and tax stability. In 2017, for instance, then finance minister Arun Jaitley avoided major tax hikes and offered relief to the middle class. Investors welcomed the approach, with the Sensex rising about 1.7 per cent and the Nifty gaining nearly 1.8 per cent , one of the stronger Budget Day performances of that period.Another standout came in 2021, when Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Budget in the wake of the Covid-19 shock. With a clear push towards economic recovery, higher capital expenditure, healthcare and infrastructure, markets rallied sharply. The Sensex jumped over 2 per cent and the Nifty climbed almost 2.7 per cent, marking one of the best Budget Day gains in recent years.But not every Budget has cheered investors. In 2016, higher dividend taxation dampened sentiment, and the Sensex ended the day in the red. In 2018, the introduction of long-term capital gains tax on listed equities and equity mutual funds caught markets off guard. Although indices slipped only modestly on the day, they fell around 6.8 per cent over the following sessions. The 2023 Budget triggered a largely flat reaction, as it maintained fiscal discipline but lacked big-bang reforms to excite traders.The July 2024 Budget also drew a cautious response. Changes related to capital gains taxation surprised some investors. While the reaction was not severe, both the Sensex and Nifty ended slightly lower, underscoring how unexpected tax measures can weigh on sentiment even when the broader macro picture is stable.Also historically, volatility after the Budget has been common, and one-month returns have often been mixed.As the nation heads into the Union Budget 2026, market conditions are already unsettled. Equity indices have pulled back from recent highs, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers, and global factors such as interest rates, geopolitical tensions and trade policies continue to influence sentiment. In this backdrop, sharp moves on Budget Day are almost inevitable.","The nifty 50 was at 25,302. 05, down around 16 points, while sensex was up by over 18 points at 82,301.91, as at 9.35 am.

: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2026 in Parliament on February 1, 2026.The Union Budget 2026 will mark FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive Budget presentation, making her the first finance minister in India to achieve this milestone.

Nirmala Sitharaman has previously presented Budgets on Saturdays as well — on February 1, 2020, shortly before the Covid-19 lockdown, and again on February 1, 2025.Until 1999, the Union Budget was presented at 5 pm, a colonial-era practice aligned with British working hours. That convention was changed by then finance minister Yashwant Sinha, who shifted the Budget presentation to 11 am, a practice that continues to this day. Later, in 2017, former finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced another reform by advancing the Budget presentation to February 1 from the end of the month.The Budget 2026 will be delivered during the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament and will lay out the government’s fiscal roadmap for the 2026–27 financial year. The Budget speech is scheduled for February 1, 2026, with the Finance Minister expected to begin her address at 11:00 am.The Union Budget is generally presented on February 1 to allow ministries and departments adequate time to implement proposals from the start of the new financial year on April 1.Viewers can watch the Union Budget 2026 speech live through multiple official and media platforms:The full Budget documents will be made available online soon after the speech, along with explanatory statements and annexures.The Budget Session of Parliament commenced with President Droupadi Murmu addressing members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on January 28. The first phase of the session is scheduled from January 28 to February 13, while the second phase will run from March 9 to April 2, with the session comprising 30 sittings.The Union Budget is a key annual policy statement that outlines government spending, taxation proposals and fiscal strategy for the coming year, and the 2026 presentation will be closely tracked across sectors, markets and households.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman is scheduled to present the union budget 2026 in parliament on february 1, 2026.

What will the Railway Budget 2026 focus on? We take a look at possible points in FM Sitharaman’s speech:

Vande Bharat Sleeper

Amrit Bharat Trains

Kavach & Safety Focus



Railway Budget 2026: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman may announce yet another record capital expenditure allocation for Indian Railways in Union Budget 2026. In the last five years, railway budget allocations have grown exponentially, as the government focused on infrastructure as a driver of economic growth. It's one hour to the Budget speech now. FM Sitharaman will start her Budget speech at 11:00 AM. This is the first time that the Budget is being presented on a Sunday.Till 2017, the Railway Budget was presented separately. Suresh Prabhu was the last Railway Minister to present a separate railway budget in 2016. Since then railway allocations find space in the Finance Minister’s speech, but there is no separate speech or list of new trains announced.The Budget speech around railways tends to center around upcoming projects and long-term vision on passenger services, freight, and safety.At the start of this year, Indian Railways introduced the first Vande Bharat sleeper train service between Guwahati and Howrah. The new semi-high speed train set, capable of 160 kmph speeds, is aimed at overhauling overnight travel experience on the Indian Railways network.In the coming years hundreds of Vande Bharat sleeper trains will be rolled out, and FM Sitharaman’s speech may see plans for Vande Bharat sleeper trains being announced.Indian Railways says that Vande Bharat sleeper trains offer world-class comforts, with superior ride comfort compared to the existing premium trains like Rajdhani Express and Tejas Express. Cushioned berths, redesigned ladders, a host of passenger-friendly amenities, disabled-friendly features, faster travel experience and jerk-free rides are some of the top features of the Vande Bharat sleeper trains.The chair car version of the Vande Bharat trains is a popular service and as of December 2025,a total of 164 Vande Bharat train services are running across the Indian Railways network.Amrit Bharat trains are push-pull services with locomotives on both ends to enhance train speed. The trains for common man have sleeper and general coaches and there are plans to introduce them with AC coaches soon.Amrit Bharat services, which are at present fully non-AC trains, have 12 Sleeper Class Coaches and 8 General Class coaches, providing high quality services to the passengers, in many aspects similar to Vande Bharat trains. With a focus on common man services, new Amrit Bharat train plans may be announced.Indian Railways has recently commissioned 472.3 route kilometres of Kavach Version 4.0. Kavach is the indigenous Automatic Train Protection system. Kavach Version 4.0 is the most advanced version of India’s home-grown Automatic Train Protection system. It has evolved through technological improvements, drawing on field experience, operational feedback, and independent safety evaluations, according to Indian Railways. Cleared by the Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), the system marks a significant leap in railway safety capabilities.The Kavach system combines microprocessor-based architecture, GPS technology, and radio communication to maintain safe train operations. When another train is detected on the same track within a defined safety distance, it alerts the locomotive pilot and, if necessary, automatically activates braking through onboard systems.With safety in focus, the Kavach rollout may also find mention in FM Sitharaman’s Budget speech.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present the railway budget 2026 at 11:00 am.

When is Union budget speech today: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2026 at 11am in the Lok Sabha today, marking a historic moment in India’s parliamentary and economic calendar. The presentation forms part of the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament and will outline the government’s fiscal roadmap for the financial year 2026–27.Sitharaman was seen leaving Kartavya Bhavan for Rashtrapati Bhavan carrying her trademark red ‘bahi-khata’ style tablet folder bearing the national emblem. She becomes the first to present a full Union Budget on a Sunday.The Lok Sabha’s List of Business confirms that the House will assemble at 11am, when the finance minister begins her address.The 11am Budget speech is now standard practice, but this was not always the case.Until 1999, the Union Budget was presented at 5 pm, a colonial-era practice aligned with British working hours. That changed when then finance minister Yashwant Sinha shifted the presentation to the morning, making it more suited to Indian administrative and market timings.Another key reform came in 2017, when Arun Jaitley advanced the Budget date to February 1 from the end of the month. The move gave ministries more time to roll out schemes and spending from the start of the financial year on April 1.Today’s speech continues both these traditions — a February 1 presentation at 11 am — while adding a new footnote: a Sunday Budget. In 1999, when February 28 fell on a Sunday, the Budget was presented a day earlier. Sitharaman, however, proceeds on the scheduled date.During her speech, the Finance Minister will lay out the estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India for 2026–27. She will also table key documents required under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003.She will then seek leave to introduce the Finance Bill, 2026, which gives legal effect to the government’s taxation and financial proposals.Senior officials, including Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, Chief Economic Adviser Dr V Anantha Nageswaran, CBDT Chairman Ravi Agrawal and other Finance Ministry officials, were seen accompanying her.The Budget follows the tabling of the Economic Survey 2025–26, the government’s annual assessment of the economy. Prepared by the Economic Division under the Chief Economic Adviser, the survey reviews performance over the past year and frames the context for fiscal decisions.Union minister Piyush Goyal pointed to the Survey’s First Advance Estimates projecting real GDP growth of 7.4% for FY 2025–26. He said this keeps India as the fastest-growing major economy for the fourth consecutive year. He also cited inflation of 1.7% between April and December 2025, crediting lower food prices and what he described as effective inflation management.The Survey also highlighted a policy push in manufacturing, with the government framing its strategy as moving from “Swadeshi” to “Strategic Resilience” and now “Strategic Indispensability”.",Finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present the union budget 2026 at 11am in the lok sabha today.

A Chance to Build a Future-Ready Indirect Tax System

(Jayashree Parthasarathy is Tax Partner, EY India. With contributions from Ketan Lohia, Director-tax, EY India)

India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities. While GST and Customs digitalisation have undeniably transformed the landscape, companies continue to face operational bottlenecks that slow down activity, tie up working capital and drive up compliance costs. These factors directly affect the country’s ease of doing business.In this backdrop, the 56th GST Council meeting marked significant progress by tackling several long-standing pain points. Union Budget 2026 now has an opportunity to build on this momentum and deliver a tax ecosystem that is faster, more consistent and easier for businesses to navigate.A key long pending ask and expectation from the upcoming Budget is a more flexible and business-friendly input tax credit (ITC) system. Companies have long argued that credits representing taxes genuinely paid and used in business operations should be freely available or refunded.Two specific asks remain critical:Allowing smoother credit flow across GST registrations would also unlock meaningful liquidity for enterprises.The recent GST Council decision to treat intermediary services as exports (therefore removing the GST levy) is a welcome step and industry now awaits its formal implementation as a part of the budget process.Businesses are also expecting similar clarity for R&D and testing services, which currently attract 18% GST because place-of-performance rules prevent them from being classified as exports. A consistent and globally aligned export definition would boost India’s competitiveness in high-value service segments.Compliance complexity remains a major concern with an expectation that multiplicity of proceedings would be addressed. A single, centralised audit and faceless assessment system, similar to the efficient model used under the erstwhile service tax regime, would give pan India businesses one point of engagement, reduce repetitive scrutiny and minimise conflicting interpretations across States.Large taxpayers would particularly benefit from a centralized single point of contact approach by way of:A uniform, risk-based audit framework would further enhance consistency and limit unnecessary scrutiny. Equally important is a more calibrated enforcement approach; one that acts firmly against evasion but avoids punitive measures such as asset attachments or frequent detention of goods in cases involving interpretational differences or procedural lapses. A clearer differentiation between wilful violations and good-faith positions will go a long way in restoring business confidence.For India’s smallest enterprises, current GST registration thresholds (₹20 lakh for services and ₹40 lakh for goods) no longer reflect today’s cost structures. Near-decade-high inflation has pushed many micro-businesses into the GST net perhaps far earlier than intended. Raising the threshold to reflect current realities would preserve working capital and support MSME viability.On the Customs side, businesses continue to face prolonged timelines in dispute resolution, with legacy cases stretching for years and delaying investment decisions. A time-bound settlement mechanism, similar to earlier dispute-resolution schemes, would help clear the backlog and allow both industry and the department to focus on priority matters.Businesses are also seeking greater certainty through longer-validity advance rulings and simpler renewals, so long-term projects are not disrupted by tax disputes merely on account of lapse of time.Operational friction also remains a day-to-day challenge at the border. Even after goods are cleared, companies often face manual processes to pay differential duties or correct documents for host of reasons including price variation, corrections. Allowing digital payments and online amendments, and ensuring such payments qualify for GST credit, would reduce compliance effort and minimise cash-flow disruptions.Cross-border businesses are also looking for clearer, time-bound guidelines around Special Valuation Branch (SVB) proceedings. While scrutiny of related-party pricing is necessary, inconsistent practices often create uncertainty for global supply chains. Predictable timelines and uniform standards are essential if India is to position itself as a reliable global hub.Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units seeking to sell into the domestic market face a structural disadvantage, as duties are levied without fully recognising that these units often use domestic inputs. Aligning duty calculations to reflect only the imported content, and/ or extending select benefits available under free trade agreements, would improve capacity utilisation and offer SEZs a more level playing field vis-à-vis foreign suppliers.Budget 2026 offers an opportunity not just for incremental fixes but for meaningful reform that strengthens India’s indirect tax architecture. The foundation laid by GST and recent digitalisation efforts is robust. What businesses now need is a system that is simpler, more consistent and aligned with the needs of a rapidly expanding economy.If India gets this right, indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.","Indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.

The Union Budget 2026 comes at an important moment, as taxpayers prepare for a major shift—the introduction of the Income-tax Act, 2025 (ITA 2025), effective April 1, 2026. This is one of the most significant updates in decades, and many individuals are hoping that the Budget will ease the transition with clarity and stability.With the new system ahead, households are likely to be looking for measures that offer predictability and simpler compliance so families can plan taxes with confidence.In recent years, India’s personal tax framework has steadily moved towards simplification.The concessional new tax regime became the default structure, with reduced slab rates and fewer exemptions. Capital-gains rules were also made more uniform across asset classes. For households, this shift meant ease of filing with lesser documentation to be maintained, clearer choices between regimes and lower chances of inadvertent errors.These reforms appear to have encouraged wider participation: ITR filings rose from 8.13 crore in FY 2023-24 to 8.68 crore in FY 2024-25, a 6.72% increase, and around 72% of taxpayers opted for the new regime in FY 2023-24.The ITA 2025 reduces the number of sections from 819 to 536 and cuts the overall word count nearly in half—from 5.12 lakh to 2.60 lakh. While this represents meaningful structural simplification, individuals will still need help interpreting what has changed. A plain-English FAQ, along with an “old-to-new” comparison and simple illustrations for salary, rent and capital gains, could convert this statutory rewrite into practical time saved for families.Digital ease continues to be a key expectation. Filing has already become smoother with prefilled returns, enhanced dashboards and faster processing. Strengthening these systems further, especially through more comprehensive prefill of capital-gains, dividend and interest information, would help individuals adapt to the new law with fewer follow-ups and less filing-related stress.Investments in Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) seem to have grown, and more streamlining around loss set-off and cross-category VDA movements would be helpful especially for the younger investors who may dabble more in these asset classes. Likewise, retail participation in Futures and Options has risen, and many small investors face audit requirements designed for business traders. Simpler, more practical guidance in both areas would help individuals avoid misreporting and unnecessary compliance burdens.For many families, funds being blocked due to taxes being collected at source (TCS) on foreign remittances remains a routine challenge. While salaried taxpayers are now allowed to set-off the TCS against their salary withholding tax (TDS), not all taxpayers are able to avail this benefit especially where the taxpayer has only other sources of income like interest and dividend. This clubbed with backlog of tax disputes results in taxpayers having to wait for longer durations for refunds to be issued.Faster hearings, clearer procedures and more efficient disposal mechanisms would provide meaningful relief to individuals stuck in long pendency. Quicker closure of small-value appeals (on any issue), in particular, could significantly reduce household stress and unnecessary out-of-pocket costs.Households may also look for targeted relief at the lower end of the income spectrum. Under the new tax regime, the current rebate ensures that individuals with income up to Rs 12 lakh face no tax liability. For salaried taxpayers, the Rs 75,000 standard deduction effectively extends this relief to those with gross income up to Rs 12.75 lakh. A further calibrated enhancement, if considered, could help families manage inflationary pressures while keeping the system simple and aligned with the Budget’s broader focus on stability and taxpayer experience.A related development ahead of the Budget is the ICAI’s recommendation to introduce optional joint taxation for married couples, similar to systems in the US and Germany. Under the current law, each spouse files separately, which can disadvantage single-income households that cannot utilise the second spouse’s unused exemptions. Allowing couples to file a joint return could offer meaningful relief to families that pool incomes and plan finances together, particularly where income distribution between spouses is uneven.Overall, as households prepare for this major legislative transition, what they are seeking most is clarity, simplicity and stability. Straightforward rules, easy-to-understand guidance and stronger digital support can help individuals adjust to the new framework with confidence. Addressing administrative challenges, such as TDS/ TCS complexity and delays in dispute resolution, would further ease the transition.","The union budget 2026 comes at an important moment, as taxpayers prepare for a major shift.

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget for the financial year 2026–27 in the Lok Sabha at 11 am today, marking her ninth consecutive Budget.While the focus will firmly remain on the government’s revenue projections, fiscal discipline and spending priorities, Sitharaman’s Budget Day appearance also draws attention for another reason: her saree. Over the years, the finance minister has made it a point to wear handloom sarees, using the high-visibility Budget presentation to spotlight country's traditional textiles and artisan communities, in line with the government’s “Vocal for Local” push.This year, Sitharaman opted for a deep maroon Kanjeevaram saree from Tamil Nadu. The saree featured a deep maroon base with a contrasting border and subtle gold detailing, paired with a yellow blouse.Last year, Sitharaman had worn an off-white saree featuring Madhubani fish embroidery, gifted by Padma Shri awardee Dulari Devi of Bihar. Paired with a red blouse, the saree highlighted Bihar’s folk art tradition and brought national attention to a regional craft form.Across successive Budgets, Sitharaman’s saree choices have evolved into a quiet tradition, one that brings focus on Indian handlooms and regional textiles while keeping the focus firmly on the Budget itself.","Nirmala sitharaman will present the union budget for the financial year 2026–27 in the lok sabha at 11 am today.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her ninth consecutive Union Budget on February 1, marking a rare Sunday sitting and a first in independent India’s history. The Union Budget for FY27 (April 2026–March 2027) is expected to outline measures to sustain growth momentum, maintain fiscal discipline and push reforms to shield the economy from global trade frictions, including potential US tariffs.With the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament on January 29, industry and businesses laid out clear expectations from Budget 2026, particularly around artificial intelligence, infrastructure spending, telecom reforms and manufacturing support. The upcoming Budget will also continue the paperless format that has been followed for the past four years.As Sitharaman prepares to present her ninth Budget, her journey since 2019 reflects several milestones that mirror India’s evolving economic priorities and political landscape.In 2019, Nirmala Sitharaman became only the second woman in independent India’s history to present the Union Budget and the country’s first full-time woman finance minister to do so. Presenting the Modi 2.0 government’s maiden Budget in the Lok Sabha, she delivered a speech lasting two hours and 17 minutes, then the longest on record.Her address featured Urdu, Hindi and Tamil couplets and marked a symbolic shift as she replaced the traditional leather briefcase with a red cloth ‘bahi-khata’.She also announced that PAN and Aadhaar cards would be interchangeable.PM Modi congratulated her and her team, saying the Budget was “citizen friendly, development friendly, and future oriented.”In 2020, Sitharaman went on to deliver the longest Budget speech in independent India’s history. Beginning at 11 am, the speech continued for nearly two hours and 40 minutes, before she opted to cut it short when just two pages remained as she felt unwell.Continuing her tradition of poetry, she quoted Kashmiri poet Pandit Dinanath Kaul Nadim. The Budget highlighted the National Infrastructure Pipeline and introduced a fundamental restructuring of the personal income tax regime, described as the most consequential institutional reform of that year.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget 2021 in Parliament on Monday, announcing a major push for healthcare and infrastructure. The Budget, however, left income tax slabs unchanged. In her speech, the finance minister said the proposals were built on six pillars—health and well-being; physical, financial capital and infrastructure; inclusive development for aspirational India; reinvigorating human capital; innovation and R&D; and minimum government and maximum governance.During the presentation, Sitharaman wore a red and off-white silk Pochampally saree, woven in Bhoodan Pochampally, Telangana, a region widely known as the ‘silk city of India’.In 2022, Nirmala Sitharaman presented her fourth Union Budget, framing it as a long-term roadmap for the country. “This Union Budget seeks to lay the foundation and give a blueprint of the economy over Amrit Kal of next 25 years – from India at 75 to India at 100,” she said in the Lok Sabha.She emphasised that India is in a strong position to withstand future challenges and reiterated the government’s focus on boosting public investment to modernise infrastructure.The Finance Minister presented a Budget worth Rs 39.45 lakh crore, with a major push towards infrastructure spending. During the presentation, she wore a brown Bomkai saree from Odisha, featuring earthy brown and red tones, reflecting a blend of tradition and elegance.The 2023 Budget marked another historic moment. Ahead of the presentation, Sitharaman called on President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan, making it the first time a woman finance minister presented the Budget to a woman president.Presenting the fifth Budget of her tenure and the last full Budget of the Modi government’s second term, she outlined seven priorities, describing them as the ‘Saptarishi’ guiding the country through the Amrit Kaal—Inclusive Development, Reaching the Last Mile, Infrastructure and Investment, Unleashing the Potential, Green Growth, Youth Power and the Financial Sector.She wore a traditional temple-border red saree with a black border and intricate golden work.In 2024, Sitharaman delivered her shortest Budget speech yet, lasting just 56 minutes. As an Interim Budget ahead of the general elections, it avoided major policy announcements.Presenting her sixth Budget, she focused on women, the poor, youth and farmers, and said the Centre would bring a detailed roadmap for Viksit Bharat 2047 in the full Budget in July.Later that year, she created history by presenting her seventh Union Budget, surpassing former finance minister Morarji Desai’s record of six Budgets.She opted for a white silk saree with magenta border adorned with golden motifs paired with a 'bahi khata'.In 2025, Sitharaman presented the Union Budget 2025–26, underlining the government’s commitment to Garib, Yuva, Annadata and Nari. She said the Budget would drive “transformative reforms” across six sectors—taxation, urban development, mining, the financial sector, power and regulatory reforms.Built on four fundamental pillars—Garib (poor), Yuva (youth), Annadata (farmers), and Nari (women)—her speech lasted one hour and 14 minutes, the shortest full Budget speech to date. She wore a white saree with Madhubani artwork and golden borders and continued carrying the traditional ‘bahi-khata’.","Nirmala sitharaman is set to present her ninth consecutive union budget on february 1, marking a rare sunday sitting and a first in independent india’s history.

Union Budget 2026 is just hours away and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman might use Part B of her budget speech to put forward the country’s long term vision for investors.The Part A has traditionally carried core policy measures and economic announcements, while Part B has been limited largely to taxation. This year year’s speech, however, may be a clear shift, according to sources cited by ET. FM Sitharaman is expected to place more weight on Part B, going away from a format that has been followed for decades.According to sources, the section will cover both near-term economic priorities and long-term structural ambitions, providing a clearer sense of where the economy is headed. It is also expected to set out the government’s economic thinking in the context of changing global and domestic conditions.Part B will not be confined to tax proposals but will include a broader strategic outline aimed at boosting India’s standing. The narrative is expected to highlight domestic strengths, existing economic capacity and future growth prospects, alongside the policy path required to maintain progress. “The idea is to lay out a broader, long-term vision,” a government official told ET.The timing of the shift is linked to current geopolitical uncertainties, including higher tariffs imposed by the US.The government intends to use the budget speech to present a long-term policy message that offers reassurance to foreign investors.The Economic Survey, presented in Parliament earlier this week, had highlighted the need for a multi-pronged strategy to improve the investment environment by tackling both structural and cyclical issues. It also pointed to the importance of emphasising India’s stability, macroeconomic strength, sustained growth and large market size, noting that foreign direct investment inflows have yet to reach their full potential despite the government’s stated intent and track record in economic management.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman might use part b of her budget speech to put forward the country’s long term vision for investors.

The chairman's comment came in the wake of bank deposits continuing to lag credit growth as retail savings continue to pour into mutual funds.Responding to a question on his expectations, Setty said the general consensus in the financial sector is that fiscal prudence and fiscal consolidation will continue.""As a banker, there should be a level playing field for financial instruments, but there are fiscal constraints. Globally, we do not see special treatment for bank deposits. Equity instruments also do not receive special treatment in many jurisdictions,"" Setty said.The SBI chairman's views were echoed by SBI Research in a Jan 2026 report, which recommended aligning tax rates on deposit interest with capital gains to boost household savings in banks.The Indian Banks' Association has been demanding tax benefits for fixed deposits for years.Currently, FDs of up to Rs 1.5 lakh are eligible for deduction under the old tax regime, which is no longer preferred by a vast majority of taxpayers. In recent years, investors have shifted toward mutual funds.The ratio of mutual fund assets under management (AUM) to bank deposits has grown nearly three times, from 12.6% in 2015 to over 33.5% in 2025. Bank deposits grew nearly three times over the past decade, compared with more than seven times growth in mutual fund AUM.Other bankers have also raised this issue amid deposit growth lagging credit demand, with savers shifting to equities for better post-tax returns, straining bank liquidity.Last year, Uday Kotak, founder and non-executive director of Kotak Mahindra Bank, said, ""India's saver turns investor. Post-Covid, mutual fund AUM (mainly equity) has doubled to 31% of bank deposits,"" reflecting a structural shift as savers seek capital market returns.In Sept 2024, MV Rao, chairman of the Indian Banks' Association and Central Bank of India, called for govt intervention on ""the shift of money into non-banking assets such as equities and mutual funds"", warning of systemic risks if deposit outflows continue.","State bank of india chairman cs setty has sought a level playing field for tax treatment of all financial products, including fixed deposits.

Many terms are technical, and are used repeatedly across Budget documents, tables and debates.The “Budget at a Glance” table presents a consolidated snapshot of the Union Government’s finances for a financial year, showing actuals, Budget Estimates and Revised Estimates across receipts, expenditure and deficits. Each line item follows a defined accounting and constitutional framework. Below is a detailed explanation of the key terms, grouped for clarity.Estimate rekated termsBudget terms define how money is raised, spent, approved, borrowed and audited.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

The directions of the Supreme Court in the judgment are under examination,"" minister of state for labour & employment Rameswar Teli said in a written reply to Rajya Sabha.Teli was replying to a question on whether the government is aware about the Supreme Court verdict of November 4 on EPF pension scheme and by when it will implement the verdict and instruct the EPFO (Employees Provident Fund Organisation) to take actions for giving higher pension.In another written reply, Teli said the court judgement has legal, financial, actuarial and logistical implications.The scheme has provided for an extension of four months' time for eligible employees to opt for enhanced pension.The apex court order provides that employees who were existing EPS-95 members as on September 1, 2014 can contribute up to 8.33 per cent of their actual salaries, as against 8.33 per cent of the pensionable salary capped at Rs 15,000 a month, towards pension.It had also struck down the requirement in the 2014 amendments mandating employer contribution of 1.16 per cent of the salary exceeding Rs 15,000 per month.This will facilitate the subscribers to contribute higher to the scheme and get enhanced benefits accordingly.There are more than six crore subscribers of the retirement fund body. A large number of contributing members of the pension scheme would benefit from opting for contribution on wages higher than threshold of Rs 15,000 per month.The minster also said EPFO has a corpus of Rs 18,64,136 crore.

Why these documents matter

Once the finance minister finishes delivering the Union Budget speech in Parliament, the focus quickly shifts from headline announcements to the fine print. The speech sets the direction, but the real fiscal picture lies in a set of detailed Budget documents tabled alongside it, each serving a specific purpose.Here is a practical guide to what each key Budget document contains and what readers should track once the Budget is presented.Mandated under Article 112 of the Constitution, the Annual Financial Statement is the most important Budget document. It presents estimated receipts and expenditure for the coming financial year, revised estimates for the current year and actuals for the previous year.Together, the revenue and capital sections of the AFS constitute the Union Budget.Required under Article 113, the Demands for Grants detail how much money each ministry and department seeks Parliament’s approval to spend.With Demands for Grants, this document is key to tracking sector-specific priorities.Presented under Article 110, the Finance Bill gives legal effect to the tax proposals announced in the Budget.This is the document that turns Budget announcements into law.Mandated under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, these statements explain the government’s fiscal thinking beyond a single year.These documents are crucial for assessing fiscal credibility.This document consolidates scheme-wise spending that may otherwise be scattered across multiple Demands for Grants.It shows how headline allocations translate into programmes.Provides a detailed break-up of the government’s revenue sources and capital receipts.It also explains tax arrears and the revenue impact of tax incentives.An aggregated view of government spending after adjusting for recoveries and inter-departmental transfers.A concise snapshot of the Budget.This is the quickest way to grasp the overall fiscal stance.An explanatory note that decodes tax proposals in the Finance Bill.A performance framework linking spending to measurable outcomes for major schemes.The Union Budget is more than a statement of receipts and expenditure. While the speech sets the narrative, these documents reveal the strategy, constraints and trade-offs shaping government policy. For anyone tracking public finance, markets or governance, the real Budget story begins after the speech — inside these papers.",The annual financial statement (afs) is the most important budget document. Demands for grants : ministry-wise spending plans. Expenditure budget: spending on central sector and centrally sponsored schemes. Finance bill: memorandum explaining the finance bill.

With less than a few hours to go, the countdown to the Union Budget 2026–27 has entered its final stretch. As anticipation builds across households, industry and financial markets, the country is gearing up for a financial statement that will mark several firsts in India’s budgetary history.To be presented on a ""rare Sunday,"" the Budget adds a historic twist to a tradition stretching back decades. The unusual timing has only heightened the sense of expectation as finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to step into the Lok Sabha for a milestone moment.The 2026 Budget will be Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive Union Budget, making her the first finance minister in India to achieve this feat.Expectations from the speech are high, with a strong focus on tax reforms, customs duty rationalisation, and measures to sustain growth at a time of rising geopolitical risks and global trade uncertainty.Beyond immediate policy announcements, the Sunday Budget is also seen as a potential turning point in fiscal strategy. The government is expected to outline a clear roadmap for lowering India’s debt-to-GDP ratio, signalling a shift from short-term deficit management to a more durable, long-term approach to fiscal consolidation.After major relief in Budget 2025, including the income tax exemption limit being raised to Rs 12 lakh and GST rationalisation, individual taxpayers are hoping for further easing, especially through a higher standard deduction.With the new Income Tax Act, 2025, coming into force from April 1, industry bodies are seeking clarity on transition provisions, rules and FAQs to ensure smoother implementation, PTI reported.There is also an expectation that the government may offer additional incentives to encourage taxpayers to shift to the new tax regime, which offers lower rates but fewer exemptions. Rationalisation of TDS categories into fewer slabs is another key demand.Under the current new income tax regime, income up to Rs 4 lakh is exempt from tax, making Rs 4 lakh the basic exemption limit. There is a growing demand from taxpayers to raise this threshold further to ease the compliance burden. Income between Rs 4 lakh and Rs 8 lakh is taxed at 5%, while income in the Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh bracket attracts a 10% tax rate.Earnings from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 16 lakh are taxed at 15%, which rises to 20% for income between Rs 16 lakh and Rs 20 lakh. Those earning between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 24 lakh face a 25% tax rate, while any income above Rs 24 lakh is taxed at the highest slab rate of 30%.Salaried taxpayers have been urging Nirmala Sitharaman to raise the income threshold for the 30% tax bracket to Rs 30 lakh.Currently, income up to Rs 12 lakh is effectively tax-free after availing the rebate under Section 87A, a limit that extends to Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers after factoring in the standard deduction.Tax experts believe this rebate threshold could be increased to Rs 15 lakh to provide greater relief to the middle class. Meanwhile, a significant number of taxpayers continue to opt for the old tax regime, calling for lower tax rates and a higher basic exemption limit under that system as well.Section 80C remains one of the most widely used tax-saving provisions under the old tax regime, allowing deductions of up to Rs 1.5 lakh on investments in instruments such as provident fund, public provident fund, mutual funds and insurance products. However, the limit has remained unchanged for several years. Tax experts argue that to encourage household savings, the government should consider raising the Section 80C limit and extending this deduction to the new tax regime as well, which could help boost its wider adoption.Customs duty reform is expected to be a major Budget theme, with a possible overhaul similar to GST rationalisation. This could include:Such measures are seen as critical for improving ease of doing business and trade competitiveness.For households, Budget decisions have an immediate impact through changes in income tax, subsidies and welfare spending. The relief announced in Budget 2025 boosted disposable income for middle-class families, supporting consumption at a time of financial stress.Higher disposable income typically lifts demand for retail, automobiles, housing and FMCG, while policy support for housing strengthens construction and allied industries — highlighting how tax decisions ripple through the wider economy.For investors, the February 1 Budget will signal the government’s stance on growth, fiscal discipline and corporate earnings. In FY26, despite tax relief, the government maintained fiscal discipline with a fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP, down from 4.8% earlier.Market volatility during the special Budget trading session underlined how sensitively investors react to fiscal cues, with benchmark indices swinging sharply before ending nearly flat.Economists expect the Budget to spell out steps to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio from FY27, alongside higher defence spending amid rising global tensions.A pre-Budget note by Union Bank of India (UBI) expects fiscal consolidation to continue, projecting a FY27 fiscal deficit of 4.2–4.4% of GDP.“We see fiscal consolidation to continue in FY27, albeit at slower pace, to 4.2% of GDP, in order to preserve policy space in an uncertain world & ahead of Pay Commission implementation in FY28,” UBI said.The report also highlights a shift toward debt-to-GDP targeting, with the Centre aiming to reduce debt to around 50±1% of GDP by FY31.Agriculture and MSMEs — identified by Sitharaman in Budget 2025 as the first and second growth engines — are expected to remain central.Other expectations include:Defence allocation will be closely watched as the capex push continues under Make in India and in the backdrop of Operation Sindoor.FY26 saw emergency defence procurement of Rs 40,000 crore and approvals worth Rs 3.3 trillion, nearly double the budgeted defence capital outlay.FICCI has recommended raising defence capital outlay to 30% of the defence budget, increasing DRDO funding by Rs 10,000 crore, and expanding Defence Industrial Corridors to boost exports, which have grown at a 46% CAGR between FY17 and FY24.Technology firms expect Budget 2026–27 to accelerate AI adoption, digital infrastructure and innovation. The Economic Survey described AI as an economic strategy, advocating a bottom-up, sector-specific approach.Former Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani said the Survey “brilliantly captures India’s AI momentum”.“India's way forward is exciting, which is to leverage our engineering strength to create affordable, human-centric AI that solves local challenges first, then scales globally,” he told PTI.Logistics firm FarEye called for policy support for autonomous logistics and applied AI, while GlobalLogic said the Budget offers a chance to move from digital-first to intelligence-first infrastructure.Despite pressure on revenues from tax cuts and the end of the GST compensation cess, capital expenditure is expected to remain the Budget’s anchor. UBI projects FY27 capex at Rs 12.4 lakh crore, or 3.2% of GDP, with roads, railways and defence as key focus areas.At the same time, Sitharaman faces the challenge of restoring investor confidence, navigating US trade tensions, volatile commodities and a fragile global recovery — all while finding new growth drivers for the economy.Export-oriented sectors impacted by US tariffs including textiles, apparel, seafood, gems and jewellery, leather and footwear are seeking targeted relief and policy support in Budget 2026.The budgeted fiscal deficit for FY26 (April 2025–March 2026) is estimated at 4.4% of GDP. Having achieved its fiscal consolidation target of keeping the deficit below 4.5%, markets will look for clarity on the debt-to-GDP reduction path and whether the government signals a fiscal deficit target of around 4% for FY27.Capital expenditure for FY26 has been budgeted at Rs 11.2 lakh crore. The government is expected to continue its focus on capex, with a likely increase of 10–15% in the next Budget, taking the outlay beyond Rs 12 lakh crore, as private investment remains cautious.In the 2024–25 Budget, the finance minister said fiscal policy from 2026–27 onwards would aim to put central government debt on a declining path as a share of GDP. Markets will watch for a clearer debt consolidation roadmap, especially the timeline for bringing general government debt-to-GDP down to the 60% target. The ratio stood at about 85% in 2024.The government’s gross market borrowing for FY26 is pegged at Rs 14.80 lakh crore. This figure will be closely tracked as it reflects the country’s fiscal health and the strength of revenue collections.Gross tax revenue for FY26 is estimated at Rs 42.70 lakh crore, up 11% over FY25. This includes Rs 25.20 lakh crore from direct taxes and Rs 17.5 lakh crore from indirect taxes, including GST, customs and excise duties.GST revenue in FY26 is projected to rise 11% to Rs 11.78 lakh crore. FY27 projections will be keenly watched, especially as GST revenue growth is expected to pick up following rate rationalisation measures introduced from September 2025.Nominal GDP growth for FY26 was initially estimated at 10.1%, but has been revised down to 8% due to lower-than-expected inflation. Projections for FY27 nominal GDP growth will offer cues on the inflation outlook, with estimates ranging between 10.5% and 11%.","The countdown to the union budget 2026–27 has entered its final stretch.

Understanding STT



The return of capital gains tax



The impact on investors



(Views expressed are personal.)

(Akshita Haria, Senior Tax Professional, EY India. Views expressed are personal.)

The Indian stock market, with easy investment plans like Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in mutual funds, has become a popular investment avenue for citizens, from seasoned investors to millennials. However, this journey is hindered by a double taxation structure comprising the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) and capital gains tax.STT is a tax imposed by the Indian government on the value of securities—such as stocks, mutual funds, and derivatives—traded on recognized stock exchanges. This tax is applied to the total value of securities bought and sold, regardless of whether the transaction results in a profit or a loss. As a result, investors must pay STT even when they do not gain from their investments.STT was introduced in 2004 by then-Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, who also eliminated the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on securities traded on recognized exchanges. The rationale behind this move was to simplify the tax structure: the government would receive a steady, tax revenue, while investors would benefit from zero tax on long-term gains.For 14 years, this system functioned smoothly. However, as the stock market began to yield significant returns, the government reintroduced the LTCG tax on April 1, 2018. Under this new regime, any long-term capital gains exceeding INR1 lakh in a financial year are taxed at 10%. This tax is calculated based on the cost of securities as of January 31, 2018, for those purchased before that date, without any adjustments for inflation.While LTCG was reinstated, STT remained in place. Consequently, investors now face both STT on their transactions and a 10% tax on LTCG exceeding ₹1 lakh. What was initially intended as a replacement tax now exists alongside the very tax it was meant to supplant. Moreover, the LTCG tax rate was increased to 12.5% starting July 23, 2024, while the exemption limit for capital gains was only marginally raised to INR1.25 lakh.Additionally, the short-term capital gains (STCG) tax, which applies to profits from securities held for less than a year, has also seen increases over time—from 10% to 15% in 2008, and then to 20% in 2024.This means that for any transaction, an investor must first pay STT and then, depending on how long they held the securities, either 20% STCG or 12.5% LTCG on gains that exceed the exemption threshold. Notably, salaried individuals earning less than ₹12 lakh annually do not qualify for a rebate on LTCG, even if their total income, including LTCG, falls below this threshold. This forces them to pay tax on LTCG exceeding INR1.25 lakh, despite their overall income being modest.Eliminating the LTCG tax would significantly aid long-term investors, especially as savings have dwindled due to higher living costs. If complete removal of the tax is not feasible, a reduction in the LTCG rate from 12.5% to around 5% would be beneficial. Similarly, lowering the STCG tax from 20% back to its previous level of 10% could encourage more investment.For India to maintain a vibrant stock market and encourage retail participation, decisive action is needed from policymakers to restore balance.In conclusion, as we look forward to the Budget 2026, the hope is that it will address the double taxation issue that burdens investors. By reconsidering the current tax structure, the government can foster a more conducive environment for investment, ultimately benefiting the economy and the financial well-being of its citizens.","The indian stock market has become a popular investment avenue for citizens.

How will a person who has an income Rs 12 lakh benefit from new rates?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said.

With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden.Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.",Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: faqs answered. Finance minister nirmala sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime.
