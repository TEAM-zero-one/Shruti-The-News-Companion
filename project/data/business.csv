India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural economies. One powerful yet underutilised lever in this journey is household gold. In recent years, the value of household gold has more than doubled, significantly increasing family wealth across India. According to a 2025 Morgan Stanley estimate, Indian households hold nearly 34,600 tonnes of gold jewellery, valued at around $3.8 trillion—almost 89 percent of the country’s GDP. Much of this gold has been accumulated over generations or acquired to mark important life milestones.While gold carries immense emotional and cultural significance, in its idle form it contributes little to economic activity. It is therefore imperative that India deploys effective policies to enable household gold to be used productively—without forcing families to relinquish ownership.Gold loans offer precisely this solution. They allow households to unlock the economic value of gold while retaining emotional ownership, making gold a working asset that supports livelihoods, enterprise, and growth.Over the past few years, regulators have taken meaningful steps to introduce balanced regulations that protect customers while supporting sectoral development.These measures, coming into effect from April 1, 2026, create a stronger foundation. However, to unlock the full potential of gold loans for inclusive growth, further reforms are needed.Credit penetration in rural India remains low, particularly among shopkeepers and MSMEs—estimated at nearly six million nationwide. Many continue to lack access to formal finance, even as they need working capital to upgrade infrastructure, manage inventory, and expand offerings.Gold loans are ideally suited to meet these short-term needs. Interest is charged only for the period the loan is utilised, allowing borrowers to repay when cash flows improve and re-borrow as required. This flexible credit cycle supports business growth, encourages financial discipline, and mobilises household savings in a way that benefits both borrowers and the broader economy.Strengthening Last-Mile Credit Through NBFC Branch ExpansionA key reason for low credit penetration in Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural areas is limited physical branch presence. Over time, NBFCs have demonstrated a superior ability to reach underserved regions, tailor products to local needs, and operate efficiently through well-established models.For gold loans in particular, physical branches are essential and cannot be fully replaced by digital channels, unlike unsecured personal loans. Encouraging NBFCs to expand branch networks would significantly improve access and deepen market penetration.Currently, regulatory restrictions and prescriptive guidelines on branch expansion can slow network growth. Liberalising these norms—especially for collateral-backed products like gold loans—would accelerate outreach while maintaining prudential safeguards.NBFCs play a critical role in last-mile credit delivery, particularly for small-ticket and entry-level loans in rural areas. However, all NBFC loans currently carry a uniform 100 percent risk weight, which raises the cost of lending and limits credit supply.Gold loans are regulated by loan-to-value (LTV) norms, similar to home loans, where risk weights vary based on LTV. Extending a similar risk-based framework to gold loans could unlock significant capital, enabling NBFCs to expand credit availability to deserving borrowers.A coordinated approach between the Government and regulators can help create a supportive policy framework that recognises the broader economic and nation-building potential of expanding gold loan credit.Recent stress in unsecured lending segments, including microfinance, has adversely affected credit scores for millions of households. Many of these borrowers experienced temporary or one-time defaults and are now excluded from formal credit.Targeted schemes are needed to help such borrowers re-enter the formal financial system. Ensuring that temporary distress does not lead to permanent exclusion will allow households to regain access to credit and participate productively in the economy.Housing is a powerful economic driver in rural India, with strong linkages to nearly 50 sectors. While banks offer rural housing loans, their reach in smaller ticket sizes—below ₹10–15 lakh—is limited. NBFCs, with their extensive branch networks, are better positioned to serve this segment.However, SARFAESI Act provisions restrict NBFCs’ ability to recover smaller-ticket secured loans, as enforcement is allowed only for outstanding amounts of ₹20 lakh and above. Harmonising SARFAESI applicability for NBFCs in line with banks and housing finance companies would significantly improve credit flow and accelerate rural housing growth.An estimated 60 percent of gold lending remains unregulated. Formal gold loans, by contrast, operate under clear regulatory guidelines and supervision. Allowing greater flexibility in NBFC branch expansion would accelerate formalisation and extend regulated credit to underserved markets.With a strong regulatory framework already in place, wider branch access can help bring millions of borrowers into the formal financial system.The upcoming Budget presents a timely opportunity to build on existing reforms. With continued policy support and regulatory alignment, gold loans can unlock household wealth, deepen rural credit access, and drive inclusive growth across Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural India.","India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to tier-2, tier-3, and rural economies.

The sector is seeking relief from the current duty structure that favours importers as compared to local refiners, through free trade agreements.MMTC-PAMP managing director and CEO Samit Guha the duty gap has majorly affected the competitiveness of domestic refiners, even as the government is aware of the problem.Highlighting expectations from the government, Guha said that the whole ""precious metal refining sector has seen this disparity, which is there in duty, especially through the SEPA route between what we get as Dore versus what refined bullion is imported at.""He added that bullion has been kept out of free trade agreements signed after SEPA, and the industry hopes that upcoming trade deals will also exclude gold and silver from concessional duty regimes.He said targeted policy support is needed to help India enhance its refining capabilities and increase the number of London Bullion Market Association-accredited refineries. This, he suggested, could be done by offering input-linked incentives through duty differentials, either under trade agreements or by expanding the existing gap.""We would request the government to see what they can do in terms of either input-related benefits, in terms of duty differentials...which will really encourage local refiners to invest in the refinery and get ROIs and up their refining capacity and capability to a global level,"" Guha said.At present, dore imports attract a duty of 6% for both gold and silver.

What to know about the multiple train crashes in Spain this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/what-to-know-about-the-multiple-train-crashes-in-spain-this-week/articleshow/127161659.cms,"Spain train crash

Deadly High-Speed Train Collision in Southern Spain Kills Dozens, Rescue Operations Ongoing

Here's what to know





MADRID: Multiple train crashes this week have rocked Spain and the tragedies have led to questions about safety on the country's railway system.The first crash involved a high-speed train in southern Spain that derailed on Sunday evening, colliding with another fast train, killing at least 43 people and injuring more than 150.The crash was the deadliest in Spain since a 2013 crash that killed 80 people when a commuter train in the northern region of Galicia hurtled off the rails as it came around a bend going too fast.On Tuesday night, another train crash happened in northeastern Spain on a commuter line near Barcelona. One person was killed.Then, on Thursday, a commuter train crashed in southeastern Spain, lightly injuring 6 passengers.Derailment and collision The Sunday derailment happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails and slammed into an oncoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva with around 200 people, according to rail operator Adif.The head of the second train took the brunt of the impact, Transport Minister Oscar Puente said. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track and sent them plummeting down a four-meter (13-foot) slope.The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) south of Madrid.""The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of meters away,"" Andalusia's regional President Juan Manuel Moreno said.Authorities said they had identified almost all the victims from Sunday's crash.Cause under investigation Explanations about what caused the crash were scant, with an official investigation underway.Alvaro Fernandez, the president of national railway company Renfe, told Spanish public radio RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 250 kph (155 mph) and ""human error could be ruled out.""Transport Minister Puente called the crash ""truly strange"" since it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. But Puente said late Monday that officials had found a broken section of track.""Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence (of the derailment),"" Puente told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser.The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, belonged to Renfe.Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and passed its latest safety check on Jan. 15.The Spanish Union of Railway Drivers sent a letter last August asking Spain's rail operator to investigate flaws on high-speed train lines across the country caused by increased traffic.It warned of potholes, bumps and imbalances in overhead power lines, as well as frequent breakdowns and damage to trains, according to a copy of the letter seen by The Associated Press.The union called for a general strike in the coming weeks to demand more safety assurances.High-speed expansion Spain has spent decades investing heavily in high-speed trains. It currently has the largest rail network in Europe for trains traveling more than 250 kph (155 mph), with more than 3,900 kilometers (2,400 miles) of track, according to the International Union of Railways.The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Officials said that Sunday's collision was the first with deaths on Spain's high-speed rail network since it opened its first line in 1992.Commuter line crashes A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing one person and injuring at least 37 others.A commuter train crashed on Thursday in the southeastern Murcia region after it collided with a crane. Emergency services said six people with minor injuries had been transferred to the hospital.While Spain's high-speed rail network generally runs smoothly, commuter rails are plagued by reliability issues. However, crashes causing injury or death are not common.","Multiple train crashes in spain this week have led to questions about safety.

"Budget 2026: Jewellery sector seeks duty rationalisation, reforms and GST cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-jewellery-sector-seeks-duty-rationalisation-reforms-and-gst-cuts/articleshow/127444748.cms,"For the Union Budget 2026-2027, India’s gems and jewellery industry is urging the government for a mix of GST cuts, customs reforms and policy changes to counter global trade headwinds and improve export competitiveness.In its pre-Budget memorandum submitted to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) highlighted measures aimed at lowering costs for exporters and strengthening India’s role in the global diamond trade and value discovery ecosystem.“The global gem and jewellery trade is undergoing a major transformation. With high US tariffs, evolving consumer preferences, and shifting global supply chains, it is imperative that India maintains its competitive edge,” GJEPC chairman Kirit Bhansali said.According to Bhansali, the proposals focus on enhancing cost efficiency, reinforcing Special Economic Zone (SEZ) operations and improving policy frameworks that support investment and skill development. He said that with supportive reforms and a stable trade environment, India could both withstand current global pressures and drive the next phase of growth in the international jewellery market.The Council flagged concerns over the existing 4% Safe Harbour tax, stating that it remains too high and discourages international trade.The agency also called for rationalisation of import duties on cut and polished diamonds as well as coloured gemstones to help Indian exporters remain competitive globally.In addition, the GJEPC has sought amendments to the Customs Act, 1962, to bring customs procedures in line with the needs of a fast-evolving, export-oriented gems and jewellery sector. Its recommendations include risk-based customs clearance, AI-enabled digital appraisals and self-certification for trusted exporters to improve efficiency, transparency and turnaround time.Separately, the All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC) has made its own representation to the government, focusing on GST rationalisation, hallmarking, direct tax reforms and sector-wide improvements.“GST on gold and silver jewellery should be rationalised to 1.25 per cent from 3 per cent, which will help restore proportionality, reduce financial stress on households, and enable a wider base of taxed transactions,” GJC chairman Rajesh Rokde said.The GJC has also proposed exempting capital gains tax on exchanges of hallmarked jewellery, provided the proceeds from the sale are immediately reinvested in new jewellery purchases, thereby ensuring continuity of asset holding.Another key demand relates to the Tourist GST Refund scheme. The Council has urged the government to operationalise the scheme at the earliest by notifying the required rules and setting up digital claim and verification systems at major international gateways. It suggested starting with a phased pilot at Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru airports, citing higher levels of jewellery sales and foreign tourist arrivals.“Foreign tourists, particularly from the Middle East, Europe and the United States, face a tax-inclusive price disadvantage while purchasing jewellery in India as compared to regional competitors like the UAE and Singapore, where such refunds are efficiently processed through automated airport systems,"" Rokde said. The expert further highlighted that this results in a lost opportunity for India ""wherein foreign buyers either defer purchases or procure jewellery abroad, converting India's competitive craftsmanship into exported retail demand losses. ”","India’s gems and jewellery industry is urging the government for a mix of gst cuts, customs reforms and policy changes to counter global trade headwinds.

Investors’ expectations from Union Budget 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/investors-expectations-from-union-budget-2026/articleshow/127404991.cms,"By Devendra Agrawal

For Investors:

For angel investors:

Bring sale of AIF units at par with sale of shares.

Government as venture debt provider.

Invest wisely in deep tech:

For taxation:

a) Introduce taxation at household level.

b) Widen India’s tax net.

(Devendra Agrawal, Founder, Dexter Capital Advisors, a boutique investment bank)

The recent Supreme Court judgement that has gone against Tiger Global may dampen the confidence of any global investor because anything that’s agreed in the past is open for interpretation. And while that may lead to short-term benefit of recovering the taxes from one investor, in the long run it might have a negative impact on the larger investor community. They may feel the country may not be trusted with the laws laid by the previous governments. The budget should provide clarity or simplify the laws, especially for global investors.Ideally, the government should unleash private capital for startups. The recent SEBI regulations for angel investing have increased the accreditation. Earlier, any individual/HUFs/Family Trusts/Sole proprietorships with net worth greater than Rs 2 crore (excluding the value of their primary residence) could be angel investors. Now, the net worth has to be equal or greater than Rs 7.5 cr, out of which at least Rs 3.75 cr is in the form of financial assets (excluding the value of their primary residence).If someone keeps PPP (purchasing power parity) in mind, it is ridiculously high and removes a number of people from the purview of investing.The government should definitely make a uniform policy for accredited investors but with fewer norms. And before angel investors, I think, the government should look at F&Os as they are even riskier and more speculative. Angel investing drives capital formation.When any investor invests in any Alternate Investment Fund (AIF), the investor gets units of AIF. Now, often these investments are illiquid and AIF units can't be easily transferred. If an investor gets a willing buyer to transfer the AIF unit, another challenge is that AIF units are valued on Fair Market Value (FMV).In comparison, when underlined securities like shares in a company are sold, the transaction does not need to be at FMV, as long as they are sold above book value.So, there's a disparity between sale of IAF units vs sale of shares of underlying companies held by these AIFs.Doing away this disparity can bring selling of AIF units at par with selling shares and would increase liquidity in a situation where an investor in AIF wants to sell AIF units.This would definitely bring more liquidity, increase participation of investors in alternate investment funds.This is completely as per the tax laws of the country. It's just that the finance ministry has not taken this into consideration in record.The government recently approved Rs 5,000 crore in equity support for the SIDBI to help expand credit flow to the MSME sector. The government invests in startups at a 6% rate with secured assets. To help more startups raise capital from the government and for the government to benefit from it, the government may consider investing at an increased rate – 8% – but without a secured asset as long as the startup is certified and thoroughly evaluated.This could help in bringing down India’s very high venture debt, at 13-18%. The government could provide, say, a tech-driven company which has built a prototype, an 8% yield and can have a warrant structure. So that such a portfolio asset has mortality. Those warrants will yield a much higher rate of return even if a small percentage, like less than 10% of these companies, become wildly successful. So, the government could become a de facto venture debt provider or a collateral-free loan provider.The government recently built a Rs 1 lakh crore fund for deep tech without having a very clear definition of deep tech. This amount is slightly on the higher side in terms of deep tech. The government could probably allocate a certain portion of this fund towards deep tech and the remaining fund could be allocated towards other avenues as well.We should applaud the Finance Minister and the government for two big releases. First, for rationalizing taxes to INR 12 lakh for the common man. Second, the GST reform. However, there are two recommendations that I would like to make:India follows an individual-focused income tax system, where each person’s annual income is evaluated and then taxed.Introducing taxation at household level will give assesses the scope for rationalizing/reducing their tax burden. Assesses should have the option of filing their returns as a household or as an individual.If the cumulative income of a household is lesser than a particular threshold, then taxation should be lesser. For example, if a household consisting of a married couple--where both husband and wife are earning—has a cumulative income of Rs 30 lakh then the tax rate could be 20% and not the current 30%.The idea behind household-level taxation is that the family’s ability to pay depends on the shared expenses, not just individual income. This concept could definitely be explored and introduced.Less than 4% of the population pays income tax in India. This increases the tax burden on the salaried class, middle class. In comparison, ~60% of households in the US pay federal income tax and ~10-14% of the Chinese working population pays income tax. The government and other stakeholders should find a way to bring more working people under the tax bracket to reduce the overall tax burden on the salaried class. I feel one way to do this could be to incentivize high tax payers by publicly recognizing and rewarding them.","The recent supreme court judgement that has gone against tiger global may dampen the confidence of any global investor because anything that’s agreed in the past is open for interpretation.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

What can we hope for in 2026?

Each year, the Union Budget draws the nation’s attention as it defines the country’s economic direction for the new financial year. As Finance Minister wields the fiscal scalpel, focussed on tax rates, rebalancing expenditure, and setting priorities, every Indian household, business and policymaker watches keenly to understand what they will gain or lose.Past budgets have marked significant personal income tax relief, which included raising the exemption limit to incentivise consumption. Capital expenditure has consistently risen, marking the importance of infrastructure and connectivity as engines of growth.Looking at Budget 2026, to be presented on February 1, expectations would be that it would be yet another opportunity to deepen reforms by pushing manufacturing competitiveness, improving human capital, modernising tax and trade regimes, and reinforcing investment in emerging technologies that will lay out a roadmap for resilient, inclusive, and innovation-led growth.Here is a quick rundown of the key changes that have been seen in the past 5 years and what is the scope for FY 2026-27.Over the last five budgets, FY 2021-22 through FY 2025-26, India’s tax landscape has been shaped by progressive personal tax restructuring, targeted corporate tax continuity, and evolving indirect tax policy. In the earlier part of this period, the new income tax regime introduced in the 2020 Union Budget continued to evolve.While Budgets 2021 and 2022 left core slabs largely unchanged, Budget 2023 made the new tax regime the default choice on the income-tax e-filing portal and enhanced its structure with fewer slabs, a higher basic exemption and a standard deduction to benefit individual taxpayers.Budget 2024 further sweetened relief for salaried employees with the standard deduction for salaried individuals under the new regime raised to Rs 75,000/- from Rs 50,000.Next year, Budget 2025 saw one of the most significant tax reforms to date. Personal income tax up to Rs 12 lakh was made fully exempt under the new regime (meaning Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers after standard deduction), with restructured slabs above that threshold, substantially lowering the direct tax burden for the middle class.As for indirect taxes, GST (Goods and Services Tax), first introduced in 2017, also had some changes. The most significant reform came last year, when the GST rate structure was simplified from multiple slabs to a two-tier system of 5 per cent and 18 per cent, along with a 40 per cent levy on select luxury or “sin” goods. Although not part of the Budget presentation, it was a move aimed at reducing complexity and easing the tax burden for both consumers and businesses and will surely be a factor setting the tone for the upcoming Budget.Looking toward Budget 2026, expectations remain on refinements to the tax regime and compliance ease, such as fewer income tax slabs under the new regime and further indirect tax rationalisation, rather than broad rate reductions, as fiscal space is balanced against growth priorities.Speaking on the tax reforms and scope in the upcoming budget, Sanjiv Malhotra, Senior Advisor - Head of Tax Practice at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, talked to TOI and put light on the reality of the GST reforms and what he believes the government needs to do now. “Post pandemic India has experienced robust tax collections (both for direct and indirect taxes) and with a bullish GDP growth expectation for FY 2026, Government should have been able to make ample fiscal space without compromising too much on the fiscal deficit targets. FY 2025-26, however, is witnessing weaker tax collections both on income tax and GST,” he said.Further talking about the hit to government revenue, Malhotra added, “GST rationalisation in 2025 has hit the Government’s wallet hard and the same does not seem to have been off-set by stronger direct tax collections. Thus, the fiscal space seems to be limited. However, creative reallocation of funds can always create room for additional spendings in identified priority sectors.”Meanwhile, Sumit Singhania, Partner, Deloitte India also talked to TOI about real impact on tax collections but had an optimistic outlook. “The fiscal deficit target for FY26 was pegged at 4.4 percent in Budget 2025. Going by quarterly macro data, this target looks within the reach. Direct tax collections for the current fiscal is showing strong momentum 8%y-o-y growth YTD) even as GST collections growth may be subdued owing to a recent set of structural reforms. That said, overall tax and non-tax revenues growth is indeed encouraging and will help the government’s fiscal consolidation target on track. It’s quite likely that the fiscal deficit target for FY27 could be between 4.1 and 4.3 percent,” he said.He further talked about the scope for changes that he believes exist.Over the past five Union Budgets, infrastructure-led capital expenditure has moved from a counter-cyclical recovery tool to a significant piece in India’s growth strategy. Central capex allocation rose sharply from about Rs 5.54 lakh crore in FY 2021-22 to Rs 7.5 lakh crore in FY 2022-23, before crossing the Rs 10 lakh crore mark in FY 2023-24, a jump of nearly 37 per cent year-on-year. The interim FY 2024-25 Budget sustained this trajectory at around Rs 11.1 lakh crore, and FY 2025-26 pushed it further to roughly Rs 11.2 lakh crore, equivalent to just over 3 per cent of GDP. A large share of this outlay has consistently flowed into transport infrastructure, particularly roads and railways.Railways, in particular, show the long-term impact of sustained capex. With annual capital support rising to about Rs 2.6 lakh crore in recent budgets, a decade-long investment cycle has delivered visible system upgrades, including the rollout of more than 160 Vande Bharat trains and new Amrit Bharat services, rapid electrification of over 99 per cent of the broad-gauge network, and the phased deployment of the Kavach automatic train protection system to improve safety. Capacity augmentation, track renewal and station redevelopment have progressed alongside fleet expansion, with thousands of new coaches planned over FY 2025-26 and FY 2026-27.Another key part of capex and infrastructure growth is roads and highways. Since FY 2021-22, allocation for roads and highways has grown sharply. In that year, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways’ total expenditure was modest compared with later levels, but by FY 2022-23, capital support had jumped significantly, largely driven by a steep increase in capital expenditure for national highways.In FY 2023-24, the ministry’s budget allocation was around Rs 2.7 lakh crore, up by roughly 36 per cent from the previous year, with the National Highways Authority of India receiving around Rs 1.62 lakh crore for expanding and upgrading the network. The interim FY 2024-25 budget maintained this, allocating approximately Rs 2.78 lakh crore to the sector, while FY 2025-26 continued at similar levels around Rs 2.87 lakh crore, even as commitments shifted toward new project awards and expressway development. These sustained allocations have supported expansion of the national highway network, increased daily construction targets and major corridor projects.The key policy question ahead of Budget 2026 is fiscal sustainability. Although capital expenditure has remained high even as the fiscal deficit is steered lower, sustaining double-digit growth in outlays could prove difficult if tax revenues soften. The emphasis may therefore shift from rapid expansion to better asset utilisation, safety improvements and timely completion of ongoing projects, ensuring earlier investments translate into productivity gains without overstretching public finances.In this context, Budget 2026 could prioritise faster execution over simply higher allocations. The government may also present a clearer roadmap for asset monetisation to mobilise resources without widening the deficit. Industry groups such as the Confederation of Indian Industry have proposed a National Infrastructure Guarantee Corporation to enhance investor confidence, reduce financing costs and unlock stalled infrastructure projects.Talking about possible changes to Railways and infrastructure and what other sectors could have increased allocation, Anurag Gupta, Partner, Deloitte India told TOI, “While the growing trend in budgetary support is expected to continue in Budget 2026, greater reliance on PPPs would be critical to meet the ambitious investments goals laid out over next 10 years by IR. Apart from Railways, we expect growth across social infra sectors like water and sanitation. Lastly, capacity creation must also be complemented with seamless infrastructure service delivery and quality of infrastructure.”In the past few years, defence budget allocations have risen steadily, even as broader fiscal pressures have shaped allocations.In FY 2021-22, the defence budget hike was modest amid pandemic pressures, but it grew in FY 2022-23 to around Rs 5.25 lakh crore as the government prioritised operational readiness and modernisation.Meanwhile the allocations for FY 2023-24 was increased to around Rs 5.94 lakh crore, showing continued growth in investments in equipment as well as force development. The FY 2024-25 budget further raised the defence allocation to nearly Rs 6.22 lakh crore, making defence the second-largest ministry allocation and boosting capital outlay for modernisation and domestic procurement under the self-reliance agenda. In the FY 2025-26, the defence budget stood at a high of 6.81 lakh crore rupees, which signified a rise of nearly 9.5 percent compared to the budget figure of the previous year, with nearly 1.80 lakh crore rupees earmarked for buying newer defence equipment like aircraft, ships, etc.Throughout this period, revenue expenditure on salaries, maintenance and pensions has continued to account for a large share of the total, even as capital allocations emphasise modernisation and indigenous procurement under initiatives such as Make in India. The rising budget and sustained support for domestic defence production have coincided with record increases in defence production and exports, showing a shift toward self-reliance in military hardware.For Budget 2026, defence spending is expected to prioritise military preparedness and modernisation, in the backdrop of Operation Sindoor in May 2025. According to FICCI’s pre-Budget recommendations, India’s heightened external security environment and advances by adversaries in AI-enabled warfare, hypersonic systems, UAV swarms, and multi-domain operations make a strong, modern, and well-resourced defence architecture a strategic imperative. The industry body suggests increasing capital outlay to 30 per cent of the defence budget from 26 per cent, boosting frontline assets, UAVs, electronic warfare systems, and border air-defence capabilities, while also raising the DRDO allocation by Rs 10,000 crore to support frontier technologies, private sector collaboration, and deep-tech innovation.FICCI also mentioned indigenisation under Atmanirbhar Bharat, recommending expansion of Defence Industrial Corridors, including a proposed Eastern India corridor, to spur R&D, job creation, and global defence exports, which have grown at a CAGR of 46 per cent between 2016–17 and 2023–24. Establishing a Defence Export Promotion Council was also suggested to coordinate among DPSUs, private manufacturers, and foreign buyers, helping India reach its target of Rs 50,000 crore in exports by 2028–29.Over the past budgets, support for manufacturing under the Make in India agenda has increasingly centred on Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes and allied incentives aimed at boosting domestic production, investment and exports.PLI was introduced in the Budget for the first time in 2021 (after launch in 2020) with Rs 1.97 lakh crore allocation across 13 sectors.As of August-2025, 806 PLI applications have been approved across different sectors. Actual investments of around Rs 1.76 lakh crore have been realised and incremental production and sales are estimated at over Rs 16.5 lakh crore, generating more than 12 lakh jobs (direct and indirect).Incentives of Rs 21,500 crore approx. have been disbursed so far, aiding medical devices, pharmaceuticals and electronics expand capacity and exports, even as some sub-programmes face delays in payouts or delivery.Certain PLI initiatives, such as high-efficiency solar and advanced battery cells, have seen slower uptake so far, illustrating that outcomes vary significantly by sector.Overall, the PLI framework has strengthened manufacturing activity and global competitiveness, particularly in mobile and bulk drugs, though visible returns depend on sector readiness, compliance timelines, and efficient incentive disbursement, setting the stage for refinements in support as Budget 2026 approaches.Over the past five budgets, India’s welfare and subsidy allocations, particularly for food, fertiliser and fuel have been sharply recalibrated from the pandemic peak to more normalised levels. In FY 2021‑22, food and fertiliser subsidies remained elevated under pandemic relief measures, including free grains under PMGKAY, keeping the combined subsidy bill above pre-pandemic levels.Then, according to the Budget documents, total subsidies on food, fertilisers and petroleum were pegged at Rs 5,21,585 crore in the revised estimates for 2022–23, up from Rs 4,46,149 crore in the previous year. Food subsidy saw a marginal dip to Rs 2,87,194 crore from Rs 2,88,969 crore. In contrast, fertiliser subsidy surged to Rs 2,25,220 crore from Rs 1,53,758 crore, driven by higher support for both urea and phosphatic & potassic (P&K) nutrients. Petroleum subsidy also increased, rising to Rs 9,171 crore from Rs 3,423 crore.For the following fiscal year, total subsidies on food, fertilisers and petroleum were projected to decline by 28 per cent to Rs 3,74,707 crore, down from Rs 5,21,585 crore in 2022–23. Fertiliser subsidy was estimated to fall to Rs 1,75,100 crore from Rs 2,25,220 crore, while petroleum subsidy was expected to drop sharply to Rs 2,257 crore from Rs 9,171 crore. Food subsidy was also expected to have a reduction to Rs 1,97,350 crore, compared with Rs 2,87,194 crore a year earlier, following the discontinuation of the pandemic-era free foodgrain scheme.The interim FY 2024‑25 Budget allocated about Rs 4.09 lakh crore, with slight declines in fertiliser subsidies, while FY 2025‑26 saw total subsidies at roughly Rs 4.26 lakh crore, with food at Rs 2.03 lakh crore and fertiliser at Rs 1.67 lakh crore.For Budget 2026, subsidy provisions are expected to remain focused on targeted welfare delivery and efficiency rather than large expansions. With pandemic-time emergency relief measures mostly withdrawn, allocations may centre on the Public Distribution System, fertiliser support aligned with global price trends, and existing LPG or clean energy subsidy frameworks.Over the past five budgets, agriculture and rural development have been seen as fiscal priorities, FM Nirmala Sitharaman calling it the “first engine” of the country's development during the 2025-26 budget presentation.In Budget 2021-22 foundational schemes such as the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, expanded e-NAM mandis and micro-irrigation support were emphasised upon amid pandemic recovery. By Budget 2023-24, the government had increased allocations for the agriculture ministry to roughly Rs 1.25 lakh crore, including significant releases under PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi with more than Rs 2.8 lakh crore disbursed to over 11 crore farmers via direct benefit transfer. This year also saw higher spending on rural employment and insurance outlays to stabilise farm incomes.Subsequently, in the budget of FY 2024-25, the aggregate allocations funded to the agriculture and allied areas increased by an additional 4.5 per cent to Rs 1.40 lakh crores, with the latter registering double-digit growth. Similarly, the budget of 2025-26 proposed an allocation of about Rs 1.37 lakh crores and launching missions like rural prosperity, underemployment, skilling, and self-reliance.Throughout this period, rural safety nets such as MGNREGA remained stable, supporting work on rural infrastructure that increasingly benefited agricultural productivity, as evidenced by rising utilisation of funds for land development, irrigation and water harvesting.Looking into the expectations from Budget 2026, it would include the continued income support, raising the limit of subsidised credit (e.g., raising the limit on Kisan credit cards), building on the productivity and value chain missions, and a stronger impetus to rural resilience and employment generation to fuel growth in the agrarian economy.Based on the past budgets, there is a pattern emerging: a rise in capital expenditure, providing relief to the taxpayers, supporting the manufacturing sector, and providing impetus to welfare measures, all with the aim of cutting the fiscal deficit. Budget 2026 is likely to be a repeat performance of the above balancing act, as the economy is witnessing a pick-up in infrastructure, defence, and manufacturing sectors along with a fine-tuning of subsidies and taxes.Sanjiv Malhotra, Senior Advisor - Head of Tax Practice, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas told TOI, “Few sectors wherein I will place my bets (for increased allocations) will be defense, hi-tech manufacturing and skill development.”Thus, these signals indicate that Budget 2026 will likely focus on targeted investments and fiscal prudence, aiming to sustain growth while strengthening strategic sectors.","The union budget defines the country’s economic direction for the new financial year. Past budgets have marked significant personal income tax relief, which included raising the exemption limit to incentivise consumption. Capital expenditure has consistently risen, marking the importance of infrastructure and connectivity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127390670,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1557926,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

It recommended a national mission to create large-scale affordable rental housing in tier-1 and tier-2 cities, backed by incentives for developers, institutional participation and tenant-level tax benefits. Such a move would help formalise the rental market, curb informal settlements and support workforce mobility, the body said.CREDAI also reiterated its long-pending demand to raise the deduction limit on interest paid on home loans to Rs 5 lakh from the current Rs 2 lakh, and to revise the definition of affordable housing, including the area norms and the Rs 45 lakh price cap.“Housing remains a critical engine of economic growth, employment generation and urban transformation. To keep pace with India’s rapid urbanisation, it is vital to strengthen affordability, expand access to formal finance, and develop a robust rental housing ecosystem,” Shekhar Patel, President of CREDAI, said.The association flagged that the current definition of affordable housing has not been updated since 2017 and no longer reflects market realities. At present, affordable homes are capped at 60 square metres carpet area in metros and 90 square metres in non-metros, with a maximum value of Rs 45 lakh, and attract 1% GST.“The existing thresholds do not align with sharply higher land and construction costs,” CREDAI said, proposing that carpet area limits be raised to 90 square metres in metros and 120 square metres in non-metros, while removing the value cap entirely.Other real estate executives also outlined Budget expectations. Manoj Gaur, CMD of Gaurs Group, called for industry status for real estate, citing its large contribution to GDP and its position as the country’s second-largest employment generator.Shivam Agarwal, VP – Strategic Growth at Sattva Group, sought single-window clearances for Global Capability Centres (GCCs) to accelerate foreign investment, noting that GCCs are a key driver of office space demand.Ashok Kapur, Chairman of Krisumi Corporation, urged tax incentives and policy support for green and sustainable buildings, while Kirthi Chilukuri, Founder and MD of Stonecraft Group, called for stronger demand-side support for homebuyers to revive housing growth.",Realtors' apex body credai has urged the government to launch a national rental housing mission in the upcoming union budget.

Why the Budget matters to households



Dalal Street’s reaction to the Budget



Winners, laggards and sector signals



(With inputs from agencies)

The date for the presentation of the Union Budget is drawing closer and everyone is speculating what Nirmala Sitharaman 's bahikhata might just be holding. More than just a government financial statement, the event is a roadmap for taxation, spending and public policy that influences how the economy performs over the next year. The Budget announcements are tracked by both common man and Dalal Street, looking for tax rate changes, spending priorities and sectoral allocations, as they affect everything from household disposable income to corporate profitability and investment flows.As India prepares for the Union Budget 2026 to be presented on February 1, Sunday, the lessons and impacts from last year’s Budget 2025-26 help explain why this day matters so much for individuals, industries and financial markets.For ordinary people, Budget announcements have an immediate impact as they are affected by alterations in income tax, subsidies, welfare spendings. These key points affect everyone as they determine how much money families have left after meeting their tax obligations.For instance, last time in Budget 2025, the government offered major relief to common people, exempting annual income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new tax regime and restructuring slabs.This move increased disposable income for many middle-class households at a time when budgets were under pressure. Higher disposable income generally means stronger demand for goods and services.On the sectoral front, segments such as retail, automobiles, housing and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) benefit when consumers feel more confident about spending. Policy support for housing and homebuyers further strengthens construction activity and related industries, showing how tax decisions ripple through the wider economy.The February 1 announcement will serve as a major indicator of economic growth, corporate earnings and government finances for investors. Announcements on taxation, capital expenditure, subsidies and the fiscal deficit shape expectations about future economic performance. This year, even with tax relief and reforms, the government stuck to fiscal discipline, targeting a fiscal deficit of 4.4% of GDP for FY26, down from 4.8% in the current year.Market behaviour on Budget day highlighted this sensitivity. During the special trading session, the Sensex and Nifty opened higher but turned volatile after the speech. Both indices swung sharply through the day before ending almost flat, showing how quickly sentiment can change as investors process policy signals.The sectoral impact was uneven. Consumer, FMCG, automobile and consumer durable stocks gained on expectations of stronger demand. Insurance stocks drew support after the foreign direct investment limit in the sector was raised to 100%, potentially improving capital flows. Healthcare, green energy, agriculture-linked firms and water management companies also benefited from targeted measures.However, railway, defence and some infrastructure stocks disappointed investors. Although overall infrastructure allocations remained large, the increase in capital spending was modest, falling short of hopes for a major push.","Budget announcements are tracked by both common man and dalal street.

Union Budget 2026: Budget 2026 season is here and the banking sector heading ahead with a list of expectations, looking for targeted policy support to address credit constraints, employment pressures and regulatory challenges.According to Balasubramanian A, senior vice president at TeamLease Services, BFSI played a role in expanding formal employment in 2025, driven largely by large banks and fintech platforms. Lending growth remained in the mid-to-high single digits during the year. However, he further flagged that emerging asset-quality concerns, particularly in unsecured personal loans and auto loans, where non-performing assets are on the rise.This trend, he noted, reflects weak overall economic growth and the impact of earlier interest rate hikes.Hiring within the sector has been largely concentrated in customer-facing roles such as retail banking, along with back-office operations and compliance functions. ""High-skill roles in investment banking and wealth management are limited. Employment is formally structured, but wage growth has lagged inflation, compressing real wages for junior staff,"" the expert told TOI.Credit availability continues to be a key challenge. Despite existing government schemes, MSMEs remain largely credit-starved, with SME lending growing at a slow pace. Housing finance has held up well, and insurance penetration is increasing in semi-urban and rural areas. However, these positives conceal a broader sense of caution in bank lending decisions.From the incoming Union Budget, the sector is seeking enhanced credit guarantee mechanisms for MSMEs ""with higher coverage, longer tenors, and simplified KYC norms for small loans,"" Balasubramanian said. To improve access for MSMEs, there should deply co-lending schemes where the government shares risks.Additionally, the industry is also seeking continued support for digital financial inclusion, including backing for UPI, BHIM and digital lending platforms, along with the introduction of a ""FinTech Bill clarifying regulatory sandboxes"".Incentives to boost pension and insurance adoption are another priority, with calls for matching government contributions for NPS enrolments to strengthen the savings base and retirement security.Additionally, the sector wants regulatory relief for regional rural banks and small finance banks, including tax breaks and a reduced compliance burden, to improve profitability and expand the flow of credit to rural areas.","Bfsi played a role in expanding formal employment in 2025, driven largely by large banks and fintech platforms.

Hospitality & Tourism Outlook

‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

Island Tourism and Maritime Connectivity

MUMBAI: As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, stakeholders across India’s travel, tourism and hospitality sectors are seeking policy continuity, improved financing frameworks and measures to stimulate consumer spending. While domestic travel demand has remained resilient, foreign tourist arrivals are still below earlier peak levels, prompting industry leaders to look to the Budget for support on infrastructure creation, connectivity and ease of doing business.“The Indian hospitality industry has been in a sweet spot in recent years amidst persistent demand-supply imbalances and a structurally favourable environment. However, foreign tourist arrivals are still below past peak levels. ICRA expects the upcoming Union Budget to continue its focus on tourism and infrastructure investments, ease of doing business, enhanced connectivity and accessibility. With supply growth continuing to lag demand, policy frameworks aiding favourable financing terms shall support inventory addition,” said Srikumar Krishnamurthy, Senior Vice President & Co-Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA Ltd.Echoing the need for policy stability and demand stimulation, BLS International highlighted the importance of global mobility and consumer spending.“India’s travel and tourism ecosystem has benefited significantly from the Government’s progressive policy outlook towards global mobility and ease of travel. We hope the government maintains this positive outlook. In addition, continued policy support through the upcoming Union Budget—particularly through certain measures to increase the disposable income, as well as targeted travel incentives—would encourage people to spend more on both domestic and international travel, boosting the overall tourism industry,” said Shikhar Aggarwal, Joint Managing Director, BLS International.He added that a review of the current foreign exchange limits and taxes on forex transactions would further support this momentum by easing cash-flow pressures for travellers and service providers.From the marine tourism segment, Nautika underscored the need for easier permits and modern maritime infrastructure to unlock island tourism potential.“As an industry we’re expecting that the government adds more facilities so that people visit touristy destinations like islands more in 2026. The company supports laws that make it easier to get permits for high-end services and improve shipping infrastructure. Better ports, eco-friendly ship technology and easy movement between islands would not only aid tourists and operators but they would also help the economy grow and create jobs in the area,” said Anoop Kumar, Founder and Director, Nautika.He noted that more than 2.5 million passengers are served each year and that the segment is growing rapidly, adding that “rules and incentives that promote modern maritime services will help open up new tourism potential” and signal that India is serious about sustainable tourism-led growth.Overall, industry expectations from Union Budget 2026 centre on sustaining investments in tourism and transport infrastructure, improving connectivity and accessibility, easing financial and regulatory bottlenecks, and boosting consumer spending power—seen as critical to reviving inbound tourism and supporting the next phase of growth in India’s travel and tourism ecosystem.","Industry leaders look to the budget for support on infrastructure creation, connectivity and ease of doing business.

‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

As the Budget 2026 approaches, the finance minister may not further tighten the fiscal stance in FY27, with Nuvama suggesting the government could choose to keep the deficit unchanged at the FY26 level.In its latest report, Nuvama said the Indian economy looks to be nearing a bottom, but added that momentum remains fragile. While tax cuts announced in 2025 have lifted consumption in certain areas, the firm said the impact may not translate into a broader demand revival, as spending cuts are expected to help the government meet its FY26 gross fiscal deficit (GFD) target of 4.4 per cent of GDP.Highlighting the need for policy support, the report stated, ""For FY27, monetary easing done so far must be complemented with fiscal support to enhance its effectiveness. Hence, while fiscal expansion is unlikely, we forecast the FM would refrain from further consolidation in FY27"".Nuvama expects that rather than moving towards deeper consolidation, the Budget could pause the tightening trajectory and maintain the fiscal deficit at 4.4% of GDP in FY27, the same level projected for FY26.To deliver stronger growth despite limited fiscal room, the report said the government may have to lean on large-scale disinvestments or push public sector undertakings (PSUs) to raise capital expenditure, which it noted has been subdued for several years.The report also flagged the possibility of non-fiscal measures to support growth. These could include deregulation, credit-guarantee schemes and initiatives to improve the ease of doing business. A credit guarantee scheme for microfinance institutions (MFIs), aimed at supporting low-income borrowers, may also be considered.From the market’s point of view, Nuvama said higher development spending and increased capex would be positive signals, but warned they may not be enough to arrest the earnings downgrade cycle. It added that margins could see mean reversion and external headwinds remain a key risk.Given these factors, the brokerage said it continues to maintain a defensive stance, while noting that any changes to capital gains taxation could shape market sentiment in the near term.Nuvama added that while FY26 priorities were tilted towards lifting consumption through tax rationalisation, FY27 could move towards encouraging investment through deregulation. It expects continued attention on sectors such as semiconductors, AI and robotics, and exports.Overall, the report said the FY27 Budget could be mildly supportive for growth, though the pace of recovery is likely to stay modest.","The union budget 2026 may maintain the fiscal deficit at 4.4% of gdp in fy27.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
