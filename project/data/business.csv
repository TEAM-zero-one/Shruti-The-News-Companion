1. Re-introducing tax incentives for the self-employed under the new tax regime can provide a much-needed nudge towards retirement planning.

2.

Formalising retirement savings for gig and platform workers through mandatory contributions deserves priority.

3.

Revisiting the ₹7.5 lakh cap on tax-exempt employer contributions can materially improve retirement adequacy for salaried employees.

4.

Making NPS tie-up mandatory for private sector employers can significantly expand coverage.

5.

Enabling interoperability between EPF and NPS would provide flexibility and empower individual choice.

As India aspires to become a developed economy by 2047, one of the most critical yet under-discussed pillars is retirement security. Despite rapid financialisation of household savings, India’s pension assets stand at only about 14% of GDP, significantly lower than comparable economies. The upcoming Union Budget offers an opportunity to accelerate India’s journey towards becoming a ‘pensioned society’ by strengthening and widening the National Pension System (NPS).Nearly 58% of India’s workforce is self-employed, as per the Economic Survey 2024-25. Unlike salaried employees—who benefit from EPF, corporate NPS and superannuation—the self-employed largely remain outside formal retirement systems. Section 80CCD(1B), which allowed an additional deduction of ₹50,000 for NPS contributions, acted as a strong behavioural trigger for this segment under the old tax regime. Its absence in the new tax regime has diluted that incentive.Re-introducing 80CCD(1B) under the new regime, with a higher limit of up to ₹1.2 lakh annually, would encourage early participation in retirement savings.Global experience shows that upfront tax incentives play a decisive role in driving adoption of long-term products like pensions. Over time, this would reduce old-age dependency and fiscal pressures on the State.India’s gig workforce—estimated at nearly 1 crore today and projected to reach 2.35 crore by 2029-30 —represents a fast-growing but vulnerable segment. While the Code on Social Security, 2020 recognises gig and platform workers and provides for insurance and health benefits, structured retirement savings remain absent.A modest mandatory contribution of 2–3% by digital platforms into NPS can meaningfully address this gap. Given the nature of gig work, voluntary retirement savings often take a back seat to immediate income needs. A default, system-driven contribution mechanism would help these workers build a long-term corpus without affecting their day-to-day liquidity. This step would also align well with the Government’s broader inclusion and social security agenda.Currently, the combined employer contribution to EPF, superannuation and NPS is capped at ₹7.5 lakh per annum. In practice, a significant portion of this limit is consumed by EPF and superannuation, leaving limited headroom for NPS contributions - even though NPS allows up to 14% of basic salary as employer contribution. As a result, senior management and key decision-makers often find NPS less attractive, which in turn affects adoption across organisations.Removing NPS from this overall cap—or creating a separate sub-limit for NPS—would enhance retirement replacement rates, potentially increasing them to around 65% when combined with other retirement instruments. This would also encourage leadership within corporates to actively champion NPS adoption.While EPF is mandatory, NPS remains optional, despite its low cost, transparency and market-linked returns. Today, only about 21,000 corporates offer employer NPS, compared to nearly 8 lakh establishments registered with EPFO. Making NPS tie-up mandatory for companies above a certain workforce threshold - say, 100 employees - would substantially widen coverage among private sector employees. A blended approach combining EPF, superannuation and NPS can meaningfully enhance long-term retirement outcomes, while still preserving choice and diversification.India’s workforce is young, mobile and increasingly financially aware. While EPF offers fixed returns and capital protection, NPS provides market-linked growth, low costs and the flexibility to customize asset allocation based on age and risk appetite. Although policy intent to allow tax-neutral transfers from recognised provident funds to NPS was articulated earlier, operational enablement - especially for EPF - remains incomplete.Allowing seamless, tax-neutral transfers between EPF and NPS would give employees the freedom to design retirement solutions aligned to their life stage and financial goals, while also channelising long-term savings into productive capital formation.The Union Budget has a unique opportunity to place retirement security firmly at the center of India’s economic agenda. Targeted tax incentives, inclusion of emerging workforce segments, rationalisation of contribution limits, and greater system flexibility can collectively deepen NPS adoption. These measures would not only strengthen household financial resilience but also support long-term capital formation-creating a virtuous cycle for both citizens and the economy.",The union budget has a unique opportunity to place retirement security firmly at the center of india’s economic agenda.

NEW DELHI: The budget for 2026-27 is likely to be presented on February 1, the first, in recent memory, to be presented on a Sunday.The budget session may start from Jan 28 with the President’s speech. Though the final call on the date will be taken by the cabinet committee on parliamentary affairs (CCPA) on Wednesday, TOI has learnt that govt may continue with the tradition of presenting the budget on February 1.Since 2017, govt has been presenting the budget at 11 am on February 1 and former FM Arun Jaitley had unveiled it for the first time on the first day of Feb after govt decided to advance the budget presentation. Prior to 2017, the budget was presented on February 28.This year Feb 1 falls on a Sunday. It is also Guru Ravidas Jayanti, a restricted holiday. Being a holiday, govt offices and the stock markets are closed on Sunday.People aware of the development said that the Economic Survey would be presented on January 29. The next two days — January 30 and 31 — would be holidays. The first part of the budget session is likely to be for three weeks and the second part will last for four weeks.In 2025, February 1 fell on a Saturday and govt presented the interim budget that day. The Union budget had been presented on a Saturday before too, including in 1999 when then finance minister Yashwant Sinha, who read out the budget on February 27, a Saturday. This also marked the beginning of budget speech at 11 am instead of 5 pm, a departure from colonial practice.The 2026-27 budget is keenly awaited as it comes at a time of geopolitical tensions and under the shadow of Trump’s tariffs. Government is expected to unleash reform measures to shield growth and the country’s standing as one of the fastest growing major economies in the world .They added that the themes have been chosen considering govt’s focus to achieve the goal of a developed nation by undertaking major reforms to push growth against the backdrop of global challenges.TOI has also learnt that getting rid of the “mentality of slavery” and the thrust on “reform, perform and transform” are likely to be the central themes of the President’s address at the joint sitting of Parliament on Jan 28. Different ministries have been asked to give their inputs based on these themes for the President’s speech.Removing traces of colonialism has become the talking point for the govt since August 15, 2022, when PM Narendra Modi spoke about it from the ramparts of the Red Fort. This was also one of the five pledges (Panch Pran). “When we see even the smallest thing related to colonialism in us or around us, we have to be rid of it... Indians should shed ‘colonialism’ from their minds and habits,” PM Modi had said.","The budget session may start from jan 28 with the president’s speech.

Why reform is required

For a country that prides itself on a thriving middle class, India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. Over the past few years, a series of amendments—presented as “rationalisations”—have quietly created a minefield for salaried employees who believed they were doing the right thing by saving for their future.Three provisions stand out for the burden they impose: taxation of employer contributions to provident and superannuation funds beyond ₹7.5 lakh; yearly taxation of accretions on such excess contributions; and taxation of interest earned on the employee’s own PF contributions above ₹2.5 lakh. In isolation each may appear technical. Together, they are reshaping retirement planning in ways that leave employees with little clarity, greater financial anxiety, and a rising tax bill on income they do not even receive today.The first shock for employees came with the Finance Act, 2020, which capped employer contributions to recognised PF, approved superannuation funds and NPS at ₹7.5 lakh per year. Anything above that—common for senior professionals, mid-level employees in high-cost cities, and those in organisations with generous retirement policies—became taxable as a perquisite.But what stings more is that annual accretion—interest, dividend or similar growth—on this “excess contribution” is also taxed. This is a tax on notional income, long before the employee sees a rupee of it.Many describe this as an upfront penalty on saving. Unlike bonuses or cash payments, retirement contributions are locked in for the long term. Yet tax is now collected today on money that may only be received decades later. That mismatch betweenandhas become a major pain point.When exemption isn’t really exemptionThe hardship intensifies when the National Pension System comes into play. While the government justified taxing excess employer contributions by calling PF, superannuation and NPS an “EEE regime”, the law doesn’t fully support that claim.Under Section 10(12A), up to 60% of the NPS corpus can be withdrawn tax-free upon closure of the account or opting out of NPS. The remaining 40% must be used to purchase an annuity plan from a life insurance company, and the pension received from this annuity is fully taxable. Employees therefore argue that the premise of an entirely exempt regime is not accurate.The Finance Act, 2021 introduced another hit: PF interest earned on the employee’s own contribution beyond ₹2.5 lakh per year is taxable.For many mid-career employees, PF is the only disciplined savings instrument they rely on. A high PF contribution isn’t a luxury; it is a way to secure the future in the absence of universal social security.Yet the law now characterises high contributions—even when mandatory or part of salary structure—as an attempt to “enjoy full exemption”. The sting is sharper for those whose basic salary is high enough that the statutory 12% PF contribution itself may cross the ₹2.5 lakh threshold, triggering tax on interest even when the employee never intended to “over-contribute”. This change is seen as especially harsh in a country where inflation erodes purchasing power and pension adequacy is already a concern.“Also, these changes all appear to be part of the ultimate aim of the government to do away with all deductions and exemptions and make the ‘new tax regime’ the only regime available for all taxpayers,” says Ameet Patel, partner, Manohar Chowdhry & Associates.Across these provisions, a consistent theme emerges:India now taxes retirement savings more aggressively. Employees who save diligently, especially mid- to senior-level workers, face:The result is that long-term savings face multiple tax points.There is growing consensus across industry bodies that these provisions need urgent review. The argument is not about giving employees a windfall—it is about ensuring fairness and a safety net. With an ageing population, lack of a universal social security system applicable to all citizens, and rising cost of living, the existing provisions are detrimental . India’s salaried class feels squeezed—not because they don’t want to pay taxes, but because the system increasingly treats retirement savings as a luxury rather than a necessity. What was once a predictable, trusted savings pathway is now layered with caps, tax triggers, and compliance complications.“And this compounds the problems that the ageing population faces when insurance companies either refuse to issue new health policies to senior citizens or charge such high premia on the policies that having a Mediclaim policy becomes extremely expensive for such retired persons. As and when such a person needs large amounts to be paid to hospitals for medical treatments, the depleted savings are often inadequate and the entire family is put under huge financial stress,” concludes Patel.",India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Or allow non-resident taxpayers to submit TRCs from previous years (for example, the past one or two years) along with Form 10F.

Alternatively allow submission of documents other than TRC to substantiate residency of a particular country.

Practical Pain Points

India’s economic footprint extends far beyond its borders. Millions of Indians living abroad continue to hold property, investments, and financial interests back home. Foreign nationals and global investors, too, increasingly engage with Indian businesses. Yet, for all the cross-border activity, India’s tax system still places a disproportionately heavy compliance burden on those who qualify as non-residents under tax law.As Budget 2026 approaches, industry bodies, tax experts, and non-resident taxpayers are urging the government to rationalize the rules. Their central message is simple: when income is minimal, passive, or already subject to tax deducted at source (TDS), compliance should be simple and easy.At present, non-resident individuals must file an Indian tax return if their total income exceeds Rs. 2.5 lakh — even when every rupee of that income has already suffered TDS and there is no additional tax liability arising in India. This includes small interest earnings, or dividend income.Tax experts point out that this leads to return filings with no additional tax payable, clogging the system and adding cost and effort for taxpayers who may have no other financial connection to India.Recommendation: Perhaps Budget 2026 provisions could provide some leeway and exemption in filing a tax return, if no tax is required to be paid and the non-resident has no business income in India.A non-resident taxpayer can claim the benefit of a tax treaty, which often provides a lower tax rate — for instance, on dividend income from shares held in India. Under section 90(2) of the Income-tax Act, the provisions that are more favourable to the taxpayer prevail. Thus, if the treaty prescribes a lower rate than domestic law, the treaty rate applies.However, section 90(4) requires the taxpayer to furnish a Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) in order to access treaty benefits, regardless of the nature or quantum of income. When the amounts involved are very small, the requirement to obtain a TRC can create unnecessary hardship for both the non-resident recipient and the resident payer, as the process involves time and cost.Mahesh Nayak, tax partner at CNK & Associates points to several other challenges. “In addition, non-resident taxpayers must currently file Form 10F electronically on the e-filing portal to claim tax treaty relief. They are also required to provide a TRC from foreign tax authorities covering the entire financial year to establish residency in the other country. In practice, many foreign tax authorities do not issue TRCs certifying future residency. Further, in certain jurisdictions, obtaining a TRC involves incurring a significant cost to the individual taxpayer and hence, asking for multiple TRCs for recurring payments becomes a costly affair, he says.Nayak points out that submission of documents other than TRC to substantiate the tax residency of a particular jurisdiction (country) should be permitted. The objective of a TRC is only to determine that the taxpayer is a resident of a particular country and therefore, if one can substantiate the tax residency through some other document, it should suffice, as held by Tribunals. “For example, in the US, a citizen is considered as a tax resident. Therefore, in such a situation, if one can provide a copy of the passport, clearly demonstrating US citizenship, that should suffice the eligibility of the taxpayer to claim the benefit of the India – US tax treaty. Copies of the passport can also be used to help determine the number of days stay in a particular jurisdiction, which can help determine tax residency in jurisdictions which determine tax residency based on number of days stay in that particular year,” he explains.If the TRC provided by the tax authorities of the relevant jurisdiction does not contain all the information as required under the Indian tax rules, the non-resident is required to provide the said details in a declaration in Form 10F, which is to be furnished electronically.“There are practical challenges for a non-resident taxpayer, who does not have a PAN in India, to furnish Form 10F as at times, the OTP is not sent to the foreign mobile number of the taxpayer. This creates an unnecessary hassle for a mere filing of a declaration along with the TRC,” states Nayak.Non-residents must maintain a bank account in India to pay taxes and to receive tax refunds, even when they reside abroad and hold no other Indian assets. The final step in income-tax return filing — e-verification — is linked to Indian bank accounts, Aadhaar-linked mobile numbers, or certain digital signatures. Non-residents without Indian mobile numbers often struggle to complete filings within the stipulated deadline.Budget 2026 provides the perfect moment to modernize India’s approach — and to acknowledge that, for millions of global Indians and foreign nationals, “ease of compliance” is a reality.","At present, non-resident individuals must file an indian tax return if their total income exceeds rs. 2.5 lakh.

As India charts its economic course for the coming year, the insurance sector remains a key pillar in household financial planning and risk mitigation. Recent regulatory efforts and initiatives have supported sectoral growth, yet broad measures of insurance engagement show there is still significant ground to cover. According to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s annual report, India’s overall insurance penetration stood at 3.7 percent of GDP in FY24, with life insurance coverage at 2.8 percent. This level remains below the global average of over 7 percent. As per a PwC India report on insurance inclusion, in rural India, where around 65 percent of the population resides, less than 10 percent of people have life insurance coverage.These insights serve as a reminder that despite progress, access to financial protection is still limited for large sections of the population. With this context, the upcoming Budget offers an opportunity to strengthen policy support. My recommendations below aim to enhance customer outcomes, improve long term savings participation, and support national goals of financial inclusion and resilience.India’s pension ecosystem continues to face a significant coverage gap.While the National Pension System and other formal pension schemes continue to expand, India's formal pension coverage remains below 25% of the workforce according to the Mercer-CFA Institute Global Pension Index 2025. The report ranks the country 45th out of 47 nations for pension adequacy. Life insurance annuity products and the National Pension System both aim to support retirement income, yet their tax treatment differs considerably.Insurance annuity payouts are taxed on the full amount, including the principal that has already been taxed during the earning years. NPS subscribers, on the other hand, receive additional deductions for self-contribution and employer contribution. This difference in treatment often influences consumer decisions more than product suitability.A more aligned and tax efficient framework across financial products, for example taxing only the returns on annuity payouts and extending comparable deductions to insurance annuity pension products, would allow individuals to choose based on their long term needs rather than tax benefits. Such alignment would encourage more Indians to build structured retirement plans.Over the last few years, high-value traditional insurance policies have received different treatment. For example, for all policies whose annual aggregate premium is higher than Rs. 5 lakh, the maturity proceeds are now taxed at regular income tax rates. These policies, which provide significant life cover in addition to disciplined wealth accumulation, started to be considered less attractive when compared to other alternatives of investment.Meanwhile, high-value Unit Linked insurance policies, whose annual aggregate premium is higher than Rs. 2.5 lakh premium get long-term capital gains treatment, usually more generous and tax efficient. Therefore, introducing similar tax treatment of capital gain on high-value traditional insurance policies as well and bringing both to the same tax treatment would create consistency, simplify the tax code, and encourage more people-particularly business owners, double-income families, and senior professionals to combine protection with savings.As insurance companies strive to meet rural coverage requirements, affordability becomes crucial. Even modest transaction costs such as stamp duty can influence pricing for low ticket products. Exempting rural and social sector policies from stamp duty, similar to the exemption already provided under PMJJBY, would help improve affordability and support deeper penetration.Life insurance can play an important role in shaping India’s long-term financial resilience. While the sector has made progress in expanding access and adapting to changing customer needs, data shows that penetration and coverage gaps persist. Thoughtful policy changes in the upcoming budget can support a more efficient, equitable, and inclusive insurance ecosystem.In the end, financial security should not remain a privilege of a few but be strengthened as a shared foundation for every household.","India’s pension ecosystem continues to face a significant coverage gap. In rural india, where around 65 percent of the population resides, less than 10 percent of people have life insurance coverage. Thoughtful policy changes in the upcoming budget can support a more efficient, equitable, and inclusive insurance ecosystem.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126175952,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-64102,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Budget 2026: Introduction of optional joint taxation for married couples can be a game changer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-introduction-of-optional-joint-taxation-for-married-couples-can-be-a-game-changer/articleshow/126155653.cms,"ICAI proposes that married couples be given the option to file a single, joint return. (AI image)

What is the proposal about?

Why ICAI recommends joint taxation

It simplifies tax compliance and household filing. Joint filing could reduce paperwork and make it easier for couples to manage their tax affairs together.

It could relieve tax burden for many households — especially those with a single earning member. Under joint taxation, the exemption thresholds and effective liability could be more favourable.

It aligns India with global practices. Many countries – such as the US and some European countries (such as Germany, Spain, Portugal) allow joint filing or joint assessment for married couples.

How joint taxation might work (proposed model)

Tax slabs (for joint filers) might be restructured. For example, one proposed model sets no tax up to ₹6 lakh (for the couple), 5% for ₹6–14 lakh, and ascending slabs for higher income.

Standard deductions (for salaried earners), exemptions and surcharge thresholds may be adjusted — e.g. increased surcharge threshold, separate standard deductions for both spouses if salaried.

The option to choose — i.e., couples could opt to file jointly only if it benefits them; otherwise, they’d continue filing individually, retaining flexibility.

What needs careful design — and possible concerns

System-level overhaul required: Current tax filing, TDS/TCS, PAN-based tracking systems are designed for individuals. Joint filing may require re-designing data architecture, reconciliations, challans, and return-processing.

Current tax filing, TDS/TCS, PAN-based tracking systems are designed for individuals. Joint filing may require re-designing data architecture, reconciliations, challans, and return-processing. Risk of revenue leakage or misuse: If exemption limits and deductions are doubled or significantly enhanced for couples, there could be a potential for tax avoidance through income-shifting, especially in households with skewed income distribution.

If exemption limits and deductions are doubled or significantly enhanced for couples, there could be a potential for tax avoidance through income-shifting, especially in households with skewed income distribution. Complexity with deductions & exemptions: Handling categories like house-property income, home-loan interest, investments under 80C, medical insurance deduction, etc., for two individuals in one return would require clear guidelines — especially because current laws treat individuals separately.

Handling categories like house-property income, home-loan interest, investments under 80C, medical insurance deduction, etc., for two individuals in one return would require clear guidelines — especially because current laws treat individuals separately. Fairness to dual-income couples: For couples where both work, joint taxation may not offer much advantage — or could even increase tax liability if their combined income pushes them into higher slabs. The optional nature would allow couples to choose the regime that’s most beneficial.

What could this mean for Indian households — a few scenarios

Household type



Possible benefits under joint taxation



Single-earner couple (spouse unemployed / homemaker)



Lower tax liability — combined exemption could reduce tax burden; simpler ITR filing and compliance.



Dual-earner couple with modest incomes



Could benefit from higher basic exemption + standard deductions; might still pay less than two separate returns depending on slab thresholds.



High-income dual-earner couple



Possibly limited benefit: combined income might push into higher slab — need careful evaluation.



Families with children, home-loan, medical expenses



Joint filing could allow better optimization of deductions (standard deduction, 80C, 80D, housing benefit) if structured well.





Why this proposal matters — beyond tax savings

It recognises a household as a unit — acknowledging that many expenses (household, children, assets) are shared, so taxing couples as a unit can make tax treatment more equitable.

It simplifies tax compliance — fewer returns to file, less paperwork, consolidated records, which is especially beneficial for small earners or nuclear families.

It aligns India with global practices — many economies allow joint filing, and this could modernise India’s tax code for contemporary family structures.

It could increase compliance and reduce evasion — by discouraging income splitting and spreading income artificially across family members to reduce taxes.

Conclusion

Pre-budget suggestions are pouring in, in the North Block. As the government gears up to present the 2026 budget, one proposal stands out for its potential impact on millions of households: optional joint taxation for married couples. It has been suggested by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and if adopted by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), it could mark a significant shift in how personal income tax is structured — and how families plan their finances.Currently, under the Indian tax system, every individual — married or not — is taxed separately. Each spouse must file their own income tax return, even if they have shared income or joint expensesICAI proposes that married couples be given the option to file a single, joint return — combining their incomes and deductions — instead of two separate ones. In other words: a married couple could choose what makes financial sense for them each year — file individually, or jointly.According to ICAI’s submission:The couple would file a single consolidated Income tax return (ITR) under the joint-filing option.The idea is attractive, but implementing joint taxation in India isn’t just a technical tweak. There are challenges to consider:The proposal for optional joint taxation of married couples — as submitted by ICAI in its pre-Budget 2026-27 memorandum — represents a potential paradigm shift in India’s personal tax framework.It seeks not just to ease compliance, but to recognise households (not just individuals) as fundamental economic units.For many Indian families — especially those with a single earner, homemaker spouse, children, home-loan or shared expenses — this could translate into lighter tax burden, improved financial well-being, and simpler tax compliance. On the policy side, it could bring India a step closer to global practices and make the tax system more equitable, transparent, and modern.","Icai proposes that married couples be given the option to file a single, joint return.

By Parizad Sirwalla

Budget 2025 income tax: In the run up to the Budget 2025, individual taxpayers were eagerly looking forward to favorable tax reforms. The FM seems to have brought some cheer to them through her proposals.Recognizing the contributions of the middle class and with an objective to eventually phase out the old tax regime, various changes have been introduced in the new tax regime. The basic exemption limit has been increased from INR 3 lakhs to INR 4 lakhs. In a significant shift, the highest slab is increased from INR 15 lakhs to 24 lakhs. The other slabs and tax rates have been realigned and a new tax rate of 25% has been included. Income threshold for rebate under 87A available to resident taxpayers has been increased from INR 7 lakhs to INR 12 lakhs. For computing this threshold, special rate income (such as capital gains, lottery winnings etc.) has been specifically excluded, to also address certain ambiguities in the earlier interpretation.With these changes, all the taxpayers in the new tax regime have some reason to celebrate, irrespective of income levels.As an illustration, a person with income up to 12 lakhs can now enjoy annual tax savings of INR 80,000 (excluding cess). At the same time, an individual with income of 18 lakhs has a tax savings upto INR 110,000 (excluding cess). The savings would be higher for income levels where surcharge is applicable.Few amendments have been made with a view to simplify certain provisions. Earlier, in case of vacant properties, annual income could be considered as NIL for up to two self-occupied properties (SOP). While there is no change in above, to qualify as SOP, currently there is a condition that the taxpayer should not be able to reside therein due to his business or employment or profession and that taxpayer is staying in a premises not owned by him. This condition has now been done away with.NPS Vatsalya Scheme launched in September 2024, enabled parents and guardians to start a NPS for their minor children, which on attaining majority, would be transferred to the child's name with the accumulated corpus. As a welcome measure, the Budget has extended the deduction of INR 50,000 under section 80CCD (available in the old tax regime) to also include contributions towards this scheme. Further, it has been specified that partial withdrawals up to 25 per cent from the scheme, allowed for specified reasons, shall not be taxable.Currently, a deduction is allowed to an individual for any amount deposited in the National Saving Scheme (NSS), prior to 1 April 1992. Any withdrawals from the scheme are held as taxable. As a notification dated 29 August 2024 specified that the balances would not earn interest, this made the depositors keen to withdraw the NSS balance. Based on various representations received, the FM has now exempted the withdrawals done post 29 August 2024, for which deduction was allowed earlier, to provide them the much-required relief.Striking a balance between fiscal prudence and the theme of “Trust first, Scrutinize later”, the Government has enhanced timelines for filing updated returns by two more years by paying additional taxes of 60 and 70 percent respectively. This will help boost tax revenues through voluntary compliance.Consistency and clarity has been provided in the taxability of redemption proceeds of all un-exempted ULIPs, by including them in the definition of equity - oriented fund, which was earlier only with respect to certain unexempted ULIPs.There has been a rationalization of the various TCS/ TDS thresholds including on remittances under Liberalized remittance scheme (from INR 700,000 to INR 10,00,000 and NIL in the case of remittance for education financed by a specified loans) and interest income for senior citizens (from existing INR 50,000 to INR 100,000). This will positively impact their cash flows.The higher TDS is proposed to be continued on assesses having invalid PAN/ non-PAN holders. However, it is proposed to remove the higher TDS/TCS on non-filers of return of income with an attempt for ease of doing business and reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers.The FM has also promised to table the much-awaited New Income Tax Bill which aims at simplicity and reduced litigation, in the next week. All in all, the Budget endeavors to take steps to reinforce confidence and optimism in the taxpayers.","Income threshold for rebate under 87a available to resident taxpayers has been increased from inr 7 lakhs to inr 12 lakhs.

'Budget's given comfort to monetary authority': Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budgets-given-comfort-to-monetary-authority-finance-secretary-tuhin-kanta-pandey/articleshow/117995724.cms,"In an interview to TOI,

Pandey, who is also in charge of the revenue department, said

Do you think the Budget has done enough to help accelerate growth against the backdrop of global uncertainties?

Is the time right for

monetary authorities to play a part in accelerating growth, for example with a rate cut?

So, has the Budget created conditions for a rate cut?

Is the tax relief largely to boost consumption and address some of the concerns of the middle class?

Have other levers of economy got required attention, apart from consumption and investment?

When do you expect I-T bill to be presented in Parliament? How will it make life of the taxpayer simple?

Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the 2025-26 Budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation.the Budget has enabled all levers of growth to accelerate. Excepts:It is a pro-growth Budget. We have headwinds and we also have internal challenges. We have addressed both. Although, we are still the fastest growing large economy in the world, not only we have to maintain this growth, but we have to push it up. We have addressed both the supply-side and demand-side and tried in a non inflationary way to maximise growth, accelerate growth.I think it's up to the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to take a call on that. But, on the fiscal side, we have done our bit. We have kept the promise of fiscal consolidation. FM had announced that it will be 4.9% in this year and we have been able to achieve 4.8%. FM had said fiscal consolidation path will mean we'll bring it to 4.5% next year. We are proposing 4.4% and there was also an announcement that thereafter we will have a glide path in terms of the debt-to-GDP level and a visibility would be given on how it will go forward.That has also been included in the FRBM statement.In a way, the Budget has provided whatever stimulations are required. We are not providing a stimulus at the cost of the deficit by increasing the deficit. So, we are giving sufficient sort of comfort to the monetary authority. However, they would have to take a call based on whatever.I would say consumption is one part. However, we are not really prescribing how taxpayers, who have got this money back in a way, how they will behave. Basically, the decision making is transferred to taxpayers, who have got this relief. They may choose to consume, save or invest directly in either of the three situations we have. It will have a salutary and good effect on the economy because if they choose to consume, it will boost demand. If they choose to invest indirectly, they are supporting the banks to extend more credit. Because, banks can give credit only when they have got increased deposits. And, if they choose to directly invest, for example in a house, they also participate in investments. In that case, it will work like an investment multiplier anyway. So, it will be a combination of consumption and investment multiplier, with a positive impact on savings. Overall, I would say it will be a growth-booster.A large economy like India has to have all engines firing. You cannot simply say we will only go for agriculture, not for manufacturing. Or, we will go for manufacturing and not for services. Therefore all three are required. If you see all the proposals on supply side, we have tried to see how we can speed up production, how we can speed up productivity and how we can spur employment. So, it is employment-led growth. In agriculture, we have taken steps to boost pulses productivity and increase credit limit for farmers. Everywhere we have said how we can boost production and productivity. We are saying let there be a growth path for MSMEs. Let there be more credit available for MSMEs. Let their participation in exports be more. Let there be more support for them in terms of innovation and research. Our tax policy is supporting labour intensive sectors.It is proposed to be done before Feb 13. We are not changing the policy through it. The same thing will be carried forward because after passing, this bill will be applicable from a future date. We wanted to reform right away. So, those reforms have been brought in this bill through amendments. There are so many redundant provisions. There are a number of changes. More than 4,000 changes have happened since 1962, when this act was enacted. In 63 years, the finance sector changed, plus there were many taxation laws and amendment bills. Things get complicated to read and they may also create interpretation problems. There could be many interpretation problems or litigations. If you have more readability, if you have clarity, there will be less litigation.","Finance secretary tuhin kanta pandey said the 2025-26 budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
