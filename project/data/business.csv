India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural economies. One powerful yet underutilised lever in this journey is household gold. In recent years, the value of household gold has more than doubled, significantly increasing family wealth across India. According to a 2025 Morgan Stanley estimate, Indian households hold nearly 34,600 tonnes of gold jewellery, valued at around $3.8 trillion—almost 89 percent of the country’s GDP. Much of this gold has been accumulated over generations or acquired to mark important life milestones.While gold carries immense emotional and cultural significance, in its idle form it contributes little to economic activity. It is therefore imperative that India deploys effective policies to enable household gold to be used productively—without forcing families to relinquish ownership.Gold loans offer precisely this solution. They allow households to unlock the economic value of gold while retaining emotional ownership, making gold a working asset that supports livelihoods, enterprise, and growth.Over the past few years, regulators have taken meaningful steps to introduce balanced regulations that protect customers while supporting sectoral development.These measures, coming into effect from April 1, 2026, create a stronger foundation. However, to unlock the full potential of gold loans for inclusive growth, further reforms are needed.Credit penetration in rural India remains low, particularly among shopkeepers and MSMEs—estimated at nearly six million nationwide. Many continue to lack access to formal finance, even as they need working capital to upgrade infrastructure, manage inventory, and expand offerings.Gold loans are ideally suited to meet these short-term needs. Interest is charged only for the period the loan is utilised, allowing borrowers to repay when cash flows improve and re-borrow as required. This flexible credit cycle supports business growth, encourages financial discipline, and mobilises household savings in a way that benefits both borrowers and the broader economy.Strengthening Last-Mile Credit Through NBFC Branch ExpansionA key reason for low credit penetration in Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural areas is limited physical branch presence. Over time, NBFCs have demonstrated a superior ability to reach underserved regions, tailor products to local needs, and operate efficiently through well-established models.For gold loans in particular, physical branches are essential and cannot be fully replaced by digital channels, unlike unsecured personal loans. Encouraging NBFCs to expand branch networks would significantly improve access and deepen market penetration.Currently, regulatory restrictions and prescriptive guidelines on branch expansion can slow network growth. Liberalising these norms—especially for collateral-backed products like gold loans—would accelerate outreach while maintaining prudential safeguards.NBFCs play a critical role in last-mile credit delivery, particularly for small-ticket and entry-level loans in rural areas. However, all NBFC loans currently carry a uniform 100 percent risk weight, which raises the cost of lending and limits credit supply.Gold loans are regulated by loan-to-value (LTV) norms, similar to home loans, where risk weights vary based on LTV. Extending a similar risk-based framework to gold loans could unlock significant capital, enabling NBFCs to expand credit availability to deserving borrowers.A coordinated approach between the Government and regulators can help create a supportive policy framework that recognises the broader economic and nation-building potential of expanding gold loan credit.Recent stress in unsecured lending segments, including microfinance, has adversely affected credit scores for millions of households. Many of these borrowers experienced temporary or one-time defaults and are now excluded from formal credit.Targeted schemes are needed to help such borrowers re-enter the formal financial system. Ensuring that temporary distress does not lead to permanent exclusion will allow households to regain access to credit and participate productively in the economy.Housing is a powerful economic driver in rural India, with strong linkages to nearly 50 sectors. While banks offer rural housing loans, their reach in smaller ticket sizes—below ₹10–15 lakh—is limited. NBFCs, with their extensive branch networks, are better positioned to serve this segment.However, SARFAESI Act provisions restrict NBFCs’ ability to recover smaller-ticket secured loans, as enforcement is allowed only for outstanding amounts of ₹20 lakh and above. Harmonising SARFAESI applicability for NBFCs in line with banks and housing finance companies would significantly improve credit flow and accelerate rural housing growth.An estimated 60 percent of gold lending remains unregulated. Formal gold loans, by contrast, operate under clear regulatory guidelines and supervision. Allowing greater flexibility in NBFC branch expansion would accelerate formalisation and extend regulated credit to underserved markets.With a strong regulatory framework already in place, wider branch access can help bring millions of borrowers into the formal financial system.The upcoming Budget presents a timely opportunity to build on existing reforms. With continued policy support and regulatory alignment, gold loans can unlock household wealth, deepen rural credit access, and drive inclusive growth across Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural India.","India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to tier-2, tier-3, and rural economies.

Deadly High-Speed Train Collision in Southern Spain Kills Dozens, Rescue Operations Ongoing

Here's what to know





MADRID: Multiple train crashes this week have rocked Spain and the tragedies have led to questions about safety on the country's railway system.The first crash involved a high-speed train in southern Spain that derailed on Sunday evening, colliding with another fast train, killing at least 43 people and injuring more than 150.The crash was the deadliest in Spain since a 2013 crash that killed 80 people when a commuter train in the northern region of Galicia hurtled off the rails as it came around a bend going too fast.On Tuesday night, another train crash happened in northeastern Spain on a commuter line near Barcelona. One person was killed.Then, on Thursday, a commuter train crashed in southeastern Spain, lightly injuring 6 passengers.Derailment and collision The Sunday derailment happened at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails and slammed into an oncoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva with around 200 people, according to rail operator Adif.The head of the second train took the brunt of the impact, Transport Minister Oscar Puente said. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track and sent them plummeting down a four-meter (13-foot) slope.The collision took place near Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) south of Madrid.""The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of meters away,"" Andalusia's regional President Juan Manuel Moreno said.Authorities said they had identified almost all the victims from Sunday's crash.Cause under investigation Explanations about what caused the crash were scant, with an official investigation underway.Alvaro Fernandez, the president of national railway company Renfe, told Spanish public radio RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit of 250 kph (155 mph) and ""human error could be ruled out.""Transport Minister Puente called the crash ""truly strange"" since it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. But Puente said late Monday that officials had found a broken section of track.""Now we have to determine if that is a cause or a consequence (of the derailment),"" Puente told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser.The train that jumped the track belonged to the private company Iryo, while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, belonged to Renfe.Iryo said in a statement Monday that its train was manufactured in 2022 and passed its latest safety check on Jan. 15.The Spanish Union of Railway Drivers sent a letter last August asking Spain's rail operator to investigate flaws on high-speed train lines across the country caused by increased traffic.It warned of potholes, bumps and imbalances in overhead power lines, as well as frequent breakdowns and damage to trains, according to a copy of the letter seen by The Associated Press.The union called for a general strike in the coming weeks to demand more safety assurances.High-speed expansion Spain has spent decades investing heavily in high-speed trains. It currently has the largest rail network in Europe for trains traveling more than 250 kph (155 mph), with more than 3,900 kilometers (2,400 miles) of track, according to the International Union of Railways.The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Officials said that Sunday's collision was the first with deaths on Spain's high-speed rail network since it opened its first line in 1992.Commuter line crashes A Barcelona commuter train crashed Tuesday after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish regional authorities said, killing one person and injuring at least 37 others.A commuter train crashed on Thursday in the southeastern Murcia region after it collided with a crane. Emergency services said six people with minor injuries had been transferred to the hospital.While Spain's high-speed rail network generally runs smoothly, commuter rails are plagued by reliability issues. However, crashes causing injury or death are not common.","Multiple train crashes in spain this week have led to questions about safety.

For many taxpayers with simple income profile, filing an Income Tax Return (ITR) has become easier over the years, but it remains an important annual compliance requirement that demands time and attention. With better technology and rising expectations for convenience, a question arises whether we can move towards complete automation of ITR filing.Let's look at how our country is progressing towards a simpler, smarter, and user-friendly ITR filing experience.India's tax system has made greater progress in making the tax return filing easier by pulling together data from various sources into the Income tax department's database.Sign up on the e-filing portal, using PAN as the user ID, create a password, and you are ready to upload your tax return.Many details now appear automatically in the ITR, such as personal information, PAN, Aadhaar, bank information, salary data, personal income and tax paid details.Information reported in earlier years, such as foreign assets, directorships, unlisted shares etc.is also pre-populated, saving time and effort.The Annual Information Statement (AIS) and Taxpayer Information Summary (TIS) provide a consolidated list of all your income, tax and financial activities.You can verify your tax return instantly using Aadhaar OTP or net banking, so you are no longer required to mail signed ITR-V form to the tax authorities.While the taxpayer is required to verify & reconcile the details appearing in the income tax database, the above features have reduced mistakes when entering data and made the process much easier.Income tax department has already made strong progress through AIS/TIS, pre-filled returns, faceless assessments, and a rapidly improving e-filing portal. However, a truly automated tax return filing needs more than upgrades but a structural change. Here are a few areas that could be looked at for further improvement:All financial institutions and govt systems need to share information through common, standardised channels so that tax department can compile accurate data.Today's prefilled returns still miss several income items, such as interest income splits, capital gains data from different brokers, rental income, exempt categories, and digital asset earnings etc.Govt can move towards a single, simplified tax regime along with rationalising capital gains and TDS provisions to automate the filings for simpler tax returns.The e-filing portal has already improved the online filing experience, but there's still room to make it faster and more efficient. Quicker AIS/TIS updates and automatic real-time error checks before submission, could be few steps to make the process easier for taxpayers.Another widely discussed idea is whether employers can submit relevant details for their salaried employees to eliminate ITR filing.Right now, Form 16 captures data regarding salary, deduction(s), taxes and personal income details to certain extent. However, the complexity arises for employees with multiple income streams, especially foreign income or other personal financial details that employers will not be aware of. While it's an idea with clear potential, the same requires comprehensive design to work for every taxpayer.Full automation is certainly within reach for simpler tax returns. However, tax returns involving tax-treaty claims (including Form 67 filings), business income, capital gains, foreign income, foreign asset disclosures etc., will still need to follow the existing process due to complexities, with automation applied, wherever practical.Though certain challenges remain, the tax department continues to advance towards a smarter, smoother, and more intuitive tax-filing system, for better taxpayer experience.","Filing an income tax return (itr) has become easier over the years, but it remains an important annual compliance requirement that demands time and attention.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

Island Tourism and Maritime Connectivity

MUMBAI: As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, stakeholders across India’s travel, tourism and hospitality sectors are seeking policy continuity, improved financing frameworks and measures to stimulate consumer spending. While domestic travel demand has remained resilient, foreign tourist arrivals are still below earlier peak levels, prompting industry leaders to look to the Budget for support on infrastructure creation, connectivity and ease of doing business.“The Indian hospitality industry has been in a sweet spot in recent years amidst persistent demand-supply imbalances and a structurally favourable environment. However, foreign tourist arrivals are still below past peak levels. ICRA expects the upcoming Union Budget to continue its focus on tourism and infrastructure investments, ease of doing business, enhanced connectivity and accessibility. With supply growth continuing to lag demand, policy frameworks aiding favourable financing terms shall support inventory addition,” said Srikumar Krishnamurthy, Senior Vice President & Co-Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA Ltd.Echoing the need for policy stability and demand stimulation, BLS International highlighted the importance of global mobility and consumer spending.“India’s travel and tourism ecosystem has benefited significantly from the Government’s progressive policy outlook towards global mobility and ease of travel. We hope the government maintains this positive outlook. In addition, continued policy support through the upcoming Union Budget—particularly through certain measures to increase the disposable income, as well as targeted travel incentives—would encourage people to spend more on both domestic and international travel, boosting the overall tourism industry,” said Shikhar Aggarwal, Joint Managing Director, BLS International.He added that a review of the current foreign exchange limits and taxes on forex transactions would further support this momentum by easing cash-flow pressures for travellers and service providers.From the marine tourism segment, Nautika underscored the need for easier permits and modern maritime infrastructure to unlock island tourism potential.“As an industry we’re expecting that the government adds more facilities so that people visit touristy destinations like islands more in 2026. The company supports laws that make it easier to get permits for high-end services and improve shipping infrastructure. Better ports, eco-friendly ship technology and easy movement between islands would not only aid tourists and operators but they would also help the economy grow and create jobs in the area,” said Anoop Kumar, Founder and Director, Nautika.He noted that more than 2.5 million passengers are served each year and that the segment is growing rapidly, adding that “rules and incentives that promote modern maritime services will help open up new tourism potential” and signal that India is serious about sustainable tourism-led growth.Overall, industry expectations from Union Budget 2026 centre on sustaining investments in tourism and transport infrastructure, improving connectivity and accessibility, easing financial and regulatory bottlenecks, and boosting consumer spending power—seen as critical to reviving inbound tourism and supporting the next phase of growth in India’s travel and tourism ecosystem.","Industry leaders look to the budget for support on infrastructure creation, connectivity and ease of doing business.

As the Budget 2026 approaches, the finance minister may not further tighten the fiscal stance in FY27, with Nuvama suggesting the government could choose to keep the deficit unchanged at the FY26 level.In its latest report, Nuvama said the Indian economy looks to be nearing a bottom, but added that momentum remains fragile. While tax cuts announced in 2025 have lifted consumption in certain areas, the firm said the impact may not translate into a broader demand revival, as spending cuts are expected to help the government meet its FY26 gross fiscal deficit (GFD) target of 4.4 per cent of GDP.Highlighting the need for policy support, the report stated, ""For FY27, monetary easing done so far must be complemented with fiscal support to enhance its effectiveness. Hence, while fiscal expansion is unlikely, we forecast the FM would refrain from further consolidation in FY27"".Nuvama expects that rather than moving towards deeper consolidation, the Budget could pause the tightening trajectory and maintain the fiscal deficit at 4.4% of GDP in FY27, the same level projected for FY26.To deliver stronger growth despite limited fiscal room, the report said the government may have to lean on large-scale disinvestments or push public sector undertakings (PSUs) to raise capital expenditure, which it noted has been subdued for several years.The report also flagged the possibility of non-fiscal measures to support growth. These could include deregulation, credit-guarantee schemes and initiatives to improve the ease of doing business. A credit guarantee scheme for microfinance institutions (MFIs), aimed at supporting low-income borrowers, may also be considered.From the market’s point of view, Nuvama said higher development spending and increased capex would be positive signals, but warned they may not be enough to arrest the earnings downgrade cycle. It added that margins could see mean reversion and external headwinds remain a key risk.Given these factors, the brokerage said it continues to maintain a defensive stance, while noting that any changes to capital gains taxation could shape market sentiment in the near term.Nuvama added that while FY26 priorities were tilted towards lifting consumption through tax rationalisation, FY27 could move towards encouraging investment through deregulation. It expects continued attention on sectors such as semiconductors, AI and robotics, and exports.Overall, the report said the FY27 Budget could be mildly supportive for growth, though the pace of recovery is likely to stay modest.","The union budget 2026 may maintain the fiscal deficit at 4.4% of gdp in fy27.

"How Union budget impacts common people: Salary, savings and prices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-union-budget-impacts-common-people-salary-savings-and-prices/articleshow/127265707.cms,"India To Grow 6 To 8% In Real Terms In Next 5 Years: Ashwini Vaishnaw At Davos

Every year on February 1, the whole of India has their eyes on the Union budget. Tax brackets, fund allocations, yearly review and many more subjects find the spotlight in the Parliament, and for all the right reasons. The Union Budget is more than just a government financial plan; it is a decision made that directly influences how much we earn, save and spend.Every year, millions of salaried individuals, small businesses and households watch the budget closely because even small policy adjustments can impact their daily expenses and long-term financial health.''Out of all the matters discussed, the most anticipated one remains the income tax. Changes in tax slabs, deductions, or exemptions directly affect the take-home salary of millions of employed individuals.Yearly incomes are divided into different slabs and have policies devised for exemption or inclusion in the tax bracket. If the government eases taxes or increases standard deductions, salaried employees may see higher net income.Contrarily, a new cess or surcharge can reduce disposable income.Budget announcements also influence job markets through incentives for industries, MSMEs and startups, potentially driving hiring and salary growth.This further drives the topic to the next segment, which is savings.The Union Budget often recalibrates rules around popular saving schemes such as PPF, NPS, SSY and fixed deposits. Revised interest rates, tax exemptions under Section 80C or NPS-related benefits can encourage individuals to save more.Apart from individuals, the capital markets also react sharply to budget announcements, influencing retail investors. Incentives for insurance, mutual funds or pension products can boost long-term financial planning for the middle class.However, this is for the long term planning. The Union budget, however have prospects that also influence the day-to-day expenditure and cost of living of Indians.Budget decisions affect daily expenses through changes in customs duties and subsidies.Cheaper imports can reduce the prices of electronics or consumer goods, while higher import duties or reduced subsidies may increase the cost of fuels, food items or essentials. Inflation-related measures—like increased MSP or food security spending—also shape household budgets.Additionally, allocations towards infrastructure, transport and housing can influence rental costs, urban mobility and overall living standards.For an average voter, the Union Budget determines how far their salary stretches, how much they can save for the future, and how expensive daily life becomes. Whether the government focuses on tax relief, welfare spending, or economic growth ultimately shapes the financial well-being of common people across India.","The union budget is more than just a government financial plan; it is a decision made that directly influences how much we earn, save and spend. Changes in tax slabs, deductions, or exemptions directly affect the take-home salary of millions of employed individuals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127265922,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-976597,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
Union Budget vs Interim Budget: Key differences – explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-vs-interim-budget-key-differences-explained/articleshow/127143777.cms,"What is an interim budget?



What an interim budget does – and doesn’t – do



An interim budget typically:



Seeks approval for essential government spending

Continues existing welfare schemes

Presents revised estimates for the current fiscal year

What it usually avoids:



Major changes in tax rates

New flagship programmes with long-term fiscal costs

Structural reforms in key sectors

The Union Budget: Where policy choices are made



Direct and indirect taxes

Capital expenditure allocations

Disinvestment and privatisation

Fiscal deficit targets

Sector-specific incentives

New Policy Initiatives

Reforms and structural changes

Why Budget 2026 matters



Analysts expect Budget 2026 to focus on three broad areas:

Fiscal discipline: A gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit without cutting back on growth-supporting spending

A gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit without cutting back on growth-supporting spending Infrastructure push: Continued investment in roads, railways, logistics and urban infrastructure

Continued investment in roads, railways, logistics and urban infrastructure Manufacturing and jobs: Support for sectors that can generate employment and attract global supply chains

Tax expectations



Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present Budget 2026 on January 1. Interestingly, after many years the Budget would be presented on a Sunday. This would be her ninth consecutive budgetary presentation, one short of matching the record of most presentations at 10 by former PM Morarji Desai.The Union Budget presented by the finance minister in Parliament sets the economic tone for the year ahead. But not every budget carries the same weight. Some are meant to maintain continuity; others are designed to drive change. As India prepares for the Union Budget 2026, the distinction between a full Union Budget and an interim budget becomes especially important.Unlike 2024, when the government presented an interim budget ahead of the general elections, the upcoming Budget 2026 will be a full-fledged budget. This provides the government both the political space and legislative authority to introduce reforms, recalibrate taxes and policy and outline a clear economic strategy.An interim budget is presented when a government is nearing the end of its term in the final year and elections are either scheduled or are imminent. Its purpose is only administrative – to seek Parliament’s approval in order to keep the country and regular expenditure running, until a new government takes charge.By convention, interim budgets are not expected to make any big policy decisions and announcements. Large tax changes, new long-term schemes or structural reforms are usually avoided. This restraint is meant to prevent an outgoing administration from tying the hands of its successor and also not to make it a political tool going into elections.This is why markets and investors tend to treat interim budgets as neutral events.A full Union Budget, presented by a government is the main instrument through which the government announces its economic priorities.This is where decisions are taken on:Historically, major economic shifts – from liberalisation measures to disinvestment/ privatisation – have been anchored in full Union Budgets.Budget 2026 will not be constrained by election-related conventions. That matters because India is at a critical point in its growth trajectory.Policymakers are increasingly focused on sustaining growth while managing fiscal consolidation. Public capital expenditure has emerged as a key driver, and the government has repeatedly signalled that it intends to maintain this momentum.Both fiscal and capex have been on an upwards trajectory in past multiple budgets. Capex has seen a significant rise in budgetary allocations year on year. Whereas fiscal consolidation targets set by the government have been met over the estimated targets.While taxpayers often hope for sweeping tax cuts, expectations for Budget 2026 are more measured. This time focus could be on simplification – rationalising slabs, easing compliance and widening the tax base – rather than sharp rate reductions.Economists argue that such an approach is more sustainable, especially as the government balances growth priorities with fiscal prudence.","The union budget presented by the finance minister in parliament sets the economic tone for the year ahead.

Budget 2026- How To Respond to the Global Trade War

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2026 at a time when the global economy is facing headwinds from the trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump. India has been levied with one of the steepest tariffs - 50% for its exports to the US. The implication of this decision is important since America is India’s largest trading partner.An India-US trade deal is still stuck in negotiations - the US wants India to stop buying crude oil from Russia, and it wants India to open up its agriculture and dairy sectors to American products. On both demands, India has maintained a firm stance - decisions on which country to procure crude from is about economics and strategic autonomy, and agriculture and dairy sectors have never been opened for access as part of trade deals.In this backdrop, Budget 2026 assumes significance - how will the Modi government insulate the Indian economy from the impact of Trump’s trade tariffs?India is among the world’s top 5 economies in nominal GDP terms and is on the road to become the third largest after the US and China in the coming years. It is also the world’s fastest growing major economy. With the world’s largest population, the importance of India as a market to sell in cannot be ignored.Importantly, India is largely a domestic demand driven growth story - a fact that somewhat insulates it from external headwinds. Dr DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor at EY says, “It (Indian economy) is in some sense insulated from the ongoing global uncertainties. India's strategy is to diversify its export destinations and become more competitive, so that for the domestic producers, there is cost competitiveness and scale offered through domestic demand over and above which they can export,” he tells TOI.But as it looks to step up its exports, the 50% tariffs from the US are a major impediment.India’s merchandise exports to the US fell 1.83% year-on-year to $6.88 billion in December 2025, while imports rose 7.57% to $4.03 billion, even as exports grew 9.75% during April–December.Despite a 50% US tariff on Indian goods from August 27, Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal has said exports remain on a positive growth path as both sides negotiate a bilateral trade agreement.As Rishi Shah, Partner and Economic Advisory Services Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat notes: Over the past few years, the Union Budget has played a constructive role in engineering an ecosystem for growth, with a decisive tilt toward productive public expenditure, balance-sheet repair and macro stability. This has allowed India to absorb repeated global shocks with relatively limited disruption.Economists surveyed by Times of India Online are of the view that India’s economic growth story is largely domestic driven, which largely insulates it from external headwinds and shocks. However, the exports facing sectors, which are bearing the brunt of the global trade war need relief. Steps to enhance export competitiveness and diversification of basket, customs duty rationalisation, along with relief for MSMEs are needed, feel experts.Most economists also stress the need for continued capital expenditure push while working to reduce fiscal deficit, and focus on job creation.Ranen Banerjee, Partner, Government Sector Leader at PwC India tells TOI, “There are sectors that have a higher exposure to externalities and some of them are labour intensive and many in the MSME segment. Given there cannot be a direct intervention to support them, the budget can look at bringing down their cost of doing business, cost of working capital and also help lay the foundations for competitiveness.”“This could be through higher allocations for the credit guarantee scheme, reducing compliance burdens and creation of common shared infrastructure/facilities that help them improve quality control, meeting export standards in the finished products. The short term pressures on employment in the job intensive sectors affected by global uncertainties could be supported by redirecting the labour to construction through continued higher allocations to capex and concessions to housing and property to spur housing demand,” he says.“Budget 2026 should aim to further boost consumption by following policies that would create jobs and lower the cost of living,” an economist at an industry body told TOI.The economist advocates boosting public investment, crowding in domestic and foreign private capital through investor facilitation, prioritizing affordable housing via a National Urban Planning Authority, and strengthening future-ready education and skilling to expand employment opportunities.Rishi Shah of Grant Thornton Bharat says that Budget 2026 should now return to first principles and reinforce the economy’s internal resilience.First, policy must focus on strengthening businesses by durably lowering the cost of doing business—not through protection, but via regulatory certainty, simpler compliance, faster dispute resolution and continued logistics efficiency gains. In a fragmented global trade environment, competitiveness will matter more than preferential market access, and these measures directly support both domestic activity and export viability.Second, public sector capital expenditure must remain elevated and well-targeted. Beyond its near-term demand impact, public capex expands productive capacity, alleviates infrastructure bottlenecks and improves private investment viability—especially when global financial conditions remain uneven.Third, the budget should sharpen its emphasis on innovation, quality standards and domestic value addition, particularly within manufacturing and MSMEs. Sustained growth will increasingly depend on India’s ability to move up the value chain rather than merely scale volumes.Finally, fiscal credibility remains a macro anchor. Improving expenditure efficiency while maintaining a transparent and credible deficit path is essential to preserve investor confidence and monetary-fiscal coordination. In combination, these priorities can help India de-risk growth from external volatility while laying the groundwork for durable economic transformation.The above four themes are also the broad recommendations of most economists that TOI Online spoke to.Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda notes that uncertainty relating to trade wars is likely to remain until a trade deal is signed and the content examined.“The Budget can buffer certain vulnerable sectors through measures to support the MSME segment. This group largely houses industries like garments, leather products, jewelry, handcrafts, auto parts etc, which are the ones which are susceptible to an impact due to the ongoing tariff regime pursued in the USA,” he advises.Radhika Rao, Executive Director and Senior Economist at DBS Bank is of the view that the centre might prioritise strategic sectors, which include defence, semiconductors, electronics, renewable energy, artificial intelligence/robotics etc.“Budget allocations towards the defence sector have targeted modernisation and expansion of the indigenous manufacturing capacity, with indications of a double-digit increase in the FY27 Budget. An uncertain geopolitical environment also increases the urgency to boost domestic procurement and strengthen the security apparatus. Development of new core technologies will also require a skilled workforce, which can benefit from industry and cross-country collaborations,” she tells TOI.Yuvika Singhal, Economist at QuantEco says that diversification in terms of products and geographics is the biggest insulation. “Friend shoring has emerged as a relevant underlying guiding principle for crafting trade deals that are mutually beneficial. In the past one-year India has successfully concluded trade deals with UK, EFTA, Oman & New Zealand. The icing on the cake would be the signing of the much awaited US-India trade deal. To expedite the conclusion of the same, it would perhaps become imperative for India to revamp its customs duty framework, including the non-trade barriers,” she tells TOI.“In this context, we expect the FY27 Union Budget to notify critical changes to the existing customs rate framework. This would be consistent with the long-standing demand for correcting the inverted duty structure in several manufacturing sectors and promotion of ease of doing business,” she adds.Rumki Majumdar, Economist at Deloitte India recommends that the policies need to be reoriented towards supply-side resilience. This can be done by easing compliance and expanding capacity. She tells TOI that the export market for India should be widened and deepened through effective FTA implementation.She says that public capex should be sustained with a focus on debt-to-GDP discipline to bolster competitiveness and insulate domestic demand.Sachchidanand Shukla - Group Chief Economist at Larsen & Toubro tells TOI, “Budget will do well to reiterate India’s thrust to insulate growth by continuing to lean on buttressing growth via improved quality of expenditure (maintaining focus on Infrastructure, adequate support to needy segments esp the ones hit by Tariffs), transparency (weeded out off-budget borrowings) and communicating the shift to debt/GDP with more clarity and better communication since debt will be the fiscal anchor as against fiscal deficit, which was relatively better understood as the annual operating target. ”“The idea of keeping debt on a declining path may not be as easy to understand or communicate and that may have implications for interest rates and the pricing of government securities,” he adds.Fiscal discipline with emphasis on capital expenditure is a common ask by economists. Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist and Executive Director at Anand Rathi Group, said Budget 2026 should sustain high government capital expenditure to ease infrastructure bottlenecks. Economic growth needs to be supported as global demand softens amid trade tensions.He adds that maintaining a credible fiscal consolidation path is essential to anchor investor confidence.DK Srivastava of EY India also talks of fiscal focus. “There would be some further rationalization on customs duty and there may be some reciprocal commodity by commodity decision that the government takes, but the budget will actually ensure that these growth drivers that have helped the Indian economy in FY 26 will continue to operate. The budget will emphasize continued fiscal consolidation and government capex demand to remain stable and supportive so the overall fiscal policy supports growth,” he says.",Budget 2026 assumes significance - how will the modi government insulate the indian economy from the impact of trump’s trade tariffs?

I hope this reform-oriented approach continues and gathers further momentum."" said Vineet Gupta, MD at Jamboree Education.Sumeet Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder, LEAD Group, said the focus must shift from access to classroom impact.“As digital learning becomes integral to school education, the real challenge lies in translating potential into consistent classroom impact,” Mehta said.He said Budget support for digital infrastructure and teacher upskilling was essential.“Rationalising GST on essential education inputs would make a meaningful difference, including removing the 18 per cent GST on paper used for textbooks and lowering the tax burden on digital learning tools,” he added.Vinu Warrier, Managing Partner and Founder, eduVelocity, said the sector expects structural reform rather than incremental funding.“Higher education—especially postgraduate and global pathways—has become increasingly out of reach for middle-income families,” Warrier said.“The expectation from this Budget is a student-centric financing model that combines affordable credit, income-linked repayment mechanisms and transparent scholarship disbursal,” he added.He said public spending should prioritise employability, completion and workforce readiness, with stronger public-private collaboration.","Education leaders and edtech executives call for higher and better-targeted allocations in budget 2026.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
