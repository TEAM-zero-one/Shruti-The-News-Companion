Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the central excise act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from rs 2,050 to rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks.

"Budget: Budget proposes 30% TDS on net winnings in online games, removes threshold for TDS levy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-proposes-30-tds-on-net-winnings-in-online-games-removes-threshold-for-tds-levy/articleshow/97527935.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

"Budget 2026: Biogas body IBA seeks Rs 10,000 cr subsidy fund; pitches higher support for CBG, organic manure",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-biogas-body-iba-seeks-rs-10000-cr-subsidy-fund-pitches-higher-support-for-cbg-organic-manure/articleshow/126464804.cms,"The Indian Biogas Association (IBA) has proposed the creation of a Rs 10,000 crore fund to provide capital subsidy to the biogas industry in the Union Budget 2026, calling for higher fiscal support to accelerate investment, improve project viability and scale up green energy adoption, PTI reported.In its Budget recommendations, the industry body urged the government to raise the capital subsidy for compressed biogas (CBG) plants by 50 per cent to Rs 6 crore per 4.8 tonnes per day (TPD) of capacity, and increase the upper cap to Rs 25 crore per project, from the current Rs 10 crore limit. At present, the scheme offers Rs 4 crore per 4.8 TPD of capacity.IBA said it will share these recommendations with the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy and the Ministry of Finance, adding that it has raised the demands at multiple forums ahead of the Budget.The association said the capex cost of CBG plants has risen by over 50 per cent since the launch of the Central Financial Assistance (CFA) scheme in 2014, necessitating a revision in subsidy norms. It proposed that the enhanced subsidy structure be supported by a minimum corpus of Rs 10,000 crore, enabling projects of up to 20 TPD capacity.For Budget 2026, IBA said the biogas and CBG sector should be positioned as a fast-maturing pillar of green growth, which now requires deeper fiscal support, faster implementation and easier access to finance to unlock private investment and rural income opportunities.The association also called for scaling up project incentives by raising CFA levels, and proposed a mandated blending of fermented organic manure (FOM) in fertiliser use — at least 5 per cent by 2028, rising to 10 per cent by 2030.Pointing to the government’s annual Rs 2 lakh crore chemical fertiliser subsidy, IBA said this contributes little to soil organic content. Redirecting even 10 per cent (Rs 20,000–25,000 crore) of this subsidy towards FOM-linked or carbon-based incentives could improve soil health, reduce import dependence and promote climate-smart agriculture, it said.The association noted that the current Rs 1,450 crore allocation over three years for Market Development Assistance (MDA) for organic manure from CBG plants is “abysmally low” and only a starting point, especially when compared with chemical fertiliser subsidies.In line with the compressed biogas blending obligation (CBO) under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, IBA suggested that the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers consider introducing a FOM–Chemical Fertilizer Blending Obligation (FCFBO) under an Organic–Chemical Fertilizer Blending Programme.The industry body also pushed for carbon monetisation through a Green Certificate mechanism, urging the government to allow biogas and CBG producers to sell carbon credits in domestic and international markets. It said this would help meet climate targets while opening new revenue streams for producers.Carbon credits in voluntary markets are valued at USD 5–50 per tonne of CO₂, and even at the lowest price, the carbon premium for CBG’s greenhouse gas mitigation could be Rs 10–12 per kg of methane produced, IBA said. With around 1,000 CBG plants expected by 2030, the market value of CBG-based green certificates could be about Rs 4,000 crore, it estimated.IBA also suggested introducing ‘cap and trade’ practices for carbon-intensive entities, and subsidising part of the proposed carbon pricing mechanism to help kick-start the system.","The indian biogas association (iba) has proposed the creation of a rs 10,000 crore fund to provide capital subsidy to the biogas industry in the union budget 2026.

"Budget 2026: Govt should avoid hiking surcharge on super-rich, reviving wealth tax; why experts warn of capital flight",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-govt-should-avoid-hiking-surcharge-on-super-rich-reviving-wealth-tax-why-experts-warn-of-capital-flight/articleshow/126463614.cms,"Risk of high earners relocating

Wealth tax seen as inefficient

Tax experts have cautioned the government against raising the income tax surcharge on high-income individuals or reintroducing a wealth tax in the Union Budget 2026-27, warning that such moves could push wealthy taxpayers to relocate to low-tax jurisdictions and hurt investment and job creation.At present, individuals earning over Rs 50 lakh are subject to a surcharge on income tax — 10 per cent on income between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore, 15 per cent for Rs 1–2 crore, and 25 per cent for Rs 2–5 crore. Those earning above Rs 5 crore pay a 25 per cent surcharge under the new tax regime, while the surcharge is 37 per cent under the old regime, PTI reported.According to estimates by independent economists, recent GST rate cuts and lower income tax collections could cost the exchequer around Rs 2 lakh crore in the current fiscal, prompting debate on whether additional revenue measures may be needed in FY27 for higher spending on defence and other priorities.PwC & Co LLP Partner Amit Rana said while the principle of taxation is based on vertical equity, excessively high taxes can be counterproductive.“We have a pretty good slab, wherein at the highest level you pay 42 per cent, at the lowest level you pay almost zero, even at reasonable income levels. But, when you start making it very prohibitive, you run the risk of high-income earners wanting not to be in India, and that is possible in the world today,” Rana told PTI.He added that high-income individuals play a key role in creating industries and generating jobs, making it essential to strike a careful balance in taxation.EY India Tax Partner Surabhi Marwah echoed similar concerns, saying high surcharges or a return of wealth tax could prompt high-net-worth individuals to move capital or residency abroad.“Tax uncertainty and steep effective rates may play a role in decisions around capital relocation and residency. Stability and predictability in the tax regime may be as important as the rates when the objective is to retain capital and talent,” she said.Marwah noted that wealth tax was abolished in 2015 as collections did not justify the administrative effort involved. She added that surcharges are generally viewed as more efficient and less litigious than asset-based taxes.“With the government now having access to robust data trails through GST, CRS agreements and other systems, policymakers may continue to see surcharge adjustments as a relatively simpler option compared to asset-based valuation regimes,” she said.Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co Partner Gouri Puri said higher tax rates could encourage capital flight and discourage entrepreneurship.“Capital flight is a genuine risk since mobile families can re-domicile to other jurisdictions with lower rates. There is always global competition to keep tax regimes investor-friendly, and harsher taxes in India may discourage investment and push capital away,” she said, adding that a wealth tax would also revive concerns over compliance costs and administrative complexity.Deloitte India Partner Alok Agrawal pointed out that the government had already reduced the highest surcharge from 37 per cent to 25 per cent in Budget 2023 for individuals earning above Rs 5 crore under the new tax regime, bringing down the maximum marginal tax rate from about 42.7 per cent to 39 per cent.“This applied from April 1, 2023, and was applicable only under the new tax regime. So, it seems unlikely that the government would hike this once again within a short span of three years,” he told PTI.On wealth tax, Agrawal said collections from such a levy have historically been small relative to the cost of administration.“The government’s focus has instead been on improving tax collections through more robust enforcement by leveraging technology and information-sharing with other countries,” he added.","Risk of high earners relocating to low-tax jurisdictions, tax experts say.

Budget 2026: CII pitches demand-led disinvestment plan; proposes four-step privatisation roadmap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-202627-cii-pitches-demand-led-disinvestment-plan-proposes-four-step-privatisation-roadmap/articleshow/126462077.cms,"AI image

The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) suggested a four-fold privatisation process in their recommendations on the Union Budget 2026-27. They called for faster and more predictable disinvestment.The industry body claimed that a calibrated privatisation approach would help sustain capital expenditure and fund development priorities, particularly in sectors where private participation can improve efficiency, technology adoption, and competitiveness.CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee highlighted the role of private enterprise in India’s growth. “A forward-looking privatisation policy, aligned with the vision of Viksit Bharat, will enable the government to focus on its core functions while empowering the private sector to accelerate industrial transformation and job creation,” he said, as quoted by ANI.To accelerate the government’s exit from non-strategic Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs), CII outlined a four-pronged strategy.First, CII recommended adopting a demand-led approach for selecting PSEs for privatisation. Contrary to short-listing entities and then checking the appetite for them, it was proposed that government needs to start by measuring market interest for a larger list of entities and short-list those with better interest and valuation.Second, the industry body called for announcing a rolling three-year privatisation pipeline in advance. According to CII, greater visibility would give investors time to plan, deepen participation, and improve price discovery.Third, CII proposed setting up a dedicated institutional mechanism to oversee privatisation. This would include a ministerial board for strategic direction, an advisory panel of industry and legal experts, and a professional execution team to handle due diligence, market engagement, and regulatory coordination.Fourth, acknowledging that complete privatisation is complex and time-consuming, CII suggested a calibrated disinvestment route as an interim measure. The government could initially reduce its stake in listed PSEs to 51 per cent, retaining management control, and later bring it down further to between 33 per cent and 26 per cent.CII estimated that lowering government ownership to 51 per cent in 78 listed PSEs could unlock nearly Rs 10 lakh crore. In the first two years, disinvestment in 55 PSEs could raise about Rs 4.6 lakh crore, followed by Rs 5.4 lakh crore from 23 additional enterprises.“A calibrated reduction of government stake balances strategic control with value creation,” Banerjee said, adding that the proceeds could fund healthcare, education, green infrastructure, and fiscal consolidation while maintaining control in strategic sectors.The Union Budget for 2026–27 will be presented on February 1.",The confederation of indian industry (cii) suggested a four-fold privatisation process in their recommendations on the union budget 2026-27.

The meeting also saw participation from the Governor of Manipur, chief ministers of Delhi, Goa, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Meghalaya and Sikkim, and deputy chief ministers of several states, including Telangana.Opposition-ruled states said the changes to the rural employment framework weaken the employment guarantee and go against the spirit of cooperative federalism.Parliament last month passed the VB-G RAM G Bill, replacing the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Under the new scheme, the Centre will bear 60 per cent of the cost and states 40 per cent, compared with the 90:10 funding pattern under MGNREGA.Punjab Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema strongly opposed the proposed changes, saying the new framework dilutes the employment guarantee while shifting a significant financial burden to states.“Proposed MGNREGA changes weaken employment guarantee and burden states,” Cheema said at the meeting, calling for the restoration of the original demand-driven structure and funding pattern of the scheme.Telangana Finance Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said the Union government had replaced MGNREGA with VB-G RAM G without consulting states. He noted that the shift from a 90:10 to 60:40 funding ratio would further strain state finances.He also pointed out that any additional man-days beyond the normative allocation would now have to be borne by states, which would create a serious obstacle in providing demand-based work to job seekers.“This is entirely against the spirit of cooperative federalism and starving them of funds for capital outlay, which is essential for maintaining growth momentum,” Vikramarka said.The Telangana finance minister also suggested that surcharges on income tax and corporation tax be credited to a non-lapsable infrastructure fund, from which states could receive grants for infrastructure development. Alternatively, he said, surcharges should be merged with basic tax rates to expand the divisible pool of central taxes.On GST reforms, Vikramarka said GST 2.0 may boost demand but questioned its sustainability, warning that states’ revenues could fall due to rate reductions. He called for a suitable mechanism to compensate states for any revenue loss.Punjab also sought a special fiscal package, citing the “double whammy” of border tensions and floods in 2025. On GST, Cheema said Punjab is facing an annual revenue loss of nearly Rs 6,000 crore following GST 2.0 and pressed for a predictable GST stabilisation or compensation mechanism for states.",Opposition-ruled states punjab and telangana sought additional fiscal support from the centre in the union budget 2026-27.

He also flagged constraints under the Urban Infrastructure Development Fund (UIDF), arguing that the current Rs 100 crore cap on project size was limiting execution of large urban projects, and proposed that the ceiling be raised to Rs 500 crore.Saini thanked the Centre for continuing the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment scheme and sought higher untied allocations for Haryana, along with relaxations in utilisation conditions, citing the state’s special requirements due to its location in the National Capital Region (NCR).He said the upcoming Budget would further pave the way for Haryana’s progress and reaffirmed the state’s commitment to contributing towards making India a developed nation by 2047.Highlighting Haryana’s agrarian profile, Saini said the state ranks second in the country in foodgrain production and is known as the breadbasket of India. He said around six lakh acres of land are affected by salinity and waterlogging, and sought central financial assistance to prevent further damage.He also underlined the need for modernising agriculture through digital agriculture, micro-irrigation, agri-logistics and value addition, adding that agri-processing clusters and MSMEs could become engines of rural prosperity.On the social sector, Saini said Haryana plans to open a medical college in every district, for which substantial support under centrally sponsored schemes would be required. He also sought higher assistance for social security pensions, noting that over 44 lakh people in the state receive such benefits.The chief minister said Haryana’s NCR region is being developed as a logistics hub, requiring higher central capital investment to improve connectivity and time-bound movement of goods.

The Resilience Gap: Why Household Security Matters Now

(First Revised Estimate)

India’s Impending Challenge: Ageing with Dignity

From Reform to Execution: Making Policy Work for Households

(Sumit Madan is Managing Director and CEO, Axis Max Life Insurance)

The Union Budget 2026 arrives at a defining juncture of India’s ascent, where progress must be measured not merely by the velocity of our growth, but by the resilience of the nation’s foundation. Over the past few decades, India has undergone a historic transformation, scaling from a $1 trillion economy to a global powerhouse through massive, sustained investments in physical and digital infrastructure. Yet, as the nation targets the $5 trillion milestone and beyond, we must recognize that swift economic expansion without robust household financial security is inherently fragile. As India enters this next chapter of growth, life insurance must be positioned as a national priority and a strategic pillar that transforms prosperity into permanence and shields the aspirations of a billion-plus people from the headwinds of uncertainty.For a ""Viksit Bharat"" to endure, national success must be measured by the financial resilience of Indian families. However, recent data signals a dual vulnerability where according to the Economic Survey 2024-25, India’s gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP fell from 31.2% in 2021-22 to 30.2% in 2022-23. This decline in savings is mirrored by a stagnation in financial protection, leaving households exposed.This downward shift is more than just a statistic, and signals an impending vulnerability in the nation's financial foundation. To address this, the Union Budget 2026 must serve as a critical demand-side engine to rebuild this foundation through a two-pronged fiscal strategy. First, to bolster overall household savings, a comprehensive overhaul of Sections 80C, 80CCC, and 80CCD is required, featuring higher, inflation-indexed limits.As it stands, India’s total sum assured as a percentage of GDP stands at just 24%, a stark contrast to Singapore (332%) or Malaysia (153%). Consequently, India’s protection gap remains the highest in the region at 83%, compared to just 55% in Singapore.Hence, to specifically bridge this protection gap, the government should introduce a dedicated tax deduction for pure term insurance premiums, independent of the current ₹1.5 lakh limit of Section 80C. By establishing an exclusive incentive similar to Section 80D’s treatment of health insurance, the Budget can elevate life protection from a discretionary expense to a fundamental pillar of financial planning, ensuring a secure household base for a developed India.Despite rising disposable incomes, a significant share of Indian households, especially those dependent on a single breadwinner, remains one income shock or medical emergency away from financial distress. The need for reform is made more urgent by a looming demographic shift: India is set to age faster than it grows rich. By 2050, one in five Indians will be over the age of 60, yet retirement preparedness continues to lag behind aspiration.Addressing India's impending demographic and financial challenges requires moving beyond fragmented, legacy frameworks. The Union Budget 2026 should create a dedicated tax bucket for annuities and pension products, recognizing retirement planning as a non-negotiable social necessity. Crucially, this reform must create parity with the National Pension System (NPS), ensuring that all pension-linked instruments benefit from a level playing field to encourage long-term disciplined saving.Central to this overhaul should be the inclusion of annuities under Section 10(10D) as tax-exempt instruments. Currently, Section 10(10D) explicitly excludes retirement payouts, treating annuity income as taxable at the individual’s slab rate, which creates a significant deterrent to retirement security. Granting tax-free status to these payouts will ensure protection remains meaningful in an evolving economy. By aligning the annuity tax treatment, India’s financial architecture can evolve into a credible social security platform, shifting life insurance from a discretionary purchase to an essential safety net.To deliver these targeted solutions at scale, the regulatory framework must undergo a commensurate evolution. The government’s recognition of life insurance as an essential service under the GST framework is a progressive measure that serves as a vital precursor to the sector's overarching reform. This fiscal alignment effectively anchors the Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha Bill 2025, which has already established the strategic direction for universal coverage. To translate this vision into impact, the upcoming Union Budget 2026 must now provide a concrete execution roadmap, formalizing the transition toward 100% FDI while ensuring robust governance remains paramount.Furthermore, there is significant anticipation for a clear roadmap regarding Composite Licensing. By enabling a ""one-stop-shop"" model integrating life and health insurance, the industry can lower distribution costs and simplify the consumer journey, fostering a more holistic protection ecosystem for all Indians.Today, it is time to recognize life insurance as a vital fiscal stabilizer, with the Union Budget 2026 representing an opportunity to institutionalize financial security as a national priority. Together, policymakers and the industry can ensure that by 2047, every Indian household stands protected.","For a ""viksit bharat"" to endure, national success must be measured by the financial resilience of indian families.

Easier compliance and rationalisation of withholding taxes:

Tax policy levers to support growth and high-technology manufacturing:

Addressing the mounting burden of

tax litigation

:

The Income-tax Act, 2025, which is slated to come into force from 1 April 2026, is the product of an extensive consultative exercise, involving a Parliamentary Committee, wide-ranging stakeholder representations, and detailed deliberations before its eventual enactment. Against this backdrop, it would ordinarily be expected that the forthcoming Budget would refrain from proposing substantive changes to direct tax law, particularly to a statute that is yet to be operationalised. Any premature tinkering with the framework risks diluting the objective of introducing a clean-slate, simplified legislation. It is the concerns around tax administration and implementation that need to be addressed, emphasisesAccording to him, policy expectations can broadly be classified into four baskets.One of the most pressing areas requiring attention is simplification of compliance, particularly in the area of tax deduction at source (TDS). The current regime prescribes multiple rates across numerous sections, creating significant interpretational challenges.Litigation frequently arises around the applicable rate, classification of payments, and procedural lapses—often without any underlying revenue loss. There is a strong case for rationalising TDS rates into two or three broad buckets.For example: One rate for salary income, one uniform rate for most non-salary payments and a separate, higher rate for exceptional categories such as lottery winnings or similar windfall incomes. Such rationalisation would dramatically reduce compliance complexity.“Large taxpayers today maintain sizeable teams merely to manage withholding tax compliance and litigation risk. Simplifying TDS rates would lower compliance costs, reduce disputes, and free up productive resources, without materially impacting revenue collection,” he emphasises.India has articulated a clear ambition to position itself as a global hub for high-technology manufacturing, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and advanced electronics. These sectors are capital-intensive and R&D-heavy, requiring sustained investment in research and innovation.At present, however, India offers no meaningful tax incentive for research and development expenditure. This stands in contrast to many competing jurisdictions that actively use tax policy to attract cutting-edge innovation.“The Budget presents an opportunity to re-examine whether targeted R&D incentives—designed carefully to avoid misuse—can be reintroduced or recalibrated, particularly for sunrise sectors critical to India’s long-term competitiveness. This assumes added significance in light of the evolving global mobility landscape. A number of highly skilled Indian professionals, particularly in science and technology, may consider returning to India due to constraints around work visas such as the H-1B in the United States. Creating a robust domestic ecosystem for research and innovation, supported by sensible tax incentives, could help India productively absorb this talent,” states Kanabar.Kanabar points out that prolonged litigation has an adverse fall out for both taxpayers and the government. The Revenue is deprived of its dues, beyond the standard 20% pre-deposit, for several years.Taxpayers carry prolonged contingent liabilities, affecting cash flows, balance sheets, and business decisions—even in cases where additions may ultimately not survive. India’s experience with tax dispute resolution schemes has been largely positive. Schemes introduced in the past, including those rolled out in 2020 and revisited in 2024, witnessed significant participation and resulted in meaningful revenue mobilisation and dispute reduction. “There is a strong case for re-imagining a comprehensive dispute resolution framework, both for direct taxes and for indirect taxes, particularly customs, where litigation has accumulated over decades. A well-designed scheme can unclog the appellate system, provide certainty to taxpayers, and deliver immediate fiscal benefits to the exchequer,” he states.Tax administration and respect for taxpayer sentiment: Lastly Kanabar points out that the Budget must reinforce the principle that tax administration should be facilitative, not adversarial. Concerns around indiscriminate issuance of notices, mechanical reopening of assessments, and lack of accountability continue to affect taxpayer confidence. While faceless processes have reduced some friction, they have also introduced new challenges relating to responsiveness, proportionality, and application of mind. What is required is not another layer of legislation, but administrative sensitivity. An approach that recognises that taxpayers are partners in nation-building and that certainty, fairness, and predictability are integral to ease of doing business, he sums up.","The income-tax act, 2025, is slated to come into force from 1 april 2026.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Latest income tax slabs fy 2025-26: under old tax regime: 5% tax applies on earnings between rs 2,50,001 and rs 5,00,000. 20% tax rate for income range of £5,000 to £10,000: earnings exceeding rs 10,000 are taxed at 30%.
