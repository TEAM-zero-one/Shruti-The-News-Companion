NEW DELHI: With Congress set to launch a protest against the VB-G RAM G scheme, which replaced the UPA-era MGNREGA, the rural development ministry has sent a detailed report on the new scheme to all central ministers which they can refer to in public meetings to counter the opposition.TOI has learnt that in the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had briefed ministers about the key features of VB-G RAM G and how it’s better than that of previous rural employment guarantee programme. PM Narendra Modi had also asked ministers to be fully conversant with the provisions of the new scheme.Ministers will highlight the increase of guaranteed 125 days employment under the new scheme compared to the provision of earlier 100 days and creation of durable assets beyond a narrow emphasis on wage expenditure. They will also highlight how the scheme will create stronger local livelihood opportunities to help mitigate distress-driven migration.To counter the opposition charge, ministers have been informed that under normative funding, the central govt allocates funds to states based on predefined norms, ensuring predictability, fiscal discipline, and better budgetary planning. In contrast, demand-driven models often lead to uncertain allocations and fiscal misalignment.","Congress set to launch a protest against the vb-g ram g scheme.

As the New Year’s fireworks fade over the Burj Khalifa, UAE residents aren't just waking up to a new calendar, they are waking up to a new way of living. January 1, 2026, marks the launch of a major ""regulatory reset"" across the Emirates.Whether it’s what you find in your takeaway bag or how long your kids stay in school on a Friday, the country is getting a significant upgrade. Here are the top five changes you need to know to stay ahead of the curve.This is the second major phase of the nationwide environmental push. Starting January 1, 2026, the UAE is banning an expanded range of single-use plastic items, including beverage cups and lids, cutlery (spoons, forks, knives, chopsticks), plates, straws, stirrers, and food containers or boxes made of Styrofoam. The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) through Ministerial Decision No. 380 of 2022.The ban applies to the import, manufacture, and trade of these items. If a product is made of conventional plastic (not plant-based or recycled), it is prohibited.Businesses found violating this ban face a starting fine of AED 2,000. This amount can be doubled for repeat offenses within the same year, up to a maximum of AED 10,000.To avoid these fines, residents and businesses should switch to reusable alternatives or plant-based (PLA) products, which remain exempt.Starting the first week of January 2026, the timing for Friday Jumu'ah prayers and school dismissals is changing nationwide to accommodate the standardized 12:45 PM prayer time. The General Authority for Islamic Affairs, Awqaf, and Zakat announced the prayer shift, and the KHDA (Knowledge and Human Development Authority) confirmed the specific Dubai school changes.In Dubai, all private schools must finish the school day by 11:30 AM on Fridays starting January 9, 2026. This allows students and staff enough time to reach mosques before the 12:45 PM sermon begins. Schools for older students (Grade 6/Year 7 and above) may offer online learning options for Fridays, provided they get KHDA approval.While there are no direct ""fines"" for parents, schools that fail to comply with these dismissal times risk regulatory action and warnings from education authorities for non-compliance with the national academic calendar and student wellbeing guidelines.New updates to the Tax Procedures Law take effect on January 1, 2026, introducing a strict ""use it or lose it"" rule for tax refunds and a much longer window for the government to audit suspected tax evaders. The Ministry of Finance through Federal Decree-Laws No. 16 and 17 of 2025 announced.Businesses and individuals can no longer carry forward overpaid VAT or credit balances indefinitely. You must claim your refund within 5 years from the end of the tax period, or the right to that money expires. Additionally, the Federal Tax Authority (FTA) can now audit cases of suspected tax evasion for up to 15 years, a massive increase from the previous 5-year limit.Failure to conduct ""due diligence"" on your suppliers can lead to the denial of VAT recovery if that supplier is found to be part of an evasion chain. Furthermore, natural persons (freelancers/sole traders) with a turnover exceeding AED 1 million who fail to register for Corporate Tax face an administrative penalty of AED 10,000.The deadline for individual social media influencers and content creators to obtain a professional permit is January 31, 2026. This applies to anyone who accepts payment (cash or gifts) to promote brands or services on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.Influencers must apply for an ""individual"" permit to legally conduct advertising activities. This move aims to professionalize the industry and ensure that advertisements are clearly disclosed to the public.Operating without a valid permit after the deadline can result in a fine of AED 10,000. In some cases, the influencer's social media accounts may be suspended or their business license revoked. To stay safe, you should apply for the permit through the UAE Media Council's official portal before the end of the month.The Ministry of Finance via Cabinet Decision No. 197 of 2025 announced that sweetened beverages are being taxed is shifting from a flat rate to a tiered system based on sugar content. Beginning January 1, 2026, the more sugar a drink contains per 100ml, the higher the tax (and price) will be.The Details: High-sugar drinks (8g or more per 100ml) will be taxed at AED 1.10 per liter, while moderate-sugar drinks (5g to 7.99g) will be taxed at AED 0.79 per liter. Drinks with less than 5g of sugar or those using only artificial sweeteners will be taxed at 0%.Manufacturers and importers who fail to provide required lab reports for their products will see their drinks automatically classified into the highest tax tier. Additionally, businesses failing to register for excise tax or file returns correctly face standard administrative penalties, which typically start at AED 10,000 for late registration.January 2026 brings smart, people-friendly changes across taxes, environment, workplace, and travel. Many rules help make life greener and more efficient, but they come with clear compliance requirements and fines if ignored.",Uae introduces new rules starting january 2026.

Flying India to the UAE? Two new airline launch could make tickets cheaper,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/flying-india-to-the-uae-two-new-airline-launch-could-make-tickets-cheaper/articleshow/126212860.cms,"Two new airlines enter busy India–UAE routes / AI Generated Image





New Airlines: Al Hind Air and. FlyExpress

Al Hind Air (The ""Gulf-First"" Bridge): Backed by the massive Alhind Group (a Kerala-based travel giant with 130+ global branches), this airline is the one to watch for the UAE expat community. Operating from a Kochi hub, they will start with domestic flights in South India before launching direct international routes to Dubai, Sharjah, and Abu Dhabi in late 2026 using Airbus A320neo jets.



Because they already handle visas and labor recruitment, expect ""all-in-one"" bundles where your flight, insurance, and airport transfers are packaged together for a much lower total cost.

Because they already handle visas and labor recruitment, expect ""all-in-one"" bundles where your flight, insurance, and airport transfers are packaged together for a much lower total cost. FlyExpress (The Regional Specialist): While Al Hind focuses on the South, FlyExpress is emerging as a ""stealth"" player from Hyderabad targeting Central and Western India. This is the best choice for travelers whose hometowns lack a major international hub. By focusing on regional ""on-time"" performance and direct links to smaller cities, they aim to cut hours off your total door-to-door travel time.



They plan to use a ""Combi"" model, carrying both passengers and heavy cargo, to subsidize ticket prices. Their goal is to connect Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities that currently require long bus or train rides from major airports.

Role of Navi Mumbai Airport





Routes





Prices, and discounts

Bank Partnerships: Many UAE banks (like Mashreq, ADCB, and Emirates NBD) are offering 10% to 15% instant discounts when booking through portals like Cleartrip or directly on airline apps.

App-Exclusive Codes: Use codes like ""FLYAI"" or ""HIT"" on the Air India Express and Akasa apps for up to 25% off base fares.

Navi Mumbai Launch Offers: Check for specific promotional fares when selecting the Navi Mumbai airport code; these are often AED 100–200 cheaper than flights to the main Mumbai terminal.





Travel between the UAE and India is set to become easier and more competitive, as new airlines and expanded routes enter one of the world’s busiest aviation corridors. With millions of Indian expatriates living in the UAE, and strong demand from tourists, students, and business travellers, airlines are racing to add capacity and attract passengers with better schedules and pricing.Recent aviation approvals and route expansions signal a clear shift: more flight options, more departure cities, and increasing fare competition between low-cost and full-service carriers.As the UAE-India travel corridor hits record demand, two new airlines, Al Hind Air and FlyExpress, have officially received their government approvals (NOCs) to begin operations in 2026. While both aim to lower fares and increase competition, they are targeting very different types of travelers.""Our goal is to make air travel as accessible as a road trip for the Indian diaspora in the UAE,"" stated a spokesperson for the Alhind Group during the NOC announcement. ""By increasing competition, we are ensuring that the traveler always gets the best price.""If you have ever dreaded the traffic at Mumbai’s main airport, 2026 offers a fresh alternative. The Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is now fully operational.Airlines like Akasa Air and Air India Express have shifted many of their UAE operations here to avoid the congestion of the old terminal.For travelers, this is a strategic win. NMIA is much closer for those heading toward Pune or the expanding business districts of New Mumbai. Because it is a new facility, many airlines are currently offering ""launch fares"" to encourage passengers to switch their landing spot from the main Mumbai (BOM) terminal to NMIA.The expansion isn't just about more planes; it’s about better routes. Air India Express has reached a massive milestone of 100 aircraft, allowing them to launch non-stop flights from Abu Dhabi to Pune and Delhi multiple times a week.Similarly, Akasa Air is rapidly expanding its footprint in the UAE, with new services from Sharjah targeting the Northern Emirates. These direct routes mean less time spent in layovers and more time with family. Most of these new flights are scheduled during the ""golden hours"", early morning or late night, to ensure you reach your destination by the start of the business day.To make the most of these changes, you need to know when to book and what to pay. Here is the current market breakdown for early 2026:Shankh Air and Al Hind Air are targeting a full domestic rollout in Q1 2026, with international UAE-India routes expected to pick up pace by the second half of the year. Thanks to the ""seat explosion,"" one-way fares from Dubai to Delhi or Mumbai have stabilized. You can currently find tickets starting as low as AED 350 to AED 450 on budget carriers if booked 3–4 weeks in advance.How to get discounts:For both Indian and UAE audiences, the message is clear: more airline options are coming, but smart planning still matters. The expansion of routes and entry of new airlines should improve connectivity and choice, but demand on the UAE–India corridor remains strong year-round.Travellers who stay alert to new route launches, book early, and remain flexible with airports and travel dates are best positioned to benefit from competitive fares as the market continues to open up.","Two new airlines, al hind air and flyexpress, have officially received their government approvals (nocs) to begin operations in 2026.

Enhancing Affordability of Social and Rural Insurance through Stamp Duty Reforms

As India charts its economic course for the coming year, the insurance sector remains a key pillar in household financial planning and risk mitigation. Recent regulatory efforts and initiatives have supported sectoral growth, yet broad measures of insurance engagement show there is still significant ground to cover. According to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s annual report, India’s overall insurance penetration stood at 3.7 percent of GDP in FY24, with life insurance coverage at 2.8 percent. This level remains below the global average of over 7 percent. As per a PwC India report on insurance inclusion, in rural India, where around 65 percent of the population resides, less than 10 percent of people have life insurance coverage.These insights serve as a reminder that despite progress, access to financial protection is still limited for large sections of the population. With this context, the upcoming Budget offers an opportunity to strengthen policy support. My recommendations below aim to enhance customer outcomes, improve long term savings participation, and support national goals of financial inclusion and resilience.India’s pension ecosystem continues to face a significant coverage gap.While the National Pension System and other formal pension schemes continue to expand, India's formal pension coverage remains below 25% of the workforce according to the Mercer-CFA Institute Global Pension Index 2025. The report ranks the country 45th out of 47 nations for pension adequacy. Life insurance annuity products and the National Pension System both aim to support retirement income, yet their tax treatment differs considerably.Insurance annuity payouts are taxed on the full amount, including the principal that has already been taxed during the earning years. NPS subscribers, on the other hand, receive additional deductions for self-contribution and employer contribution. This difference in treatment often influences consumer decisions more than product suitability.A more aligned and tax efficient framework across financial products, for example taxing only the returns on annuity payouts and extending comparable deductions to insurance annuity pension products, would allow individuals to choose based on their long term needs rather than tax benefits. Such alignment would encourage more Indians to build structured retirement plans.Over the last few years, high-value traditional insurance policies have received different treatment. For example, for all policies whose annual aggregate premium is higher than Rs. 5 lakh, the maturity proceeds are now taxed at regular income tax rates. These policies, which provide significant life cover in addition to disciplined wealth accumulation, started to be considered less attractive when compared to other alternatives of investment.Meanwhile, high-value Unit Linked insurance policies, whose annual aggregate premium is higher than Rs. 2.5 lakh premium get long-term capital gains treatment, usually more generous and tax efficient. Therefore, introducing similar tax treatment of capital gain on high-value traditional insurance policies as well and bringing both to the same tax treatment would create consistency, simplify the tax code, and encourage more people-particularly business owners, double-income families, and senior professionals to combine protection with savings.As insurance companies strive to meet rural coverage requirements, affordability becomes crucial. Even modest transaction costs such as stamp duty can influence pricing for low ticket products. Exempting rural and social sector policies from stamp duty, similar to the exemption already provided under PMJJBY, would help improve affordability and support deeper penetration.Life insurance can play an important role in shaping India’s long-term financial resilience. While the sector has made progress in expanding access and adapting to changing customer needs, data shows that penetration and coverage gaps persist. Thoughtful policy changes in the upcoming budget can support a more efficient, equitable, and inclusive insurance ecosystem.In the end, financial security should not remain a privilege of a few but be strengthened as a shared foundation for every household.","India’s pension ecosystem continues to face a significant coverage gap.

Amarpal Chadha shares a checklist:

Verify Deductions and Exemptions: Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim

Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim Identify Discrepancies: Compare the return filed with Form 16, bank statements, investment proofs, and other records to spot any discrepancies.

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): The Income Tax Department is stepping up scrutiny for tax returns and income tax refund claims and many taxpayers are getting alerts to check their exemption and deduction claims. The last date to file income tax returns for FY 2024-25 was pushed to September 15, 2025 this year since the tax department took time to release forms and update the portal. However, the last date to file an updated or belated return for the current assessment year remains December 31, 2025.Several taxpayers are also facing delays in their returns and refunds being processed. Ahead of the important deadline, the Income Tax Department has issued a clarification on why some taxpayers are getting alerts to review their ITRs.The Income Tax Department has said that in the ongoing financial year 2025–26, over 21 lakh taxpayers have already updated their ITRs for AYs 2021–22 to 2024–25 and paid more than ₹2,500 crore in taxes. Also, over 15 lakh ITRs have been revised for the current assessment year.In a press release, the Income Tax Department has said that some taxpayers have claimed ‘ineligible’ refunds - through the deductions and exemptions route.This has led to their income being underreported.“Under the risk management framework, and through the use of advanced data analytics, cases for Assessment Year (AY) 2025–26 have been identified,” the Income Tax Department said.The tax department on its part is ‘nudging’ taxpayers to update their tax returns in case there is some discrepancy in the deductions and exemptions.Identified taxpayers are being sent SMS and email under the government’s “Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (NUDGE)” campaign. The aim is to encourage these taxpayers to correct errors in tax return filing, ahead of the December 31, 2025 deadline.“This initiative reflects a trust-first approach to tax administration, under which taxpayers are provided an opportunity to review their Income-tax Returns (ITRs) and voluntarily correct any ineligible claims, wherever required,” the tax department said.“The campaign leverages data analytics and technology to enable a transparent, non-intrusive, and taxpayer-centric compliance environment, with an emphasis on guidance and voluntary compliance,” the department adds.The tax department has advised the concerned taxpayers to “review their ITRs, verify the correctness of their deduction and exemption claims, and revise their returns, if required, within the prescribed time by 31 December 2025, so as to avoid further enquiries in the matter.”Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India explains that the NUDGE campaign is an initiative of the Income Tax Department aimed at encouraging taxpayers to voluntarily review deduction or exemption claims that have been identified as potentially ineligible through data analytics.The Department is also leveraging global information-exchange frameworks such as the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), Common Reporting Standards (CRS), and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) to identify possible discrepancies in foreign asset reporting, Chadha told TOI.Under the tax department’s initiative, taxpayers may receive an email or SMS explaining the reason for the communication and advising them to verify the accuracy of deductions or exemptions claimed, as well as the correctness of foreign asset disclosures. Where a taxpayer believes that corrective action is required, a revised return may be filed on or before December 31, 2025, which is the deadline for filing updated income tax returns for FY 2024-25Tanu Gupta, Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP has a clear message: In principle, all those exemptions and deductions which are not genuine are likely to come under scrutiny.“Even those deductions and exemptions which are inconsistent with the income tax department's records/information/data, may also come under scrutiny. The most sought-after deduction/exemption currently includes ""Donation to Political Parties"", ""House Rent Allowance"" to name a few,” she told TOI.According to Amarpal Chadha, any deduction that is claimed for donations to political parties where an incorrect or invalid PAN of the donee has been provided may come under the Income Tax Department’s scrutiny.The tax department has said that there are also cases where the taxpayers have given incorrect or invalid PAN details. Other cases pertain to the extent of deductions and exemptions that are being claimed by the taxpayers.“In addition, any deduction or exemption claimed in the income-tax return over and above what is reflected in Form 16 such as HRA exemption, exemptions under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), gratuity exemption etc. are also under tax department’s radar,” he told TOI.Tanu Gupta recommends that for all the claims including exemptions and deductions, the taxpayer should always keep in handy the following documents: receipts / invoices of the payments for which exemption / deduction is claimed, bank statement evidencing such payment through proper banking channels, receipts from the recipient to corroborate with such payments.These are broad guidelines for the documents which the taxpayer should anyway keep on files for a good financial housekeeping, she says.Is there a need for panic? No, says Tanu Gupta. “Instead, the taxpayer needs to revisit their claims of exemptions and deductions in the return and take action accordingly viz file the revised return if needed. As the name suggests, the abbreviation and the complete name of it (Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable), it is to facilitate the taxpayer to file compliant tax returns voluntarily, with correct, justified and genuine claims of deductions/exemptions,” she tells TOI.“There are cases where the taxpayers have received the communication from the department, although they believe that they do not have any inconsistency for the claims made in the return. They only need to see if they have all supporting documents for such payments to submit to the tax authorities when asked for,” explains Tanu Gupta, adding that wherever such exemptions / deductions are not authentic, the taxpayer needs to immediately revise the tax return by reversing such claims in the returns; and pay due income tax along with interest.If any claim or reporting needs correction, file a revised return within the prescribed timeline currently on or before December 31, 2025, he says.“However, if the taxpayer believes that the exemptions or deductions claimed are accurate and valid, they may wait for further communication from the Income Tax Department,” he adds.It is important to restate here that taxpayers do not have to worry where their tax claims are genuine.The Income Tax Department has clarified that taxpayers whose claims are genuine and correctly made in accordance with law are not required to take any further action.“It is clarified that taxpayers who do not avail of this opportunity may still file an updated return from 1 January 2026, as permitted under law, subject to payment of additional tax liability,” it has said.","The income tax department is stepping up scrutiny for tax returns and income tax refund claims. Many taxpayers are getting alerts to check their exemption and deduction claims.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday proposed to impose a 30 per cent tax on net winnings from online gaming and also do away with the existing threshold limit of Rs 10,000.The Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on online gaming -- levy of 30 per cent on payment of net winnings in a financial year and removal of the current Rs 10,000 threshold for the levy of TDS.In case the amount is not withdrawn from user account, tax shall be deducted at source at the end of the financial year.Speaking to reporters after the Budget, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the tax would be on net winnings on the aggregate value.""When you take out the money from the winning accumulated pool, the withholding tax would be levied on that,"" Malhotra said.The other change in the TDS provision for online gaming was removing the Rs 10,000 threshold.Malhotra said the move came after it came to the notice of the tax department that some online gaming companies were keeping the winning amount lower than the threshold so that they are not covered under the TDS provision.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sudin Sabnis said online gaming has assumed gigantic proportions in India with revenue of Indian mobile gaming industry expected to reach $5 billion by 2025 and has been a subject matter of intense government scrutiny in the recent past from GST and Income Tax perspective.""The Budget seeks to introduce a withholding tax on entire net winnings of any such user of online gaming platform. The gaming industry would need to revamp its strategy as these provisions along with ongoing discussions in GST Council could impact the user psyche similar to taxation of crypto currencies introduced in the last Budget,"" Sabnis said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said two new sections have been proposed with respect to online gaming Section 115BBJ to tax such proceeds at 30 per cent and Section 194BA providing TDS on net winnings in the user account at the end of the financial year.""Additionally, certain definitions have been provided such as computer resource', 'internet', 'online game', 'online gaming intermediary', 'user', 'user account' in order to avoid ambiguity,"" Maheshwari said.","Budget 2023-24 proposed to introduce two new provisions for tax deducted at source (tds) on online gaming.

Budget 2026: Introduction of optional joint taxation for married couples can be a game changer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-introduction-of-optional-joint-taxation-for-married-couples-can-be-a-game-changer/articleshow/126155653.cms,"ICAI proposes that married couples be given the option to file a single, joint return. (AI image)

What is the proposal about?

Why ICAI recommends joint taxation

It simplifies tax compliance and household filing. Joint filing could reduce paperwork and make it easier for couples to manage their tax affairs together.

It could relieve tax burden for many households — especially those with a single earning member. Under joint taxation, the exemption thresholds and effective liability could be more favourable.

It aligns India with global practices. Many countries – such as the US and some European countries (such as Germany, Spain, Portugal) allow joint filing or joint assessment for married couples.

How joint taxation might work (proposed model)

Tax slabs (for joint filers) might be restructured. For example, one proposed model sets no tax up to ₹6 lakh (for the couple), 5% for ₹6–14 lakh, and ascending slabs for higher income.

Standard deductions (for salaried earners), exemptions and surcharge thresholds may be adjusted — e.g. increased surcharge threshold, separate standard deductions for both spouses if salaried.

The option to choose — i.e., couples could opt to file jointly only if it benefits them; otherwise, they’d continue filing individually, retaining flexibility.

What needs careful design — and possible concerns

System-level overhaul required: Current tax filing, TDS/TCS, PAN-based tracking systems are designed for individuals. Joint filing may require re-designing data architecture, reconciliations, challans, and return-processing.

Current tax filing, TDS/TCS, PAN-based tracking systems are designed for individuals. Joint filing may require re-designing data architecture, reconciliations, challans, and return-processing. Risk of revenue leakage or misuse: If exemption limits and deductions are doubled or significantly enhanced for couples, there could be a potential for tax avoidance through income-shifting, especially in households with skewed income distribution.

If exemption limits and deductions are doubled or significantly enhanced for couples, there could be a potential for tax avoidance through income-shifting, especially in households with skewed income distribution. Complexity with deductions & exemptions: Handling categories like house-property income, home-loan interest, investments under 80C, medical insurance deduction, etc., for two individuals in one return would require clear guidelines — especially because current laws treat individuals separately.

Handling categories like house-property income, home-loan interest, investments under 80C, medical insurance deduction, etc., for two individuals in one return would require clear guidelines — especially because current laws treat individuals separately. Fairness to dual-income couples: For couples where both work, joint taxation may not offer much advantage — or could even increase tax liability if their combined income pushes them into higher slabs. The optional nature would allow couples to choose the regime that’s most beneficial.

What could this mean for Indian households — a few scenarios

Household type



Possible benefits under joint taxation



Single-earner couple (spouse unemployed / homemaker)



Lower tax liability — combined exemption could reduce tax burden; simpler ITR filing and compliance.



Dual-earner couple with modest incomes



Could benefit from higher basic exemption + standard deductions; might still pay less than two separate returns depending on slab thresholds.



High-income dual-earner couple



Possibly limited benefit: combined income might push into higher slab — need careful evaluation.



Families with children, home-loan, medical expenses



Joint filing could allow better optimization of deductions (standard deduction, 80C, 80D, housing benefit) if structured well.





Why this proposal matters — beyond tax savings

It recognises a household as a unit — acknowledging that many expenses (household, children, assets) are shared, so taxing couples as a unit can make tax treatment more equitable.

It simplifies tax compliance — fewer returns to file, less paperwork, consolidated records, which is especially beneficial for small earners or nuclear families.

It aligns India with global practices — many economies allow joint filing, and this could modernise India’s tax code for contemporary family structures.

It could increase compliance and reduce evasion — by discouraging income splitting and spreading income artificially across family members to reduce taxes.

Conclusion

Pre-budget suggestions are pouring in, in the North Block. As the government gears up to present the 2026 budget, one proposal stands out for its potential impact on millions of households: optional joint taxation for married couples. It has been suggested by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and if adopted by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), it could mark a significant shift in how personal income tax is structured — and how families plan their finances.Currently, under the Indian tax system, every individual — married or not — is taxed separately. Each spouse must file their own income tax return, even if they have shared income or joint expensesICAI proposes that married couples be given the option to file a single, joint return — combining their incomes and deductions — instead of two separate ones. In other words: a married couple could choose what makes financial sense for them each year — file individually, or jointly.According to ICAI’s submission:The couple would file a single consolidated Income tax return (ITR) under the joint-filing option.The idea is attractive, but implementing joint taxation in India isn’t just a technical tweak. There are challenges to consider:The proposal for optional joint taxation of married couples — as submitted by ICAI in its pre-Budget 2026-27 memorandum — represents a potential paradigm shift in India’s personal tax framework.It seeks not just to ease compliance, but to recognise households (not just individuals) as fundamental economic units.For many Indian families — especially those with a single earner, homemaker spouse, children, home-loan or shared expenses — this could translate into lighter tax burden, improved financial well-being, and simpler tax compliance. On the policy side, it could bring India a step closer to global practices and make the tax system more equitable, transparent, and modern.","Icai proposes that married couples be given the option to file a single, joint return.

By Parizad Sirwalla

Budget 2025 income tax: In the run up to the Budget 2025, individual taxpayers were eagerly looking forward to favorable tax reforms. The FM seems to have brought some cheer to them through her proposals.Recognizing the contributions of the middle class and with an objective to eventually phase out the old tax regime, various changes have been introduced in the new tax regime. The basic exemption limit has been increased from INR 3 lakhs to INR 4 lakhs. In a significant shift, the highest slab is increased from INR 15 lakhs to 24 lakhs. The other slabs and tax rates have been realigned and a new tax rate of 25% has been included. Income threshold for rebate under 87A available to resident taxpayers has been increased from INR 7 lakhs to INR 12 lakhs. For computing this threshold, special rate income (such as capital gains, lottery winnings etc.) has been specifically excluded, to also address certain ambiguities in the earlier interpretation.With these changes, all the taxpayers in the new tax regime have some reason to celebrate, irrespective of income levels.As an illustration, a person with income up to 12 lakhs can now enjoy annual tax savings of INR 80,000 (excluding cess). At the same time, an individual with income of 18 lakhs has a tax savings upto INR 110,000 (excluding cess). The savings would be higher for income levels where surcharge is applicable.Few amendments have been made with a view to simplify certain provisions. Earlier, in case of vacant properties, annual income could be considered as NIL for up to two self-occupied properties (SOP). While there is no change in above, to qualify as SOP, currently there is a condition that the taxpayer should not be able to reside therein due to his business or employment or profession and that taxpayer is staying in a premises not owned by him. This condition has now been done away with.NPS Vatsalya Scheme launched in September 2024, enabled parents and guardians to start a NPS for their minor children, which on attaining majority, would be transferred to the child's name with the accumulated corpus. As a welcome measure, the Budget has extended the deduction of INR 50,000 under section 80CCD (available in the old tax regime) to also include contributions towards this scheme. Further, it has been specified that partial withdrawals up to 25 per cent from the scheme, allowed for specified reasons, shall not be taxable.Currently, a deduction is allowed to an individual for any amount deposited in the National Saving Scheme (NSS), prior to 1 April 1992. Any withdrawals from the scheme are held as taxable. As a notification dated 29 August 2024 specified that the balances would not earn interest, this made the depositors keen to withdraw the NSS balance. Based on various representations received, the FM has now exempted the withdrawals done post 29 August 2024, for which deduction was allowed earlier, to provide them the much-required relief.Striking a balance between fiscal prudence and the theme of “Trust first, Scrutinize later”, the Government has enhanced timelines for filing updated returns by two more years by paying additional taxes of 60 and 70 percent respectively. This will help boost tax revenues through voluntary compliance.Consistency and clarity has been provided in the taxability of redemption proceeds of all un-exempted ULIPs, by including them in the definition of equity - oriented fund, which was earlier only with respect to certain unexempted ULIPs.There has been a rationalization of the various TCS/ TDS thresholds including on remittances under Liberalized remittance scheme (from INR 700,000 to INR 10,00,000 and NIL in the case of remittance for education financed by a specified loans) and interest income for senior citizens (from existing INR 50,000 to INR 100,000). This will positively impact their cash flows.The higher TDS is proposed to be continued on assesses having invalid PAN/ non-PAN holders. However, it is proposed to remove the higher TDS/TCS on non-filers of return of income with an attempt for ease of doing business and reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers.The FM has also promised to table the much-awaited New Income Tax Bill which aims at simplicity and reduced litigation, in the next week. All in all, the Budget endeavors to take steps to reinforce confidence and optimism in the taxpayers.","Income threshold for rebate under 87a available to resident taxpayers has been increased from inr 7 lakhs to inr 12 lakhs.

'Budget's given comfort to monetary authority': Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budgets-given-comfort-to-monetary-authority-finance-secretary-tuhin-kanta-pandey/articleshow/117995724.cms,"In an interview to TOI,

Pandey, who is also in charge of the revenue department, said

Do you think the Budget has done enough to help accelerate growth against the backdrop of global uncertainties?

Is the time right for

monetary authorities to play a part in accelerating growth, for example with a rate cut?

So, has the Budget created conditions for a rate cut?

Is the tax relief largely to boost consumption and address some of the concerns of the middle class?

Have other levers of economy got required attention, apart from consumption and investment?

When do you expect I-T bill to be presented in Parliament? How will it make life of the taxpayer simple?

Finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the 2025-26 Budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation.the Budget has enabled all levers of growth to accelerate. Excepts:It is a pro-growth Budget. We have headwinds and we also have internal challenges. We have addressed both. Although, we are still the fastest growing large economy in the world, not only we have to maintain this growth, but we have to push it up. We have addressed both the supply-side and demand-side and tried in a non inflationary way to maximise growth, accelerate growth.I think it's up to the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to take a call on that. But, on the fiscal side, we have done our bit. We have kept the promise of fiscal consolidation. FM had announced that it will be 4.9% in this year and we have been able to achieve 4.8%. FM had said fiscal consolidation path will mean we'll bring it to 4.5% next year. We are proposing 4.4% and there was also an announcement that thereafter we will have a glide path in terms of the debt-to-GDP level and a visibility would be given on how it will go forward.That has also been included in the FRBM statement.In a way, the Budget has provided whatever stimulations are required. We are not providing a stimulus at the cost of the deficit by increasing the deficit. So, we are giving sufficient sort of comfort to the monetary authority. However, they would have to take a call based on whatever.I would say consumption is one part. However, we are not really prescribing how taxpayers, who have got this money back in a way, how they will behave. Basically, the decision making is transferred to taxpayers, who have got this relief. They may choose to consume, save or invest directly in either of the three situations we have. It will have a salutary and good effect on the economy because if they choose to consume, it will boost demand. If they choose to invest indirectly, they are supporting the banks to extend more credit. Because, banks can give credit only when they have got increased deposits. And, if they choose to directly invest, for example in a house, they also participate in investments. In that case, it will work like an investment multiplier anyway. So, it will be a combination of consumption and investment multiplier, with a positive impact on savings. Overall, I would say it will be a growth-booster.A large economy like India has to have all engines firing. You cannot simply say we will only go for agriculture, not for manufacturing. Or, we will go for manufacturing and not for services. Therefore all three are required. If you see all the proposals on supply side, we have tried to see how we can speed up production, how we can speed up productivity and how we can spur employment. So, it is employment-led growth. In agriculture, we have taken steps to boost pulses productivity and increase credit limit for farmers. Everywhere we have said how we can boost production and productivity. We are saying let there be a growth path for MSMEs. Let there be more credit available for MSMEs. Let their participation in exports be more. Let there be more support for them in terms of innovation and research. Our tax policy is supporting labour intensive sectors.It is proposed to be done before Feb 13. We are not changing the policy through it. The same thing will be carried forward because after passing, this bill will be applicable from a future date. We wanted to reform right away. So, those reforms have been brought in this bill through amendments. There are so many redundant provisions. There are a number of changes. More than 4,000 changes have happened since 1962, when this act was enacted. In 63 years, the finance sector changed, plus there were many taxation laws and amendment bills. Things get complicated to read and they may also create interpretation problems. There could be many interpretation problems or litigations. If you have more readability, if you have clarity, there will be less litigation.","Finance secretary tuhin kanta pandey said the 2025-26 budget has tried to push growth in a non-inflationary manner and has kept the promise of fiscal consolidation.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/latest-income-tax-slabs-2025-26-how-much-tax-do-individuals-earning-slightly-above-rs-12-lakh-have-to-pay-marginal-relief-calculations-explained/articleshow/117911656.cms,"Budget 2025 income tax: The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs. 12,75,000/-.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

GST reforms on the cards?

More tax relief coming soon? The Narendra Modi government, having provided substantial relief in personal income tax and customs tariff rationalisation in the Union Budget 2025, is now expected to initiate efforts to streamline the goods and services tax (GST) framework for easier implementation and adherence, according to officials.The primary objective will be to restructure the tax slabs to ensure meaningful outcomes, they indicated.The GST structure comprises four slabs-5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, with special rates for certain items like precious metals and additional cess on sin goods.The 5% slab currently covers 21% of GST items, whilst 12% applies to 19%, 18% to 44%, and 28% to 3% of items.According to an ET report, the government intends to discuss simplification and rationalisation with the group of ministers (GoM) tasked with reviewing rates, according to a source close to the discussions.The source noted that whilst the GoM has primarily concentrated on slab adjustments for goods, a comprehensive simplification requires fundamental restructuring of the current system.The GST Council established the GoM for rate rationalisation in September 2021. Despite numerous meetings, the GoM has not yet presented its final recommendations.Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The GoM is considering proposals including elimination of dual rates for items like pens and sunglasses based on price thresholds.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget 2025 speech announced that there will be NIL or zero income tax for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh. But did you know that for salaried individuals, the tax-free annual income can reach Rs 13.7 lakh, compared to Rs 12 lakh for others!“I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000,” FM Sitharaman announced in her Union Budget speech.This advantage of no tax till Rs 13.7 lakh income stems from the Rs 75,000 standard deduction and National Pension System (NPS) investments. Section 80CCD(2) allows tax deduction of up to 14% of basic salary invested in NPS, whilst the old tax regime offers 10%.According to an ET analysis, a salaried individual with Rs 13.7 lakh yearly income can achieve tax savings of approximately Rs 96,000 through NPS contributions. It’s important to note that this benefit requires employer participation in NPS as part of cost to the company, as employees cannot opt independently.It’s interesting to note that despite this opportunity existing for nearly a decade, only 2.2 million individuals have enrolled.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime.
