"ITAT rules in Shah Rukh favour, quashes reassessment process",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/itat-rules-in-shah-rukh-favour-quashes-reassessment-process/articleshow/118810677.cms,"Shahrukh Khan

MUMBAI: Superstar Shah Rukh Khan secured a significant victory as the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) ruled in his favour, quashing reassessment proceedings and order initiated by the tax authorities for the 2011-12 financial year.Against an income of Rs 83.42 crore declared by the actor in his income-tax (I-T) return, the tax officer denied his claims for foreign tax credit (for taxes paid in the UK) and reassessed the income as Rs 84.17 crore. Such reassessment was done beyond four years from the end of the relevant assessment year (2012-13).The ITAT bench held that reassessment of the case by the income-tax department was not legally justified, marking a crucial win for the actor in his prolonged battle over foreign tax credit claims.The litigation related to taxation of Khan's remuneration for the movie 'RA One.' As per the agreement between the actor and Red Chillies Entertainments (a film production and distribution company founded by Khan), 70% of the film's shooting was to take place in the UK and therefore 70% of the income would accrue overseas (which would be subject to UK tax including withholding tax). The actor's remuneration, in this regard, was routed through Winford Production, a UK entity. Tax authorities contended that such an arrangement of payment, caused a revenue loss to India. The I-T officer denied the actor's claim for foreign tax credit, that was made in his original I-T return.An Indian resident taxpayer is subject to tax in India on his/her global income. In simple terms, foreign tax credit provisions contained in tax treaties, enable an Indian taxpayer to deduct tax paid in the foreign country from his India tax liability. This prevents double taxation of the same income.In a detailed order, the ITAT bench composed of Sandeep Singh Karhail and Girish Agrawal, ruled that the reassessment proceedings were invalid. The tribunal noted that the assessing officer had failed to demonstrate any fresh tangible material warranting a reassessment beyond the four-year statutory period. It further observed that the disputed issue had already been examined during the initial scrutiny assessment of the case.Citing multiple judicial precedents, the tribunal emphasised that reassessment under Section 147 can be done after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year, only if certain conditions were met. For instance, if the income had escaped assessment due to taxpayer's failure to file an I-T return, or respond to a notice. Or, if the tax taxpayer had failed to fully and truly disclose all material facts during the original assessment. The tribunal found no evidence of such failure on Khan's part.The ITAT bench concluded that the re-assessment proceedings were bad in law on more than one count and were not in conformity with the provisions of Section 147, and quashed the same. Tax experts believe that the judgment strengthens the position of Indian taxpayers with overseas earnings, reaffirming that reassessments cannot be arbitrarily initiated without sufficient grounds.","Shah rukh khan secured a significant victory as the income tax appellate tribunal (itat) ruled in his favour. The litigation related to taxation of khan's remuneration for the movie 'ra one' as per the agreement between the actor and red chillies entertainments (a film production and distribution company founded by khan), 70% of the film's shooting was to take place in the uk.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118810746,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-20544,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Mufti Shah Mir , accused of helping Pakistan's ISI in kidnapping Indian businessman and former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav from Iran, was shot dead on Friday night by unidentified gunmen in Turbat, Balochistan Mir, known to be involved in human trafficking , was leaving the local mosque after Taraweeh (night) prayers when bikers ambushed him and shot him multiple times at point-blank range. According to a report in Dawn, Mir was immediately shifted to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.Mir, a human and arms trafficker, operated under the cover of a mufti (scholar) and was a member of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, an Islamic fundamentalist political party.Sources said he was an important conduit linked with ISI-led death squads and played a significant role in the abduction and extrajudicial killing of numerous Baloch youths. He was also instrumental in spreading religious extremism in Balochistan.In March 2016, Jadhav was abducted by a group led by Mullah Omar Irani of Jaish al-Adl from the Iran-Pakistan border and handed over to the Pakistan army through several intermediaries, including Mir. Irani was also killed, along with his two sons, in the same area (Turbat) in Nov 2020, allegedly by ISI.Mir is also suspected to have been gunned down by ISI operatives in what is believed to be an internal conflict that has been brewing for some time. Last week, two others of JUI-F -- Wadera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah -- were shot dead by bike-borne assailants in what the local police described as targeted killings. The security guard of one also sustained bullet injuries. Mir had also survived two attempts on his life last year and had recently restricted his movements. ""He was providing intelligence about Baloch fighters to the Pak army. In 2023, a teacher named Abdul Rauf was murdered over alleged blasphemy in Turbat. The killing was carried out on the instructions of Mir,"" a source informed.Jadhav, who was running a business in Chabahar (Iran) after a premature retirement from the Navy, was abducted and incarcerated on false charges in Pakistan. He was intercepted in the Chaman area of Balochistan on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on March 3, 2016. In April 2017, a Pakistani military court sentenced Jadhav to death, charging him with involvement in espionage and sabotage activities. India condemned the verdict as a premeditated murder. The International Court of Justice stayed the execution while asking the Pakistan government to review the conviction process besides grant consular access to India.","Mufti shah mir, accused of helping pakistan's isi in kidnapping indian businessman and former indian navy officer kulbhushan jadhav from iran, was shot dead on friday night.

India hints at tariff liberalisation



April 2 deadline

Ongoing talks

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump have agreed to advance negotiations on the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), ANI reported on Saturday citing sources. The development comes on the same day when foreign secretary Vikram Misri hinted that New Delhi might be considering liberalising tariffs.This mutually beneficial agreement, finalised in February 2025, aims to boost market access, reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and enhance supply chain integration.To achieve the goals of the agreement, both leaders have decided to appoint senior representatives to accelerate negotiations, enhance trade relations and foster economic cooperation, the sources revealed.The BTA is expected to impact various sectors, including goods and services. By increasing market access and reducing barriers, the agreement will facilitate smoother trade flows and create new opportunities for businesses on both sides.A day after Trump claimed that India had agreed to bring down tariffs, foreign secretary Vikram Misri refused to comment on the US president's remark. He, however, added that India in recent years had signed several trade pacts with partners based on tariff liberalisation.""There’s a lot of interest in statements coming out of the United States. I will not get into that at this point of time because these are ongoing discussions… But I would only point you towards the fact that we have in recent times entered into bilateral trade agreements which are based on tariff liberalisation with several partners,"" he said.""There are ongoing discussions with several other partners on these issues now. I think the ongoing discussions should be seen in that context. That is our general approach and it applies to any such engagement we have,” he added.Sources indicate that India is optimistic about resolving the tariff issue with the US in the coming weeks, ideally before the April 2 deadline.This was reflected in the MEA's response on the same, which said, ""Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.""India has already lowered its average applied tariffs for major developed nations, including Australia, UAE, Switzerland, and Norway, under recently concluded trade agreements.A delegation, led by commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal , had visited Washington from March 3 to 6, for discussions with the US counterpart on the trade agreement. The talks were part of a broader initiative to expand bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, with a focus on key sectors such as energy, defense, and technology.""Commerce and industry minister (Piyush Goyal) was in US and met his counterparts. Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said on Friday.","Prime minister narendra modi and us president donald trump have agreed to advance negotiations on the bilateral trade agreement.

NEW DELHI: The Nationalist Congress Party (SP) leader Rohini Khadse has made a unique demand on the occasion of women's day - immunity to commit one murder. The demand, however, comes in the context of rising crimes against women across the nation.In a letter addressed to President Droupadi Murmu, Khadse begins with an apology and goes on to list out the reasons behind her demand.Citing the World Population Review survey which ranked India as the most unsafe country for women in Asia, Khadse said, ""In light of this, we, on behalf of all women, make a request—grant us permission for one murder. We seek to eliminate the mindset that enables atrocities, the mentality that fuels sexual violence, and the ineffective law enforcement system that fails to protect us.""She further cited examples of warriors who took up weapons to defend themselves and said, ""Honorable President, when their kingdoms and people were in danger, Maharani Tarabai and Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar took up swords to defend them. So why should we, in our fight for social reform, remain silent?""""Our country is known as the land of Mahatma Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi, both great symbols of peace and non-violence. However, with due respect, I seek forgiveness while making this appeal, as the matter is of utmost importance…Today, women in the country are highly unsafe.

The report documented 4,45,256 cases of crimes against women in 2022, equating to around 51 FIRs filed every hour.

His remark Friday that India has agreed to ""cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done"" drew criticism from opposition which accused Modi govt of acting under pressure from Trump.Govt sources recalled that, during the first Trump administration, discussions took place about a limited trade deal between the two nations. ""For various reasons, it did not produce an outcome. Since discussions have just begun, it would be premature to talk about its details,"" said a source, adding there's also a context for each dimension, that would reflect the interests of both sides.""It would be recalled that India has reduced its average applied tariffs significantly for key developed countries like Australia, UAE, Switzerland, Norway, etc, under the recently concluded mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreements. Similar negotiations are currently under way with European Union and UK, among other partners. The ongoing discussions with the US should be seen in this context,"" he said.In February 2025, India and the US agreed to negotiate the first tranche of a mutually beneficial deal. Modi and Trump agreed to designate representatives to advance negotiations.""They were to work towards increasing market access, reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers and deepening supply chain integration. Accordingly, an Indian delegation led by the commerce and industry minister visited Washington from 3-6 March 2025,"" said another official.""It engaged the US commerce secretary, the US trade representative and their teams.

: New Delhi is close to having Tahawwur Rana , a former Pakistani Army doctor and 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack accused, brought to justice after US Supreme Court Associate Justice Elena Kagan rejected his emergency application on Thursday to stay his extradition to India .Rana's attorneys immediately bumped up the application to Chief Justice John Roberts, likely the last court of appeal, with little possibility of reprieve after President Trump personally assured his extradition during Prime Minister Modi 's visit to Washington DC last month and the State Department signed off on handing him over to Indian authorities.On Thursday, Rana played the religion and health card, citing possible religious persecution and torture in India on account of his Muslim faith, besides serious medical condition, to forestall the extradition, which he argued through attorneys would be a ""de facto death sentence. "" But Justice Kagan, who serves as the Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit which had earlier upheld the extradition, rejected his ""Emergency Application for Stay Pending Litigation of Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.""“Application…denied by Justice Kagan,” the US SC website said in a terse announcement, without elaborating.Rana has fought the extradition for almost four years purportedly with help from the Pakistani establishment loath to give up one of their own because of the precedent it would set. But the state department has already signed off on handing him over to India, and New Delhi has already made arrangements to take him into custody and fly him back to face justice for one of the most egregious terrorist attacks on Indian soil that also claimed the lives of 26 foreign nationals, including six Americans.","Tahawwur rana is a former pakistani army doctor and 26/11 mumbai terrorist attack accused.

NEW DELHI: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Friday said that the "" boundary question "" and specific differences between India and China must not dictate the bilateral relations between the two countries.While addressing his annual press conference in Beijing, Yi said that Indo-China relations made positive strides over the past year after the successful meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at Kazan in Russia.""As two ancient civilisations, we have enough wisdom and capability to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas pending a fair and reasonable solution to the boundary issue,"" Yi said.""We should never allow bilateral relations to be defined by the boundary question or specific differences to affect the overall picture of our bilateral ties. China believes that as the largest neighbours, both countries should be partners in each other's success,"" he added.The Chinese foreign minister said that the Xi and PM Modi provided strategic guidance for the improvement of ties at the Kazan meetingAfter this, both sides earnestly followed through on the important common understanding of the leaders, ""strengthened exchanges and practical cooperation at all levels and achieved a series of positive outcomes"", he added.This comes months after India and China completed the contentious disengagement process in Depsang and Demchok in Eastern Ladakh, bringing to an end the 54-month-old military standoff in the area, a giant step towards normalisation of bilateral tie.After the finalisation of the pact, Modi and Xi held talks in Kazan on October 23. In the meeting, the two sides decided to revive the various dialogue mechanisms.After that, national security advisor Ajit Doval and Wang held the 23rd Special Representatives (SR) dialogue in Beijing on December 18.On January 26, foreign secretary Vikram Misri travelled to the Chinese capital and held talks with his Chinese counterpart Sun Weidong under the framework of the 'Foreign seccretary-vice minister' mechanism.'We have the responsibility to take the lead'On the ongoing tariff war with US, Wang said that as important members of Global South, India and China must put up joint opposition against hegemonism and power politics""""A cooperative partnership between the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for both sides.

Trump insists there was 'no clash' between Elon Musk and Marco Rubio over DOGE cuts

A high-stakes White House meeting erupted into a showdown between Elon Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio , exposing deep rifts within the Trump administration over the billionaire’s sweeping government overhaul .According to a report by the New York Times, the tensions had been simmering for weeks, but they exploded in the Cabinet Room, where President Trump presided over a heated exchange between Musk and top officials. Rubio, long frustrated by Musk’s aggressive cost-cutting measures , pushed back hard when Musk accused him of failing to downsize his department.“You have fired nobody,” Musk scoffed, pointing out that the State Department remained bloated. Rubio fired back, reminding Musk of the 1,500 State Department officials who had taken buyouts. The billionaire was unimpressed.As the argument escalated, Trump, who had been watching with folded arms, finally intervened, reported New York Times. “Marco’s doing a great job,” he said, signaling a shift. While Trump had championed Musk’s efficiency crusade, the president now emphasized the need for a more measured approach.Trump announced a recalibration: Cabinet secretaries would take charge, with Musk’s team merely advising. The move was the first significant sign that Trump was willing to place limits on Musk’s influence.The meeting’s impact was immediate. Cabinet officials, many of whom had privately complained about Musk’s aggressive tactics, saw it as a turning point. The shift signaled that Trump was listening to concerns, particularly regarding layoffs affecting key constituencies, including veterans.Yet Musk’s influence remains formidable. His financial backing of Trump’s campaign and his grip on social media have left officials wary of crossing him. After the meeting, Trump posted that future cuts would be made with a “scalpel, not a hatchet,” a clear rebuke of Musk’s scorched-earth strategy.Musk later called the meeting “productive,” but inside the room, his frustration was evident. The battle for control over the administration’s cost-cutting efforts is far from over. While Trump has drawn a line, Musk is unlikely to retreat quietly. The question now is whether this uneasy truce will hold—or if another Cabinet clash is just around the corner.President Donald Trump, however, denied reports of the clash in a press meeting. ""There was no clash. I was there. Elon gets along great with Marco and they both are doing a fantastic job,"" he said.","High-stakes white house meeting erupted into a showdown between elon musk and secretary of state marco rubio.

Who was Brad Sigmon? First US prisoner executed by firing squad in 15 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-was-brad-sigmon-first-us-prisoner-executed-by-firing-squad-in-15-years/articleshow/118797457.cms,"Picture source: The Guardian

Brad Sigmon death: South Carolina man executed by firing squad

Who Was Brad Sigmon?

Sigmon killed David and Gladys Larke, his ex-girlfriend’s parents, with a baseball bat in their Greenville County home in 2001.

He planned to kidnap his ex-girlfriend, Becky Barbare, and then kill both her and himself



On the night of the murders, he had been smoking crack cocaine and drinking. He told a friend he would “get Becky for leaving him” and “tie her parents up,” according to court records.

He was sentenced to death in 2002.

Sigmon was the oldest of the 46 inmates executed in South Carolina since the death penalty resumed in the US in 1976.

Brad Sigmon , a South Carolina man, was executed by firing squad on Friday, becoming the first US prisoner in 15 years to be put to death by this method.Three volunteer prison staff members fired rifles to execute Brad Sigmon, 67, who was later pronounced dead.Sigmon opted for the firing squad over the electric chair or lethal injection. According to news agency Associated Press, his lawyers argued that he feared the electric chair would ""cook him alive"" and that a lethal injection of pentobarbital could cause fluid and blood to rush into his lungs, effectively drowning him.South Carolina keeps the details of its lethal injection method confidential. Sigmon had requested the state Supreme Court to halt his execution on Thursday, arguing against this secrecy, but his appeal was denied.The firing squad has a long and violent history in the US and worldwide. It has been used to punish mutineers and deserters in military forces, as a form of frontier justice in the American Old West, and as a tool of terror and political repression in the former Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.","Brad sigmon, 67, killed his ex-girlfriend's parents with a baseball bat in 2001.

Errol Musk on having child with Elon: 'Any woman with a slight brain would be mad to say no',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/errol-musk-on-having-child-with-elon-any-woman-with-slight-brain-would-be-mad-to-say-no-ashley-st-clair/articleshow/118807869.cms,"Errol on St. Clair: ‘A little crazy’ or the opportunity of a lifetime?

No clarifications, just more speculation

Errol’s contradictions: Defending Elon while taking shots at his exes

Errol Musk , never one to hold back, has weighed in on the swirling controversy surrounding Ashley St. Clair’s claim that she secretly gave birth to Elon Musk ’s 13th child. While making it abundantly clear that he has no insider knowledge, Errol still had plenty to say—dropping his usual mix of blunt opinions and offbeat musings.Sitting in his sprawling South African home, surrounded by chaotic domesticity, Errol made no effort to soften his words about the 26-year-old right-wing influencer. “I would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with Elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said during an interview with the Daily Mail. “If it turns out not to be true, she would be a little crazy, don’t you think?”But in the next breath, his tone shifted. “Any woman with a slight brain would be mad to turn down the opportunity if she were to be offered a child with Elon,” he said as quoted by the Daily Mail, an eyebrow-raising remark that seemed both a backhanded compliment and a subtle dig at St. Clair’s credibility.Despite his sharp words, Errol refused to take a definitive stance on whether St. Clair was telling the truth. When pressed, he simply let his earlier statements hang in the air, leaving the speculation to simmer.His comments stand in contrast to his past critiques of Elon as a father. Just weeks ago, Errol publicly accused his billionaire son of being a neglectful parent, particularly in the wake of the tragic loss of Elon’s first child, Nevada, in 2002. But in this latest conversation, his tone seemed more conciliatory.Though Errol has often been openly critical of Elon, he appears to have drawn the line at St. Clair’s allegations. In fact, his words hinted at an uncharacteristic moment of defense for his son. “I think Elon is a good father. He is trying to be,” he said. “No one sets out to be a bad father. It’s very difficult.”Yet, true to form, his defenses often come with a sting. When the subject turned to Elon’s other exes—particularly Grimes—Errol was less forgiving. “She is nice, an attractive girl in some ways... She is a little nuts,” he quipped, before attributing the couple’s children’s “very weird” names solely to the musician. “It’s not Elon’s work. He was trying to make her happy.”","Errol musk has weighed in on the controversy surrounding ashley st. clair’s claim that she secretly gave birth to elon musk ’s 13th child. “i would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said during an interview with the daily mail.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118808243,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1449611,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
