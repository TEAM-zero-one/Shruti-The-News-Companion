"'US did it, why can't Pakistan?': Indian envoy demands Hafiz Saeed's extradition",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-did-it-why-cant-pakistan-indian-envoy-demands-hafiz-saeeds-extradition/articleshow/121280078.cms,"Hafiz Saeed (File photo)

NEW DELHI: India's ambassador to Israel, JP Singh, has said that Operation Sindoor , launched in response to crossborder terrorism from Pakistan, is only ""paused"" and ""not over"".In an interview with Israeli news channel i24, Singh called for the formation of a global coalition against terrorism and drew parallel with the example of Tahawwur Rana 's extradition by US. Indian envoy demanded that Pakistan should also hand over key terror figures, including LeT chief Hafiz Saeed , Sajid Mir, and Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi.Recounting the events leading up to the operation, Singh referred to the April 22 Pahalgam attack, in which 26 civilians were killed after being targeted based on their religion. He said India's response was focused specifically on terrorist groups and their infrastructure within Pakistan.However, he added that Pakistan responded by attacking Indian military installations.""The terrorists killed people based on their religion,"" Singh said. ""India's operation was against terror groups and their infrastructure to which Pakistan responded by attacking India's military installations.""When asked if the ceasefire signalled an end to the conflict, Singh responded that the operation had only been paused. ""The ceasefire is still holding on but we have made it very clear that Operation Sindoor is paused, it's not yet over,"" he said. ""Wherever terrorists are, we have to kill those terrorists and we have to destroy their infrastructure.""Singh described the Indian airstrike on Pakistan’s Nur Khan base on May 10 as a game changer. He claimed the strike caused panic in Pakistan and prompted its Director General of Military Operations to reach out to India seeking a ceasefire.On the issue of the Indus Waters Treaty , which Pakistan has described as an act of war, Singh said that India could no longer uphold a treaty based on goodwill and friendship while facing constant terrorist attacks from across the border. He pointed out that although India continued to allow water to flow to Pakistan, the latter allowed terror to flow in the opposite direction. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s view that ""blood and water cannot flow together"" reflected the public's growing frustration, which led to the suspension of the treaty.""Terror must stop,"" Singh said, stressing that any treaty could only function if Pakistan ended its support for terrorism. He added, ""While IWT is in abeyance, another IWT is operational - Operation Sindoor is India's War Against Terrorism.""Singh named Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad as the two core groups behind the long list of terror attacks in India and said their leaders continue to roam freely in Pakistan. He said Pakistan could defuse tensions simply by handing over the key individuals India has long demanded.""They need to do a very simple thing - when the preamble includes goodwill and friendship, they just need to hand over these terrorists to us,"" he said.Referring again to the US example, Singh questioned why Pakistan could not follow the same path. ""When the US can hand over these culprits, why can't Pakistan hand over? They have to simply hand over Hafeez Saeed, Lakhvi, Sajid Mir and things will be over,"" he said.Singh dismissed Pakistan’s offer to investigate the Pahalgam attack as a tactic to deflect attention. He questioned what had come of earlier investigations into the Mumbai, Pathankot, and Pulwama attacks. ""We have given them dossiers after dossiers - we have given them technical inputs. America has shared with them evidence. Everything is there but what have they done?"" he asked.He mentioned that despite being named as planners and executioners of the Mumbai attack, Lakhvi and Hafiz Saeed remain at large. ""So we can't believe them,"" he added.Pointing out that terrorism is a global threat, Singh called for deeper cooperation among affected nations. ""At an international level, all those countries including India, Israel and many other countries that face the brunt of terrorism, we need to expand our diplomatic reach, we need to cooperate, we need to form a coalition against terrorism and most importantly against the supporters of these terrorist groups.""He also added that by underlining India's unwavering position. ""Our prime minister has made it very clear - very clear - that we have zero tolerance on terrorism. We are not going to accept this cross-border terrorism .""","India's ambassador to israel, jp singh, has said that operation sindoor is only ""paused"" and ""not over"" singh called for the formation of a global coalition against terrorism and drew parallel with the example of tahawwur rana's extradition by us. Indian envoy demanded that pakistan should also hand over key terror figures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121280369,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-618528,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"From Rawalpindi to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, India can strike anywhere in Pakistan, says Army official",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-rawalpindi-to-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-india-can-strike-anywhere-in-pakistan-says-army-general/articleshow/121279718.cms,"Soldiers practice military drills with heavy artillery (AP Photo), and Lt Gen Sumer Ivan D'Cunha (ANI).

NEW DELHI: Director general of Army Air Defence, Lt Gen Sumer Ivan D'Cunha , on Monday said that India has the capability to strike targets anywhere within Pakistan. Speaking in the context of Operation Sindoor , he explained that the Indian armed forces are fully prepared to respond across the entire depth of Pakistani territory if needed.In an interview with news agency ANI, Lt Gen D'Cunha said, ""The whole of Pakistan is within range."" He added that even if the Pakistan Army moves its General Headquarters (GHQ) from Rawalpindi to areas like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), they would have to ""find a deep hole.""During Operation Sindoor, India carried out strikes on important Pakistani airbases using loitering munitions to hit key targets.Lt Gen D'Cunha said, ""I just like to say that India has an adequate arsenal of weapons to take on Pakistan right across its depth. So, from its broadest to its narrowest, wherever it is, the whole of Pakistan is within range. We are absolutely capable, from our borders or even in depth, where we can take on the entire Pakistan. And the GHQ can move from Rawalpindi to KPK or wherever they want to move, but they are all within range, so they will have to really find a deep hole.""He said that Indian forces used locally developed technology, including long-range drones and guided munitions, which played a role in the operation.Lt Gen D'Cunha also said that the armed forces are responsible for protecting the country and its people.""Our job is to protect our sovereignty, our people... So, I think that the very fact that we have been able to protect our motherland from this onslaught, which was aimed at causing a lot of problems in population centers and in our cantonments, the very fact that we have given this reassurance to our people, not only to our civil population... a lot of our own jawans, officers, wives were staying in cantonments. And they were also equally concerned about these drone attacks. And the very fact that we ensured that this did not manifest in any casualties, I am sure it not only made the soldier feel proud, it made the families feel proud. And finally, the population of India feel proud. I think that's the takeaway.""Le Gen D'Cunha also highlighted India's preparedness in modern warfare, particularly in neutralising drones and other advanced technologies during Operation Sindoor.""The Russia-Ukraine clash and even to some extent the Israeli current conflict, taught us about the huge capability that drones have. We realised that Pakistan, by its backend support from Turkey and maybe a northern adversary as well, had a plethora of drones. We also knew that in order to take on an effective air defence integrated system that we have, they (Pakistan) would have to saturate us. So, if you see his concept of employment, they (Pakistan) would first send in low-altitude, cheaper drones in large numbers to saturate your radars, and they would also force you to open up your radars...We anticipated this, and about maybe on the 26th, 27th, and 28th, we did a simulation exercise at the behest of our army chief in the border areas, where we simulated drone attacks on the weapon system. It was not from the border, but it was internal, on the border... We started at 5:30 in the morning, maybe on the 26th for the first day, when multiple drones were coming in to train our people,"" he said.India had launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting nine terror-related sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir.This was in response to a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam last month, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists. Following India’s strike, Pakistan retaliated with shelling across the Line of Control and Jammu and Kashmir, along with attempted drone attacks along the border.After Pakistan's incursion, India escalated its response, targeting and destroying key Pakistani military and air infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase. Both countries reached an understanding to end hostilities on May 10.","Lt gen sumer ivan d'cunha said that india has the capability to strike targets anywhere within pakistan. He added that even if the pakistan army moves its general headquarters (ghq) from rawalpindi to areas like khyber pakhtunkhwa (kpk), they would have to ""find a deep hole"" after pakistan's incursion, india escalated its response, targeting and destroying key pakistani military and air infrastructure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121280069,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1367746,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Amid Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigrants, the US Embassy in India has released a strong advisory warning Indian citizens that they could face a permanent ban on travelling to the US in future.

He targeted the Citizensip Clause of the 14th Amendment that granted US citizenship to almost everyone born on American soil. While the executive order is now facing legal hurdles, the administration id deporiting illegal immigrants, arresting them, encouraging them to self-deport.All foreign nations staying the in the US for over 30 days are now required to register with the federal government -- in a new immigration rule change.Two deportation cases involving Indians became very high profile in the last few months. Ranjani Srinivasan,a PhD student at Columbia University, fled to Canada after her visa was revoked for allegedly participating in a pro-Palestine protest, though she said she did not participate in the protest. Ranjani was made an example by the Department of Homeland Security as to how people should deport themselves out of the US to avoid arrest.Georgetown University scholar Badar Khan Suri was arrested for his alleged link with Hamas -- his wife is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former aide of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. He has been released by a court order that said the Trump administration could not prove what national security risk Khan Suri posed.","Us embassy in india issued a stern warning against overstaying in us.

Cong Leader Jairam Ramesh BLASTS Modi Govt, Says Delegation Move Just For Optics & Headlines

Poll Do you think Rahul Gandhi's questions about Operation Sindoor are justified? No, it's politically motivated. Yes, he deserves answers.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday again questioned external affairs minister S Jaishankar over his remarks on Operation Sindoor , asking how many Indian aircraft were lost during the operation.""EAM Jaishankar’s silence isn’t just telling — it’s damning. So I’ll ask again: How many Indian aircraft did we lose because Pakistan knew?"" Gandhi posted on X while resharing an earlier post of himself.He added, ""This wasn’t a lapse. It was a crime.

He is speaking the language of Pakistan,"" BJP's Amit Malviya said in a post on X.Gandhi had earlier, on May 17, shared an undated video of Jaishankar where the minister is heard saying that India had warned Pakistan before launching strikes on terror infrastructure.In that post, Gandhi wrote, ""Informing Pakistan at the start of our attack was a crime. EAM has publicly admitted that GOI did it."" He also asked, ""Who authorised it? How many aircraft did our air force lose as a result?""Meanwhile, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) responded to Gandhi’s claim, calling it a ""misrepresentation of facts.""The MEA said the government had warned Pakistan in the ""early phase after Operation Sindoor’s commencement"" and not before it began.It clarified that Jaishankar had said, ""We had warned Pakistan at the start, which is clearly the early phase after Op Sindoor’s commencement."" The ministry added, ""This is being falsely represented as being before the commencement. This utter misrepresentation of facts is being called out.""Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7, targeting terror bases in Pakistan in retaliation for the deadly Pahalgam terror attack on April 22.","Congress leader rahul gandhi on monday again questioned external affairs minister s jaishankar over his remarks on operation sindoor.

He said that Nehru not only agreed to give water to Pakistan at the cost of India but also gave Rs 83 crore to the neighbouring country, whose value now amounts to Rs 5,500 crore.Chouhan was referring to the amount that India gave to Pakistan to help build replacement canals from the western rivers of the Indus system.""We had been giving waters to Pakistan at the cost of our farmers' interest, but the neighbouring country has been responsible for producing terrorists,"" said Chouhan, adding that even former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee had opposed the Indus Waters Treaty in Parliament.Referring to Nehru's remarks where he reportedly said that India bought peace by extending financial assistance to Pakistan, Chouhan said, ""What kind of peace was that? We lost water as well as money.""Explaining the rationale behind keeping the treaty in abeyance, Chouhan said, ""Waters of Indus river system will now be used for India and its farmers."" Representatives of several organisations, including Samyukta Kisan Morcha and Bharatiya Kisan Union (non-political), attended the meeting. They supported govt's move on the treaty and even demanded that it be abrogated.The farmers’ representatives also demanded the government to work for better utilization of water resources available in the Indus River System for the benefit of farmers in Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and western Uttar Pradesh.Under the treaty, waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - are allocated to India for unrestricted use while the waters of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - are allocated largely to Pakistan.

On May 13, India expelled the Pakistani official for alleged involvement in espionage activities.Investigators claim those arrested were relaying sensitive military and strategic information to Pakistani handlers. Forensic analysis of digital devices and financial transactions is underway, police said.Among the first arrests, Falaksher Masih and Suraj Masih from Amritsar were taken into custody on 4 May for allegedly leaking photographs and details about army cantonments and airbases near the Pakistan border to ISI operatives. More arrests followed on 11 May, including Guzala and Yameen Mohammad from Malerkotla, who were allegedly paid via UPI transfers for sharing confidential military details.Police say Guzala confessed to sharing information with Danish for financial gain, receiving Rs 30,000 in two transactions.On May 13, two more men Sukhpreet Singh and Karanbir Singh from Gurdaspur were detained.
