Who is Sergio Gor?

Gor was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, when it was part of the Soviet Union. His family moved to the US in 1999 when he was about 12. His father, Yuri Gorokhovsky , was an aviation engineer involved in designing Soviet aircraft including the IL-76, used by the Indian Air Force. His mother is said to be of Israeli origin.

Active in young conservative circles, he worked as spokesman for Republican lawmakers Steve King and Michele Bachmann, both known for their far-right views. Gor later became deputy chief of staff to senator Rand Paul.

and Michele Bachmann, both known for their far-right views. Gor later became deputy chief of staff to senator Rand Paul. Gor joined Trump’s orbit during the 2020 elections, rose quickly in the MAGA movement, and was appointed director of presidential personnel after Trump’s 2024 victory. Trump credits him with placing nearly 4,000 loyalists in government roles.

Gor is known for his loyalty to Trump but has also been criticised by others as unpredictable in his decisions. He clashed with Elon Musk, Trump’s billionaire adviser.

He also played a role in derailing Jared Isaacman’s nomination to lead Nasa after pointing out Isaacman’s past donations to Democrats.

US president Donald Trump has nominated Sergio Gor as the next American ambassador to India. If confirmed by the Senate, Gor will also serve as special envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs, a region that includes Pakistan and Bangladesh where the US currently has no ambassadors.Trump announced the move on social media, calling Gor a “great friend” and someone he could fully trust to deliver on his agenda. “For the most populous region in the world, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my agenda and help us make America great again. Sergio will make an incredible ambassador,” Trump wrote.Gor will replace Eric Garcetti, a Democratic appointee, who returned to California after the end of the Biden presidency.","Sergio gor was born in tashkent, uzbekistan, when it was part of the soviet union.

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. The Chairman of L&T’s casual comment, “How long can you stare at your wife?” in connection with working on Sundays was recorded—without permission— and circulated online, which soon exploded into a nationwide debate on productivity and work-life balance. The backlash was swift and merciless. I had quoted a verse from the Thirukkural on love, which reminds us that for those truly bound together, even a lifetime is not enough to gaze at one another. Months later, I came across an interview given by the same chairman, where he reflected with humility: “In hindsight, I could have answered differently. But what happened, happened and I cannot withdraw it now. If the same question comes again, I would answer differently now.” In a digital age where a single phrase can erase decades of hard work, this acceptance was refreshing. Cancel culture has become a defining feature of our times. A sentence pulled out of context or a misplaced gesture can ignite fury and can define a person’s entire being. You wake up in the morning with a faint hope that the storm has passed, only to feel your heart sink when notifications pour in: outrage, ridicule, anger. You scroll through, and it feels as if the entire world is pointing fingers at you. Colleagues avert their eyes. Friends grow silent. Even familiar spaces feel strange. The house you return to is the same, yet somehow it feels emptier, because the noise outside has entered your heart. And yet, this is where dignity must be preserved—not by denial or defiance, but by quiet acceptance. To whisper, “yes, I stumbled” and stand up again is courage in its purest form. It is the kind of courage that cleanses, the kind that turns defeat into resurgence. Very recently, there was a contentious statement made about Kamaraj. Here was a man of unimpeachable integrity, the very embodiment of selflessness in public life. He gave up power, lived without wealth or privilege, and left behind nothing but his honesty. And yet, he too faced defeat—not at the hands of a giant, but a little-known newcomer in an election. For a leader of his stature, it was not just loss, but heartbreak. Cho Ramaswamy, in his book I Met Kamaraj, recalls a poignant meeting with the leader soon after. Kamaraj lay quietly in his bed in his humble home. When asked how his followers could be expected to stand by him after such an electoral set-back, he replied with dignity: “I have fallen in a manner that I cannot fall any lower. I can only get up. If true followers still wait at my gate in this hour of defeat, why would they leave when I rise again?” Defeat had not diminished him; it had only deepened his greatness. The true test of courage is not in how one wins, but in how one handles defeat. To reflect, to recognize one’s fault, to apologize when needed—and then, to rise again. Thiruvalluvar called this the acid test of greatness: Saalbirkku Kattalai Yaadhenil Tholvi Thulayallaar Kannum Kolal. “What is perfection’s test? To accept defeat Even at the hands of those less worthy.” The world often glorifies victory, putting it on pedestals and writing songs in its name. But the truest measure of character is revealed when defeat comes from someone far less in stature or merit. To bear such a fall without anger, to bow to the outcome without bitterness, and to rise again without scorn — that is dignity in its highest form.","Bharathi bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text ‘thirukkural’ written by tamil poet and philosopher thiruvalluvar, the kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

That was 11 years before Trump's tariff vendetta and six years before realisation of the need for diversification of supply chains.He consistently stressed the need to become self-reliant in every field with the announcement of govt's focus on ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ' after Covid-19 pandemic, reducing sourcing of products from other nations & putting more thrust on 'Vocal for Local'.In his latest address, the PM emphasised the need to reach new heights in manufacturing by adopting the ""daam kam, dum jyada"" mantra.The first speech saw Modi identifying himself as an ""outsider in Delhi"" who was not part of the ""elite"", and announcing schemes such as Jan Dhan Yojna, Make in India , Skill India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat and transformation of the erstwhile Planning Commission which, among other things, will define his legacy.The 2016 speech saw Modi celebrating the progress of his signature achievements: construction of toilets, bringing large numbers of the poor to the banking net. He followed that up next year by focusing on his theme of New India - a secure, prosperous and strong nation, and expeditious completion of works, since the poor suffer the most because of delays.Two years later, he spoke about how international experts used to refer to the Indian economy as being ""risky"" prior to 2014.Since 2020, the PM's I-Day speeches have focused on national unity and a long-term vision of building a strong nation. While in his 2020 address, the PM spoke about ""Make in India, Make for the World"" as a strategy, the address in 2021 focused on a roadmap for 'Viksit Bharat by 2047'.The PM's address in 2022, marking 75 years of Independence, introduced Panch Pran (five vows), urging citizens to commit to unity, development, and the removal of colonial mindsets.By 2024, the PM's speech had a strong reformist thrust. He spoke about major governance changes impacting the middle class, farmers, and the poor while pitching for UCC and ONOE.","Pm narendra modi's pitch on aug 15 for indians to produce goods which can hold their own against global competition, without causing pollution, has been seen from the lens of us president donald trump's decision to ""punish"" india for not heeding his diktats.

A strong earthquake with a revised magnitude of 7.5 struck the Drake Passage on Thursday, shaking the remote region between South America and Antarctica but posing no widespread tsunami threat, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.Initially reported as an 8.0 magnitude event, the US Geological Survey (USGS) later downgraded the quake and confirmed it occurred at a shallow depth of 11 kilometers (7 miles). The epicenter was located over 700 kilometers (435 miles) southeast of Ushuaia, Argentina — the southernmost city in the country with a population of approximately 57,000.The quake struck at 4:16 PM HST on August 21 (07:46 AM IST on August 22).While the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center briefly issued a warning for parts of the Chilean coast, it later confirmed there was no tsunami threat to Hawaii or other distant areas.Chile’s Navy Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service also issued a tsunami alert for its Antarctic territory after the quake, noting the epicenter was about 258 kilometers (160 miles) northwest of the Chilean Base Frei research station.There have been no reports of damage or casualties, largely due to the remote nature of the area.","A strong earthquake with a revised magnitude of 7.5 struck the drake passage on thursday.

Poll How do you view the current situation in Gaza? Critical and needs immediate attention Under control and manageable

What this could mean



Arab countries are not on board

Situation in Gaza remains dire







Israel pushed deeper into the contested territory of Gaza on Wednesday, pressing ahead with a plan to seize the Strip while simultaneously approving thousands of new housing units in the occupied West Bank, moves that sparked international alarm and reignited debate over the future of a Palestinian state.Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, the military’s chief spokesperson, declared that Israel “has begun the next phase of the war,” with troops edging into Gaza City’s outskirts and preparations under way to relocate displaced residents to southern Gaza, reported NYT.Meanwhile in the West Bank, the government greenlit 3,400 settlement homes in a project described by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a hard-line coalition partner, as proof that the “idea of a Palestinian state is being erased from the table.”For the takeover move, Israel's defence minister has authorised the call-up of about 60,000 reservists, piling pressure on Hamas.The dual announcements landed just as mediators floated a new ceasefire proposal -- one reportedly close to terms Israel had previously backed. However, Israel's plan to move ahead with the takeover plan cast doubt on whether talks could advance amid the escalations.The looming assault aims to prevent Hamas, which led the deadly October.7, 2023, onslaught on southern Israel that started the war, from regrouping and planning future attacks, an Israeli military official, who requested anonymity in line with military protocol, told NYT on Wednesday.If Israel takes ""full control"" of Gaza, it would reverse the decision made in 2005 when Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers from the area.Since then, Israel has kept control over Gaza’s borders, airspace, and utilities. This move could also mean that the Israeli military would enter parts of Gaza that it does not yet control. Some right-wing leaders in Israel argue that the 2005 pullout from Gaza helped Hamas rise to power by winning elections in 2006.Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the goal is to defeat Hamas and rescue the remaining hostages, but it’s unclear if this plan is for the short term or something longer.So far, no Arab country has agreed to help govern Gaza after the war. A Jordanian official told Reuters, ""Arab countries would only support what Palestinians agree and decide on."" He added that security should be managed by Palestinian institutions.A Hamas leader, Osama Hamdan, told Al Jazeera that any force trying to govern Gaza alongside Israel would be treated as an ""occupying"" power.Earlier this year, Egypt proposed a plan backed by Arab countries to set up a neutral Palestinian committee to run Gaza after the war. But both Israel and the United States rejected it.The Israeli army has claimed it now controls about 75 per cent of Gaza. But most of Gaza’s 2 million people have been displaced many times over the past 22 months. Aid groups are warning that famine is very close.One resident, 30-year-old Aya Mohammad, said, ""Where should we go? We have been displaced and humiliated enough."" Hamas says it will only agree to a deal that ends the war permanently. Israel says Hamas is not serious about giving up power.","Israel pushes deeper into contested territory of gaza on wednesday, pressing ahead with a plan to seize the strip.

Yes No

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said that India was not the biggest importer of Russian oil and expressed that he was ""perplexed"" as New Delhi's purchase of oil from the US had in fact increased. The statements came in as Donald Trump has been putting pressure on India to stop buying oil from Moscow, claiming that the move was fueling Russia's aggression against Ukraine.Speaking at bilateral meet with Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow, Jaishankar said, ""We are not the biggest purchasers of Russian oil, that is China. We are not the biggest purchasers of LNG, that is the European Union. We are not the country which has the biggest trade surge with Russia after 2022; I think there are some countries to the South.""""We are a country where the Americans have said for the last few years that we should do everything to stabilise the world energy market, including buying oil from Russia.

This requires swiftly addressing non-tariff barriers and regulatory impediments, enhancing India's exports to Russia in sectors like agriculture, pharma, and textiles will certainly help correct the imbalance,"" Jaishankar said.On Ukraine, Jaishankar reiterated India's position of peace and said, ""On regional issues, we discussed developments in Ukraine, West Asia, the Middle East and Afghanistan.

NEW DELHI: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday informed the Rajya Sabha that the United States embassy has contradicted claims made earlier this year by US President Donald Trump, stating that USAID had not allocated $21 million to boost voter turnout in India.In a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question, Minister of State for External Affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said the US Embassy in New Delhi has formally informed India that ""USAID/India did not receive or provide funding of $21 million for voter turnout in India from fiscal years 2014 to 2024, nor has it implemented any voter turnout-related activities in India.""This clarification came after the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in February 2025, had publicly posted about cancelling $486 million in USAID funding worldwide, including an alleged $21 million earmarked for ""increasing voter turnout in India."" Trump himself had cited this as an example of US aid misuse.Following the post, MEA sought urgent details from the US embassy regarding all USAID-funded projects in India over the past decade. In July, the embassy shared a funding breakdown but reiterated that no voter turnout initiatives had ever been financed in India.The MEA also confirmed that USAID operations in India have been wound up. On August 11, the US embassy notified India that all seven Partnership Agreements with the government had been closed as part of Washington’s decision to dissolve USAID globally.According to official figures placed in Parliament, USAID funding between 2022 and 2024 in India went to programs supporting Tibetan communities, education for marginalized children, air pollution mitigation, renewable energy projects, and HIV/AIDS interventions, but none related to elections.",The ministry of external affairs (mea) informed the rajya sabha that the united states embassy has contradicted claims made earlier this year by us president donald trump.

Trade and river cooperation

NEW DELHI: A day after Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi concluded his two-day visit to India, China’s ambassador to India Xu Feihong voiced strong opposition to the United States’ tariff measures against New Delhi and emphasized the need for closer cooperation between India and China.“US has imposed tariffs of up to 50% on India and even threatened for more. China firmly opposes it. Silence only emboldens the bully. China will firmly stand with India,” Xu said, underscoring Beijing’s willingness to support New Delhi against unilateral trade restrictions.The envoy stressed that the partnership between India and China is crucial for regional and global development. “For two neighbouring countries of such size, unity and cooperation are the only way to achieve common development. China and India’s friendship benefits Asia. We are the double engines of economic growth in Asia. India and China unity benefits the world at large. India and China have the responsibility to take the lead in promoting an equal and orderly multipolar world,” he said.Xu further noted that trust-building is essential in the bilateral relationship. “China and India should enhance strategic mutual trust, and avoid mutual suspicion.Both countries are partners, not rivals. We should manage differences through dialogue,” he said.“We are willing to work with India to enhance development of our strategies and enlarge the cake of cooperation. We welcome all Indian commodities to enter the Chinese market.”Xu highlighted the progress on the boundary issue following Wang Yi’s visit. “This time, during the Chinese FM visit to India, he had a very important talk with Mr Doval on the boundary issue. They reached a consensus on 10 points. Two groups will be set up by our two sides over the border issue. One group will be for border delimitation into appropriate sectors. The second group will focus on proper management of the border and border areas,” Xu said.He added, “We should not define the border issue as relationship between our two countries. The border issue is on one side, and cooperation between India and China is on the other side.”Xu’s remarks followed the 24th round of the Special Representatives’ dialogue on the boundary question, which Wang Yi co-chaired with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on August 19.The Chinese minister also held bilateral talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar on August 18 and called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Xu highlighted ten points of consensus reached in the talks, noting that both sides spoke positively of the progress made since the 23rd round and the implementation of the leader-level consensus reached in Kazan. “The two sides reiterated the importance of maintaining peace and tranquility in the border areas, emphasized handling the issue properly through friendly consultations, to promote overall development of the China-India bilateral relationship,” Xu said.He added that both sides agreed to “take a political perspective of the overall bilateral relationship while seeking a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable framework for settlement of the boundary question in accordance with the Agreement on Political Parameters and Guiding Principles for Settlement of the China-India Boundary Question signed in 2005.”Among the key outcomes, Xu said the two sides agreed to set up an Expert Group under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on the China-India border affairs (WMCC) framework to explore “Early Harvest” solutions on boundary delimitation in appropriate sectors. They also agreed to create a Working Group under the WMCC framework to advance effective border management.Further, Xu noted that the two sides agreed to “create General-Level Mechanisms in the Eastern and Middle Sectors, in addition to the existing General-Level Mechanism in the Western Sector, and hold the next round of General-Level Mechanism meeting in the Western Sector at an early date.”On economic and trade ties, Xu said the two countries agreed to reopen the three traditional border trading markets — Renqinggang-Changgu, Pulan-Gunji, and Jiuba-Namgya — and to hold the 25th round of SR talks in China in 2026.Both sides also discussed cooperation on trans-border rivers.

Mikko Rantanen faces legal battle over Finnish military service delay

Mikko Rantanen delivers for Dallas after blockbuster trade and mega-contract

Dallas Stars forward Mikko Rantanen is in the middle of a complicated situation off the ice. In Finland, all men are required to complete mandatory military service, and prosecutors allege Rantanen failed to report on time last April. They argue his application to delay his service was filed too late, leaving him subject to a potential fine equivalent to 10–15 days of income.Mikko Rantanen’s agent, Matti Huhtamaki, has pushed back strongly, stressing that his client did nothing wrong and that “there have been mistakes that Mikko has tried to correct as soon as he received the information.” Huhtamaki added that the matter “should be left to the court” and refused further comment until proceedings conclude.The 28-year-old briefly served at the Guard Jaeger Regiment’s sports school earlier this year before being released for health reasons. While the legal uncertainty lingers, the case highlights the challenges international athletes sometimes face when balancing professional careers abroad with domestic legal and civic obligations.Despite the off-ice drama, Rantanen’s hockey career is thriving. After a trade that sent him from the Colorado Avalanche to the Carolina Hurricanes before landing in Dallas, he wasted no time committing to his new team, signing an eight-year, $96 million deal.“It was the first time I’ve been traded from Colorado and it happened quick,” Rantanen told NHL.com, explaining that he felt Dallas was the right fit after discussions with his camp and his girlfriend, Susanna.Also Read: Hockey’s own Kelce brothers?

Jay Rosehill calls the trade a “pipe dream” but says Leafs should take it

Fans divided over the bold trade proposal

Former NHL enforcer Jay Rosehill stirred the pot this week with a bold trade scenario that has Toronto Maple Leafs fans debating the future of their blue line. On the ""Leafs Morning Take"" podcast, Rosehill weighed in on a hypothetical deal that would send Morgan Rielly and Nick Robertson to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Erik Karlsson , who is on an eight-year, $92 million contract.While acknowledging the unlikeliness of such a move, Jay Rosehill made it clear he’d pull the trigger in a heartbeat. “I take that all day,” Rosehill said. “We're gonna try and get rid of Nick Robertson in general… I just don't think he's gonna be here. And Morgan Rielly is, you know, kind of stalled, makes 7.5 million. Doesn't produce like he used to. Sometimes has some dead stuff going on in the D-zone.”Rosehill praised Karlsson’s resume, pointing to his Norris Trophy-winning pedigree, elite puck movement, and power play ability. Still, he admitted the blockbuster was more of a dream scenario than a realistic front-office move. “I just don't see anyone going for that… so I would take it for sure. But I just don't see it happening.”The mock deal quickly lit up fan discussions online. Some fans argued that Karlsson isn’t worth the package, while others said it would be a “Christmas present” for Toronto. One fan countered bluntly: “Pretty sure Rielly says no.”Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Edmonton Oilers weighing major trade with Bruins as Connor McDavid contract factor looms With Toronto’s offseason decisions still under scrutiny, Rosehill’s take reflects a broader debate: should the Leafs gamble on another star defenseman or continue betting on their current core?",Toronto maple leafs linked to shocking erik karlsson trade.

A longtime confidante of New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been suspended from his re-election campaign after she attempted to hand a journalist a potato chip bag containing cash.The incident unfolded on Wednesday in Harlem, where Adams was opening a campaign office.According to The City, reporter Katie Honan was approached by Winnie Greco, a former City Hall adviser and major Adams fundraiser. Greco asked her to meet at a Whole Foods near the campaign site. Inside the store, Greco pressed an opened bag of Herr’s Sour Cream & Onion potato chips into Honan’s hands. Honan initially refused, thinking it was just a snack, but Greco insisted.When Honan later opened the bag, she discovered a red envelope with cash inside — including at least one $100 bill and several $20 bills, The City reported. She immediately phoned Greco, saying she could not accept the money. Greco responded that she had already left and suggested they could meet later in Chinatown.In an interview with The City, Greco apologised repeatedly. “I make a mistake,” she said. “I’m so sorry.It’s a culture thing. I don’t know. I don’t understand. I’m so sorry. I feel so bad right now. I’m so sorry, honey.” she said.Later, she asked the outlet not to publish the story and talk to her attorney. “Can we forget about this? I try to be a good person. Please. Please. Please don’t do in the news nothing about me”, she added, as per The City.“I just wanted to be her friend. I just wanted to have one good friend. It’s nothing”, she further said.Greco’s lawyer, Steven Brill, was quoted by the news agency Associated Press that the episode was “being blown out of proportion,” insisting that in Chinese culture, cash is often given “as a gesture of friendship and gratitude.”He added, “Winnie’s intention was born purely out of kindness. I grant you this looks odd, but it was innocent.”Adams’ campaign swiftly distanced itself. As per AP, spokesperson Todd Shapiro said Greco “holds no position in this campaign and has been suspended from all volunteer activities,” stressing that the mayor had “no prior knowledge of this matter” and remains committed to “the highest ethical and legal standards.”Following the discovery, Honan returned the envelope and bag to her editors. The City alerted the department of investigation (DOI), which later confirmed receiving the complaint. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn then retrieved the bag, according to the outlet.Greco has been under federal scrutiny since the FBI raided two of her Bronx properties in February 2024. She resigned as Adams’ Asian affairs director later that year but has remained a visible figure at campaign events.According to The New York Times, she had previously helped Adams raise significant funds and was once described by senior aide Ingrid Lewis-Martin as “my sister.”Her history with Adams stretches back more than a decade, during which she connected him to Chinese-American donors and organisations.","Winnie greco, a longtime confidante of new york city mayor eric adams, has been suspended from his re-election campaign.

Austin Ekeler emerges as Commanders’ lead back after Brian Robinson trade

10 Fantasy Football Values, Sleepers & Lottery Tickets | Running Backs to Draft

Croskey-Merritt could be Washington’s 2025 Fantasy breakout

Who fills the gap behind Ekeler and Croskey-Merritt?

The 2025 NFL season is around the corner, and fantasy football managers are already recalibrating their draft boards. Washington’s decision to trade running back Brian Robinson Jr. to the San Francisco 49ers has opened a significant gap in the Commanders’ backfield, creating fresh intrigue and risk for fantasy players.Austin Ekeler, entering his 30s, is the immediate beneficiary. A proven pass-catching back, Ekeler remains dangerous in space but is unlikely to shoulder a heavy workload at this stage of his career. Last season, he logged 733 scrimmage yards and four touchdowns in 12 games.He projects as a reliable flex option in PPR leagues, though Washington will be cautious with his snaps to keep him fresh across a long campaign. Fantasy managers can expect Ekeler to deliver consistent production in short-yardage and passing situations, making him a key piece in the Commanders’ offense.The real buzz belongs to rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt, who has asked teammates to call him “Bill.” A seventh-round pick, Croskey-Merritt has quickly become a preseason talking point after producing 72 rushing yards and a touchdown across two games.His limited college resume tempers expectations, but Washington’s decision to move on from Robinson suggests confidence in his potential.For fantasy managers, he represents a high-upside mid- to late-round pick, one who could seize the starting role if Ekeler is restricted to situational duties.Beyond Ekeler and Croskey-Merritt, options are unconvincing. Jeremy McNichols and Chris Rodriguez Jr. will likely battle for rotational snaps, while Demetric Felton and Kazmeir Allen appear headed for practice squad roles. Neither group offers tangible fantasy value unless injuries create openings.Also Read: Cleveland Browns’ Dillon Gabriel eyes NFL breakthrough while fiancée Zo Caswell begins wedding dress hunt The Commanders’ backfield now revolves around two names. Ekeler provides stability and proven production, making him a safe selection for fantasy rosters. Croskey-Merritt is the wildcard — raw but explosive, and capable of becoming one of 2025’s breakout sleepers. Washington’s preseason usage patterns will be critical in determining how snaps are distributed, but for now, fantasy managers must weigh experience against potential. With Jayden Daniels at quarterback and Deebo Samuel joining Terry McLaurin at receiver, Washington’s offense looks primed for growth.",Austin ekeler and jacory croskey-merritt take center stage post-robinson trade.
