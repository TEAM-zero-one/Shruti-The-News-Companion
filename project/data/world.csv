Judge removal involves several steps. Here’s how it proceeds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judge-removal-involves-several-steps-heres-how-it-proceeds/articleshow/121477504.cms,"Judge removal involves several steps. Here’s how it proceeds

Once a judicial inquiry committee concludes in its report about wrongdoing by a constitutional court judge, the CJI, on being satisfied with the committee’s finding, offers an opportunity to the judge concerned to resign.If the judge refuses, then the CJI forwards the inquiry report to the President, who is the appointing authority, and the PM. The PM and the Union Cabinet, after discussing the report, may ask the law ministry/parliamentary affairs ministry to initiate a motion for removal.A notice for motion of removal against the judge can be moved in Rajya Sabha if 50 or more MPs sign the motion, and in Lok Sabha if 100 or more MPs agree to put their signatures to it.Once the motion is placed before the LS Speaker or RS chairman, in either case, he carries out a preliminary review of the report as well as the accompanying motion and has the power to ‘admit or refuse to admit’ the notice of motion for removal (Section 3 of Judges Inquiry Act, 1968).In the event of admitting the notice of motion for removal, the head of the House concerned will keep the motion pending and constitute a three-member committee for “the purpose of making an investigation into the grounds on which the removal of a judge is prayed for”.The committee will comprise either the CJI or a judge of the SC, an HC chief justice and a distinguished jurist. The committee will then frame charges against the judge concerned. “Such charges, together with a statement of the grounds on which each such charge is based, shall be communicated to the judge and he shall be given a reasonable opportunity of presenting a written statement of defence within such time as may be specified in this behalf by the committee,” the Act provides.Section 4 of the Act provides, “The committee shall have power to regulate its own procedure in making the investigation and shall give a reasonable opportunity to the judge of cross-examining witnesses, adducing evidence and of being heard in his defence.” The committee, after conclusion of the investigation, will present a report to the head of the House concerned where the motion for removal is pending.If the report finds the judge ‘not guilty’, then no further steps will be taken, and the motion will be treated as infructuous. If the report finds the judge guilty, then the head of the House will lay the report before the House as soon as possible and the House will take up the motion for removal for debate.The motion will then have to be passed by each House, supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than twothirds of the members of the House present and voting.It will then be presented to the President for removal of the judge. A notice for motion of removal against the judge can be moved in Rajya Sabha if 50 or more MPs sign the motion, and in Lok Sabha if 100 or more MPs agree to put their signatures to it","Judge removal involves several steps. A notice for motion of removal against the judge can be moved in rajya sabha if 50 or more mps sign the motion, and in lok sabha if 100 or more mp agree to put their signatures to it. If the report finds the judge ‘not guilty’, then no further steps will be taken.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121477520,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-970501,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
'Limit to political desperation': BJP wades into Congress crossfire as Udit Raj targets Shashi Tharoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/limit-to-political-desperation-bjp-wades-into-congress-crossfire-as-udit-raj-targets-shashi-tharoor/articleshow/121477025.cms,"Udit Raj (L), Shashi Tharoor (C) and Kiren Rijiju (R)

NEW DELHI: Amid rising tensions within the Congress party, the BJP has rallied around opposition MP Shashi Tharoor, who is facing criticism from his own colleagues over remarks made during an international delegation visit.Tharoor’s statements lauding India’s recent counterterror strikes have sparked sharp reactions from fellow Congress leader Udit Raj, prompting BJP leaders to question the Congress’s stance on national interest.Union minister Kiren Rijiju took to X on Wednesday to condemn the grand old party, responding to Udit Raj’s criticism of Tharoor. Sharing a video, Rijiju questioned the party's priorities: “Congress ka haath kiske sath? Kya Congress party mein desh ke liye bolna mana hai?” he posted in Hindi.“We Indians must speak in one voice in crucial time at least,” he added.In another post, Rijiju intensified his criticism, “What does the Congress party want & how much they really care for the country? Should the Indian MPs go to foreign nation and speak against India and its Prime Minister? There’s limit to political desperation!”BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla echoed Rijiju’s sentiments, alleging that Congress leader Udit Raj was targeting Tharoor under the influence of Rahul Gandhi.He framed the row as a case of internal sabotage. “Shashi Tharoor is being attacked at the behest of Rahul Gandhi because Shashi Tharoor kept India first not (Gandhi) family. He talked about national interest, not his party’s interest. He is being attacked because he kept national policy above the vote bank (politics),” Poonawalla told PTI.He accused the Congress of hypocrisy: asserting support for the armed forces in an all-party meeting, while launching “missiles at its own leader” abroad.“The Congress, which is launching missiles at its own leader, won’t say a word against Pakistan,” he said.The row stems from Tharoor’s recent remarks during an official address in Panama, where he was representing India as part of a multi-party delegation. Tharoor spoke about India’s evolving counter-terrorism posture, referencing key military operations.“What has changed in recent years is that the terrorists have also realised they will have a price to pay; on that, let there be no doubt. When, for the first time, India breached the Line of Control between India and Pakistan to conduct a surgical strike on a terror base, a launch pad – the Uri strike in September 2015. That was already something we had not done before. Even during the Kargil War, we had not crossed the Line of Control; in Uri, we did, and then came the attack in Pulwama in January 2019. This time, we crossed not only the Line of Control but also the international border, and we struck the terrorist headquarters in Balakot. This time, we have gone beyond both of those. We have not only gone beyond the Line of Control and the international border. We have struck at the Punjabi heartland of Pakistan by hitting terror bases, training centres, and terror headquarters in nine places,” Tharoor said.Udit Raj, however, took serious objection, accusing Tharoor of undermining the Congress’s legacy. “How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed LOC and the international border?” Raj posted on X.He pointed to India’s military actions during the 1965 and 1971 wars, as well as strikes under the UPA, to challenge Tharoor’s narrative. “Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has become the super spokesperson of the BJP, speaking in favour of PM Modi and his government,” Raj told ANI.As the rift widens, Tharoor finds himself caught between praise from political opponents and rebuke from within his own party.Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, Tharoor, is currently leading an all-party delegation to countries in Americas for Centre's resolve of global outreach of India's recent counterterror Operation Sindoor.",Opposition mp shashi tharoor is facing criticism from his own colleagues.

"'Blinded, numbed, paralysed': How Operation Sindoor set Pakistan air force back by five years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/blinded-numbed-paralysed-how-operation-sindoor-set-pakistan-air-force-back-by-five-years/articleshow/121462969.cms,"Poll Do you believe India's Operation Sindoor effectively crippled Pakistan's air power? Yes, it was highly effective No, it had minimal impact

'Blinded and numbed'



The tipping point



NEW DELHI: In just four days of high-intensity precision strikes, India’s Operation Sindoor ""blinded, numbed, and paralysed"" Pakistan’s air power, delivering a ""five-year setback"" to the Pakistan air force Launched in retaliation to missile strikes on military targets, the Indian Air Force ’s campaign was swift and surgical. According to top security sources quoted by news agency ANI, the strikes crippled Pakistan’s radar coverage, dismantled its command and control systems, and exposed glaring weaknesses in its Chinese and Turkish-supplied weaponry.The operation was triggered after India struck terror hubs in Bahawalpur and Muridke on the night of May 6-7. Pakistan retaliated with missile strikes that were largely neutralised by India’s layered air defence network. But what followed stunned even seasoned military observers.On the night of May 9-10, Indian jets and missiles targeted air bases across Pakistan, from Chaklala and Sargodha to Rahimyar Khan and Karachi. The strikes were carried out with air-launched cruise missiles, standoff weapons, and loitering munitions like the Harop and Harpy.The first objective: destroy Pakistan’s radar and air defence grid. Indian weapons knocked out key Chinese-supplied HQ-9 missile sites and radar stations near Lahore, opening vast gaps in Pakistan's aerial surveillance.“They were flying blind,” said one source. “Their air force was forced to fly deep inside their own territory, terrified of the S-400 and Akash systems deployed along our borders,” the source told ANI.Turkish and Chinese drones launched by Pakistan were overwhelmed by India’s active defence—from Siachen to Naliya. Even vintage L-70 and Zu-23 guns played a role in downing enemy drones.By May 9, the focus shifted to destroying command and control centres at Chaklala, Murid, and Sargodha air bases. Rampage and SCALP missiles fired from Mirage, Rafale, Su-30, and MiG-29 aircraft delivered surgical precision, breaking the chain of communication between airborne early-warning planes and ground control.The strikes reportedly left Pakistani air command in disarray, unable to assess the battlefield, respond effectively, or even detect incoming threats.“They were effectively paralysed,” a source said adding, “Some PAF officers were even forced to rely on civilian aircraft corridors to shield their movement, a tactic born out of desperation.”On May 10, around 1 am, Pakistan launched tactical surface-to-surface missiles targeting Indian bases at Adampur and strategic points in Gujarat and Punjab. But India’s indigenous air defence systems intercepted most threats. In some cases, Pakistani missiles reportedly landed intact, retrieved later by civilians and handed over to Indian forces.India’s final wave of strikes hit deeper targets, including the Bholari air base, where a Saab 200 AEW&C aircraft and several Western-origin jets were destroyed inside a hangar. At other bases, runway craters halted air operations for hours. Precision strikes were monitored via AWACS and satellites.By dawn on May 10, Pakistan was scrambling. With its radar and C2 systems gutted, air assets damaged, and no clear response strategy, it quietly reached out to Indian officials, seeking a ceasefire.“Pakistan and its backers were stunned, both by the scale and by India’s readiness to escalate,” said a senior official.According to sources, Operation Sindoor delivered not just a tactical blow but a strategic message: India had the reach, the intent, and the means to respond decisively. The damage assessment is still underway, but internal reviews suggest the Pakistani Air Force suffered a degradation equivalent to five years of capability loss - both in hardware and in morale.As for India, the operation demonstrated a dramatic shift: from restraint to proactive dominance — with air and ground forces working in tandem to alter the equation, possibly for good.","India's operation sindoor 'blinded, numbed, and paralysed' pakistan's air power.

'Dishonest' vs 'nationalist': Shashi Tharoor triggers another Congress-BJP slugfest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dishonest-vs-nationalist-shashi-tharoor-triggers-another-congress-bjp-slugfest/articleshow/121469742.cms,"Drifting apart

Who is to blame for this divide?

Should Congress act against Tharoor?

NEW DELHI: Is Shashi Tharoor prioritising national interest over party interest as country's global envoy or is he being a ""super spokesperson of the BJP ""? The Thiruvananthapuram MP, who is leading one of the 7 multi-party delegations to expose Pakistan post Pahalgam terror attack, is once again in his party's crosshairs - this time for his remark that ""India breached the Line of Control (Loc) for the first time during the 2016 surgical strike on a terror base. ""As expected, Congress rebuttal to this claim has been sharp and strong. The party cited an old statement of S Jaishankar to counter Tharoor's remarks. Senior Congress leader Pawan Khera posted on X a remark made by Jaishankar to the Parliamentary Committee on External Affairs in October 2016.Khera claimed that Jaishankar had then said: “Professionally done, target-specific, limited-calibre counter-terrorist operations have been carried out across the LoC in the past too, but this is for the first time that the government has made it public.""Tharoor and Congress, who have been at loggerheads for sometime now, seem to be fast drifting apart. What started in February as Tharoor's surprise one-off praise for PM Modi's US visit has slowly but surely evolved into a full blown controversy with the Congress leader making several statements in praise of NDA government's diplomacy initiatives and especially its handling of events post the Pahalgam terror attack.The latest controversy erupted after Tharoor, during his visit to Panama, said that in recent years, India’s stance on terrorism had changed and that terrorists now understand they will face consequences for their actions.""What has changed in recent years is that the terrorists have also realised they will have a price to pay; on that, let there be no doubt. When, for the first time, India breached the Line of Control between India and Pakistan to conduct a surgical strike on a terror base, a launch pad - the Uri strike in September 2016. That was already something we had not done before. Even during the Kargil War, we had not crossed the Line of Control; in Uri, we did, and then came the attack in Pulwama in January 2019. This time, we crossed not only the Line of Control but also the international border, and we struck the terrorist headquarters in Balakot. This time, we have gone beyond both of those. We have not only gone beyond the Line of Control and the international border. We have struck at the Punjabi heartland of Pakistan by hitting terror bases, training centres, and terror headquarters in nine places,"" Tharoor had said.This evoked a sharp retort from the Congress. Udit Raj, who has been leading the charge against Tharoor, took to social media to slam the Thiruvananthapuram MP.""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed LOC and the International border. In 1965 the Indian Army entered Pakistan at multiple points, which completely surprised the Pakistanis in the Lahore sector. In 1971, India tore Pakistan into two pieces and during the UPA government, several surgical strikes were unleashed, but drum beating was not done to encash it politically. How could you be so dishonest to the party which gave you so much?"" the Congress leader wrote on X.Pawan Khera also targeted Tharoor and tagged him on an old interview of Manmohan Singh - in which the former Prime Minister had claimed that at least 6 surgical strikes were carried out against Pakistan during the UPA regime.The Congress had in May 2019 released a list of six UPA-era ""surgical strikes"" which included Bhattal sector in Poonch (June 19, 2008); Sharda sector, across Neelam River Valley, in Kel (August 30-September 1, 2011); Sawan Patra checkpost (January 6, 2013); Nazapir sector (July 27-28, 2013); Neelam Valley (August 6, 2013); and one on December 23, 2013.""The BJP, which had then called these claims fraudulent, came to Tharoor's defence and slammed the Congress for attacking a ""nationalist"" leader within its ranks.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla alleged the Congress has deployed Udit Raj to attack Tharoor at the behest of Rahul Gandhi at a time when a multi-party Indian delegation, led by the Congress MP, is abroad to expose Pakistan at the international forum.BJP leader Ajay Alok said, “There are two gangs within Congress - one is the ‘Gangs of Rahul Gandhi,’ similar to ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’, and the other is the nationalist group with leaders like Shashi Tharoor and P Chidambaram. Today, the Gangs of Gandhi are behaving like the Gangs of Wasseypur. Congress has completely lost its mental balance.""Former Congress leader Sanjay Jha blames the party for the present crisis. ""The Congress did not give Tharoor his due. In Tharoor, the Congress had a huge talent at its disposal and he along with Chidambaram should have been given prominence in showcasing party's response to the current standoff,"" Sanjay Jha says.What should worry the Congress is the support for Tharoor from one of its senior Kerala leaders, who was recently removed from the post of state chief.Former KPCC chief K Sudhakaran had last week questioned the party's decision to exclude the name of Tharoor from the list of persons to lead the Centre's delegations on ' Operation Sindoor ' and said it was akin to ""insulting"" him.Sudhakaran said that Tharoor was a competent leader and a loyal member of the party and therefore, in his view, it was not right to sideline the Thiruvananthapuram MP.""All this was an unnecessary controversy is what I feel,"" Sudhakaran had said in an interview to a TV channel according to news agency PTI.Tharoor seems to be unperturbed by the Congress opposition to his stand and the attacks of Udit Raj. He has openly aired his views supporting PM Modi's diplomacy initiatives despite clear instructions from Mallikarjun Kharge not to speak against the party line.Sanjay Jha feels Congress should not take any action against Tharoor and instead the party should make efforts to talk to him and integrate him.Well, that does not seem likely in the present circumstances - especially with some Congress leaders now taking a more aggressive stand against Tharoor.Perhaps, it is the politics of Kerala that is at the centre of this row. Kerala goes to polls next year and Congress is going all out to defeat the LDF and make a comeback in the state after two consecutive defeats. The fact that Rahul Gandhi's closest aide K C Venugopal is from Kerala may perhaps have something to do with the power tussle in the state unit and Tharoor's possible disenchantment with the party.","The latest controversy erupted after tharoor, during his visit to panama, said that in recent years, india’s stance on terrorism had changed. The congress had in may 2019 released a list of six upa-era ""surgical strikes"" which included bhattal sector in poonch.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121469880,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1151617,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India is set to hold civil defence mock drills on Thursday across four states bordering Pakistan, including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Jammu and Kashmir.The drills aim to test emergency response coordination and civilian evacuation strategies in case of cross-border hostilities or terror-related incidents.Government officials said the exercise would involve local civil defence teams, police, disaster response units, and medical staff.The drill is intended to test emergency response coordination, civilian evacuation protocols, and inter-agency communication in case of cross-border hostilities or terrorist incidentsThe mock drill comes just weeks after India launched Operation Sindoor on the night of May 6–7, a retaliatory strike reportedly targeting terror camps and military infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK). The operation was a response to the terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians.India's counter-attack prompted Pakistan to launch its strikes on Indian military sites and urban areas. In response, India hit at least nine Pakistani air bases, including radar and air defence units. After several days of high-intensity action, Pakistan requested a ceasefire, which India accepted on May 10.","India to hold civil defence mock drills on thursday across four states bordering pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi on Wednesday refuted Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma 's allegations regarding his British wife Elizabeth Colburn's alleged connection with Pakistan’s ISI, calling it the “plot of a C-grade Bollywood movie.”In his first public statement on the matter, Gogoi clarified that his wife spent only one year in Pakistan in 2013 while working on an international project focused on climate change in South Asia.“About 14–15 years ago, my wife — a well-known expert in public policy — was involved in an international initiative addressing climate change in South Asia. As part of that work, she spent a year in Pakistan and then came to India in 2012–13, where she has been working ever since. In 2015, she took up a new job,” the Congress leader said.“I accompanied her in 2013, about 12 years ago. The chief minister is trying to turn this into a C-grade Bollywood movie with a so-called release date of September 10. This story is bound to be a complete flop. The people of Assam are already aware of the truth,” he added.Gogoi also raised questions about the timing and intent behind the allegations.“Our counter-question is this: if, according to these accusations, my wife or I committed any wrongdoing or illegal act, then who has been in power for the last 11–12 years? What have the central agencies been doing all this time? Everyone knows the level of scrutiny involved when someone crosses a national border — whether entering or exiting,” Gogoi said.“As a leader of the opposition who speaks boldly and openly in Parliament, my biodata is known to everyone,” he added.Reacting to Gogoi’s remarks, chief minister Sarma welcomed the Congress MP’s “admission” and claimed that credible evidence supports allegations of Gogoi's ties with the Pakistani establishment.“Finally, Congress MP Shri Gaurav Gogoi has admitted that he visited Pakistan. But let us be very clear — this is just the beginning, not the end,” Sarma wrote on X.“What lies ahead is far more serious. There exists every reasonable ground, supported by credible inputs and documented information, to suggest that Shri Gogoi has maintained proximity with the Pakistani establishment. The Government of Assam, committed to transparency and accountability, will make everything public on September 10, once the Special Investigation Team (SIT) concludes its comprehensive inquiry. The people of Assam and the nation deserve the truth — and they shall have it in full,” he added.“But the people will also not forget — nor forgive — the Congress party and Shri Rahul Gandhi for deliberately promoting such a dangerous and compromised individual into the public life of our country,"" Sarma added.During a press conference, later in the day, Sarma claimed that Gogoi is a ""Pakistani agent"" and his wife maintain close ties with its establishment.""Whatever he (Gaurav Gogoi) has revealed is only 10 per cent. He and his wife are deeply involved in anti-India activities. His son was born in India and later got British citizenship. He surrendered his son's Indian passport there are very serious allegations. I have documents to prove his wife's involvement in collecting Indian Intelligence input. I will reveal details on September 10,"" Sarma said.""The entire point was to dethrone Bhupen Borah. He (Gogoi) could have admitted that before his appointment. He is very smart. He knows that he has to admit. So, he admitted after taking the appointment letter as a Congress president. But today also he made a very wrong statement. His Pakistan visit had nothing to do with his wife. That was an independent visit with the approval of Interior Department of Pakistan. This is about national security, about Bharat. This has nothing to do with elections. His wife was snooping on our IB. I have documents to prove that. It was all because of taking advantage of Tarun Gogoi's position. They crafted their role within Indian establishment. It was snooping on behalf of a particular climate activist group,"" he added.This come days after Sarma alleged that Gogoi visited Pakistan on the “ISI’s invitation” and worked closely with the establishment.Sarma had claimed, “Gaurav Gogoi visited Pakistan on an invitation from the ISI. This is the first time I’m publicly stating this. We have documents to support it. He did not go there for tourism. He went there to receive training.”He added that Gogoi, who is the deputy leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha, traveled on a direct invitation from the Pakistani government, calling the visit “dangerous.”“He was working closely with the Pakistan establishment. When does a Home Department issue an invitation? Only to impart training,” Sarma asserted. “An invitation from the foreign affairs department or a university is an entirely different matter. This was not from the foreign ministry or cultural department. He went on a direct invitation from Pakistan’s Home Department,” he claimed.","Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma claims that gaurav gogoi is a ""pakistani agent"" and his wife maintain close ties with the pakistani establishment.

Congress ups the ante



How government has responded



NEW DELHI: ""If terrorism is a rabid dog, Pakistan is its vile handler. We must first unite the world to tackle this wild handler—else it will continue to breed more rabid dogs,"" boomed TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee ’s emotional voice to thunderous applause from the Indian diaspora in Tokyo.The rest of Abhishek's speech was in sync with what the government has repeatedly reiterated. He said Pakistan was given ample time to clean its house, and when it refused to act, India — “honourable in action” — decimated nine terror establishments across the border without harming civilian infrastructure.Abhishek's succinct portrayal of India’s modus operandi to the global community has been eclipsed only by Shashi Tharoor in the opposition ranks, who not only took Pakistan to the cleaners but, in his suave manner, blasted Donald Trump’s repeated hyphenation of India-Pakistan and his boastful claim of using trade as leverage to broker peace.Tharoor's jab at “gentleman” Trump may have earned him further plaudits among a growing mass of admirers, but Congress is unlikely to gain political brownie points from it. Its barely hidden contempt for Tharoor’s freewheeling, independent stance, evident in not nominating him for the all-party meet is another example of an organisation that has failed to read the room and has shown strategic tone-deafness. Congress, despite its diplomatic pedigree, missed an opportunity to leverage its best communicator on foreign soil.As a former Under-Secretary-General of the UN and MoS MEA, Tharoor holds elite credentials to lucidly elucidate India’s stance on terror, and not nominating the four-time MP is certainly not a fair assessment of his skillset.Incidentally, the government had sought to overrule both Congress and TMC in nominating leaders of its choice. In TMC's case, in the absence of the ailing Sudip Banerjee, it nominated Yusuf Pathan , while Tharoor was incidentally named as head of the group visiting the US and four other countries. While TMC put its foot down and insisted on selecting its own representative, eventually ensuring that Abhishek Banerjee flew to Tokyo, Congress neither managed to persuade the ruling dispensation nor dissuade Tharoor from leading the delegation.Even in domestic optics, Congress appears to be trailing. Regarding the visit to Poonch, Congress seems to have taken a leaf out of TMC’s book. According to J&K CM Omar Abdullah, it was the TMC that initiated the process of visiting Poonch, which bore the brunt of Pakistan’s barbarism during Operation Sindoor , leading to the deaths of innocent civilians.Abhishek Banerjee visiting Rash Behari Bose's grave in Tokyo, a key aide of Netaji, has resonated with Bengali nationalists. Taking cue from Abhishek, the rest of the delegation, along with the Indian ambassador, went to pay their respects, which TMC touted as “Bengal showing the way.”Netaji's grandnephew Chandra Bose, too, praised Abhishek Banerjee for visiting the historic site. When contacted by the Times of India, former BJP leader Chandra Kumar Bose was emphatic that this is the time for national unity and that TMC is doing what any responsible party should do. He hoped that Congress too would mellow its belligerence and keep all the probing questions for a later day, probably once Parliament is in session. His impassioned plea to all political parties is to maintain communal harmony and not be swayed by the evil designs of the Pahalgam terrorists.Professor Sibaji Pratim Basu believes there is more than meets the eye in TMC's extremely well-calibrated stance post-Operation Sindoor. He argues that with assembly elections due in Bengal in a year, the party is in no mood to put a foot wrong. However, once the election draws closer, TMC may well tighten the screws on the BJP, questioning why the government didn’t go for the jugular and attempt to take PoK. The likes of Madhya Pradesh BJP minister Vijay Shah passing disparaging comments against Colonel Sofiya Qureshi will also be raised before the appropriate electorate, Basu believes.As for Congress, he contends that the party is willing to play hardball because this year is relatively election-free until the end — and in any case, it isn’t a major player in Bihar. According to him, the lack of effective messaging remains the biggest flaw in Rahul Gandhi ’s political playbook. The fact that Shashi Tharoor has provided a ringing endorsement of India’s policy regarding Operation Sindoor, Basu predicts, will be used by the BJP to blunt the pointed queries of the grand old party in Parliament.Political analyst Professor Subhamoy Maitra looks at TMC's strategy through a critical lens. He believes TMC is a party that isn’t ideologically driven. It operates through meticulous political planning in an opportunistic fashion. Maitra minces no words and calls TMC a “political chameleon” — hawkish on foreign policy one day, repositioning itself as a peacenik the next, if the situation demands. According to the veteran analyst, TMC, assured of a lion’s share of the minority vote, is now also trying to make the right noises for the majority community ahead of the assembly election next year.Maitra believes Abhishek Banerjee's visit hits the mark politically, but can’t help wondering if the entire episode — from Yusuf Pathan’s withdrawal to the TMC general secretary stepping in — was a well-coordinated political stunt. As for Congress, Professor Maitra believes the grand old party is staying true to its centrist roots and is therefore shying away from completely mirroring the BJP on a national security issue. He infers that the party is merely leveraging the lack of transparency in the India–US equation.Professor Basu and many others believe TMC has learnt from past missteps. After the Pulwama attack, Mamata Banerjee had taken a controversial stance by asking for proof of India’s assault on Balakot. It didn’t play out well with the masses, and the BJP had a field day branding her anti-national. At a 2019 election rally in Kolkata, PM Modi said, “Kolkata’s Didi was more pained than people in Islamabad and Rawalpindi…Leaders of the mahagathbandhan...shouted so much that they became heroes in Pakistan.”Politics is often driven by narrative — and that’s where TMC had failed to read the tea leaves post-Balakot. Other opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, who campaigned hard on alleged corruption in the Rafale deal, were humbled in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. The BJP, surprisingly, delivered its best-ever performance in Bengal, winning 18 of the state’s 42 seats.From the clarion call to annex PoK to Abhishek’s pointed “rabid dog” analogy, TMC is eager to match the BJP’s fervent nationalistic pitch. Congress, on the other hand, after a muted response during Operation Sindoor, has upped the political ante. Its sharp attack on S Jaishankar for what felt like a clearly out-of-context comment has baffled many. Congress leader Pawan Khera has already referred to Jaishankar as Jaichand, the medieval ruler who helped “outsider” Muhammad Ghori defeat Prithviraj Chauhan.Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi has posted on X calling the External Affairs Minister “JJ,” posing three questions and claiming “India’s foreign policy has collapsed.” While what “JJ” means is open to interpretation, the phrasing of the questions virtually endorses Trump’s assertions about brokering peace.Sure, the government should clarify Trump’s claims, and when asked on foreign soil, Jaishankar cheekily said, “The US was in the United States” during Operation Sindoor. Tharoor again rightly dissected Trump’s logic, exposing its transactional underbelly and performative bravado. But the rest of Congress seems more interested in scoring quick hits than crafting a coherent foreign policy stance.As for the accusation that Jaishankar informed Pakistan in advance, even P Chidambaram has responded in guarded fashion. He told Indian Express that Rahul Gandhi rightly asked, and the MEA has clarified, hence, “I have no further comment.” Where Congress could have genuinely grilled the government was on why the Pahalgam attackers haven’t been caught even after a month, or how the attack was allowed to happen in the first place. Instead, it went off-script, launching personal tirades — a risky strategy at a time when the nation appears united behind Operation Sindoor.Jaishankar, on his part, has clarified in the Consultative Committee of Parliament that Pakistan was only informed after India had hit the terror targets. According to sources, he also cleared the air on Trump’s mediation claims, stating emphatically that the ceasefire was initiated solely through bilateral discussion after Pakistan reached out. Congress sources, however, maintain that they are not fully satisfied with the explanation provided.PM Modi, too, speaking from his home state, indirectly addressed Trump’s claim, stating that it was Pakistan that couldn’t bear India’s military onslaught and waved the white flag. Appealing to the good sense of Pakistani citizens, he urged them to remove their country from the clutches of terrorism. If the red lines are crossed,""the bullets are ready,” came the dire warning.It remains to be seen how Congress responds to this emphatic assertion from PM Modi about how events unfolded during Operation Sindoor. So far, Congress’s messaging has appeared muddled and misdirected, a sharp contrast to its INDIA ally, TMC. The likes of Alka Lamba’s gaffe, calling Operation Sindoor “Operation Blue Star,” have certainly not helped its cause. There may still be time to course-correct, but for now, TMC has emerged as the craftier and more calibrated opposition.In a year where perception may outweigh ideology, the real contest may be between message discipline and narrative drift.",Abhishek banerjee's succinct portrayal of india’s modus operandi has been eclipsed only by shashi tharoor in the opposition ranks. The government had sought to overrule both congress and tmc in nominating leaders of its choice.

Poll Should India collaborate with international partners for the AMCA project? Yes, it can enhance technology sharing No, we should develop independently

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday green-lighted the 'Made in India' fighter jet programme to produce a fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).India has been working on the ambitious AMCA project to develop a medium-weight, deep-penetration fighter jet with advanced stealth capabilities to bolster its air power.The AMCA, along with the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), is expected to form the backbone of the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the coming decades.""In a significant push towards enhancing India's indigenous defence capabilities and fostering a robust domestic aerospace industrial ecosystem, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has approved the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) Programme Execution Model,"" the ministry of defence said.The ministry added that private sector companies are invited to participate in the project.""They can bid either independently or as a joint venture or as consortia. The entity/bidder should be an Indian company compliant with the laws and regulations of the country,"" the ministry said in a statement.The development also comes amid heightened tensions with Pakistan following Operation Sindoor which claimed over 100 terrorists.The government has focused on enhancing India’s air power, especially in light of China's rapid advancements in the domain.Meanwhile, China now accounts for over 80% of Pakistan's arms imports.A recent US intelligence report claimed that Pakistan is the ""primary recipient"" of China’s economic and military generosity and foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan's armed forces are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China.""Foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan’s WMD programs are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China, and sometimes are transshipped through Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. However, terrorist attacks targeting Chinese workers who support China Pakistan Economic Corridor projects has emerged as a point of friction between the countries; seven Chinese nationals were killed in Pakistan in 2024,"" it added.Also read: Why India is fighting a Pakistan armed by China ""Pakistan primarily is a recipient of China’s economic and military largesse, and Pakistani forces conduct multiple combined military exercises every year with China’s PLA, including a new air exercise completed in November 2024,"" the report said.Last year, the Cabinet Committee on Security, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, granted in-principle approval to the AMCA programme. The indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet project is expected to play a pivotal role in strengthening the IAF’s combat capabilities.The estimated development cost of the AMCA project stands at approximately Rs 15,000 crore.The IAF has long advocated for the AMCA programme, given its long-term strategic requirements and the absence of a fifth-generation fighter jet in its current fleet. In contrast, China has already inducted its Chengdu J-20 jets, which it claims to be fifth-generation air superiority fighters with precision strike capabilities.India’s confidence in the AMCA initiative received a major boost following the successful development of the LCA Tejas.Developed by state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the Tejas has proven to be a capable platform for air combat and offensive missions, with secondary roles in reconnaissance and anti-ship operations.Meanwhile, the IAF is also in the process of acquiring 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) to enhance its operational readiness. In April 2019, the IAF issued a Request for Information (RFI) for the procurement, estimated at around USD 18 billion.

JAISALMER: A state government employee was detained on Wednesday in Rajasthan on suspicion of spying for Pakistan's spy agency ISI amid a widening crackdown on espionage networks across the country after Operation Sindoor.Sakur Khan Mangaliyar, employed with the state's employment department, was picked up by a joint team of CID and intelligence agencies from his office in Jaisalmer. Mangaliyar is expected to be transferred to Jaipur for further questioning.Authorities are also probing a suspected connection between Mangaliyar and a senior Congress politician from the border region. Security agencies have withheld comment on political links. Sources said Mangaliyar served as a personal assistant to a Congress functionary during the previous Congress-led state govt.Mangaliyar, a resident of Mangaliya's Dhani in Baroda village near the Pakistan border, had been under surveillance for several weeks. Investigators found multiple Pakistani phone numbers in his mobile device and reported that he could not provide credible explanations. He also admitted to traveling to Pakistan at least seven times in recent years, raising further concerns.SP Sudhir Chaudhary said the inquiry began following alerts from ""higher headquarters"" over suspicious activities. ""We are verifying all facts and conducting an inquiry,"" he added.Though no military-related photos or videos were found on his phone, officials said several files had been deleted. Two bank accounts under his name are currently under scrutiny.

NEW DELHI/GUWAHATI: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma and newly appointed Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi continued to skirmish on Wednesday over the former's charge that his opponent had quietly visited Pakistan.While Gogoi said the CM's ""ludicrous and ridiculous"" allegations were part of an unsuccessful political plot to sow seeds of doubt in the mind of Congress brass and discourage them from appointing him the state unit chief, Sarma claimed his charge had been validated with the Congress neta finally ""admitting"" that he had visited Pakistan. CM also said Gogoi had been economical with facts and police would soon bring out the full truth.Addressing a press conference, Gogoi said his wife, ""a well-known expert in public policy"", worked on an international project in south Asia on climate change, and spent a year in Pakistan before returning to India around 2012-13. She later took up a new job in 2015 and he too went to Pakistan once in 2013. He said the people of Assam had known these facts during the 11-year term of BJP-led Centre, which conducts background checks on opposition members, especially those like him who speak freely in Parliament.Sarma took to X to say Gogoi's ""admission"" that he did travel to Pakistan was just the tip of the iceberg of his links with the enemy country and his govt would reveal the full story through its investigative report on Sept 10. ""Today he admitted (going to Pakistan) because he knows Sept 10 is approaching. But he has made a very false statement (that he went to visit his wife). It was an independent visit, approved by the Interior Department of Pakistan,"" he said. ""What I will reveal on Sept 10 will make Rahul Gandhi regret appointing such a person to a leadership role,"" Sarma said, adding, ""There are serious national security concerns at stake...""Gogoi said, ""The CM has said he will make revelations on Sept 10. Is this a movie? This is a sensitive issue and he should reveal now what he has. BJP 's job is defamation and they are creating this whole thing like a C-grade Bollywood movie which will flop miserably.""Sarma had written, ""This is just the beginning, not the end. What lies ahead is far more serious. There exists every reasonable ground, supported by credible inputs and documented information, to suggest that Shri Gogoi has maintained proximity with the Pakistani establishment."" He also alleged Gogoi's British wife was ""snooping on our IB"" on behalf of a climate activist group ""and I have documents to prove that"".Gogoi alleged the CM's ""smear campaign"" is a tactic to cover up the activities of his own family, adding he has amassed huge wealth and property through his family, which heads 17 companies and gets benefits of govt contracts. He further said illegal coal and drugs had emerged as the ""biggest diseases"" of northeast under BJP's patronage, and the reality of the region was far from the claims made during the ""rising North East summit"", which was addressed by PM Narendra Modi.","Assam cm himanta biswa sarma and newly appointed assam congress president gaurav gogoi continued to skirmish on wednesday.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan remains tight-lipped on a wave of drone attacks in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, with a suspected quadcopter strike injuring 22 civilians, including seven minors, during a volleyball match in Azam Warsak, South Waziristan, on Tuesday night.The attack, echoing a deadly May 19 strike in North Waziristan that killed four children, has sparked fury over the govt’s silence and lack of accountability in the volatile tribal regions bordering Afghanistan.The latest assault, security locals said, occurred around 8 pm local time, targeting civilians aged 13 to 60. A 13-year-old boy and an adult male were critically injured and transferred to tertiary care, with seven others severely wounded. “We were playing volleyball when the explosion hit, followed by gunfire. It was pure panic,” said a resident, requesting anonymity.The North Waziristan attack in Hurmuz village on May 19 had led to an eight-day sit-in at Mir Ali town. Locals accused authorities of targeting civilians under counter-terrorism pretexts. The military’s media affairs wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), denied involvement, blaming the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but offered no clarity.Tuesday’s strike follows a pattern of unclaimed attacks. In March 2025, 11 civilians, including women and children, died in Mardan in an attack that locals said was delivered by drones, though authorities claimed it targeted militants.In Sept 2024, a drone strike in Upper South Waziristan killed one and injured three, with no official response. Historically, US drone strikes in Pakistan’s tribal areas, peaking between 2004 and 2018, drew fierce condemnation for civilian casualties. Pakistan’s protests against US operations, including diplomatic complaints to the UN, contrasted with its own use of armed quadcopters against alleged TTP militants in tribal districts and other parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 2020, often without acknowledging civilian tolls.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has demanded independent probes, citing violations of due process in both foreign and domestic strikes.Islamabad’s silence on the latest attack fuels distrust. Pakistan attributes tribal violence to groups like TTP, as in the ISPR’s North Waziristan response, but its failure to address quadcopter incidents — whether by state forces or militants — deepens local resentment. “If drones keep targeting Waziristan, how do we answer our people,” an elder asked during the Mir Ali protests, a sentiment amplified after Tuesday’s attack. Civilians, particularly children, bear the brunt of conflict in a region scarred by militancy and military operations.","Pakistan remains tight-lipped on a wave of drone attacks in northwestern khyber pakhtunkhwa province. 22 civilians, including seven minors, were injured during a volleyball match in azam warsak, south waziristan, on tuesday night.
