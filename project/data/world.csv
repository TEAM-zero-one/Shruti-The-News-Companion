'Jets were shot down': Donald Trump says stopped a lot of wars; again brings up India-Pakistan conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jets-were-shot-down-donald-trump-says-stopped-a-lot-of-wars-again-brings-up-india-pakistan-conflict/articleshow/122776193.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)





US President Donald Trump on Friday once again claimed credit for preventing a major conflict between India and Pakistan, saying the two nuclear-armed nations were ""hitting each other"" and that ""four or five jets were shot down"" before tensions were eased ""through trade talks. ""Speaking at a private dinner with Republican lawmakers at the White House, Trump said, ""We stopped a lot of wars. And these were serious, India and Pakistan, that was going on… These are two serious nuclear countries, and they were hitting each other. You know, it seems like a new form of warfare.""""Planes were being shot out of the air… five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down, actually,"" he added.He went on to explain how his administration used trade negotiations as leverage to calm tensions. ""India and Pakistan were going at it, and they were back and forth, and it was getting bigger and bigger, and we got it solved through trade. We said, you guys want to make a trade deal,"" he said.""We're not making a trade deal if you're going to be throwing around weapons, and maybe nuclear weapons, both very powerful nuclear states,"" he added.Trump also claimed that US also dismantled Iran's nuclear program.""You saw it recently when you looked at what we did in Iran, where we knocked out their nuclear capability, totally knocked out that,"" he asserted.This isn’t the first time Trump has made such a claim.Earlier in the week, he said, ""We've been very successful in settling wars. You have India and Pakistan. You have Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years. India, by the way, Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly, and we did that through trade.""""I said, 'we're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled,’ and they did, and they were both great, great leaders, and they were great,"" he added.While Trump has reiterated that he helped ""stop"" the conflict through diplomacy and trade pressure, the actual peace move actually began when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) contacted his Indian counterpart to request a halt to all hostilities, on land, in the air, and at sea.Tensions had sharply escalated following a deadly terror attack on April 22 in Jammu and Kashmir’s Anantnag district. The strike, carried out by Pakistan-backed militants in Pahalgam, killed 26 people.In response, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, with the Indian Air Force (IAF) targeting nine major terror hubs inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Pakistan attempted to retaliate with drones and missile strikes, but Indian air defence systems successfully intercepted all incoming threats. As tensions rose, the IAF carried out precision strikes on 11 Pakistani airbases, including strategic sites such as Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan.While there were no casualties or structural damage reported in India, the Indian military released visual proof of the damage caused by its cross-border strikes.The IAF’s strong air defence capabilities played a crucial role in safeguarding Indian airspace during the exchange, neutralising multiple UAV and drone threats.","Us president donald trump on friday once again claimed credit for preventing a major conflict between india and pakistan.

NEW DELHI: After the United States designated The Resistance Front (TRF), a Pakistan-backed proxy of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and the group behind the April 22 Pahalgam massacre that killed 26 civilians, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), China responded by condemning the attack and urging stronger regional cooperation against terrorism.China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian praised the US efforts to combat terrorism. Responding to the US state department’s designation of TRF as both a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), Lin said: ""China firmly opposes all forms of terrorism and strongly condemns the terrorist attack that occurred on April 22.

Dent in exports?

Can’t accept double standards on energy security, says India

Poll Should India take a stronger stand against unilateral sanctions? Yes, to safeguard national interests No, steady diplomacy works best

NEW DELHI: Nayara Energy’s refinery in Gujarat’s Vadinar became the first in India to come under western sanctions as European Union Friday announced fresh curbs on Russian oil exports with the aim of throttling funding for Moscow’s war machine.“For the first time, we’re designating a flag registry and the biggest Rosneft refinery in India,” agencies quoted EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas as saying. India responded, saying it “does not subscribe to any unilateral sanction measures. We are a responsible actor and remain fully committed to our legal obligations.”Govt of India considers the provision of energy security a responsibility of paramount importance to meet the basic needs of its citizens. We would stress that there should be no double standards, especially when it comes to energy trade,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.The new measures include lowering the current price cap of $60/barrel, the threshold at which countries outside the G7 grouping of seven developed economies can buy Russian oil and access Western shipping as well as insurance services.Additionally, 105 off-radar vessels have been sanctioned, bringing the total to 223 out of a fleet of 400 oil tankers and limiting Moscow’s ability to evade the price cap.Rosneft, along with partners — commodities trader Trafigura and Russian investment firm UCP (United Capital Partners ) — had acquired the refinery with a capacity of 20 million tonnes per annum and associated assets from Essar Oil for $12.9 billion in 2017.Rosneft holds 49.1% in the venture. The refinery depends on exports to Europe and Africa as a small retail network of 6,750 fuel stations limits domestic sales. Curbs on products derived from Russian oil could cloud exports, impacting operations and threatening jobs. The curbs will also derail Rosneft’s bid to exit the venture because sanctions make repatriation of profit impossible.As reported by TOI earlier, the Russian giant had initiated talks with Reliance Industries Ltd for selling its stake in Nayara but the asking price of $20 billion was proving to be a hurdle. The new price cap will be graded in a band to the market average as subdued prices rendered the present cap less effective.","Nayara energy's refinery in gujarat’s vadinar became the first in india to come under western sanctions.

India welcomes move

MEA: TRF ban timely, important, strong assertion of Indo-US ties

Pakistan on Thursday suffered the humiliation of having its latest terror avatar, The Resistance Front (TRF), responsible for the Pahalgam massacre, being designated a Foreign Terrorist Organisation by the US state department.TRF was also termed a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” in concurrence with the US treasury department. In a statement, secretary of state Marco Rubio called TRF, whose existence Islamabad denies, a “front and proxy” for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-backed terror outfit responsible for numerous terror attacks in India, including the 26/11 Mumbai carnage that killed 159.In a separate notification published in the Federal Register, Rubio said based upon a review of the administrative record assembled in this matter, and in consultation with the attorney general and the treasury secretary, he has concluded that “there is a sufficient factual basis to find that Lashkar-e-Taiba uses the additional aliases The Resistance Front; TRF; Kashmir Resistance Front; and Kashmir Resistance”. The linkage endorsed India’s stand that LeT continues to re-invent itself in Pakistan under new names.The announcement by the US state department designating TRF a Foreign Terrorist Organisation not only strengthens India's case for a UN ban on TRF but also spotlights Pakistan-sponsored terrorism exactly when Islamabad is looking to corner India on the J&K issue, using its ongoing presidency of the Security Council (UNSC) to hold an open debate next week on unresolved disputes.External affairs minister S Jaishankar welcomed the development, calling it a strong affirmation of India-US counterterrorism cooperation and appreciating the role of his counterpart Marco Rubio and the State Department.Separately, the MEA said in a statement that this was a timely and important step as the TRF had been involved in numerous terror-related activities, including the Pahalgam terrorist attack for which it twice claimed responsibility. As a non-permanent member, Pakistan had earlier worked – with help from China – to dilute the UNSC condemnation of the attack.One of the things it insisted on was removal of the terror group’s name from the statement. Since 2023 – well before the Pahalgam attack – India had been sharing information with the Monitoring Team of the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee, pointing to the TRF’s role as a cover for Pakistan based UN-proscribed terror groups like LeT and Jaish-eMohammed (JeM), for an international ban on the group.The govt is hoping that the US designation will bolster the case for TRF’s listing by the 1267 committee, even though it will be subject to approval not just by China but also, for now, Pakistan, a non-permanent member of the UNSC till the end of next year.“India has consistently emphasized the need for global cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the dismantling of terror infrastructure. The designation of TRF is a timely and important step reflecting the deep cooperation between India and the United States on counterterrorism,” said the ministry.The US ban on TRF is also the first real show of intent by the US under the second Trump administration to pin Pakistan down on the issue of cross-border terrorism. It follows multiple conflicting signals from Trump himself who made repeated remarks after India’ Operation Sindoor that seemed to equate India, which sees itself as the victim and not aggressor, with Pakistan.Trump, in fact, continues to maintain – much to the delight of Pakistan – that he mediated the India-Pakistan ceasefire, preventing a nuclear conflagration. “These actions... demonstrate the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,” Rubio said in a statement, even as Islamabad is angling for a US presidential visit on the margins of the Quad summit in India later this year.Pakistan reacted with its customary denials to the terror designations, insisting it is a “frontline state against terrorism” despite legions of terrorists from Osama bin Laden to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed sheltering there and its nationals conducting numerous terrorist attacks across the world, including in the US.“Investigations into the Pahalgam incident… are still inconclusive. Any linkage with LeT, a defunct organisation banned in Pakistan, belies ground realities,” Pakistan’s foreign ministry said.","Pakistan's latest terror avatar, the resistance front (trf), responsible for the pahalgam massacre, was designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the us state department.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s Rahim Yar Khan airbase, which was hit by Indian missiles during Operation Sindoor over two months ago, is still not operational, an indication of the extent of damage the strategic military installation suffered. Pakistan airport authority is learnt to have issued another ‘Notice to Airmen’, aka ‘Notam’, for its runway, declaring it unusable till Aug 5, sources said.The airbase, located around 230 km south of Bahawalpur, holds a strategic place in Pakistan’s southern air defence due to its proximity to India’s Rajasthan border. It had suffered massive damage in the precision strikes carried out by India early in May. In May-end, PM Narendra Modi had said at a rally in Rajasthan’s Bikaner that the airbase was in ‘ICU’.Located within the perimeters of an international airport, the airbase had issued the first Notam on the evening of May 10 declaring the runway non-operational for a week (May 18), and later extended it. Notam was again issued in early June, extending the closure of the airbase until July 4. The latest notice said the runway is unavailable for flight operations due to “work in progress”.The airbase serves as a forward operating base for the Pakistan Air Force central command and was used heavily for military purposes.The missiles fired at Rahim Yar Khan airbase caused a massive crater on its runway, a Pakistan district commissioner had told the local press in May. However, the damage, clearly, was much bigger than a crater as the airbase has been non-functional for over two months.Besides this airbase, simultaneous attacks were carried out on Nur Khan airbase at Chaklala in Rawalpindi, the Rafiqui airbase at Shorkot in Punjab, the Murid airbase in Chakwal and the Chunian airbase in Punjab. Pakistan officials had acknowledged damage to transport aircraft at Nur Khan and technical facilities at Chunian.Similarly, the Markaz Subhan Allah terror camp in Bahawalpur, reduced to rubble in airstrikes, has been shut down indefinitely with the Jaish-e-Muhammed brass looking for a new address, preferably in a densely populated area, sources said.","2 months after sindoor, pak’s rahim yar khan base still shut down.

'Time For Revival...': Russia's Big Unity Call To Rivals India & China | 'RIC Troika Will...'

(With inputs from agencies)

BEIJING/NEW DELHI: China on Thursday expressed its support for Russia’s initiative to revive the dormant Russia-India-China (RIC) troika.Russian news portal Izvestia on Thursday quoted Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko as saying that Moscow expects the resumption of the RIC format and is negotiating on this issue with Beijing and New Delhi.“This topic appears in our negotiations with both of them. We are interested in making this format work, because these three countries are important partners, besides being the founders of BRICS,” Rudenko said.“Therefore, the absence of this format, in my opinion, looks inappropriate. In this regard, we expect that the countries will agree to resume work within the framework of the RIC — of course, when relations between these states reach a level that allows them to work in a trilateral format,” he said.In India, the ministry of external affairs said RIC is a consultative format where the three countries discuss global issues and regional issues of interest to them. “As to when this particular RIC format meeting is going to be held, it is something that will be worked out among the three countries in a mutually convenient manner,” said the spokesperson.Asked for his reaction to Rudenko’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Thursday said, “China-Russia-India cooperation not only serves the respective interests of the three countries but also helps uphold peace, security, stability and progress in the region and the world.”China stands ready to maintain communication with Russia and India on advancing the trilateral cooperation, he said.The Russian and Chinese interests in the revival of RIC followed the recent visit of foreign minister S Jaishankar to China to take part in the SCO foreign ministers meeting, during which he held talks with his Chinese and Russian counterpaerts Wang Yi and Sergei Lavrov.Joint work in the RIC format was stalled, first because of the Covid pandemic and then by the India-China military standoff at eastern Ladakh in 2020.",China expresses its support for russia’s initiative to revive the dormant russia-india-china troika.

‘This is a story of universal values, a story of ours to tell’

If Ram could send one tweet from the forest, what would he say? If Raavan could do a TED talk, what would it be titled? A week before the premiere of ‘ Ramayana ’ at the Arts Council of Pakistan in Karachi on July 11, 30-year-old finance grad-turned-director Yogeshwar Karera shot off Karan Johar-style rapid-fire questions at his cast for a social media promo.This was no ordinary stage production — the Hindu epic had never been performed in Pakistan before. The cast was entirely Muslim, except for the director, and the play used AI to enhance storytelling. Despite recent Indo-Pak tensions, it sold around 1,000 tickets and generated buzz on both sides of the border.“We weren’t expecting such a response,” says Karera, surprised by the congratulatory messages pouring in for Mauj Collective, the theatre group he co-founded a year ago. He says the near-war between the two countries did not impact the play. “The sponsors and venues had no reservations at all about staging it. Only the media has asked us these questions. In fact, it didn’t even cross our minds that this might be seen as sensitive or controversial,” says Raana Kazmi, co-founder of Mauj Collective with a day job in human resources.People from all backgrounds came, regardless of their religion.Families with kids, students, the elderly, everyone. A friend told me about how a parent explained each scene to their child,” says Kazmi, who played the role of Sita. Samhan Ghazi brought fierce intensity to the role of Raavan. Karera, a Sindhi who moved to Karachi in his teens, says his fascination for the epic tale of good triumphing over evil started young.“I was five years old when I first watched Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan on Doordarshan. The story grabbed me from the start,” says Karera, who decided to pursue theatre full time in the middle of his finance and accounting degree.After getting a diploma at the National Academy of Performing Arts in Pakistan, Karera and two friends, Kazmi and Sana Toaha, founded Mauj Collective. The year-old theatre troupe uses tech-savvy stagecraft, social media flair and scripts that speak to a younger generation.Although some have interpreted Mauj’s ‘Ramayana’ as a statement on religious unity, the group maintains their goal wasn’t about sending a message. “None of us ever felt like we were telling a story outside the world we inhabit. I’ve grown up with this story of the Ramayana. I may not belong to the community religiously, but this is a story of our subcontinent. It never felt like the story wasn’t ours to tell. The values in it are universal,” says Ashmal Lalwany, who played Ram in the production.Some Sanskrit and Hindi words were adapted to terms more familiar to a Karachi audience. For instance, ‘prakriti’ became ‘kudrat’. Sometimes, this would lead to amusing confusion. “In one scene, Hanuman is supposed to give me a ring.Now, I know the word ‘anguthi’ means ‘ring,’ and that’s it. But one day during rehearsal, Jibran Khan (who plays Hanuman) says, “Aap is mundrika ko dekhein”. I was just standing there like, ‘Where am I supposed to look? What is a mundrika?” laughs Kazmi.","Young drama group stages pak’s 1st ramayana in karachi.

Congress seeks 2 days to discuss Pahalgam

NEW DELHI: Ahead of Parliament’s Monsoon session, several Union ministers, including Rajnath Singh , Amit Shah, J P Nadda and Kiren Rijiju, on Friday strategised over the BJP-led govt’s stand on germane issues amid the opposition raising the heat on matters such as the revision of Bihar’s electoral rolls, Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor The strategy session of the group of ministers at defence minister Singh’s residence also comes ahead of the customary all-party meeting scheduled on Sunday. Though there was no official comment on the agenda of the Friday meeting, sources said it was related to the Parliament session. Union ministers Piyush Goyal and G Kishan Reddy were among those present at the strategy meeting. Singh is likely to chair the all-party meeting.Opposition parties have also been pushing the govt to bring a bill in Parliament on restoring statehood to J&K. On the special intensive revision (SIR) of rolls in Bihar, they have claimed that it is aimed at benefiting BJP. They have also seized on US President Donald Trump's claim of mediating the “ceasefire” between India and Pakistan during Operation Sindoor to attack the Modi govt. BJP and its Bihar allies have backed the SIR in the poll-bound state, asserting that it is aimed at ensuring that only eligible people are allowed to vote in the assembly polls and take welfare benefits.Ahead of the opposition’s meeting to chart the course for the coming monsoon session of Parliament, Congress said govt must allocate two days to discuss in Parliament the Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent events.The INDIA bloc will meet online on Saturday, while the Parliament session will get underway from Monday. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said the Pahalgam terror attack issue is serious as the terrorists have not been arrested yet, while the claims of US President Donald Trump about the IndiaPakistan “ceasefire” have added a new dimension to the cessation of Operation Sindoor.He said the revelations by three top defence officials including the chief of defence staff and the remarks of Lt General Rahul Singh about China’s role, have made the subject “very significant”.

INS Nistar is the first of the two such vessels being built by Hindustan Shipyard Ltd at a cost of Rs 2,393 crore.Seth lauded the Navy and the shipbuilding industry for consistently enhancing the indigenous content in warships through homegrown solutions and innovative technologies. “At present, all the 57 warships in the pipeline are being constructed indigenously,” he said.Admiral Tripathi, in turn, said: “INS Nistar is not just a technological asset, but a crucial operational enabler. She will provide submarine rescue support to Navy as well as our regional partners. This will enable India to emerge as a ‘preferred submarine rescue partner’ in the region”.Having state-of-the-art equipment like remotely operated vehicles, self-propelled hyperbaric lifeboats and diving compression chambers, INS Nistar can undertake deep sea saturation diving up to a depth of 300 metres. The vessel will also serve as ‘mother ship’ for deep submergence rescue vessels (DSRVs), which are basically mini-submarines that dive to “mate’’ with a disabled submarine to extricate sailors trapped deep underwater. INS Nistar is also equipped with a combination of remotely operated vessels to undertake diver monitoring and salvage operations up to a depth of 1,000 metres.","India on friday commissioned ins nistar, its first indigenously designed and constructed diving support vessel.

"For most Indian farmers, costs grow faster than income",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-most-indian-farmers-costs-grow-faster-than-income/articleshow/122772650.cms,"For most Indian farmers, costs grow faster than income

Inflation rate exceeded income growth

Indian farmers are hit by the double whammy of stagnant income and declining profit margins, according to an analysis of data compiled by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). For nearly all major crops, the increase in agricultural income over the last decade has not kept pace with the rural inflation rate.The data also shows that the profit margins for most crops have declined. The analysis of ten major crops for both kharif and rabi seasons shows that, except for maize, groundnut and rapeseed/mustard, the increase in farm income has been less than the rural inflation rate during the same period.In 2013-14, the average input cost was Rs 25,179 per hectare for paddy while the value of family labour was assessed at Rs 8,452 per hectare. The value of the crop was Rs 53,242 per hectare, which meant a profit of Rs 19,611 per hectare. In 2023-24, this profit increased to Rs 30,216 per hectare. Although this was a 54% jump, consumer prices in rural areas increased by 65% between 2013-14 and 2023-24. The crop also saw a decline in profit margins.I n 2013-14, the profit margin was 58% of the input and labour costs, which has now dropped to 49.3% of the cost. The input cost and family labour is taken as the total expense to calculate the profit margin since this spending is also part of the formula for Minimum Support Price (MSP). Wheat, unlike paddy, is primarily a rabi (winter) crop, but a comparison of decadal growth in income and margins shows a similar pattern.The surplus over input cost and family labour was Rs 29,442 per hectare in 2012-13 and increased by 53% to Rs 45,179 in 2022-23. That’s lower than the 71% increase in rural consumer prices between 2012-13 and 2022-23. The profit margin too decreased from 123% in 2012-13 to 103% in 2022-23. Sugarcane, another major crop, also saw a stagnation in net income.From Rs 96,451 per hectare in 2012-13, the profits increased to 1,21,668 in 2022-23. This 26% increase is lower than the increase in consumer price inflation. In 2012-13, the profit margin was 151%, which declined to 102% in 2022-23. Of the ten major crops (based on highest output) for which the comparison is done, only three have shown an increase in income higher than the inflation rate.These are maize (162%), rapeseed & mustard (85.7%) and groundnut (71.4%). For the rest, the increase was lower than the inflation rate. It was between 50% and 60% for gram, between 20% and 30% for soyabean and cotton, and less than 20% for arhar (tur). Apart from stagnant incomes, the profit margins have declined for all of these crops except maize. These per-hectare profits are roughly equal to the seasonal incomes for a vast majority of Indian farmers.The average land holding size in the Agriculture Census of 2015-16 was just under 1.1 hectares, but most farmers (68.5%) are marginal farmers, which means they own less than 1 hectare of land (averaging at 0.38 hectare). This means that seasonal income for them will be even lower. Experts have pointed out that the stagnation as well as lower agricultural income is due to the extent of mismatch between the share of agriculture in GDP and in employment.Despite contributing only 16% of GDP, agriculture employs more than 40% of India’s workforce. In advanced economies like the US, its share in GDP and employment is 0.9% and 2%, respectively. Even in a developing economy like China, agriculture’s contribution to GDP is 6.8% while it employs 22% of the workforce.","For most indian farmers, costs grow faster than income growth.

The department of state also reaffirmed the FTO status of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba.The Resistance Front was formed in 2019 as a proxy of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and was banned by the central government in 2023.It has been actively involved in recruiting youth online, facilitating the infiltration of terrorists, and smuggling weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into Jammu and Kashmir.TRF had also claimed responsibility for several attacks targeting civilians, political leaders, and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. Its founder and commander, Sheikh Sajjad Gul, has been designated a terrorist under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.According to security agencies, TRF’s operations are backed by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which uses the group as part of its strategy to keep the Kashmir region unstable.The April 22 attack, carried out in the Baisaran Valley, a popular tourist destination often called ""mini Switzerland"" -- is being described as the worst terror strike on civilians in Kashmir since the 2019 Pulwama bombing.","The resistance front (trf) is an offshoot of the banned lashkar-e-tayyiba.

India warns West on energy security double standards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-warns-west-on-energy-security-double-standards/articleshow/122674405.cms,"Petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri

NEW DELHI: India can arrange alternative supplies if Russian oil exports are sanctioned, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday in what is seen as the first official reaction to the US and EU threat of secondary sanctions for buying those barrels.“India has diversified the sources (of oil). I am not worried at all. If something happens, we will deal with it. There is sufficient supply available,” Puri said at an industry event.Separately, the foreign ministry said govt’s overriding priority was to secure the energy needs of its people, while also cautioning against any double standards on the issue.The comments, in response to media queries, followed NATO chief Mark Rutte’s threat, echoing the US, that countries like India, China and Brazil would take a battering for buying Russian exports.“Let me reiterate, and I have said this in the past as well. Securing energy needs of our people is understandably an overriding priority for us,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.“In this endeavour, we are guided by what is there on offer in the markets, as also by the prevailing global circumstances. We would particularly caution against any double standards on the matter,” he added. India has in the past too accused the West of having double standards on the issue, saying that European countries have themselves benefited from importing Russian energy for prolonged periods.Puri said India has built up “navigational resilience” by expanding the sourcing of oil from 40 countries against 27 countries earlier. “India has been clear that it will buy oil from wherever it has to. The prime minister’s commitment, in the final analysis, is to the Indian consumer,” he said.In addition, Puri said, more oil was coming into the global market from countries such as Brazil, Guyana and Canada that are not members of the OPEC+ grouping. “If a major source goes off the market, you diversify. The current debate in the oil market is whether prices will be in the range of $65-70 or $60-65 (per barrel),” he said.","Petroleum minister hardeep singh puri said india can arrange alternative supplies if russian oil exports are sanctioned.

Two other Pakistani terrorists were members of the squad.Satellite phone analysis has revealed that Sulaiman’s location on April 15 was in Tral forest, indicating he was in the vicinity of the attack site at Baisaran for almost a week before the incident. Sulaiman was also involved in the April 2023 attack on an Army truck in Poonch, in which five soldiers were killed. However, he laid low for the next two years, before carrying out the ISI-LeT mission.Sources did not reveal the identities of the two other Pakistani terrorists who selectively gunned down the 26 civilians — all men and 25 of them being Hindus.There are currently about 68 foreign terrorists and three local terrorists active in the Valley.

While their relationship now feels like a fairytale played out on NFL sidelines and Eras Tour stages, the early days of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ’s romance were anything but accidental. In fact, Kelce has openly admitted that he didn’t just rely on charm — he employed strategy, bold moves, and even a bit of backup from Swift’s own inner circle.On his New Heights podcast back in 2023, Kelce shocked listeners by revealing that he went to one of Swift’s Eras Tour concerts with a clear mission — to get her attention. He crafted a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it, hoping to hand it to the pop megastar. “I had someone playing cupid,” Kelce later told The Wall Street Journal in November 2023, confirming that a secret matchmaker inside Swift’s circle was feeding him helpful information about her.Though he never named the person, Kelce credited the mystery “cupid” with giving him valuable insight and helping him make his move at the right time. The insider even said Kelce was “lucky enough” to have her support — a wink at just how calculated this courtship really was.Their first date, which reportedly took place in New York City, came with high stakes. According to Kelce, he was surrounded by friends and family who all delivered the same brutally honest warning: “Do not f–k this up.”The pressure was real, but so was his determination. “I was never going to give up,” Kelce told WSJ, noting that no matter how untouchable Swift seemed, he was willing to risk rejection just for a chance.Looking back, the calculated beginning of their romance only adds to the depth of what has become one of pop culture’s most celebrated couples.
