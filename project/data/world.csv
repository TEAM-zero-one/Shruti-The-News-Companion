FM to table Manipur budget today, Shah to seek Prez rule nod

NEW DELHI: The budget session of Parliament resumes on Monday in the shadow of a spate of controversies along the ‘ opposition vs government ’ battleline, ranging from Trump’s comments on tariffs, duplicate voter identity card numbers, three-language policy and delimitation, amid indications that the non-budget issues may set off fireworks.Adding to the clutch of issues being debated in public are the renewed violence in Manipur and the Waqf amendment bill . The government is scheduled to bring a resolution to seek Parliament’s approval for proclamation of President’s rule in Manipur , and the opposition will use the discussion to raise the two years of continuing ethnic strife in the northeastern state. The state’s budget too will come up for discussion.The Centre last month placed Manipur under President’s rule after the resignation of beleaguered CM N Biren Singh. Also, the Centre is expected to bring the controversial Waqf bill for passage, which is being opposed by the entire opposition. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju has indicated that govt was in favour of early passage of the Waqf bill on which NDA allies have pledged support.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is to table the budget for Manipur on Monday, which has been under President’s rule since Feb 13. Home minister Amit Shah is expected to move a resolution seeking Parliament’s approval for proclamation of President’s rule in the state. The three-language policy and delimitation have become contentious in the south, with states banding together to question the Centre.Trump’s disparaging statements about India’s tariffs, and his recent announcement that India has agreed to lower tariffs, have elicited strong statements from Congress about the interests of India’s farmers and manufacturers. The party has demanded that the prime minister take Parliament into confidence on the discussions with the US about the proposed trade deal.At the same time, the opposition will corner government over the issue of duplicate EPIC numbers, which has become controversial after the claims by Trinamool Congress in West Bengal.",Finance minister nirmala sitharaman is to table the budget for manipur on monday.

India hints at tariff liberalisation



April 2 deadline

Ongoing talks

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump have agreed to advance negotiations on the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), ANI reported on Saturday citing sources. The development comes on the same day when foreign secretary Vikram Misri hinted that New Delhi might be considering liberalising tariffs.This mutually beneficial agreement, finalised in February 2025, aims to boost market access, reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and enhance supply chain integration.To achieve the goals of the agreement, both leaders have decided to appoint senior representatives to accelerate negotiations, enhance trade relations and foster economic cooperation, the sources revealed.The BTA is expected to impact various sectors, including goods and services. By increasing market access and reducing barriers, the agreement will facilitate smoother trade flows and create new opportunities for businesses on both sides.A day after Trump claimed that India had agreed to bring down tariffs, foreign secretary Vikram Misri refused to comment on the US president's remark. He, however, added that India in recent years had signed several trade pacts with partners based on tariff liberalisation.""There’s a lot of interest in statements coming out of the United States. I will not get into that at this point of time because these are ongoing discussions… But I would only point you towards the fact that we have in recent times entered into bilateral trade agreements which are based on tariff liberalisation with several partners,"" he said.""There are ongoing discussions with several other partners on these issues now. I think the ongoing discussions should be seen in that context. That is our general approach and it applies to any such engagement we have,” he added.Sources indicate that India is optimistic about resolving the tariff issue with the US in the coming weeks, ideally before the April 2 deadline.This was reflected in the MEA's response on the same, which said, ""Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.""India has already lowered its average applied tariffs for major developed nations, including Australia, UAE, Switzerland, and Norway, under recently concluded trade agreements.A delegation, led by commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal , had visited Washington from March 3 to 6, for discussions with the US counterpart on the trade agreement. The talks were part of a broader initiative to expand bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, with a focus on key sectors such as energy, defense, and technology.""Commerce and industry minister (Piyush Goyal) was in US and met his counterparts. Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said on Friday.","Prime minister narendra modi and us president donald trump have agreed to advance negotiations on the bilateral trade agreement.

Mufti Shah Mir , accused of helping Pakistan's ISI in kidnapping Indian businessman and former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav from Iran, was shot dead on Friday night by unidentified gunmen in Turbat, Balochistan Mir, known to be involved in human trafficking , was leaving the local mosque after Taraweeh (night) prayers when bikers ambushed him and shot him multiple times at point-blank range. According to a report in Dawn, Mir was immediately shifted to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.Mir, a human and arms trafficker, operated under the cover of a mufti (scholar) and was a member of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, an Islamic fundamentalist political party.Sources said he was an important conduit linked with ISI-led death squads and played a significant role in the abduction and extrajudicial killing of numerous Baloch youths. He was also instrumental in spreading religious extremism in Balochistan.In March 2016, Jadhav was abducted by a group led by Mullah Omar Irani of Jaish al-Adl from the Iran-Pakistan border and handed over to the Pakistan army through several intermediaries, including Mir. Irani was also killed, along with his two sons, in the same area (Turbat) in Nov 2020, allegedly by ISI.Mir is also suspected to have been gunned down by ISI operatives in what is believed to be an internal conflict that has been brewing for some time. Last week, two others of JUI-F -- Wadera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah -- were shot dead by bike-borne assailants in what the local police described as targeted killings. The security guard of one also sustained bullet injuries. Mir had also survived two attempts on his life last year and had recently restricted his movements. ""He was providing intelligence about Baloch fighters to the Pak army. In 2023, a teacher named Abdul Rauf was murdered over alleged blasphemy in Turbat. The killing was carried out on the instructions of Mir,"" a source informed.Jadhav, who was running a business in Chabahar (Iran) after a premature retirement from the Navy, was abducted and incarcerated on false charges in Pakistan. He was intercepted in the Chaman area of Balochistan on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on March 3, 2016. In April 2017, a Pakistani military court sentenced Jadhav to death, charging him with involvement in espionage and sabotage activities. India condemned the verdict as a premeditated murder. The International Court of Justice stayed the execution while asking the Pakistan government to review the conviction process besides grant consular access to India.","Mufti shah mir, accused of helping pakistan's isi in kidnapping indian businessman and former indian navy officer kulbhushan jadhav from iran, was shot dead on friday night.

NEW DELHI: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Friday said that the "" boundary question "" and specific differences between India and China must not dictate the bilateral relations between the two countries.While addressing his annual press conference in Beijing, Yi said that Indo-China relations made positive strides over the past year after the successful meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at Kazan in Russia.""As two ancient civilisations, we have enough wisdom and capability to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas pending a fair and reasonable solution to the boundary issue,"" Yi said.""We should never allow bilateral relations to be defined by the boundary question or specific differences to affect the overall picture of our bilateral ties. China believes that as the largest neighbours, both countries should be partners in each other's success,"" he added.The Chinese foreign minister said that the Xi and PM Modi provided strategic guidance for the improvement of ties at the Kazan meetingAfter this, both sides earnestly followed through on the important common understanding of the leaders, ""strengthened exchanges and practical cooperation at all levels and achieved a series of positive outcomes"", he added.This comes months after India and China completed the contentious disengagement process in Depsang and Demchok in Eastern Ladakh, bringing to an end the 54-month-old military standoff in the area, a giant step towards normalisation of bilateral tie.After the finalisation of the pact, Modi and Xi held talks in Kazan on October 23. In the meeting, the two sides decided to revive the various dialogue mechanisms.After that, national security advisor Ajit Doval and Wang held the 23rd Special Representatives (SR) dialogue in Beijing on December 18.On January 26, foreign secretary Vikram Misri travelled to the Chinese capital and held talks with his Chinese counterpart Sun Weidong under the framework of the 'Foreign seccretary-vice minister' mechanism.'We have the responsibility to take the lead'On the ongoing tariff war with US, Wang said that as important members of Global South, India and China must put up joint opposition against hegemonism and power politics""""A cooperative partnership between the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for both sides. There is every reason for us to support each other rather than undermine each other or undercut each other,"" he said, adding that both the countries ""should work with each other rather than guard against each other,"" Yi said.""This is the only path that truly serves the fundamental interests of the two countries. As important members of the Global South, we have the responsibility to take the lead in opposing hegemonism and power politics"" he added in apparent reference to the United States.The remarks came after a recent meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart, Wang Yi, during which Jaishankar praised the cooperation between the two countries in multilateral forums, especially the G20.","Wang yi said that indo-china relations made positive strides over the past year.

Trump insists there was 'no clash' between Elon Musk and Marco Rubio over DOGE cuts

A high-stakes White House meeting erupted into a showdown between Elon Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio , exposing deep rifts within the Trump administration over the billionaire’s sweeping government overhaul .According to a report by the New York Times, the tensions had been simmering for weeks, but they exploded in the Cabinet Room, where President Trump presided over a heated exchange between Musk and top officials. Rubio, long frustrated by Musk’s aggressive cost-cutting measures , pushed back hard when Musk accused him of failing to downsize his department.“You have fired nobody,” Musk scoffed, pointing out that the State Department remained bloated. Rubio fired back, reminding Musk of the 1,500 State Department officials who had taken buyouts. The billionaire was unimpressed.As the argument escalated, Trump, who had been watching with folded arms, finally intervened, reported New York Times. “Marco’s doing a great job,” he said, signaling a shift. While Trump had championed Musk’s efficiency crusade, the president now emphasized the need for a more measured approach.Trump announced a recalibration: Cabinet secretaries would take charge, with Musk’s team merely advising. The move was the first significant sign that Trump was willing to place limits on Musk’s influence.The meeting’s impact was immediate. Cabinet officials, many of whom had privately complained about Musk’s aggressive tactics, saw it as a turning point. The shift signaled that Trump was listening to concerns, particularly regarding layoffs affecting key constituencies, including veterans.Yet Musk’s influence remains formidable. His financial backing of Trump’s campaign and his grip on social media have left officials wary of crossing him. After the meeting, Trump posted that future cuts would be made with a “scalpel, not a hatchet,” a clear rebuke of Musk’s scorched-earth strategy.Musk later called the meeting “productive,” but inside the room, his frustration was evident. The battle for control over the administration’s cost-cutting efforts is far from over. While Trump has drawn a line, Musk is unlikely to retreat quietly. The question now is whether this uneasy truce will hold—or if another Cabinet clash is just around the corner.President Donald Trump, however, denied reports of the clash in a press meeting. ""There was no clash. I was there. Elon gets along great with Marco and they both are doing a fantastic job,"" he said.","High-stakes white house meeting erupted into a showdown between elon musk and secretary of state marco rubio.

Luxembourg’s Prince Frederik Dead at 22 After Battling Rare Disease

What is POLG

Prince Frederik of Luxembourg , son of Prince Robert and Princess Julie of Nassau, passed away on March 1 in Paris at the age of 22 after a lifelong struggle with POLG mitochondrial disease.His family confirmed the news in an emotional statement on the POLG Foundation’s website. ""It is with a very heavy heart that my wife and I would like to inform you of the passing of our son, The POLG Foundation founder and creative director, Frederik,"" Prince Robert wrote.Frederik was diagnosed with POLG mitochondrial disease at age 14 after years of unexplained health struggles. The rare genetic disorder affects the body's ability to produce energy, leading to organ failure.Despite his diagnosis, Frederik dedicated his life to advocating for research and awareness. In his final moments, Frederik called his loved ones to his bedside to say goodbye. ""Frederik found the strength and the courage to say goodbye to each of us in turn,"" Prince Robert said. ""Even in his last moments, his humour and boundless compassion compelled him to leave us with one last laugh… to cheer us all up.""Frederik’s health had declined in recent weeks after being hospitalised with pneumonia and another severe infection.Even in his last days, Frederik continued to engage with the world. His father recalled that he still had his alarm set for an Italian lesson on Duolingo.His family, struggling with his loss, are holding onto his words. ""Go outside when the sun is shining,"" he had written in a note on his phone.POLG disease is a genetic disorder that prevents the body from producing enough energy, leading to organ failure. It is caused by mutations in the POLG and POLG2 genes, which affect mitochondria—the body's power source. Symptoms vary but often include muscle weakness, seizures, and liver failure. There is no cure, and the disease worsens over time.Once thought to be rare, the disease now affect about 1 in 5,000 people worldwide, making them the second most common serious genetic disorder after cystic fibrosis.","Luxembourg’s prince frederik dead at 22 after battling rare disease.

Syria's neighboring foreign ministers call for lifting sanctions and reconciliation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/syrias-neighboring-foreign-ministers-call-for-lifting-sanctions-and-reconciliation/articleshow/118827885.cms,"Relatives and neighbours mourn during the funeral procession for four Syrian security force members killed in clashes with loyalists of ousted President Bashar Assad in coastal Syria, in the village of Al-Janoudiya, west of Idlib, Saturday, March 8, 2025.

AMMAN: Syria's top diplomat and his counterparts from neighboring countries Sunday called for the lifting of Western-led sanctions on Syria and post-war reconciliation.The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon made their remarks alongside Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani following a meeting in the Jordanian capital Amman.They come following days of clashes between Syrian security forces and insurgents of the minority Alawite community loyal to the deposed Bashar Assad government in Syria's coastal province. Some rights groups say hundreds of civilians, mostly Alawite, were killed in revenge attacks after the fighting broke out. The Associated Press could not independently verify those numbers.The United States and Europe have been hesitant to lift sanctions on Syria before there is a clear political transition that is democratic and inclusive of Syria’s minorities and civil society. At the same time, the country desperately needs money to rebuild after years of war and pull millions out of poverty. The United Nations estimates that some 90% of Syria’s population lives in poverty.“We are protecting all components of the Syrian people, and we do not discriminate between them. We will not allow the repetition of the tragedies of the Syrian people,” said al-Shibani.Syria's new Islamist authorities under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa have struggled to convince the United States and Europe to lift sanctions to start rebuilding the country after 13 years of war and reconcile with the Kurds in the northeast and Druze in the south to exert state authority across the country.The weekend's violence appears likely to stymie attempts to remove sanctions in the immediate future. The U.S. and U.N. released statements condemning the killing of civilians, which U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as being carried out by “radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis.” He called for Damascus to hold the perpetrators accountable.Also on Sunday, al-Sharaa announced the formation of a committee tasked with investigating the violence in coastal communities, including “violations against civilians” and another one tasked with “maintaining civil peace.”Al-Sharaa said in a video statement that the outbreak of violence was part of “attempts by remnants of the former regime, with foreign parties behind them, to create new strife and drag our country to a civil war, with the goal of dividing it and destroying its unity and stability.”He said the country’s new authorities “will not tolerate the remnants of Assad who committed crimes against our army forces and state institutions” and promised to “hold accountable with all firmness and without leniency anyone who was involved in the blood of civilians or harmed our people.”It remained to be seen whether those measures will succeed in calming the situation and reassuring both Syrians and the international community.Syria's neighbors fear that the country's pulverized economy and internal tensions could impact their own stability.“Stability in Syria requires dialogue with the country's various components,” said Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein at a joint news conference.The foreign ministers were critical of what they said was foreign intervention in the region after Israeli troops conducted military operations in southern Syria and seized a U.N. buffer zone that divides Syria from the Golan Heights, which Israel seized and annexed in 1967. On Sunday, the Israeli commanding officers visited and assessed the buffer zone.Turkish Foreign Minister Fidan welcomed the “historic” meeting and called for cooperation to decrease tension in Syria, and said he alongside others will work against sleeper cells belonging to the extremist Islamic State group and affiliates of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party in Syria and Iraq.“This is a regional problem. Regardless of our ideals we should all combat IS as well as the PKK, they are both terrorist entities,” he added.Iraq's foreign minister warned that IS sleeper cells are growing in numbers.“We need to take the initiative first in exchanging views and information about (the Islamic State group's) latest operations and especially their expansion not only on the Syrian borders with Iraq and Jordan but also their expansion in the Syrian land,” said Hussein.","The foreign ministers of turkey, iraq, jordan and lebanon made their remarks alongside syrian foreign minister asaad hassan al-shibani.

The threat came from Budha Dal leader Baba Balbir Singh, whose conflict with the SGPC and Shiromani Akali Dal leadership became public in November 2023.The dispute stems from a November 2023 incident in which police allegedly entered the gurdwara in Sultanpur Lodhi and opened fire, resulting in the death of a home guard jawan. The SGPC conducted an investigation into the clash.""SGPC should immediately take back its decision to sack the two jathedars, which was taken against the sentiments of the community, and reinstate them. Leaders of the Nihang groups have passed a resolution to oppose the installation of the new Jathedar Kuldeep Singh Gargaj. I request the Nihangs to come prepared in good numbers at Anandpur Sahib. We are already there in good strength. We shall not allow this programme to happen. We are firm on the decision, and we shall not allow violation of the maryada,"" said Baba Balbir Singh.SGPC President Harjinder Singh Dhami released the findings of their investigation in January 2024, alleging that police actions were directed by the Punjab CM. The report claimed that approximately 1,000 bullets were fired, and teargas was deployed by the police inside the gurdwara premises.Damdami Taksal has also declared its opposition to the installation ceremony. Taksal spokesperson Gurdeep Singh Naulkha released a video statement opposing the new appointment and called on supporters to gather at Kesgarh Sahib.Naulkha, who serves as the general secretary of SAD district Fatehgarh Sahib, was the first Taksal member to criticize SAD leaders after some of them condemned Baba Dhuma's support for the BJP-led Mahayuti in the Maharashtra Assembly election in November 2024.The SGPC report noted that no attempts were made to resolve the conflict between the Nihang factions during the November 2023 incident.","Giani kuldeep singh gargaj officially took charge as the jathedar of takht kesgarh sahib.

SEOUL: North Korea on Monday condemned joint US-South Korean military drills as a ""provocative act"", warning of the danger of sparking war with ""an accidental single shot,"" days after Seoul's air force mistakenly bombed a village on its own territory.""This is a dangerous provocative act of leading the acute situation on the Korean peninsula, which may spark off a physical conflict between the two sides by means of an accidental single shot,"" said Pyongyang's foreign ministry, as quoted by state media.The joint US-South Korea "" Freedom Shield 2025 "" exercise was set to kick off on Monday, and will involve ""live, virtual, and field-based training"", according to a US statement.The exercise will run until March 21, the statement said.Military cooperation between Seoul and Washington regularly invites condemnation from Pyongyang, where the government sees such moves as preparation for an invasion, and often carries out missile tests in response.The latest exercise comes after two South Korean Air Force fighter jets accidentally dropped eight bombs on a village during a joint training exercise with US forces on March 6.Fifteen people, including civilians and military personnel, were wounded in that incident, South Korea's National Fire Agency said.Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of UN sanctions.The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950-1953 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.The United States stations tens of thousands of soldiers in the South, in part to protect Seoul against Pyongyang.The large-scale Freedom Shield exercises are one of the allies' biggest annual joint exercises.In its statement on Monday, North Korea's foreign ministry dubbed the exercises ""an aggressive and confrontational war rehearsal"".Last week, Pyongyang slammed the United States for ""political and military provocations"" over the visit of a US Navy aircraft carrier to the South Korean port of Busan.","North korea condemns joint us-south korean military drills as a ""provocative act"" pyongyang warns of the danger of sparking war with ""an accidental single shot"" comes after two south korean air force fighter jets accidentally dropped eight bombs on a village during a joint training exercise with us forces.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118827807,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-150032,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
