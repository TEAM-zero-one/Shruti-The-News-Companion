NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday welcomed the India-US interim trade agreement, calling it a major step towards strengthening economic ties, boosting domestic manufacturing and creating jobs.In a post on X, PM Modi said: ""Great news for India and USA! We have agreed on a framework for an Interim Trade Agreement between our two great nations. I thank President Trump for his personal commitment to robust ties between our countries. This framework reflects the growing depth, trust and dynamism of our partnership. It strengthens ‘ Make in India ’ by opening new opportunities for India’s hardworking farmers, entrepreneurs, MSMEs, StartUp innovators, fishermen and more. It will generate large-scale employment for women and youngsters. India and the United States share a commitment to promoting innovation and this framework will further deepen investment and technology partnerships between us. This framework will also strengthen resilient and trusted supply chains and contribute to global growth. As India moves forward towards building a Viksit Bharat, we remain committed to building global partner"".India and the United States earlier released a joint statement announcing the framework for an interim trade agreement, under which tariffs on Indian goods entering the US will be reduced from 50% to 18%. ""The US and India are pleased to announce that they have reached a framework for an Interim Agreement regarding reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade,"" the statement said.The announcement follows months of negotiations after trade talks stalled when Washington imposed 50% tariffs on Indian imports. Of these, 25% duties were introduced in August, with the US alleging that India was supporting Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine through oil purchases.The framework also reaffirms both sides’ commitment to negotiations on a broader US-India Bilateral Trade Agreement, launched by Modi and US President Donald Trump in February 2025 amid prolonged trade tensions linked to India’s energy imports from Russia.Under the interim deal, the United States will lower tariffs to 18% on a wide range of Indian products, including textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, plastic and rubber goods, organic chemicals, home décor, artisanal products and select machinery. Subject to the successful conclusion of the agreement, Washington has also said it will remove tariffs on additional Indian exports such as generic pharmaceuticals, gems and diamonds, and aircraft parts.India, in turn, will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a broad basket of food and agricultural products, including dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits.Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said the agreement protects India’s agriculture sector, with sensitive farm and dairy products fully safeguarded. These include maize, wheat, rice, soya, poultry, milk, cheese, ethanol for fuel, tobacco, certain vegetables and meat.The framework also outlines India’s intent to purchase $500 billion worth of US energy products, aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, technology products and coking coal over the next five years, a move expected to significantly expand bilateral trade.On claims that India would end Russian oil imports, New Delhi has not confirmed any such commitment. The government has reiterated that energy security remains its top priority. “Diversifying our energy sourcing in keeping with objective market conditions and evolving international dynamics is at the core of our strategy to ensure this,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.The agreement provides for preferential market access for both countries in key sectors. The US will remove tariffs on certain Indian aircraft and aircraft parts imposed on national security grounds, while India will receive preferential tariff rate quotas for automotive parts and negotiated outcomes for generic pharmaceuticals and ingredients.Goyal said the pact opens up a $30 trillion market for Indian exporters, particularly MSMEs, farmers and fishermen, and is expected to create lakhs of jobs for women and youth.The framework also includes steps to boost digital and technology trade, with both sides committing to address barriers to digital commerce, increase trade in technology products including GPUs and data centre equipment, and expand joint technology cooperation.Both countries have agreed to work on removing non-tariff barriers affecting bilateral trade. India will address issues related to US medical devices, information and communication technology goods, and food and agricultural products, eliminate restrictive import licensing and review standards within six months to ease market access.Officials said the framework paves the way for finalising the interim agreement and advancing negotiations on a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement, with scope for further tariff reductions.","Prime minister narendra modi welcomes india-us interim trade agreement.

NEW DELHI: Rebutting PM Narendra Modi 's accusation, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said Modi's ""Goebbelsian"" and ""filthy"" propaganda against then PM Manmohan Singh , who was a decent and hardworking achiever, was an insult to the Sikh religion, and demanded that Modi apologise for it.Kharge said Congress respects Sikh religion and made Manmohan Singh finance minister and PM twice, but Modi ran a ""false propaganda"" against him to wrest his chair.He was reacting to Modi's speech in Rajya Sabha in which the PM accused Congress of insulting Sikhs, with a reference to Rahul Gandhi's recent viral exchange with minister Ravneet Bittu where the latter was called ""traitor"".Kharge said Modi made absurd claims and allegations targeting Congress and his speech suggests that he is ""mentally disturbed"" because of Epstein Files which, he alleged, have been used by US President Donald Trump to armtwist him.""As soon as Trump caught him, Modi surrendered, he knelt down and made a trade deal, but who did he sacrifice?

What’s at stake when it comes to your plate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-at-stake-when-it-comes-to-your-plate/articleshow/127979060.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. ‘Would you like fries with that?’ The girl behind the counter asked the American standing before me at the McDonald’s outlet. He hesitated. A long hesitation for what should have been the simplest of decisions. Big Mac. Drink. Fries. Yes or no. I grew impatient. Why was his choice so difficult? Only later did it strike me that the difficulty did not lie in the fries. It lay in the burger itself. Vegetarian. Vegan . Flexitarian. A single patty had splintered into moral choices. In that moment, under fluorescent lights and digital menus, I realised that food , once a matter of hunger , had quietly become a matter of conscience. The World Economic Forum recently published data on changing global food habits. Vegetarianism, once considered marginal in the West, is steadily rising across Europe and the United States. Curiously, it is declining in large emerging economies such as India, where traditional diets are slowly yielding to speed, packaging and convenience. Among Gen Z in Europe, vegetarianism is being embraced with fresh intensity: protecting animals, reducing environmental strain. The logic is simple. Growing plants asks less of the earth than raising animals. Vegetables require less land, water and energy. Fewer forests are cleared, fewer resources extracted, fewer gases released. That is why a vegetarian diet produces nearly two and a half times less carbon emissions than a meat-based one. Eating vegetarian for a year can save emissions equal to removing a small family car from the road for six months. Yet the case for meat-eating carries its own dignity. Across history, meat has been nourishment in difficult climates, insurance against crop failure, and a compact source of strength where options were limited. For many communities even today, meat is not indulgence but woven into livelihoods and traditions. In this light, meat-eating is not moral neglect, but practical inheritance. But long before climate charts and sustainability panels, the Tamil land approached food through a softer instinct—not calculation, but empathy. Across the world today, vegetarianism is no longer eccentric. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs adopt plant-based diets for health and longevity. European govts encourage reduced meat consumption. What appears newly awakened is, in truth, deeply old. This is where Thiruvalluvar excels as a poet of compassion. Avisorinthu āayiram vēṭṭalin oṉdṟaṉ Uyirsegutthu uṇṇāamai naṉdṟu Better than a thousand burnt offerings Is One life un-killed, un-eaten . A thousand ritual fires may blaze, but they do not equal the quiet mercy of restraint. Tamil Sangam literature echoes this gentleness. Puranānūru speaks of ascetics as kollā nōṉbiṉar, those who have vowed not to kill. Akanānūru describes hospitality through rice, milk, curd, fruits, honey, and vegetables. Meat appears openly in most places; its absence elsewhere is deliberate. Vegetarian food is not portrayed as denial, but as choice shaped by feeling. Power too once learned restraint. Emperor Ashoka’s edicts from the third century BCE recorded reduced slaughter, protected animals, and banned killing on certain days. After Kalinga, remorse hardened into mercy, carved into stone. Valluvar reminds us that progress is not only about what we invent but about what we choose not to harm. It was the same voice that echoed in saint poet Vallalar’s verse: ‘I shed tears seeing plants that wither without water’. And somewhere between a burger choice and a spared life, the question remains quietly unanswered.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

HAL Clarifies AMCA Status, Says It Will Bid For India's Fifth-Generation Fighter Jet In 2035 Phase

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing speculation of possible delays in the delivery of the first batch of indigenous LCA Mk1A fighter jets to IAF, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Thursday said that “five LCA Mk1A aircraft are fully ready for delivery, incorporating major contracted capabilities in accordance with the agreed specifications”.HAL also said that “an additional nine aircraft have already been built and flown. Upon receipt of engines from General Electric (US company), these aircraft will be made ready for delivery”. “All design and development issues identified are being addressed in an expedited manner. HAL is in active discussions with IAF to deliver the aircraft at the earliest,” it said in a statement.HAL has received five engines from GE as on date. The supply position from GE is positive, and the future delivery outlook aligns with HAL’s delivery plans, the company said. HAL assured that it will meet the guidance projected for the current financial year.Besides LCA Mk1A aircraft, the company said it is simultaneously advancing multiple strategic programmes, including Indian Multi Role Helicopter (IMRH), Tejas LCA Mk2 and Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), all of which are expected to enter production after 2032.HAL had received the first contract from IAF for 83 LCA Mk1A jets (73 fighters and 10 trainers) in Feb 2021, and later, a follow-on contract in Sept 2025 for 97 additional LCA Mk1A aircraft (68 fighters and 29 twin-seaters) at a cost of over Rs 62,370 crore.The delivery of these aircraft would commence during 2027-28 and be completed over a period of six years.The aircraft would have an indigenous content of over 64%, with 67 additional items incorporated. In all, IAF had ordered 180 of these aircraft in two tranches.Some of the planes were supposed to be delivered last year, but IAF insisted that HAL provide the aircraft in a fully operational configuration. On Oct 17 last year, the company conducted the first flight of the first Tejas Mk1A prototype from its Nashik facility. At present, HAL’s fighter aircraft production capacity stands at 24 aircraft per year. At this rate, fulfilling the 180 aircraft Tejas Mk1A order would take over seven years, with IAF expected to receive the complete fleet no earlier than around 2033.Beyond the 180 Mk1A jets, IAF had previously acquired 40 LCA Mk1 (IOC/FOC variants), making a total of 220 LCA-type aircraft contracted or ordered across all variants.","Hal has received five engines from ge as on date.

Deadly Blast At Shia Religious Centre In Islamabad Raises Questions On Pakistan's Security Failures

NEW DELHI: India on Friday strongly rejected Pakistan 's allegations linking New Delhi to the suicide bomb attack at a Shia mosque in Islamabad. MEA called the claims ""baseless and pointless"" accusing Pakistan of choosing ""to delude itself"" by blaming others for its internal problems.At least 31 people were killed and more than 169 injured after a suicide bomber blew himself up during Friday prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-imambargah in the Tarlai area of Pakistan’s federal capital, police sources told news agency PTI.Responding to accusations made by Pakistani leaders, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India unequivocally rejected any suggestion of its involvement.""The bombing at an Islamabad mosque earlier today is condemnable and India condoles the loss of life it has caused,"" Jaiswal said.""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills.

The collusion between India and Afghanistan is being revealed.""Asif said security guards at the Imambargah confronted the attacker, who opened fire before blowing himself up.""He then blew himself up, standing in the last row of worshippers,"" he claimed, adding that the state would respond to this ""cruelty with full force"".Pakistan's minister of state for interior Tallal Chaudhry later told the media that while the attacker was not an Afghan national, forensic analysis had established how many times he had travelled to Afghanistan.""They (terrorists) are not carrying out attacks for religion, but for dollars … Whether they belong to the BLA, TTP or any other group, they are paid in dollars,"" Chaudhry said, referring to the Balochistan Liberation Army and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.He added further that Islamabad had repeatedly urged Afghanistan ""not to provide space to terrorists and not to become India’s proxy"".Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the blast, saying, ""Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity."" Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed ""deep grief"" and said he ""strongly condemned"" the attack.Several countries, including Iran, the US and the UK, also condemned the attack.Friday’s blast came less than three months after a suicide bomber killed 12 people in an explosion outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad, highlighting Pakistan’s ongoing struggle with militant violence.","Mea called the claims ""baseless and pointless"" accusing pakistan of choosing ""to delude itself"" by blaming others for its internal problems.

Iran Reaffirms 3000-Year Civilisational Bond With India, Says Chabahar Port 'Will Work Nicely'

NEW DELHI: Iran has backed the Chabahar port and cooperation with India amid the uncertainty looming over the project because of ongoing US efforts to isolate Iran, including the Trump administration's decision last year to revoke a sanctions waiver that allowed India to develop a terminal at the port.While Washington extended the waiver till April 26 after talks with the Indian side, there's little hope of another extension in the current circumstances. The Union Budget this year saw zero allocation for the port but govt has defended the decision saying it has already transferred the entire committed amount of $120 million to Iran. However, India has not backed out of the project or its commitment to extend a $250 million line of credit for further development of the port, according to a 10-year contract signed in 2024. This commitment is not time bound though.""The port of Chabahar is vital, and it can play a good role in accessing Afghanistan and central Asia. We have a good relationship with some countries, particularly India. I believe we should boost and expand our relations,"" said Iran's ambassador to India, Mohammad Fathali. ""Chabahar is Chabahar.

Naravane’s memoir, saying the issue was “right under your nose” and accusing the government of evading key questions raised by the Opposition.Kharge’s remarks came after Opposition parties walked out of the Rajya Sabha during the Prime Minister’s reply to the debate on the President's address yesterday, alleging that their concerns – particularly on national security and China – were not addressed.""There is no need to react to the PM's speech, but I would like to respond to the things he said. Because repeating the lies has been one of his habits,” Kharge said, referring to the Prime Minister’s speech. “In 97 minutes of this speech, the PM did not say anything conclusive, he didn’t reply to any of the concerns we had raised during the discussion, but only spoke about the last 100 years, 75 years and 50 years.”Referring to the controversy over former Army Chief General Naravane’s memoir, Kharge questioned the government’s claim in Parliament that the book had not been published.“When we talk about the country’s defences, we received the published book by General MM Naravane (Retd), but how did you not get it? And you say in the parliament that the book hasn't been published. How can the Defence Minister say that the book is not published? It is a privilege. It is right under your nose,” Kharge said.He alleged that both home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh repeated the same position in the House before Rahul Gandhi brought an alleged ""memoir"" of ex-Army Chief Naravane in Parliament. “In the end it turned out to be true,” he said.Kharge also questioned the government’s response when Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of China during the debate.“Why were they troubled when LoP Rahul Gandhi raised the issue (China issue)? Listen to the truth and reply… deny it,” he said.Kharge said the Opposition decided to walk out as it felt the Prime Minister had failed to substantively respond to the debate. “It is so unfortunate that he had no substance and answer to the issues we had raised in the House. Later, they only kept abusing me,” he said.Rejecting allegations that the Congress had insulted the Sikh community, after Rahul Gandhi’s comment calling Union minister Raveneet Bittu “traitor” snowbowled into a big controversy, drawing sharp reaction from BJP.Kharge said, “We respect the Sikh community.” He cited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying, “Dr Manmohan Singh, a renowned economist was appointed the Finance Minister and PM twice, the same post as Modi ji.”Accusing the ruling party of relying on attacks rather than governance, Kharge said, “In the last 10 years, what have they done except abuse the Congress?”",Congress president mallikarjun kharge criticised prime minister narendra modi and the union government over what he called a denial of facts.

Rajya Sabha Explodes As Nadda, Mallikarjun Kharge Trade Barbs Over Rahul Gandhi, 'Gag' On Opposition

NEW DELHI: Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Friday defended the Centre’s decision to keep the Henderson Brooks-Bhagat report on the 1962 India-China war classified, as a political row erupted in Parliament over Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi being stopped from quoting the “unpublished memoir” of former Army Chief General MM Naravane.In a post on X, Rijiju described the report as a sensitive defence document and said it should not be used for political purposes. He wrote, “Our Govt is led by a matured leader. Since 1962, the Henderson Brooks-Bhagat Commission report has remained secret. It indicted the Nehru Govt for the humiliating defeat at the hands of the Chinese PLA. Our Govt has never declassified it as a defence matter that can't be used as a political tools. ”The Henderson Brooks-Bhagat report was prepared by Lieutenant General Henderson Brooks and Brigadier General Premindra Singh Bhagat and was commissioned by then Acting Army Chief General JN Chaudhuri to review the Indian Army’s operations during the 1962 war with China, reported ANI.

BJP MP Nishikant Dubey proposes to set-up library on ‘misdeeds’ of Nehru-Gandhi family,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-mp-nishikant-dubey-proposes-to-set-up-library-on-misdeeds-of-nehru-gandhi-family/articleshow/127969944.cms,"Rahul Gandhi Defends Naravane Memoir Quotes, Priyanka Questions Nishikant Dubey Quotes On Nehru

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Friday said he has decided to set up a library documenting what he described as the “misdeeds, corruption and policy failures” of the Nehru-Gandhi family, and appealed to supporters to contribute books, documents and research material for the initiative.In a post on X, Dubey said the proposed library would serve as a consolidated resource for students, researchers and future generations seeking information on the Congress party ’s first family.“I have decided to create a library on the misdeeds of the Nehru-Gandhi family, the corruption perpetrated by them, the damage inflicted on the country due to their policies, and the harm caused to the nation by their personal activities,” Dubey wrote. “I need cooperation and suggestions from all of you. This library will serve as an ideal resource for future generations and students engaged in research.”In a video message attached to the post, Dubey said his decision followed what he described as a strong public response to remarks he made in Parliament a day earlier, where he had displayed and mentioned a few books.“Yesterday in parliament I said a few things about the Gandhi family's misdeeds, corruption among other things.And there’s been a massive response to it from across the country,” he said.Dubey said people associated with the BJP, the Sangh Parivar and others he described as “nationalist” had reached out to him with historical material. He said the proposed library would compile information related to what he alleged were economic and social policy failures, the Partition of India, and links to figures such as Warren Anderson and Ottavio Quattrocchi.He also referred to documents and reports he said were not fully in the public domain, including material related to the Henderson Brooks report on the 1962 China war and the Shah Commission report.“Bringing it all together I’ll make a library… a one point centre that if you need any information regarding them for research or for the coming generation you find it there in the library,” he said, appealing for cooperation and inputs.Dubey’s remarks come amid heightened political sparring in Parliament, where proceedings have seen disruptions following a row involving Congress MP and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi.The controversy began after Gandhi attempted to refer to excerpts from an unpublished memoir of former Army chief General MM Naravane during a debate on Motion of Thanks to the President's address to parliament, drawing objections from treasury benches, including defense minister Rajnath Singh, and home minister Amit Shah over the use of material not yet in the public domain.The issue has since escalated into broader exchanges between the ruling BJP and the Congress, with both sides accusing each other of politicising sensitive historical and institutional issues. After Rahul was not able to speak in the Lower House, opposition has been continuously protesting in and outside the house, leading to suspension of eighth Congress MPs.Later on Thursday the motion was passed without a customary reply by the PM. It came as PM Modi who was scheduled to address the Lok Sabha at 5.00 pm on Wednesday couldn’t speak amid the constant pandemonium in the house, after Speaker Om Birla insisted PM not to come to parliament fearing some untoward incident.","Bjp mp nishikant dubey says he has decided to set up a library documenting what he described as the “misdeeds, corruption and policy failures” of the nehru-gandhi family.

India To Push For Tech Defence And Zakir Naik Extradition During PM Modi’s High Stakes Malaysia Trip

While India and Malaysia will look to ramp up trade and defence ties during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Kuala Lumpur over the weekend, the issue of fugitive Zakir Naik’s extradition is also likely to be raised by the Indian side. The visit is likely to see signing of several MoUs, including one for cooperation with Malaysia’s thriving semiconductor industry.“We have had opportunities to discuss the issue in past visits also at various levels. And, we will probably continue to take up the issue until all technical procedures are completed, and we hope to get the outcome that we desire,” said MEA secretary (east) P Kumaran, responding to a question about Naik.India and Malaysia have an extradition treaty, but the case, as Malaysia maintains, will be resolved based on judicial consideration. The official said that Modi and his counterpart Anwar Ibrahim will review progress under the India-Malaysia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, especially in priority areas of cooperation such as trade, investments, defence, security, semiconductors, digital technologies, renewable energy, education, healthcare, and people-to-people exchanges.Kumaran also underlined the potential for defence cooperation between the two countries, saying that India is looking at sale of Dornier aircraft to Malaysia. “Malaysia also has Scorpene submarines. We are looking at opportunities to try and collaborate, especially in terms of mid-life upgrades, retrofitting etc,” said the official.","India and malaysia will look to ramp up trade and defence ties during pm narendra modi’s visit to kuala lumpur over the weekend.

GCC Unified Visa 2026 launch date: Expected in 2026 (pilot phase)



Pilot phase likely by late 2026, including testing with some country corridors (possibly UAE-Bahrain first).

Full implementation expected to follow once technical, security and biometric systems are linked across all member states.

Who is eligible to apply for the GCC Unified Visa?



A valid passport with sufficient remaining validity (typically six months minimum).

Supporting documents like proof of accommodation and return/ onward travel.

Travel insurance covering all GCC states may be required.

GCC Unified Visa fees: Preliminary estimates



Validity of GCC Unified Visa: How long you can stay



30-day stay (single or multi-entry)

60- to 90-day validity for longer trips

Possibility of multiple entries within the validity period

Why the GCC Unified Visa matters



Seamless multi-country travel: Visit multiple member states without applying for separate visas, a huge boon for global travellers.

A unified visa promotes the GCC as a single tourism destination, enhancing its competitiveness with regions like Europe and ASEAN. Simplified logistics: Digital applications and harmonized border systems reduce wait times and bureaucratic friction.

Biometric and border control integration across all six nations. Common digital application and data-sharing platforms. Security and immigration protocols to ensure regional safety and streamlined entry.





The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf. It's launch is expected in 2026 (pilot late-year, full rollout to follow), eligibility includes tourists and other visitors with valid travel credentials, fees is estimated at US $100–$150 range with validity of likely 30–90 days, with single or multiple entries. This unified system could be a milestone for regional travel and a boost for the Gulf’s tourism, business and investment landscape.","The gulf cooperation council is moving forward with a long-planned unified tourist visa that could transform travel across the gulf region.

Ramadan 2026 working hours in the UAE explained: Penalties and rules for private sector and government employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ramadan-2026-working-hours-in-the-uae-explained-penalties-and-rules-for-private-sector-and-government-employees/articleshow/127923197.cms,"Ramadan 2026 in UAE: How Will Working Hours Change for You?

Why working hours change during Ramadan in the UAE



UAE Ramadan 2026: Reduced Working Hours for Private and Government Sectors

Private sector during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE: Mandatory two-hour reduction



How it works:



If a regular workday was 8 hours, it becomes 6 hours during Ramadan.

Employers may offer additional flexibility, such as remote work or staggered schedules, provided the reduced hours rule is followed.

This rule is not optional as companies that do not implement the reduction can face legal consequences, including labour complaints and possible penalties if inspected by MoHRE.

Tip for employees:

Government/public sector during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE: Set reduced hours and flexibility



Typical government hours during Ramadan 2026



Monday to Thursday: 9:00 am to 2:30 pm

9:00 am to 2:30 pm Friday: 9:00 am to 12:00 pm (shorter to allow for Jummah prayer and family time)

Flexible arrangements



School hours and broader work-life adjustments during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE



UAE Employers Face Penalties for Ignoring Ramadan Working Hour Laws

Legal backing and employer responsibilities during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE



Employers should:



Apply the two-hour reduction for private sector workers.

Ensure government department staff adhere to the FAHR-issued Ramadan hours.

Offer reasonable flexibility when operationally possible to support employee well-being.

Failure to comply with mandated Ramadan working hours may expose employers to labour disputes, inspections or penalties — especially in the private sector where these reductions are legally binding.

What this means for UAE workers during Ramadan 2026



Shorter workdays with at least two hours reduced for private workers.

Government hours typically from 9 am to 2:30 pm (Mon–Thu) and 9 am to 12 pm (Fri).

Flexibility options such as remote work where feasible.

School schedule adjustments and broader lifestyle shifts in line with Ramadan culture.





As the holy month of Ramadan 2026 approaches (expected to begin around February 18–19, 2026 after the crescent moon sighting), residents and workers across the United Arab Emirates are preparing for annual adjustments to daily routines including reduced working hours in both the private and government sectors. These changes are designed to help employees balance work responsibilities with fasting, prayer and family time during the sacred month.The working-hour adjustments are not just tradition or goodwill, they are formally recognised within UAE labour regulations and official government circulars.Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, during which many Muslims fast from dawn until dusk, engage in prayer, reflection and community gatherings. In recognition of the physical and spiritual demands of fasting, authorities in the UAE modify work schedules to allow workers time to maintain energy, attend religious activities and manage family life.According to the UAE’s labour law (Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021), working hours during Ramadan are specifically determined by executive regulations, requiring shorter daily schedules for employees unless otherwise authorised.For most private sector employees in the UAE, daily working hours are reduced by two hours throughout Ramadan. This reduction applies to all employees under the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE), regardless of their religion or fasting status.Any private sector employer who keeps standard hours throughout Ramadan is not complying with UAE labour regulations and can be reported to authorities.For federal government employees, the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources (FAHR) issues specific working schedules to balance productivity and observance.These hours represent a reduction of about 3.5 hours on weekdays and 1.5 hours on Fridays compared with normal schedules.Government entities are also encouraged to introduce flexible work options, including remote work on Fridays for up to 70% of staff where operationally feasible, without affecting service delivery.In addition to workplace changes, school hours are usually shortened during Ramadan to accommodate fasting students and teachers, with many institutions operating on adjusted timetables.At the same time, routine city services such as public parking, tolls and other community functions also adapt their timings to reflect the daily rhythm of Ramadan life.Under UAE law, the obligation to reduce working hours in Ramadan is grounded in Article 17 of the Labour Law and its executive regulations, which explicitly empower authorities to set specific working hours during Ramadan.For 2026’s Ramadan season, likely starting mid-February, both private and public sector employees in the UAE should expect:These changes offer a practical blend of cultural respect and workplace productivity, helping employees maintain spiritual practices without sacrificing essential functions of daily life in the UAE during the holy month.","Ramadan is the ninth month of the islamic lunar calendar, during which many muslims fast from dawn until dusk.

After weeks of online speculation linking Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean to WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella , DeJean finally spoke publicly about the situation. While appearing on The Pat McAfee Show, DeJean directly stated that he does not have a current romantic relationship despite the chatter. The whole conversation started after the two were seen at Eagles events in December 2025.The voices only grew louder after Bella appeared in Philadelphia again. But the story truly exploded this week when a viral Monday Night Raw clip put their names in the same headline once more. With fans chanting “Coop” during the Bella Twins’ segment, the NFL star was no longer able to avoid the question, which he did during the aforementioned appearance.DeJean was put on the spot with the question that was up in the air with all the rumors about him and Bella. However, he did not shy away from revealing what was true and provided a simple answer. When asked about the validity of the rumors by McAfee, DeJean bluntly admitted, “I don’t think I have a public relationship. ”That answer did not shut down the speculation, but it did make it clear that he is not ready to label anything for the public.DeJean faced the question again during an appearance on Up & Adams with Kay Adams. When Nikki’s name came up, he offered a softer answer: “I don’t know about that. She is a good friend.”Adams pressed him on the Bella’s Raw quote, but DeJean sidestepped, suggesting she could have been talking about anyone else. Bella has also avoided confirming anything about the whole situation. TMZ recently caught up with her in New York City, and she reportedly said she was still single.Before the DeJean-Bella rumors began, the cornerback was in a serious relationship with Steph Wilfawn, a former University of Iowa student.

What this game means entering the All-Star stretch

The New York Knicks visit Little Caesars Arena on Friday with a chance to strengthen their position near the top of the Eastern Conference. They arrive with several injuries that could affect rotations and minutes against a Detroit team that has been steady for most of the season.The Pistons hold the conference’s best record at 37-13 and have been consistent on both ends of the floor. Their injury list is shorter, but a few decisions before tipoff could still influence the matchup. With the All-Star break approaching, both teams are focused on seeding and maintaining form.Karl-Anthony Towns is unlikely to play, which would remove one of New York’s primary scoring options. Jalen Brunson is expected to handle a larger share of the offense if Towns sits. OG Anunoby’s status matters on defense, especially against Detroit’s wings. Josh Hart is expected to play and should help with rebounding and ball movement.Jalen Duren’s availability is the main concern for Detroit. His presence helps protect the rim and control rebounds. Tobias Harris and Duncan Robinson are both expected to play, giving Detroit stability in the rotation.Recent meetings have often been close, with several games decided late.New York has maintained a positive scoring margin this season. Brunson leads the offense, while Mitchell Robinson provides interior defense. Mikal Bridges has been active on the perimeter. If Towns does not play and Anunoby is limited, New York will rely more on guard play and defensive discipline.Detroit scores efficiently and defends at a high level. The team rebounds well and protects the paint. If Duren plays, that interior defense becomes stronger.A win for Detroit would help maintain its lead in the conference. For New York, a road win against the top seed would reduce the gap and show it can compete despite injuries.The Knicks are likely to depend on Brunson, Hart, Bridges, and Robinson, along with whoever fills Towns’ minutes. Detroit will try to use its defense and rebounding to control the pace.

Justin Gaethje opens up on headlining UFC White House event with Ilia Topuria



Justin Gaethje talks win vs. Paddy Pimblett, wants Ilia Topuria at White House | Pat McAfee Show

Justin Gaethje has set his sights on a blockbuster title unification fight against Ilia Topuria at the highly anticipated UFC White House event on June 14. After defeating Paddy Pimblett last month to claim the interim lightweight title, Gaethje believes the next step is clear. He sees himself facing the undisputed champion on one of the most unique stages the sport has ever seen.The timing of Gaethje’s prediction has added fuel to the excitement. Topuria has recently returned to training after stepping away from the sport due to personal matters. With both fighters now active and aiming high, the possibility of a headline clash at the White House is quickly becoming one of the biggest talking points in MMA.Justin Gaethje has been open about his belief that a fight with Ilia Topuria is inevitable. Speaking on The Pat McAfee Show, he said he has imagined this moment for a long time. He described the idea of walking out near the Oval Office, entering the cage with the American flag, and competing on such a historic stage as something he has spoken into existence since his bout with Rafael Fiziev last year.He explained that his original plan was to fight Topuria earlier in the year and then defend the belt at the White House event.While plans changed due to circumstances beyond his control, Gaethje feels the outcome still favors him. Winning the interim title, in his view, makes him a champion on paper and puts him in a strong position to face Topuria in June.Topuria’s recent return to training has strengthened Gaethje’s belief. The champion posted a message declaring his comeback alongside training footage. Reports from Marca suggest that Topuria has resolved legal issues with his wife, leading to a dismissed lawsuit. He is now back at his Madrid gym and focused on fighting again.As one of the biggest MMA stars in 2026, Topuria is seen as a perfect fit to headline the special White House card. Gaethje believes their title unification fight stands above all others. He said he expects them to close the show and finds it hard to imagine a bigger option.Still, Gaethje remains flexible. He admitted that a fight with Conor McGregor would also make sense. In that scenario, he believes McGregor would headline regardless, and if Topuria did not return, the division could take a very different turn.",Justin gaethje has set his sights on a title unification fight against ilia topuria at the highly anticipated ufc white house event on june 14.
