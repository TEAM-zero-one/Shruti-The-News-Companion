Mumbai institute finds gene tied to rare male infertility disorder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-institute-finds-gene-tied-to-rare-male-infertility-disorder/articleshow/123911167.cms,"MUMBAI: For years, a rare form of male infertility, in which men are born without the tubes that carry sperm, was blamed on a single gene tied to cystic fibrosis. Now, researchers in Mumbai have identified a broader set of genes in Indian men, including one passed from mothers to sons, that help explain this condition, called congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD).Although the research gained momentum in 2019, its roots stretch back to 2011. The findings promise not only better understanding of the condition but also more informed treatment options and genetic counselling for couples. Fresh from Parel's ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (ICMR-NIRRCH), a paper published earlier this week in Reproductive Sciences reported that so far, mutations in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) explain congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) in roughly 70% of Indian men with the condition. But until now, the remaining 30-40% had no clear genetic explanation. When only one tube is missing, the condition is called congenital unilateral absence of the vas deferens (CUAVD). It sometimes occurs alongside kidney abnormalities but is rare, accounting for 0.04% of male infertility cases.When both tubes are missing, CBAVD accounts for 2-3% of Indian male infertility cases and up to 25% of men with obstructive azoospermia (no sperm in semen).For these couples, IVF is the only option. ""Stigma is associated with infertility. Women are often blamed even if the biological issue lies with the man,"" said Dr Prakash Pawar, a urologist at Sion Hospital. ""Male infertility is a growing global issue. High-burden tertiary care hospitals see a few cases of CBAVD annually. ""Of the 93 men in the study, 19 had tested negative for the known CFTR gene. Using whole-exome sequencing on these 19 samples, the researchers discovered a new X-linked gene called ADGRG2, which can be passed from mothers to sons and is linked to CBAVD. This gene was found in two of the 19 men studied. ""Research groups in Europe and other countries have also reported similar pathogenic variants in ADGRG2. What makes our study significant is that this is the first time ADGRG2 has been identified in Indian men with infertility,"" said Dr Rahul Gajbhiye, scientist at ICMR-NIRRCH and principal investigator of the study. He said that in light of the findings, whole-exome sequencing should be considered for genetic screening of CBAVD, covering CFTR, ADGRG2, and other candidate genes, before couples undergo intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a procedure in which sperm is retrieved directly from the testicles and injected into the egg in the lab.","For years, a rare form of male infertility was blamed on a single gene tied to cystic fibrosis.

'Parliament's decision upheld': Centre reacts to SC's Waqf order; Opposition says 'government conspiracy stopped',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliaments-decision-upheld-centre-reacts-to-scs-waqf-order-opposition-says-government-conspiracy-stopped/articleshow/123895452.cms,"



'Law made in Parliament can't be rejected'



'Govt's conspiracy stopped'



What was SC's order?



NEW DELHI: Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju interpreted the Supreme Court's order on Waqf Amendment Act 2025 in Centre's favour, saying that the apex court ""upheld the decision made in the Parliament."" SC stalled key provisions of the act, including the clause that only practising Muslim of five years can dedicate a property as Waqf.Meanwhile, Congress viewed the judgement from an opposite lens saying that the order put a ""complete stop to government's conspiracy"", welcoming it as a relief for hose who feared their lands will be grabbed.Welcoming the judgement, Kiren Rijiju called it a win for ""democracy"" noting that ""when any law is made in the Parliament, it cannot be rejected.""""I welcome the order passed by the Supreme Court today after a full hearing on the Waqf Amendment Act. The Supreme Court knows the entire subject,"" Rijiju said.""I believe that whatever the Supreme Court bench has decided is a very good sign for our democracy, because when any law is made in the Parliament, it cannot be reject and this is what the Supreme Court has approved today... I am satisfied with the judgment of the Supreme Court, and because it is the highest court of the country, whenever any decision comes from the Supreme Court, it has an impact, and in a way, the decision of the Parliament of India has been upheld.We will see the case of a practising Muslim and what should be included in the rules,"" he added.Viewing the judgement as against the central government's ""attempt to grab land"", Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi pointed to SC's take on ""practising Muslim for five years"" clause and welcomed the stay on the provision.""This is a really good decision. The Supreme Court has put a complete stop to the conspiracy and intentions of the government. People who donate their land were fearful that the government would attempt to grab their land. This is a relief to them. How will the government decide who has been a practising Muslim for five years? This is a matter of faith. The court took note of all these aspects. We will continue the fight,"" he said.Expressing similar sentiments, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said, ""The Supreme Court’s order today on the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025 represents a substantial victory not just for the parties that opposed this arbitrary law in Parliament but all those members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee who submitted detailed dissent notes which were then ignored but now stand vindicated.""""The Order is an important one because it goes a long way towards undoing the mischievous intentions underlying the original statute. Counsels for the opposition parties had argued that the law would result in the creation of a structure where anyone and everyone could challenge the status of the property before the Collector, and the status of the property would be in limbo while in such litigation. Additionally, only a ‘Muslim’ practising for 5 years could donate to a Waqf. The intention behind these sections was always apparent - to keep the voter base inflamed and create an administrative structure to indulge those seeking to foment religious disputes,"" he added.Among the key provisions stayed was the clause requiring a person to be a practising Muslim for five years before dedicating property as Waqf, with the court noting the absence of any rules to fairly determine such status.The bench also pressed pause on provisions vesting wide powers in government collectors to decide whether a property qualifies as Waqf, warning that such authority would amount to the executive determining citizens’ rights, in violation of the principle of separation of powers.The order further limited the role of non-Muslim members in Waqf institutions, directing that the Central Waqf Council should not have more than four non-Muslims out of 20 members, and State Waqf Boards not more than three out of 11.While refusing to stay provisions on the registration of Waqfs or appointment of board CEOs, the bench observed that, as far as possible, efforts should be made to appoint CEOs from the Muslim community. The court clarified that its directions were interim in nature, issued to safeguard rights until the law’s constitutional validity is examined in full at the final hearing.","Kiren rijiju welcomes the supreme court's order on waqf amendment act 2025 in centre's favour. Congress welcomes the judgement as a relief for those who feared their lands will be grabbed.

PM puts thrust on

self-reliance in defence production

KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Monday directed the defence ministry to 'swiftly implement concrete steps' to achieve greater jointness, atmanirbharta and innovation to meet future challenges, amid the continuing differences among the Army, Navy and IAF over the creation of theatre commands for an integrated and cost-effective war-fighting machinery.Inaugurating the biennial three-day combined commanders conference (CCC) at Kolkata, the PM also reviewed the security situation and operational readiness of the armed forces in the context of the ""new normal"" created by Operation Sindoor, while being briefed on the future of warfare in the backdrop of emerging technology and tactics. tnnAs per the ""new normal"" laid down by PM Modi after the strikes against Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities, any act of cross-border terror will be treated as an act of war and be met with a decisive response. ""Moreover, the PM has made it clear that Pakistan's nuclear sabre-rattling will not prevent India from striking terror bases, with no distinction being made between terrorists and their sponsors,"" an official said.The PM complimented the armed forces for the success of Operation Sindoor as well as the integral role they play in nation-building, anti-piracy, safe return of Indian citizens from conflict zones and providing humanitarian assistance to friendly countries.The CCC at Easter Command headquarters in Vijay Durg, Kolkata, is being attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, national security adviser Ajit Doval, chief of defence staff Anil Chauhan, the three service chiefs and other top military officers and bureaucrats. Singh will address the commanders on Tuesday.Defence officials said that key topics under discussion include enhancing inter-service coordination, streamlining procurement processes, adopting advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and unmanned systems, and improving training frameworks for multi-domain operations. The conference emphasised the need to shift from traditional paradigms of warfare to agile, network-centric, and technology-driven military strategies.Reviewing the defence reforms implemented over the last two years, and the plan for the next two years, the PM's main thrust was on the urgent need for jointness among the armed forces, self-reliance in defence production and innovation to enhance operational readiness and ""prevail against any eventuality"" in the years ahead.The Modi govt has been pushing for the long-pending creation of the tri-Service integrated theatre commands (ITCs), in the most radical military reorganisation envisaged since Independence. The progress, however, has been slow. India currently has 17 single-service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which do not have the requisite synergy in planning, logistics and operations.The plan is to have two ""adversary-specific"" ITCs -- one for the northern borders with China at Lucknow and the other for the western front with Pakistan at Jaipur.","Pm narendra modi directed the defence ministry to'swiftly implement concrete steps' to achieve greater jointness, atmanirbharta and innovation to meet future challenges.

AIMPLB: SC interim order on Waqf 'incomplete and unsatisfactory',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aimplb-sc-interim-order-on-waqf-incomplete-and-unsatisfactory/articleshow/123906776.cms,"After SC Order on Waqf Act, Govt Says Parliament Upheld; Opposition Claims People’s Rights Saved

NEW DELHI: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has expressed disappointment over the Supreme Court of India ’s interim judgment on the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025, describing it as “incomplete and unsatisfactory” and sharing that the community feels that “those provisions not stayed at this stage shall be abused. ”The Board noted that while the Court has granted partial relief, the refusal to stay the entire Act “leaves numerous other harmful provisions in operation, including the prospective de-recognition of 'Waqf by user' and the mandatory requirement of a Waqf deed, which goes against the established tenets of Islamic law.” The Board’s spokesperson S Q R Ilyas said the Board will continue with its protests under the 'Save Waqf Campaign' and a rally will be held at Ramlila Maidan, Delhi, on November 16.The Court verdict evoked a mixed reaction from Muslim bodies like Jamiat Ulama -i- Hind that while welcoming the partial relief on certain clauses by the SC, emphasized that the Court’s remarks on “Waqf by User” are particularly “alarming and demand serious attention”.Meanwhile, All India Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz, Shariq Adeeb Ansari, national working president, welcomed the the verdict saying that the “nuanced judgment that protects constitutional principles, secures justice and maintains the sanctity of Waqf institutions while upholding the rule of law.”“I believe this verdict will benefit India's Muslims -- especially the Pasmanda sections -- by safeguarding their rights within the constitutional framework,"" he said.However, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind faction led by President, Maulana Mahmood Madani expressed concern over the fate of “Waqf by User”. He said that that India has more than 4 lakh Waqf properties classified under “Waqf by User,” including 1.19 lakh mosques and 1.50 lakh graveyards. More than 80% of these are unregistered.“The recent amendment has completely abolished the concept of “Waqf by User,” while merely exempting properties already registered — a cosmetic adjustment that fails to resolve the core concern,” he said. The interim order cannot be considered satisfactory until “Waqf by User” is fully safeguarded,” he added.Even as the JUH faction led by Arshad Madani welcomed the interim relief on certain provisions, he alleged that the Waqf Amendment Act was a “dangerous conspiracy against the Constitution aimed at snatching away the religious freedom of Muslims” and said that the Jamiat is confident that the SC will “strike down this law and provide complete constitutional justice”.The AIMPLB , however, highlighted the provisions where the Supreme Court’s interim order has provided relief like staying the provision that required a government officer’s report to validate waqf ownership, observing that executive authorities cannot decide property rights of citizens and saying that no Waqf shall be dispossessed or have its records altered until the matter is fully adjudicated by the Waqf Tribunal.The Board also cites that the Court’s directions with regards to number of non-Mulsims in the Central Waqf Council and State Waqf Boards and the stay on the requirement that a person must show or demonstrate that they have been ""professing Islam for at least five years"" to create a Waqf until the govt frames rules for such determination.","The all india muslim personal law board has expressed disappointment over the supreme court of india ’s interim judgment on the waqf (amendment) act 2025.

FBI’s Kash Patel Stumbles After Charlie Kirk’s Assassination; ‘Botched’ Updates Trigger Backlash

Who is Andrew Bailey? 'I am not...'



Kash Patel's series of wrong moves in the Charlie Kirk incident



Patel announced that the suspect was in custody hours after Charlie Kirk was shot. Then he took back his statement and said the suspect was released. They actually got a wrong person. A day later, Patel flew from New York to Utah to join a press conference where he was seen with an FBI jacket like a field agent. It was called unprecedented for the FBI director. Despite his presence, which delayed the Thursday press conference, Patel did not speak as the suspect was not identified. Patel was present at the press conference where they announced the arrest of Tyler Robinson, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox spoke about the details of how he was caught, not Patel.





Amid speculations that Kash Patel should be removed as the FBI director, insider chatter claims that former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who will be sworn in as a new deputy director of the FBI in a power-sharing role with Dan Bongino, will eventually replace Patel. Patel is believed to be on thin ice, though President Donald Trump praised his leadership and the FBI's investigation into the assassination of Charlie Kirk.Inside reports claim Trump is not thrilled with Patel, and the wrong arrest in connection with the Charlie Kirk murder was not the only reason. Patel's fallout with Pam Bondi over the Epstein case is where it all began. The White House, Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, have no confidence in Kash Patel and Pam Bondi, in particular, cannot stand Patel, Fox reported, citing a source.Andrew Bailey was reportedly Trump's original choice to lead the FBI. As he will be sworn in today as the co-deputy director, there is speculation that he is a part of a broader plan that will place him in the position of Patel. Bailey issued a statement to Fox clarifying that he is not replacing Patel.

Daylight saving time (DST) will end sooner than usual this year on Sunday, November 2, 2025, at 2:00 am local time.With it, Americans will have an extra hour of sleep, and also earlier sunsets in many regions. This year’s change is a day earlier than last year and is the second-earliest possible date for the shift since daylight saving time falls on the first Saturday in November, the earliest possible date is November 1.Daylight saving time, observed from March to November, was introduced to make better use of daylight. In spring, clocks are moved forward to extend evening daylight, while in autumn, clocks are set back to give more light in the mornings.Under current federal rules set by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. Next year, clocks will move forward again on Sunday, March 8, 2026.Most US states follow DST, but not all. Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe the change, citing limited benefit due to their climates. The Navajo Nation, which spans parts of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico, does observe DST to maintain consistent time across its territory.Five US territories, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, also do not follow DST.For many Americans, shifting the clocks requires changes to daily routines. Longer daylight in spring is generally seen as a benefit, while the fall shift brings darker mornings and earlier sunsets, disrupting commutes, outdoor plans, and schedules.","This year's change is a day earlier than last year and is the second-earliest possible date for the shift.

Shooting Charlie Kirk was pre-planned; some people were aware of it



Where did Robinson get the rifle?







Several questions remain unanswered even days after the arrest of Tyler Robinson in connection with Charlie Kirk's death, as Robinson has not been cooperating with the investigators. The FBI found his DNA evidence on the towel that was wrapped around the gun and found his Discord message in which he confessed to having killed Kirk. The agency has also come to a possible motive -- hatred for what Kirk stood for.Several people from the crowd at the Utah Valley University event that day claimed that they shot Charlie Kirk. One elderly man was even detained but was later released. The FBI is now probing if these were attempts to aid Tyler Robinson to flee the campus, if Tyler Robinson received help from the crowd.Robinson spoke about the event a few days ago at the dinner table and how he did not like Charlie Kirk coming to UVU for his event. The FBI has now revealed that there was a written note and a digital message in which Robinson told someone that he had the chance to take out Kirk and he was going to do it. The written note existed before the shooting and was destroyed after the shooting but FBI found forensic evidence of the note.It is not yet clear to whom Robinson told about the plan.A video has now surfaced showing Robinson at the university campus before the event.Tyler used a Mauser 98 rifle with a mounted scope to strike Kirk in the neck. According to experts, the Mauser 98 doesn't require an expert to be accurate, but basic competence is needed. Tyler Robinson belongs to a pro-gun family and was introduced to guns at an early age, as a photo of his childhood with a gun emerged. It was not difficult for him to procure a gun with a license. Tyler Robinson probably did not target Kirk's body as he might have been wearing a bulletproof vest and instead aimed for his neck.",Cops are probing whether tyler robinson was helped by anyone from the crowd after he shot charlie kirk.

Fans say the NFL’s Charlie Kirk tribute felt rushed and poorly executed

The Green Bay Packers and the NFL held a moment of silence for conservative activist Charlie Kirk before Thursday Night Football against the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field. Kirk, 31, was shot and killed Wednesday during a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.The tribute took place about 25 minutes before kickoff. The in-stadium announcement said, “The National Football League asks that you please join us in a moment of silent reflection following the murder of Charlie Kirk. The NFL condemns all violence in our communities. It will take all of us to stop hate. Thank you.”Former President Donald Trump confirmed Kirk’s death on Wednesday and later said he would posthumously award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The FBI released a photo of a person of interest Thursday, but no arrests have been made.Fox News senior NFL writer Armando Salguero shared video of the silence. The MLFootball account also circulated the clip, describing the moment as a league-wide honor. Critics, however, said the execution fell flat.One frustrated fan in attendance wrote, “They did it when the stadium wasn’t even half full half an hour ago, and it went right to. It was terrible.” Another attendee added, “It was ridiculous; they didn’t even display it on the jumbotron.”

NFL’s lack of consistency compared to past public statements drew more criticism

On social media, the pushback was even stronger. One user posted, “We doing for just anyone now? There was a school shooting yesterday (AND today) AND a shooting at a US naval academy but I guess that’s not important.” Another wrote, “That wasn’t even a moment. Couldn’t even count one second of silence.”After Oregon’s Week 3 win over Northwestern, coach Dan Lanning used his postgame press conference to reflect on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Lanning said the Ducks’ locker room, filled with players of different races, religions, and backgrounds, shows how love can exist despite differences, something he believes the country has lost sight of.He also shared that he recently learned Kirk was an Oregon fan, noting Kirk and his wife attended last year’s win over Ohio State. Lanning expressed sympathy for Erika Kirk and their children, calling the killing “evil” and adding, “Life matters. I think we’ve lost sight of that.”The NFL’s silence in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s assassination frustrated many. The league has issued statements in the past on events such as the killing of George Floyd and support for LGBTQ rights. The absence of a message for Kirk led some to accuse the NFL of picking and choosing when to speak up.Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker posted Kirk’s final text message, calling him a “strong witness for Christ.” Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson also paid tribute, as did New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who wrote, “Praying for him and his family. Charlie did great things for our country!! Political Violence NEEDS TO STOP!! Pray for our country man. This is disgusting and Sad!!”ESPN analyst Pat McAfee called the shooting “startling, saddening, and maddening.” Former NFL players Tim Tebow and Julian Edelman also acknowledged Kirk’s death.Former NFL punter Chris Kluwe, on the other hand, stirred controversy on BlueSky this week after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Kluwe, who earlier this year lost his job as a high school football coach for calling the MAGA movement “Nazi,” posted a profanity-laced message backing Sen. Elizabeth Warren for rejecting claims that Democratic rhetoric had fueled the attack. In his post, Kluwe argued that Republicans are responsible for the hostile climate, writing that they “could stop it at any time” and shouldn’t be treated like “children.”The NFL addressed its tribute to Charlie Kirk in a statement released Friday, noting that teams will decide for themselves whether to observe a similar gesture on Sunday.

The sudden upsurge that changed everything

Jaylon Johnson’s net worth and multiple hustles

Chicago Bears star cornerback Jaylon Johnson has quickly become one of the NFL’s top-paid defensive backs. His net worth significantly increased, adding much to his already existing sum. Signing a massive contract extension in 2024, Johnson attained financial security. His future looks secure, with both steady salary earnings and through endorsements and investments.The turning point in his career came in March 2024 when Johnson signed a four-year contract. A $76 million extension with Chicago was something that could change everything in his life, and it actually did. The deal averages about $19 million per season, firmly placing him among the league’s highest-paid corners.Just as important as the headline figure, Johnson secured $43.8 million guaranteed at signing, with an overall sum of $51 million guaranteed. For the 2025 season specifically, his base salary is just under $16 million, while his cap hit for the Bears sits around $21 million.For the 2025 season specifically, Johnson is set to take home $15.9 million in cash, which includes a $3.9 million base salary, a $12 million restructure bonus, and a small workout bonus.His official cap hit for the Bears sits at just under $13 million, a manageable number for Chicago given his impact on the field.Also Read: How weather and stadium conditions impact the Bears vs Vikings win probability Johnson’s net worth in 2025 is estimated at around $8–10 million. While much of his wealth is tied up in guaranteed money from his contract, he has already pocketed more than enough to secure his financial future. With two more seasons left on his extension after this year, and potential for another payday down the line, his overall earnings could soar well past $100 million if he stays healthy and productive.Off the field, Johnson isn’t known for glittery endorsement deals yet, but that may change as he continues to anchor Chicago’s defense. With his reputation as a lockdown corner and the Bears’ resurgence under a young roster, his profile is only getting bigger.In short, Jaylon Johnson’s combination of steady on-field performance and a well-structured contract has made him one of the NFL’s most secure young stars, both professionally and financially. Additionally, as of 2024, he was associated with Nike, according to sources.At the age of 26, Jaylon Johnson has not only secured his place as a leader in the Bears’ secondary but also set himself up for a prosperous future. His net worth as of today is only a part of the ongoing story. The bigger picture is a player whose value, both on and off the field, is rising.","Chicago bears star cornerback jaylon johnson has quickly become one of the nfl’s top-paid defensive backs.

The US vice president JD Vance announced that he will host 'The Charlie Kirk Show' from the White House on Monday to pay tribute to his slain friend.The show is scheduled to air at noon, less than a week after Kirk was assassinated during a college campus visit in Utah.Vance and Kirk had been close friends for many years, long before Vance entered politics. In a letter to Kirk shared after his death at Utah Valley University, Vance reflected on their time together.He noted that Kirk was one of the first people he contacted when he decided to run for the US Senate in 2021 and that Kirk helped connect him with others who could support his campaign, including Donald Trump Jr.Vance described Kirk as one of his most dedicated advocates over the years, who even helped guide the selection process that ultimately led to Vance becoming vice-president.The vice president said he first learned about Kirk being shot through group messages with friends and government officials while in a meeting in the West Wing.“God didn’t answer those prayers, and that’s OK. He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I’ll ask him to talk to big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly,” Vance wrote.Vance had also accompanied Kirk’s body during transport from Utah to his home state of Arizona.Images from the flight show Kirk’s wife, Erika, dressed in black and holding their two young children, walking hand-in-hand with second lady Usha Vance. The vice president and uniformed service members helped carry the flag-draped casket onto the plane.Earlier, on Wednesday, Vance paid tribute to Kirk on social media, calling him “a true friend” and a major influence in his rise in national politics. Kirk, the conservative activist who was shot at Utah Valley University, helped shape Vance’s path from a MAGA outsider to the vice presidency.“Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind,” Vance wrote. “Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives. When others were right, he learned from them. When he was right — as he usually was — he was generous.”Vance said Kirk was crucial to his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio, assisting with strategy, fundraising, and grassroots connections. “He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr., who took a call from me because Charlie asked,” he wrote.Kirk's children also remained deeply involved with Vance’s family and they often spent time together.“Our kids, especially our oldest, struggled with the attention and the constant presence of the protective detail. I felt this acute sense of guilt that I had conscripted my kids into this life without getting their permission. And Charlie was constantly calling and texting, checking on our family and offering guidance and prayers,” Vance said.","Jd vance will host 'the charlie kirk show' from the white house on monday.

It will be concluding shortly.”He further added, “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy!""The US President will also be speaking to Chinese President Xi later in the week.“I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday.

The meeting, hosted at the Palacio de Santa Cruz, Spain’s ministry of foreign affairs headquarters, brought together US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese vice premier He Lifeng.According to China’s Xinhua news agency, discussions covered economic and trade issues, including the TikTok dispute. The Spanish government also confirmed the talks, which will continue until Wednesday.Trade relations between the United States and China have been highly strained this year, with both sides imposing tariffs that climbed into triple digits and rattled global supply chains. In recent months, they agreed to reduce duties temporarily to 30% on US exports to China and 10% on Chinese goods entering the United States.A fresh deal in August delayed the reimposition of higher tariffs for 90 days, keeping the pause in place until 10 November.The fate of TikTok remains a central issue.
