NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Friday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a ""tougher negotiator"" than him. He made this statement during a joint press conference with PM Modi.""He (PM Narendra Modi) is a much tougher negotiator than me and he is a much better negotiator than me. There is not even a contest,"" Trump said while addressing the joint press conference.Trump also said he shares a ""special bond"" with Modi and India but nevertheless warned that India won't be spared from higher tariffs he's begun imposing on US trade partners around the world.Trump, who had earlier criticized India as the ""tariff king,"" described the India's import duties as ""very unfair and strong.""At the joint news conference with PM Modi, Trump said, ""Whatever India charges, we charge them. So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge.""Trump also announced that India and the US have agreed to work together on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor ( IMEC ). He described it as an important trade route that will operate from Israel to Italy and then to the US.Speaking about IMEC, Trump said, ""We agreed to work together to help build one of the greatest trade routes in all of history. It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the US, connecting our partners, roads, railways and undersea cables, many many undersea cables. It is a big development. It is a lot of money going to be spent and we have already spent some but we are going to be spending a lot more in order to stay advanced and stay the leader. I am pleased to report that with today's announcements, the friendship between the US and India is the strongest, I believe it has ever been. I think our relationship is the best it's ever been between two leaders of two countries.""The IMEC includes an Eastern Corridor connecting India to the Gulf region and a Northern Corridor connecting the Gulf region to Europe. It will have a railway, ship-rail transit network, and road transport routes. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on IMEC was signed by India, the US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, the European Union, Italy, France, and Germany during the G20 Summit in India in 2023.Trump also said the US will increase military sales to India and could provide F35 Stealth fighters in the future. He reaffirmed the Quad partnership 's commitment to maintaining stability in the Indo-Pacific region.""Starting this year, we will increase military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We are also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F35 Stealth fighters. In 2017, my administration revived and reinvigorated the Quad security partnership...Prime Minister and I reaffirm the strong cooperation among the United States, India, Australia and Japan, and it's really crucial to maintain peace, prosperity, tranquillity in the Indo-Pacific,"" Trump said.Trump also announced agreements on energy imports and trade routes.""The Prime Minister and I also reached an important agreement on energy that will ensure the US to be the leading supplier of oil and natural gas to India, hopefully, the number one supplier. In the groundbreaking development for the US nuclear industry, India is also reforming laws to welcome US nuclear technology, which is at the highest level in the Indian market,"" Trump said.""We agreed to work together to help build one of the greatest trade routes in all of history. It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the US, connecting our partners, roads, railways and undersea cables. It is a big development,"" he added.","Us president donald trump on friday said that prime minister narendra modi is a ""tougher negotiator"" than him.

NEW DELHI: India has improved its Climate Risk Index (CRI) rank from seventh worst affected country globally due to extreme weather events in 2019 to 49th in 2022. However, historically it remains among the top 10 most affected ones by figuring as the sixth worst in long-term (1993-2022) assessment.The findings are part of the CRI 2025, released by environmental think tank Germanwatch Wednesday, that analysed six indicators including fatalities and economic loss due to extreme weather events reported in the countries during 1993-2022.The report shows that India reported loss of 80,000 lives and nearly $180 billion in 400 extreme weather events in 30 years (1993-2022).Globally, over 7,65,000 people lost their lives due to more than 9,400 extreme weather events in the 30 years until 2022. It caused economic damages totaling $4.2 trillion (inflation-adjusted). Storms (35%), heat waves (30%) and floods (27%) caused the most fatalities during 1993-2022.The report, highlighting the consequences of globally increasing climate risks, shows seven of the 10 most affected countries in 2022 belonged to the high-income country group. ""This clearly indicates that, while the coping capacities of high-income countries significantly exceed those of lower-income countries, higher-income countries should also increase their climate risk management,"" the report said.Italy, Spain and Greece are the three EU nations which are among the 10 most affected countries worldwide over the past three decades. Dominica, China, Honduras, Myanmar and Italy are the top five most affected in the list of 1993-2022.The report comes days after WEF ranked extreme weather events amplified by climate change as the second most considerable global risk after armed conflict and war.Referring to India, the report underlined that the country experienced devastating floods in 1993, 1998, and 2013, along with severe heat waves in 2002, 2003, and 2015. The country shows high absolute fatalities and economic losses, as well as high absolute and relative numbers of people affected during 1993-2022.Notable events from India in the report include 1998 Gujarat and 1999 Odisha cyclones; cyclones Hudhud and Amphan in 2014 and 2020, respectively; 1993 floods in northern India, Uttarakhand floods of 2013, and severe floods in 2019.

He has been linked to Pakistani-American terrorist David Coleman Headley, a key conspirator in the attacks. India had requested his extradition from the US, a move that was supported by the US government. However, Rana repeatedly challenged the decision in American courts.His appeals against extradition were rejected by lower courts, and in August 2023, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the India-US Extradition Treaty allowed for his extradition. Rana then filed a petition with the US Supreme Court to block the decision. The US Solicitor General urged the court to reject his plea, reinforcing the US government's stance in favor of India's extradition request.On January 25, the US Supreme Court denied Rana’s final petition, effectively clearing the way for his extradition to India. With this ruling, Rana is now set face trial in India.","Tahawwur rana, a canadian citizen of pakistani origin, is accused of involvement in the 2008 mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, including six americans.

She said leave aside the GST, all single-screen theatres are shutting down, and there is no cut in entertainment tax. I want to clarify—there is no entertainment tax levied by the Union government,” Sitharaman said.She explained that before the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), states levied entertainment taxes as high as 100%, whereas under the GST regime, movie tickets above Rs 100 are now taxed at 18%, down from 28%. “For tickets below Rs 100, GST has been reduced from 18% to just 12%. Food and beverages inside theatres attract only 5% GST, including the ‘notorious’ popcorn,” she remarked.Bachchan had accused the government of using the film industry for its own benefit while failing to provide any support. “You have totally ignored the film and entertainment industry because you only use them for serving your own purpose,” she said in the Rajya Sabha. She alleged that the government wanted to “kill the industry,” urging Sitharaman to have “mercy” on it.In a sharp rebuttal, Sitharaman pointed to significant government initiatives supporting the media and entertainment sector, including India hosting the first-ever World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES 2025) in Mumbai. She also mentioned the recent approval of a National Centre for Excellence for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality.Highlighting historical incidents of suppression in the film industry, Sitharaman reminded Bachchan of how the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in 2020 had targeted Kangana Ranaut. “Her office was demolished within 24 hours until the Bombay High Court intervened. Jaya Bachchan ji must speak to her alliance partners about that,” she said.She further pointed out that Hridaynath Mangeshkar, the brother of Lata Mangeshkar, was fired from All India Radio because one of his compositions displeased the Congress government. She recalled that celebrated lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri was jailed, Dev Anand was threatened for opposing the Emergency, and Kishore Kumar’s songs were banned from All India Radio.“We have not forgotten the film industry.

So this is a very significant thing.""While the specific agenda of the talks remains undisclosed, Tharoor underscored key issues that India would likely prioritize. ""There are trade issues with Trump talking about tariffs. There are issues to do with the H-1B visas for legal Indian immigration. There are issues concerning the manner in which illegal immigrants were sent back and treated in very inhumane ways. That will also have to be addressed.""Tharoor also pointed to global geopolitical concerns that could feature in the discussions. ""There may be some conversations, who knows, on Ukraine. PM Modi has been to both Ukraine and Russia. President Trump took an initiative today with both countries. So there are a lot of issues. It is difficult for us to sit here and guess what they might discuss.

’s stance on key issues

Concerns over trade, immigration, and climate

Modi’s meeting with Elon Musk also under scrutiny

Modi-Trump talks set against growing bilateral tensions

NEW DELHI: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s high-profile meeting with US President Donald Trump, the Congress on Thursday questioned whether he would ""summon up the courage"" to raise India’s concerns over the treatment of deported Indian citizens and other critical issues, including trade, immigration, and climate policies.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, posed a series of questions to Modi, urging him to confront Trump on recent deportations. “Will Modi tell Trump that India would send its own aircraft—like Venezuela and Colombia—to bring back deportees in the future?” Ramesh asked.He also criticized the government's concessions to the US, including slashing import duties on farm produce and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and amending the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damages Act, 2010, to benefit US firms.The Congress leader pressed Modi on whether he would oppose Trump’s policies, including his stance on Palestine and his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the WHO. Ramesh also raised concerns about “racist attacks” on H1B visa holders, the majority of whom are Indians.“Will Mr Modi tell President Trump that attacks on H1B visa holders—over 70% of whom are Indian youth—are unacceptable? H1B visas have benefited both countries,” Ramesh stated.The Congress also questioned Modi’s upcoming meeting with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, asking whether India would insist on Tesla manufacturing in India rather than merely assembling vehicles.“Will Modi uphold his policy of auctioning spectrum instead of administrative allocation, and ensure that security considerations remain non-negotiable for satellite internet providers like Starlink?” Ramesh added.Modi, currently on a two-day visit to Washington, is set to meet Trump in the first bilateral talks of Trump’s second term. The visit comes amid concerns in New Delhi over Trump’s ""America First"" trade policies and immigration stance, as well as recent deportations that sparked outrage in India.The meeting will be closely watched for Modi’s response to these pressing concerns and whether he takes a firm stand on India’s interests.","Congress general secretary jairam ramesh, in a post on x, posed a series of questions to modi, urging him to confront trump on recent deportations.

We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters ,” he said.Trump also highlighted his strong rapport with PM Modi, calling him a “much tougher negotiator” and noting the “special bond” between their nations.The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening trade and defence relations, even as Trump maintained his hard stance on economic issues with much of the world.If the F-35 stealth fighter deal goes through, India will join an exclusive group of countries—including NATO allies, Israel, and Japan—that operate the cutting-edge aircraft.Beyond military agreements, trade discussions took centre stage. Trump, who has long criticised India’s tariffs, reiterated his concerns, calling them “unfair” and “very strong.” Earlier in the day, he announced new reciprocal tariffs on all countries, including India, raising uncertainty over future trade ties. However, PM Modi struck a more optimistic tone, saying both sides would work towards a “mutually beneficial trade agreement” focusing on oil and gas. Trump also highlighted broader economic collaboration, stating that the two countries planned to invest in infrastructure projects, including ports, railways, and undersea cables, as part of a trade route linking India to Israel and Europe.Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk also joined Trump’s discussions with PM Modi. The newly appointed DOGE head, who has taken on an influential role in the administration, also held a private meeting with the Indian leader, raising questions about whether he was acting in an official or business capacity. Modi later shared photos of their meeting, showing a Musk alongside Indian officials.The visit also touched on immigration policies. India recently accepted a US military flight carrying 100 shackled migrants as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown, sparking criticism from Indian opposition leaders. However, PM Modi defended the decision, stating that undocumented Indians in the US were being exploited by human traffickers. “Any verified Indian who is in the US illegally, we are fully prepared to take them back to India,” he said.In return, Trump announced that the US would extradite Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a suspect linked to the deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks. Calling him “one of the very evil people in the world,” Trump confirmed that the long-pending extradition would proceed after Rana lost his appeal to the US Supreme Court.","Us president donald trump has announced plans to sell advanced f-35 fighter jets to india.

Congress accuses govt of 'bulldozing' waqf report in Parliament



New Delhi: The joint parliamentary committee report on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, which proposes to overhaul management of waqf properties, was tabled in Parliament on Thursday with the Lok Sabha Speaker allowing the addition of the dissent notes in their entirety to the annexure.Home minister Amit Shah had earlier said his party had no objection to the dissent notes being attached to the report without redaction. Rules of procedure authorise the JPC chairman to use his discretion to decide on the inclusion of dissent notes. JPC chairman Jagdambika Pal had left out dissent notes which, it is learned, were critical of the committee's functioning. In Rajya Sabha, a corrigendum was issued to reflect the addition of dissent notes.Both Houses opened to protests from the opposition which sought withdrawal of the report and alleged that the dissent notes were not included in the report in their entirety and portions were removed.

Trump prioritises Americans' safety: Officials on Pannun plot

NEW DELHI: President Donald Trump prioritises nothing more than the safety of every American, said senior Trump administration officials in first remarks on the foiled murder-for-hire plot against US national and India-designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun . The Biden administration had indicted an Indian govt official for orchestrating the plot, forcing Indian authorities to launch a probe in the case.""I can tell you President Trump, you've seen this in recent days, with respect to the persons we've brought home, he prioritises nothing more than the safety of every American, and that is the continued position of this administration,"" said a senior official when asked if Trump was going to raise the issue in his meeting with PM Narendra Modi.The remarks came in a background media briefing, in which White House officials also underscored the perception of India-US ties as among the most critical partnerships of the 21st century and said Trump was going to do his part to ensure that remains the ""foundational element moving forward"". The officials said the countries are moving towards signing a new defence framework and that there's ongoing conversation about a number of new procurements by India that can help reduce the trade deficit. India is expected to agree to more energy and defence purchases from the US in the meeting with Trump.Talking about Trump's agenda with India, they said the US will build on defence sales to India, prioritising the use of American technology and India's status as a key importer of America's natural resources. According to the officials, Trump will seek a fair trade partnership and discuss ways to build up the Quad partnership to promote stability and peace across the Indo-Pacific. Specifically on China, alluding to the previous Trump administration's support for India during the eastern Ladakh standoff, the official said that the president is very proud ""in the summer of 2020"" to have augmented and strengthened the partnership with India, particularly in the border crisis with the Chinese, and that ""portends kind of continued cooperation"".Days before the return of Trump to the White House, the Indian high-level committee probing alleged Indian involvement in the plot against Pannun had filed a report recommending quick legal action against Vikash Yadav, the accused official. India is hoping the matter will be allowed to rest here and will not get the kind of salience it got under the Biden administration.The officials appreciated recent measures by India that could help reduce the trade deficit the US runs with India. ""I anticipate what you'll see coming out of a meeting (Modi-trump) today is further momentum towards a solidified fair, and I emphasise that word fair bilateral trade arrangement between our two dynamic and growing economies, and the hope would be to have such a deal in place in the calendar year 2025,"" said an official, while also expressing support for IMEEC, iCET and I2U2.""Critical technologies partnership between our economies is important to ensure that free societies are leading the way in some of the most important technologies in the future. I expect collaboration will continue with this administration, and you will see some announcements... some of the key areas, semi-conductors, critical minerals, supply chain resilience and diversification, those are good things for our economy and the president certainly believes that too.""",Trump will seek a fair trade partnership and discuss ways to build up the quad partnership to promote stability and peace across the indo-pacific.
