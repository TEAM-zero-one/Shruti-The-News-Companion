NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough, the Army's elite para commandos gunned down three terrorists in an encounter on the outskirts of Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday.One of the terrorists is Sulieman alias Asif, who is believed to be the mastermind of the April 22 Pahalgam attack, news agency PTI reported citing officials. The group was killed after the security forces launched a surprise action, codenamed 'Operation Mahadev. 'The two others were identified as Jibran and Hamza Afghani. Jibran was allegedly involved in the Sonamarg Tunnel attack in October 20204.One M4 carbine rifle, two AK rifles and other munitions were recovered from the site of the encounter.Additional security reinforcements have also been rushed as intelligence inputs suggested the presence of another group of terrorists in the area.The bodies of the slain terrorists were handed over to local police, which helped in the identification process, for legal formalities and final rites as per the standard operating procedure.Inspector General of Police (Kashmir Zone) VK Birdi described Operation Mahadev as a 'long-drawn operation.'Earlier, Srinagar-based Chinar Corps in a post on X said three terrorists were killed under the anti-terror operation.","One of the terrorists is sulieman alias asif, who is believed to be the mastermind of the april 22 pahalgam attack.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday made a detailed speech in the Lok Sabha on the government’s diplomatic response following the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor Speaking firmly, Jaishankar speaking in Lok Sabha at the Monsoon Session debate took aim at both past governments and present Opposition critics, asserting India’s zero-tolerance policy on terrorism and listing the foreign policy actions undertaken in the wake of the April 22 attack.""At no stage in any conversation with the US was there any linkage of trade with Operation Sindoor,"" Jaishankar said, adding that the request to pause action came through the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) communication channel from Pakistan The foreign minister emphasised the massive global backing India received post-attack, underlining the effectiveness of India's diplomatic outreach.""The result of that diplomacy was that out of the 190 nations of UN only three, besides Pakistan, opposed Operation Sindoor. Overwhelmingly, there was recognition that terror was unacceptable and the country which has been attacked has the right to defend itself and India was doing exactly that.""Jaishankar reiterated that India's red lines had been crossed with the Pahalgam incident, necessitating a firm and visible response. ""It was important to send a clear, strong and resolute message after the Pahalgam attack as our red lines had been crossed and we had to make it very apparent that there would be serious consequences,"" he said."" It was important to send a clear, strong and resolute message after the Pahalgam attack. Our red lines had been crossed. and we had to make it very apparent that there would be serious consequences as a result. The first step, which was taken, was that a meeting of the Cabinet Committee of Security took place on 23rd April. That meeting decided that-The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.""It was very clear that, after the first set of steps approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security, India's response to the Pahalgam attack would not stop there. Our task from a diplomatic perspective, from a foreign policy approach, was to shape the global understanding of the Pahalgam attack. What we tried to do was to bring out to the international community Pakistan's long-standing use of cross-border terrorism. We highlighted the history of terrorism in Pakistan and how this particular attack was meant to target the economy of Jammu and Kashmir and to sow communal discord among the people of India.""""The focus for our diplomacy was the UN Security Council. The challenge for us was that at this particular point, Pakistan is a member of the Security Council and we are not... Our goals in the Security Council were two: 1- to get an endorsement from the Security Council of the need for accountability, and 2- to bring to justice those who perpetrated this attack. I am glad to say that if you look at the Security Council statement of 25th April, the members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the terrorist attack. They affirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. And most importantly, the Council underlined the need to hold the perpetrators, organisers, financers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.""""From 25th April till the commencement of Operation Sindoor, there were a number of phone calls and conversations. At my level, there were 27 calls; at PM Modi's level, almost 20 calls. About 35-40 letters of support came in, and what we tried to do was to create a narrative, prepare the diplomacy for the launch of Operation Sindoor... There are 193 nations in the United Nations, only 3 countries apart from Pakistan opposed Operation Sindoor. ..""""...We had seven parliamentary delegations which went to 33 countries. Some comments were made about those delegations. I have to tell Arvind Savant ji that you are completely misinformed. Those delegations were received with great honour. Please look at the tweets of people sitting next to you. These seven delegations did the nation proud. Every member, members of opposition, members of the government, public spirited citizens, retired diplomats, they were able to explain to the whole world our posture of zero tolerance against terrorism. ..""""Yes, I went to China to make our opposition very clear about de-escalation, trade restrictions and terrorism. I did not go to China for the Olympics. I did not go to China for secret agreements. The House should know that people were watching the Olympics when China was issuing stapled visas for people from Arunachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir...""""We were asked, why did you stop at this time? Why did you not go further? This question is being asked by people who, after 26/11, felt that the best action was inaction...26/11 happened in November 2008. What was the reaction? The reaction was Sharm-el-Sheikh. In Sharm-el-Sheikh, the then government and the Pakistani Prime Minister agreed that terrorism is a main threat to both countries. Now, today, people are saying America is hyphenating you, Russia is hyphenating you, that is what I heard Deepender Hooda ji say. You are hyphenating yourself. You did not need a foreign country to say please link India to Pakistan...And worst of all, they accepted a reference to Balochistan in that...""""...We have just come back from Maldives. The day before yesterday, PM Modi was the Guest of Honour at their Independence Day. It is the same country that, during their (Congress) time, forced an Indian company to leave an airport, that country today has invited India to build two new airports...""Union home minister Amit Shah also intervened during Jaishankar’s speech, slamming the Opposition for repeated disruptions.""...I have an objection that they (Opposition) don't have faith in an Indian Foreign Minister but they have faith in some other country. I can understand the importance of foreign in their party. But this doesn't mean that all the things of their party should be imposed here in the House. This is the reason why they are sitting there (opposition benches), and will remain sitting there for the next 20 years...""","External affairs minister s jaishankar made a detailed speech in the lok sabha on the government’s diplomatic response following the pahalgam terror attack and operation sindoor.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday shredded US president Donald Trump 's claim that he used trade as leverage to materialise a ""ceasefire"" between India and Pakistan.During the debate on Operation Sindoor in Lok Sabha, Jaishankar said that ""at no stage in any conversation between India and the United States there was linkage with trade"".""At no stage, in any conversation with the United States, was there any linkage with trade and what was going on. There was no call between the Prime Minister and President Trump between April 22, when the President called the PM to convey his sympathy, and June 17, when he called the Prime Minister in Canada to explain why he couldn't meet,"" Jaishankar said in the Lower House.""After we retaliated to Pakistan's attack, we got phone calls saying Pakistan was ready to stop; but we told them request has to come from DGMO,"" Jaishankar told Parliament.Since May 10, when Trump announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire after a long night of talks mediated by Washington, he has repeated his claim on several occasions that he helped settle the tensions between India and Pakistan.Trump claimed that the understanding came through trade talks that helped ease tensions between the two countries.Speaking at the White House's Oval Office during a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Trump had said, ""If you take a look at what we just did with Pakistan and India.We settled that whole, and I think I settled it through trade.""However, India has been consistently maintaining that the understanding on cessation of hostilities with Pakistan was reached following direct talks between the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of the two militaries.In a nearly 35-minute phone call with Trump last month, PM Modi firmly stated that India does not and will ""never accept"" mediation and that the discussions between Indian and Pakistani militaries on cessation of military actions were initiated at Islamabad's request.Jaishankar stepped up his attack on the Congress party, saying ""people who did nothing have the temerity to question the government which brought down Bahawalpur and Muridke terror sites"". The foreign minister was referring to the UPA government's response to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks.""Who thought that terror sites in Bahawalpur and Muridke will be brought down the way they were: Jaishankar in Lok Sabha. Thanks to India's diplomacy, TRF - which owned up Pahalgam attack- designated as global terrorist organisation, "" Jaishankar said in Lok Sabha.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes.","S jaishankar shredded us president donald trump's claim that he used trade as leverage to materialise a ""ceasefire"" between india and pakistan.

NEW DELHI: BJP leader Baijayant Panda on Monday took a swipe at Congress during the Lok Sabha debate on Operation Sindoor with a special mention of Shashi Tharoor As Panda was making statement on government's actions post-Pahalgam attack, an opposition MP remarked that the discussion was not interesting.In a split second, Panda responded sharply by saying that the discussion would have been more engaging had Congress allowed some of good speakers to participate in the discussion. The BJP leader then went on to directly refer to Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.“It would have been truly enjoyable if you had also given a free hand. You have several leaders who could speak well on Operation Sindoor. I was listening — my friend, the honourable Shashi Tharoor Ji, speaks very well,"" he said.""Though it’s a different matter that, for some time now, his party leadership hasn’t been allowing him to speak. But I was very pleased to see that no one could stop him from speaking in the national interest,” said Panda in Lok Sabha.Tharoor, meanwhile, was seen smiling in the background as the BJP MP made the statement.Shashi Tharoor was part of the all-party delegation that delivered official briefings on Operation Sindoor representing India’s position abroad as part of a government-backed effort to build national consensus on counterterrorism.Ealier in the day, Shashi Tharoor’s absence from the Operation Sindoor debate raised eyebrows within and outside Parliament. The Thiruvananthapuram MP, who led India’s diplomatic outreach abroad following the Pahalgam terror attack, declined the Congress party’s offer to speak during the crucial discussion in Lok Sabha, sources told PTI.According to senior leaders, Tharoor was approached by Congress MPs Gaurav Gogoi and K Suresh, who inquired if he wished to participate in the debate. “It is a practice that senior leaders are asked whether they are interested in speaking on a major issue,” a Congress functionary was quoted as saying. “Gaurav Gogoi and K Suresh had reached out to him and asked if he was interested in speaking during the debate on Operation Sindoor, to which he said he is not interested and would like to speak on the ports bill. ”Tharoor instead chose to focus on The Indian Ports Bill, 2025. His silence on the national security issue came after he publicly endorsed the government’s handling of Operation Sindoor, a position seen as diverging from the party’s official line.The Congress party has been critical of the government over intelligence lapses and the alleged international fallout of the strike, including claims made by US President Donald Trump about brokering peace between India and Pakistan. Tharoor, meanwhile, had led a diplomatic mission to the US and Latin American countries to rally support for India’s cross-border strikes on terror camps in Pakistan.Asked whether he would speak in Parliament on Operation Sindoor, Tharoor had replied cryptically to reporters, saying: “Maun vrat, maun vrat.”","Bjp leader baijayant panda took a swipe at congress during the lok sabha debate on operation sindoor with a special mention of shashi tharoor.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday lashed out at the opposition in the Lok Sabha for repeatedly disrupting external affairs minister S Jaishankar ’s speech during the debate on Operation Sindoor , accusing them of lacking faith in India’s own cabinet ministers.Speaking in the House, Amit Shah got up twice to strongly object to the disruptions and accused the opposition of showing more faith in foreign narratives than in the words of India’s own cabinet ministers.""If an oath-taking cabinet minister is speaking, we should listen to him. They have more faith in some people outside India than in their own minister who is speaking on record,"" Shah said.He further added, ""When their speakers were talking, we listened patiently. Tomorrow I will inform you how many lies have been told by them. But even those lies — we accepted them like poison with calm. Now they cannot even listen to the truth.""""Mr Speaker, you should offer them protection. Everyone can comment from their seats, that’s not difficult. But when such a serious subject is being discussed, and a senior minister is speaking, does it suit the Opposition to heckle him from their seats? You must urge them to maintain decorum or else later, we will also not be able to manage our members,” Shah warned.The home minister also said, “I have an objection that they (opposition) don't have faith in an Indian Foreign Minister but they have faith in some other country.

These included:Jaishankar added, “It was important to send a clear, strong and resolute message after the Pahalgam attack. Our red lines had been crossed, and we had to make it very apparent that there would be serious consequences.”He also explained that India’s diplomatic focus was on shaping international opinion, particularly at the United Nations Security Council, where Pakistan is currently a member.“Our goals in the Security Council were two: to get an endorsement for the need for accountability, and to bring to justice those who perpetrated the attack. I am glad to say that on 25th April, the UNSC condemned the terrorist attack in the strongest terms,” Jaishankar said.He added, “The Council affirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.”The 16-hour-long Operation Sindoor discussion has been marked by sharp exchanges and fierce political posturing, with national security, diplomacy, and internal political divides all taking centre stage.",Union home minister amit shah lashed out at the opposition in the lok sabha for repeatedly disrupting external affairs minister s jaishankar ’s speech during the debate on operation sindoor.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday targeted the opposition in the Lok Sabha, accusing them of prioritising the wrong questions during discussions on Operation Sindoor Responding to queries raised by some opposition MPs about possible Indian casualties, Rajnath Singh said their line of questioning did not reflect the nation’s sentiment.“Few members of the opposition have been asking how many of our aircraft were shot down? I feel their question does not adequately represent our national sentiments. They have not asked us how many enemy aircraft our Armed Forces shot down?” Singh said in the Lok Sabha.He added, “If they must ask a question, it should be whether India destroyed terrorist bases, and the answer to that is, yes... If you have a question to ask, ask this: Were any of our brave soldiers harmed in this operation? The answer is, no, none of our soldiers were harmed.”Reiterating that the opposition was failing in its role to raise meaningful and responsible questions, the defence minister said the success of Operation Sindoor had already been communicated earlier and again in the House that day.Also read: Operation Sindoor debate: Gaurav Gogoi leads opposition charge against government in Lok Sabha; asks ‘how terrorists reached Pahalgam?’ “In any country, the public assigns different responsibilities to the ruling party and the opposition.

Here's what Rajnath Singh said on Operation Sindoor

""Soon after Pahalgam attack , our Armed Forces took action and hit with precision the nine terrorist infra sites in which more than 100 terorrists, their trainers and handlers were targeted,"" Rajnath Singh said.

, our Armed Forces took action and hit with precision the nine terrorist infra sites in which more than 100 terorrists, their trainers and handlers were targeted,"" Rajnath Singh said. He said: ""In this military operation, it is estimated that over a hundred terrorists, their trainers, handlers, and associates were killed. Most of these were linked to terrorist organisations such as Jaish-e-Mohammed , Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen""

, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen"" ""The entire operation was concluded within 22 minutes,"" he said in Lok Sabha.

""Our actions were entirely in self-defence, neither provocative nor expansionist. Yet, on May 10, 2025, at approximately 1.30am, Pakistan launched a large-scale attack on India using missiles, drones, rockets, and other long-range weapons,"" the minister said.

Rajnath Singh on India pausing Operation Sindoor

""India paused its action because the predecided political and military objectives were achieved. Saying that this operation was paused under any pressure is baseless and absolutely wrong... In my political life, I have always tried not to speak lies ever,"" the minister said.

""On 10th May, when the Indian Air Force struck hard at multiple airfields in Pakistan, Pakistan admitted defeat and offered to cease hostilities. This offer was accepted with the caveat that this Operation has only been paused. If any misadventure occurs from Pakistan's side in the future, this Operation will be resumed,"" Rajnath Singh warned.

""As the Prime Minister has rightly said, Operation Sindoor has only been paused, not called off. If needed, if Pakistan dares to repeat any misadventure, we are fully prepared to respond with even greater intensity and decisiveness,"" Rajnath Singh said.

Rajnath Singh on Indian defence against Pakistan

""S-400, Akash Missile system, Air Defence guns proved to be very useful and completely foiled this attack by Pakistan,"" he said.

I am proud to say that our Air Defence system, Counter-Drone system, and electronic equipment completely foiled this attack by Pakistan. Pakistan could not hit any of our targets, and none of our important assets were damaged. Our security arrangements were impregnable, and every attack was thwarted,"" he said.

""India has demonstrated not just its military strength, but also its national resolve, moral clarity, and political maturity. From now on, every act of terrorism will be met with a decisive and unambiguous response. We have drawn a new Lakshman Rekha (red line)...those who shelter and support terrorism will find no refuge. India will not bow to nuclear blackmail or any form of external pressure,"" Rajnath Singh tells Lok Sabha.

'Operation Sindoor a success', says Rajnath Singh

""To the Opposition, I say this, if you must question something, ask whether Operation Sindoor achieved its objective. The answer is yes. Ask whether our forces struck down the masterminds behind those who desecrated the dignity of our sisters and daughters...the answer is yes,"" Rajnath Singh tells the opposition in Lok Sabha.

""If you truly wish to question something, ask this...Did we suffer any loss of our brave soldiers in this operation? The answer is no. Not a single one of our soldiers was harmed,"" he said.

""When the goals are big, we must not get distracted by relatively smaller issues. Focusing too much on minor matters can divert attention from far more important concerns, like national security and the morale and honour of our soldiers. Unfortunately, that is exactly what seems to be happening with some of our colleagues in the opposition"".

Our forces achieved every objective: Rajanth Singh

""In any exam, what ultimately matters is the result. If a student scores well, it’s the marks that should count, not whether their pencil broke or they lost their pen during the test. Likewise, in the case of Operation Sindoor, what matters is the outcome. And the result is this: Our forces achieved every objective they set out to accomplish, fully and decisively,"" he said.

""Operation Sindoor was a symbol of India’s strength, a clear message that if anyone dares to harm our citizens, India will not stay silent. When it comes to self-defence, our political leadership will act decisively and without external pressure. Our missiles will cross physical borders, and our brave soldiers will break the enemy’s spine,"" says Rajnath in the Lower House.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday led the government’s charge in the Parliament debate on Operation Sindoor . The operation was a retaliatory strike targeting terrorists and terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (PoJK), after the April 22 massacre in Pahalgam's Baisaran meadow that left 22 civilians dead.In his point-by-point rebuttal to Opposition charges following the operation, the defence minister reiterated that the mission was paused without any external pressure, dismissing any such claims as absolutely baseless.""Under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership, India is no longer the country it once was. Today, dossiers have been replaced by decisive action. India no longer tolerates terror; it responds. And it now has the strength to strike at the very root of terrorism and uproot it completely,"" the defence minister said during the Operation Sindoor debate.","Defence minister rajnath singh tells lok sabha operation sindoor was a success.

NEW DELHI:

Pak squad behind Pahalgam killings, ISI-LeT plotted it

Over three months after Pakistani terrorists gunned down 26 civilians, including 25 tourists, at Pahalgam, the Army's para commandos have killed Suleiman, believed to be the lead killer of the gang, in Dachigam forest area on the outskirts of Srinagar. Two other terrorists were also killed in a joint operation involving the Army, CRPF and JK police, though there was no clarity yet on their involvement in the Pahalgam massacre.All the three terrorists killed on Monday in 'Operation Mahadev' were Pakistani nationals and linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba and its offshoot The Resistance Front, as per sources. A source indicated that the two terrorists killed with Suleiman could be Abu Hamza and Yasir, but officials would run more checks before confirming their identity.There was no official statement on Operation Mahadev. However, sources told TOI that Pahalgam has been avenged with the killing of Suleiman - a former Pakistani special forces commando who had trained at LeT Muridke hub in Pakistan's Punjab province before crossing the LoC in 2022 to enter Jammu region with his M-4 weapon - in the operation.A manhunt for the three-member Pahalgam attack squad that included Suleiman has been on since the day they rounded up tourists and killed them in front of their horror-struck families at Pahalgam.Sources said latest technical intelligence - based on tracking of activity on the encrypted Chinese app Ultra - had found three Pakistani terrorists hiding in Mahadev hill - from which Operation Mahadev got its name - in Dachigam. Suleiman had been on the move after the Pahalgam attack, traversing the forest dotting the Tral-Kulgam-Pahalgam tri-junction.Recoveries from the terrorists' hideout included an M4 carbine, two AK rifles and grenades.As per the standard procedure, the neutralised terrorists will be laid to rest in unmarked graves in a designated burial ground.As exclusively reported by TOI on July 15, the Pahalgam attack resulted from a closely guarded conspiracy hatched by Pakistan spy agency ISI and LeT on the directions of the country's political and military brass. It was executed by Pakistani terrorists.In what sources described as an LeT-ISI joint project akin to the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, ISI gave specific directives to Pakistan-based Lashkar commander Sajid Jutt to deploy only foreign terrorists for the targeted killings at Pahalgam. To ensure secrecy, no Kashmiri terrorists were included in the attack squad; local involvement for logistics too was 'minimal' and on a ""need-to-know"" basis. Satellite phone analysis revealed Suleiman's location in Tral forest on April 15, indicating he was in the vicinity of Baisaran for almost a week before the attack.Suleiman was also involved in the April 2023 attack on an Army truck in Poonch, in which five soldiers were killed. However, he laid low for two years after the incident.Even though the J&K Police had earlier suspected the role of Pakistani terrorists Hashim Musa and Ali Bhai in the Pahalgam massacre, the probe so far has only confirmed Suleiman's involvement. This Suleiman is different from Hashim Musa, whose nom de guerre is Sulaiman.""No local terrorist had participated in the Pahalgam attack, nor was in the loop on the terror plot,"" a senior official told TOI. Even the role of the two locals arrested by NIA was limited to providing the armed Pakistani terrorists food, shelter and other logistics, for a few thousand rupees.","Terrorist who led pahalgam attack killed in j&k gunfight.

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and former home minister P Chidambaram has raised several questions about the Union government’s handling of the Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent Operation Sindoor In an interview with news outlet The Quint, Chidambaram said the government has not provided enough information and accused it of being unwilling to share key details.""Where are the terrorist attackers? Why have you not apprehended them, or even identified them? A news item had emerged about the arrest of a few people who gave the attackers shelter. What happened to them?"" he asked, referring to the April 22 attack in Jammu and Kashmir ’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.Chidambaram also pointed out what he called the lack of a clear official information. ""We get snatches and bits of information from different officers. The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) goes to Singapore and makes a statement that give you bits of information. The deputy army chief makes a statement in Mumbai. In Indonesia, a junior officer of the Navy makes a statement. But why is the PM or the defence minister, or the foreign minister not making a comprehensive statement?"" he said.Asked what he believed the government was trying to hide, Chidambaram responded, ""I think, and this is speculation, I think they are hiding the fact that we made tactical mistakes (during Operation Sindoor), and we re-strategised...The CDS hinted at that. What tactical mistakes were made? What was the re-strategising? Either the BJP government is incompetent to answer these questions, or it is unwilling to do so. ""He also questioned the role of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the investigation. ""They are unwilling to disclose what the NIA has done all these weeks. Have they identified the terrorists, where they came from? For all we know, they could be homegrown terrorists. Why do you assume that they came from Pakistan? There's no evidence of that,"" he said.Chidambaram further added, ""They are also hiding the losses. I said it in a column that in a war, losses will occur on both sides. I understand that India would have suffered losses. Be upfront.""His comments come ahead of a scheduled debate in Parliament from Monday, where the ruling BJP and the Opposition are set to discuss the Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor.Meanwhile, the BJP hit back at Chidambaram’s remarks, accusing the Congress of defending Pakistan. BJP leader Amit Malviya said, “Once again, the Congress rushes to give a clean chit to Pakistan — this time after the Pahalgam terror attack.""He added, ""Why is it that every time our forces confront Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, Congress leaders sound more like Islamabad’s defence lawyers than India’s opposition?”","P chidambaram has raised several questions about the union government’s handling of the pahalgam terror attack and subsequent operation sindoor.

Among the restricted locations are Phu Chong-Na Yoi National Park, Prasat Ta Muen Thom, and Khao Phra Wihan National Park. Travellers were urged to contact local TAT offices for further updates and assistance.More than 100,000 people have already fled the bloodiest border fighting in over a decade, Thai authorities confirmed. The clashes, which erupted on Thursday, have involved tanks, jet fighters, and artillery, leaving at least 15 people dead 14 civilians and one Thai soldier and injuring 46, including 15 soldiers.Nearly 300 temporary shelters have been set up across four Thai border provinces to house the displaced.Cambodian authorities have not released their own casualty figures, but shelling has been reported in the town of Samraong, just 20 kilometres from the border. “We are scared because they began shooting again at about 6:00 am,” a local man told AFP, as his family fled to a nearby Buddhist temple.Despite calls for calm from Asean Chair and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, hostilities resumed early Friday.

Jaishankar’s Savage Declaration Of War At QUAD Meeting: ‘India Will Defend Its People’ | Watch

NEW DELHI: India is expected to participate in the UN high-level conference on peaceful settlement of the Palestine question and implementation of the 2-state solution, amid renewed international efforts to end the Gaza war. According to a list of delegates, 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday that will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, both key strategic partners for India.India had also voted in favour of a UNGA resolution last year that announced an international summit in June 2025 to discuss the 2-state solution. However, the conference couldn’t take place last month because of the Iran-Iraq conflict.The US had last month warned governments around the world against participating in the conference, saying it would mar ongoing efforts to end the war and free hostages, according to a diplomatic cable witnessed and reported by Reuters from Paris and Washington.According to France, the conference aims to chart a path towards the 2-state solution through “concrete measures” proposed by the 8 working groups, which have conducted extensive consultations with UN member-states and civil society.The conference is drawing attention also for the announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron this week that France will recognise the Palestinian state, becoming the first G7 country to do so. The US has condemned France’s decision and will skip the conference along with Israel.Indian ambassador to the UN, P Harish, had in a statement last week in the Security Council on the Palestinian question had taken note of the high-level conference. “While engaging in a forward-leaning and constructive manner, it is our hope that this Conference would pave the way for concrete steps towards achieving a two-State solution,” said the official, while strongly calling for a ceasefire to be put in place and seeking release of all hostages.India, which was among the 19 countries that abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution in June for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, has been in touch with the 8 working groups and is expected to further provide its inputs on the 2-state solution during the conference. The level of India’s participation is still under consideration.On the Gaza issue, India has continued to walk a tightrope between its vital and growing ties with Israel and the traditional support for the Palestinian cause, including the 2-state solution. While the government strongly defends Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas terrorist attacks, it also expects Israel to follow international law and not target civilians. “India shares historic and strong ties with our Palestinian brothers and sisters. We have always stood by them and our commitment towards the Palestinian cause is unwavering,” said Harish in his remarks in the Council.The ministry of external affairs also reiterated the Indian position in Parliament on Friday that India has always supported a negotiated 2-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognized borders, living side by side in peace with Israel.","India is set to participate in the un high-level conference addressing the palestine question and the two-state solution, co-chaired by france and saudi arabia.

Trump’s golf game with NFL legends turns controversial over fresh cheating allegations



The “Commander in Cheat” nickname resurfaces



FAQs:



1. Why is Donald Trump being accused of cheating at golf again?

2. What did Mike Tirico say about Trump cheating in golf?

3. Has Trump faced golf cheating allegations before?

A viral video has reignited controversy around U.S. President Donald Trump - this time, not for politics, but for golf. Over the weekend in Scotland, Trump was captured playing at his iconic Trump Turnberry course, but what caught social media's attention wasn’t his swing. It was a suspicious moment involving his caddie that stirred familiar accusations: is Trump once again bending the rules of the game?Trump’s time on the links has often made headlines, and not just for his signature red cap or presidential swagger. This weekend’s footage, which appears to show his caddie discreetly placing a ball on the fairway, has fueled fresh claims of dishonesty during play. While it’s possible the caddie was simply replacing a lost ball, online viewers aren’t buying it. The internet, it seems, never forgets.These recent visuals echo a now-famous incident recounted by NBC sportscaster Mike Tirico, who once played a round with Trump, Jon Gruden, and Ron Jaworski. Tirico recalled hitting a “blind shot into the green”—a 3-wood that he described as the “best 3-wood of his life.” The ball appeared destined for the pin. But what followed raised eyebrows.“Lousy break,” Trump said as Tirico searched for the ball, which mysteriously ended up in a greenside bunker some 50 yards from its likely landing spot.Tirico took two attempts to escape the trap and carded a 7.Only later did the truth emerge. Tirico shared, “Afterwards, Trump’s caddy came up to me and said, ‘You know that shot you hit on the par 5? It was about 10 feet from the hole. Trump threw it into the bunker. I watched him do it.’”What did Tirico do? True to the casual camaraderie of the day, he “laughed, shook his head, went inside, and paid Trump his money.” But it left a lasting impression.Trump’s love for golf is no secret—nor are the persistent allegations that he plays fast and loose with its rules. Veteran journalist Rick Reilly even coined the nickname “Commander in Cheat” to describe Trump’s history of questionable golf etiquette.With this weekend’s viral footage, the label once again feels relevant. Whether it’s competitive instinct, playful mischief, or something else entirely, Trump’s golfing antics continue to blur the lines between gamesmanship and gamesmanship gone too far. For critics, it's more fuel for the fire. For fans, perhaps just another chapter in a larger-than-life personality. Either way, the clip serves as a vivid reminder: when Trump hits the course, controversy isn't far behind.A viral video from Scotland appears to show Trump's caddie discreetly improving his lie during a round.Mike Tirico claimed Trump once threw his ball into a bunker during a round with NFL legends, calling it a “lousy break.”Yes, Trump has long been accused of bending the rules on the course, earning him the nickname “Commander in Cheat.”Also Read: Taylor Swift’s classy clapback to Matty Healy’s mom earns praise as she leans on Travis Kelce for support","A viral video from scotland appears to show trump's caddie discreetly improving his lie during a round.

It’s ideal for retirees, investors, or anyone who wants to live here while supporting themselves through other means.This visa usually comes with financial requirements. You may need to prove you have a certain level of income or savings to cover your living expenses.In some cases, owning property in the UAE can also support your application.The non-working visa is typically valid for one to five years, depending on the specific category and your eligibility. It offers flexibility and allows you to legally reside in the UAE without engaging in local employment. It’s also renewable if you continue to meet the conditions.Keep in mind, while the non-working visa lets you live in the UAE, it doesn’t grant work rights.

But the benefits include flexible stay requirements, the ability to open bank accounts, get a UAE driver’s license, and lease property.If you want to live in the UAE and work independently, the freelance visa is a popular option. You register as a freelancer through a free zone like Dubai Media City or Fujairah Creative City, and then get your residency visa as part of the process.
