India-Pakistan match row: Owaisi invokes Pahalgam to slam BJP; asks is money more valuable than lives of 26 citizens?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-pakistan-match-row-owaisi-invokes-pahalgam-to-slam-bjp-asks-is-money-more-valuable-than-lives-of-26-citizens/articleshow/123877564.cms,"Asaduddin Owaisi (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: AIMIM supremo and MP Asaduddin Owaisi launched a sharp attack on the BJP over India’s upcoming Asia Cup cricket clash with Pakistan, questioning why the government allowed the match despite the recent Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack . He demanded clarity on whether the monetary gains from the game outweighed the loss of human lives.""My question to the chief minister of Assam, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, and all of them is that you don't have the power to refuse to play a cricket match against Pakistan, which asked for the religion of our 26 citizens in Pahalgam and shot them..."" Owaisi said, speaking to the media.The AIMIM leader also asked whether the BJP considered the revenue from the match more valuable than the lives lost in the attack.""We ask the Prime Minister, when you said that blood and water cannot flow together, dialogue and terrorism cannot happen together, then how much money will the BCCI get from one cricket match, Rs 2000 crore, Rs 3000 crore? Is the value of money more than the lives of our 26 citizens? This is what the BJP should tell... We stood with those 26 citizens yesterday as well, we stand with them today, and we will stand with them tomorrow as well..."" he said.Owaisi, who was part of the delegation formed for Operation Sindoor ’s global outreach despite being a prominent opposition figure, said the government’s stand was inconsistent.The anger over India facing Pakistan in the tournament has been fuelled by the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 tourists were killed by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists. Calls have grown for boycotting the match against Pakistan.Earlier, Congress leader Abhishek Dutt had also criticised the decision to go ahead with the game, saying it contradicted the government’s stated policy of “no talks with terror.”""On one hand, you talk about Operation Sindoor, you say no talks with terror, no trade with terror. Our delegation went to foreign countries. What message are you trying to give by playing a match with Pakistan today?"" he asked.","Aimim supremo and mp asaduddin owaisi launched a sharp attack on the bjp over india’s upcoming asia cup cricket clash with pakistan.

Durga Prasad Subedi, the husband, was one of three men who commandeered a Royal Nepal Airlines de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft in 1973 that had Bollywood star Mala Sinha among the passengers.Speaking fondly of Karki (73), Prof Dipak Malik, a retired BHU professor and former director of Gandhian Institute of Studies, said: ""We have had a cordial relationship with her since her days in BHU... We are happy Nepal is going to get a neutral and honest person to lead the country.""""I do not forget to meet her whenever I go to Nepal,"" he added, having last visited her in Nov 2024. Prof Malik highlighted Karki's strong reputation for integrity, zero tolerance for corruption, and political neutrality, and landmark rulings against corrupt officials that earned her widespread respect.Prof Malik said Karki met her husband, a Nepali Congress youth leader who led the June 10, 1973 hijacking during the protests against the Panchayat regime of King Mahendra, while studying at BHU.The other two hijackers were Nagendra Dhungel and Basanta Bhattarai. The operation was orchestrated to fund rebellion against the monarchy. Among the conspirators were future Nepal PMs Girija Prasad Koirala and Sushil Koirala.According to reports, the three hijackers directed the pilot to land in Forbesganj, a border town in Bihar near Nepal's Biratnagar. The hijackers got off the plane there and fled into the jungle with a large amount of cash which, according to reports, belonged to a Nepalese bank and was being transported on the flight to Kathmandu.Subedi went into hiding in Varanasi after the incident and was ultimately arrested after Emergency was imposed in India in 1975. He remained in jail for two years before being handed over to Nepalese authorities.The other hijackers were also convicted and jailed but released after the Emergency was lifted in India.In a recent interview to CNN-News18, Karki called herself a ""friend of India"", attributing this bond to her time at BHU. ""My years at BHU left a lasting impression,"" she said, remembering her teachers and friends. Karki emphasised the long-standing relationship between India and Nepal, highlighting India's support and goodwill towards Nepal. Talking about the Indian leadership, she said she has ""a good impression of Modi-ji"".Born on June 7, 1952, in Biratnagar, Karki obtained a BA from Mahendra Morang Campus in 1972, followed by an MA from BHU. She obtained a law degree from Nepal's Tribhuvan University in 1978 and began her legal career in 1979, becoming a senior advocate in 2007 and a Supreme Court judge in 2010.

The Indian-built jets are expected to feature longer-range air-to-ground missiles than the Scalp used in Pakistan strikes.Dassault plans to establish a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility for Rafale’s M-88 engines in Hyderabad, complementing an existing maintenance firm in India.Indian partners such as Tata are likely to be involved in the production.The IAF sees the deal as crucial to bolstering its force structure alongside Su-30 MKIs, the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mark 1A, of which 180 have already been ordered, and the indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet planned for induction beyond 2035.","The deal is estimated to be worth over rs 2 lakh crore, with more than 60 percent indigenous content.

Ex-Tibetan PM in exile says Chinese embassies meddling in Nepal; warns India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-tibetan-pm-in-exile-says-chinese-embassies-meddling-in-nepal-warns-india/articleshow/123870939.cms,"China, India To Ink New Border Deal At SCO Summit? Envoy Drops Bombshell | Watch

NEW DELHI: Chinese Embassy officials of interfering directly in the local affairs of South Asian countries, particularly in Nepal, former Tibetan Prime Minister-in-exile Lobsang Sangay claimed, and also warned India to be vigilant about its dealings with Beijing.In an conversation at ANI podcast, Sangay voiced concern over China’s “expansionist” policies and its efforts to “checkmate” India’s influence in the region.Asked whether India, like some Southeast Asian nations, avoids the Tibet issue to preserve ties with Beijing, Sangay replied that he did not believe India followed that approach, but stressed that “China is systematically working” to curb New Delhi’s reach.""India has a bigger stake with China,"" Sangay said. ""Just look at not just Tibet, not just the border area. Look at all the neighbouring countries. In Southeast Asia or Central Asia, wherever India wants to have its influence or relationship, China is always there to checkmate.""Using Nepal as an example, he alleged that Chinese officials had become “the most powerful” players in Kathmandu, “perhaps more powerful than the Indian or American embassies.”He said similar patterns of interference were visible in Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. “They come and interfere and influence. I don’t want to say they control you, but they come inside your own house,” he said.""And the larger point that you raised about, you know, in Asia, how many people will take up the issue of Tibet because they don't want to have conflict with China, which is a fact on the one hand. On the other hand, what we say is that what happened to Tibet will happen to you. So if you don't understand and study Tibet, it will happen to you,"" he added.He pointed to Nepal as a clear example of Chinese political overreach. ""Let's say Nepal -- they didn't believe so, right? Now, yes, the Chinese embassy and the officials are interfering in local issues,"" he said. ""The Chinese Embassy, perhaps, some of my friends say, is the most powerful in Kathmandu -- more powerful than the Indian Embassy or American Embassy. Some say that.""He highlighted China's full physical control over Tibet and its current approach in other countries. ""The difference is the physical control of Tibet,"" Sangay said. ""Other than that, political influence of the Chinese government -- and through the embassies -- in all these neighbouring countries and all these Asian countries is a fact.""He also framed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visits to Tibet as strategic signals aimed at India, noting the region’s shared border and China’s large military deployment there. While transcripts of Xi’s latest speech to troops were not released—coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Beijing—Sangay said he was “sure” it echoed previous calls to “prepare for war or incursion” against India.Reflecting on his own experience, Sangay described how Tibetans had found a temporary home in India after fleeing their homeland. “As a Buddhist, we believe in impermanence. Once you lose your country, you’re nomadic,” he said, adding that India became “our home” after Tibetans fled. Although he now lives in the United States, he said he feels an enduring cultural bond with India: “As soon as I come out of Indira Gandhi Airport, when you smell the Delhi air… for your mind, it’s just calming. ”He stressed that ties between Tibetans and Indians remain strong. “Whenever I meet Indians, I immediately say Namaskar… immediately, you become friends.”Sangay also recalled how, during his tenure from 2011 to 2021, Chinese pressure often accompanied periods of India–China rapprochement. He cited the 2018 “Thank You India” event planned by the Tibetan administration, which was scaled back after India reportedly advised officials to avoid participation in the midst of efforts to ease tensions with Beijing.Despite such episodes, Sangay emphasised India’s consistent support. ""No matter which party or which person becomes Prime Minister, India has always treated Tibetans well. We cannot think of any better host for Tibetans,"" he said, adding that the preservation of Tibetan identity, education, and religious institutions has been possible due to India's support.","Former tibetan prime minister-in-exile lobsang sangay warns india to be vigilant about its dealings with beijing.

The announcement followed PM Narendra Modi’s bilateral meeting with his counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam in Varanasi.The 2 countries signed several other agreements aimed at helping Mauritius improve infrastructure and healthcare, augment maritime security and enhance defence preparedness, while allowing India to expand its footprint in the Indian Ocean. The projects announced under the package, along with budgetary assistance of $ 25 million, are together worth $ 680 million.The PM said both sides will work towards enabling trade in local currencies. Modi also said the projects, based on both grant and grant-cum-line of credit basis, are designed to support Mauritius’ needs and priorities, adding India will advance projects such as the Chagos Marine Protected Area, ATC Tower at the international airport and the expansion of highways and ring roads.“This package is not assistance. It is an investment in our shared future,” said Modi in his media remarks after the meeting, adding Mauritius was not a partner but family for India.The PM also announced signing of an agreement for cooperation in the field of hydrography, saying that, over the next 5 years, the 2 countries will work together on joint surveys, navigation charts, and hydrographic data of the Mauritius EEZ.Mauritius EEZ has expanded significantly after its recent treaty with the UK established its sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India was Mauritius’ preferred partner in the latter’s pursuit of protecting and securing its interests in the region. “It has many more responsibilities now. It needs maritime resources, and to be able to fully develop and exploit those resources, it will need assistance, and India is a preferred partner in providing that assistance,” said Misri.India had strongly backed the transfer of Chagos sovereignty to Mauritius through the treaty that also allowed the UK to retain control of the Diego Garcia island from where the UK and US operate a vital military base. In his remarks after the meeting, Ramgoolam appreciated India’s support.“We want to visit the Chagos Islands, including Diego Garcia, to plant our flag. The British offered us a vessel, but we said we preferred one from India because, symbolically, it would be more meaningful,"" said Ramgoolam.Modi also said in his statement that a free, open, secure, stable, and prosperous Indian Ocean is a shared priority. “In this context, India remains fully committed to strengthening the security of Mauritius’s EEZ and enhancing its maritime capacity,” said the PM, adding India has always stood as the first responder and a net security provider in the Indian Ocean region. The PM highlighted the refitting of the Mauritius Coast Guard ship that is being undertaken in India and also training of its officers here.The PM congratulated Ramgoolam for the Chagos Agreement, calling it a historic milestone for Mauritius’ sovereignty. “India has always supported decolonization, and the full recognition of Mauritius’ sovereignty. India has always stood firmly with Mauritius in this journey,” he said, adding that Mauritius was a key part of India’s Neighbourhood First policy and Vision MAHASAGAR.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over ""planned"" deadlocks in the House, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Saturday underscored the need for comprehensive dialogue among all political parties and elected representatives.The Speaker also urged the media to give prominence to viewpoints of elected representatives engaged in ""factual and substantive"" discussions, so that there can be ""healthy competition for constructive dialogue"" among members.Birla was speaking at the Valedictory Session of the 11th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) India Region Conference, hosted by Karnataka Legislature in Bengaluru. He said the aim of such conferences is to ensure legislatures can function without ""planned deadlocks"" in future.Mooting setting up of a National Legislative Index to rank state assemblies and councils on their performance, Birla told reporters on the sidelines of the event, ""We will take a view on National Legislative Index at the meeting of presiding officers at Lucknow in Jan next year.""He said performance of state assemblies could be assessed on the basis of parameters such as number of sittings held every year, productivity of the House, quality of debates, adoption of technology, and efficacy of various committees.The three-day conference concluded with the valedictory speech by Karnataka governor Thawarchand Gehlot. As president of CPA India Region, Birla stressed that rather than halting proceedings based on ideological or political differences, legislators must resolve to keep the House functioning.He described India's democracy and its Constitution as a ""guiding light"" for the world in the current global context. ""India's ancient democratic traditions continue to inspire and guide the legislative system in the country,"" he noted.Reaffirming Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment to building 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, he called on the presiding officers of all state legislatures to ensure the goal came to fruition through positive and people-centric discussions. He emphasised the need to increase duration of debates and number of sittings during legislative sessions.During the conference, four resolutions were adopted - to eliminate deadlocks and disruptions inside the Houses to increase public trust in democratic institutions, strengthen research and reference branches of state legislative institutions with collaboration of Parliament, ensure greater use of digital technologies in legislative institutions, and increase participation of youth and women in democratic institutions.","Lok sabha speaker om birla underscored the need for comprehensive dialogue among all political parties and elected representatives.

Anti-terror techs set to be Quad priority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anti-terror-techs-set-to-be-quad-priority/articleshow/123874937.cms,"NEW DELHI: Unfazed by uncertainty hanging over the proposed summit in November, Quad cooperation at ground level remains intact with the focus this month on counterterrorism workshops.These will include a technical exchange on misuse of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) drones by terrorists and a seminar on preventing terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technologies, including for terror-financing. India has taken note of US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor's remarks during his confirmation hearing that President Donald Trump remains committed to a meeting of Quad leaders and to strengthen the strategic grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the US that acts as a bulwark against threats to a free and open Indo-Pacific. Trump's efforts to mend ties with China, including through a landmark trade deal under discussion, have been seen as possible impediments in Quad's progress even though the foreign ministers have met twice since Trump returned to the White House.The technical exchange on misuse of drones will be conducted by the National Security Guard (NSG) on Sept 23-24 at the NSG Garrison in Manesar. ""The exercise will focus on identification of evolving UAS, framework for international cooperation by sharing best practices, subject matter expert exchange and refined national level policies for countering terrorist use of UAS or drones,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.It's important for India that counterterrorism remains a priority for Quad, as evident from its strong condemnation of the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack in the foreign ministers' meeting in Washington in July. While India would have liked a swifter response in the days that followed the attack but the fact that the condemnation eventually came in the strongest possible terms and called for the ""perpetrators, organizers, and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice without any delay"" was significant for India.The Quad seminar on terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technology will be hosted by the NIA on Sept 26. It will address, according to official sources, emerging threat from terrorists by exploitation of new emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, deepfake technologies, encrypted chat platform and metaverse. ""It aims to strengthen countermeasures against these threats, collaboration among Quad members through intelligence sharing, capacity building and engaging institutions and research organisations to develop safeguard against misuse by terrorists,"" the source said.Looking to boost India-Pacific security and prosperity, Quad will also formally launch its Ports of the Future Partnership next month with India hosting a transportation and logistics conference in Mumbai. According to a White House factsheet, the initiative will complement the work Quad partners have done to boost infrastructure expertise across the Indo-Pacific region through the Quad Infrastructure Fellowships Program. While basic Quad cooperation continues, bilateral defence collaboration with the US seems to have escaped unscathed from the downturn in India-US ties.","Unfazed by uncertainty hanging over the proposed summit in november, quad cooperation at ground level remains intact.

SRINAGAR: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah has expressed concern over the vanishing hangul, a critically endangered subspecies of Central Asian red deer, also known as the Kashmir stag, which is endemic to the Kashmir region. He fears they may go extinct.“I don’t want a situation tomorrow where our children and grandchildren know these species only through photographs in books, like the dodo or woolly mammoth,” the CM said at the 2nd International Conference on Hangul at Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture and Science here on Friday. “That would be a tragedy we must not allow,” he said.Omar said that despite living close to Dachigam National Park, he had never seen a hangul. “But at least in my lifetime I know they are there,” he said. The hangul is now largely confined to Dachigam National Park in Srinagar’s Harwan area. Their population had shrunk to just 127 in 2008. However, the hangul census of 2023 showed their population rising to 289. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified the species as critically endangered.The CM said his government would act promptly on the recommendations of the Second International Conference on Hangul protection.“My hope is that when we meet here next time, the population of hangul and markhor (a wild goat species) will have grown significantly,” Omar said.The three-day event at the Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture and Science was attended by more than 200 delegates, including eminent wildlife experts, conservationists, and biologists from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia, who shared research and strategies for conserving the hangul, markhor and other threatened ungulates of the Himalayan region.","J&k chief minister omar abdullah expresses concern over vanishing hangul.

NEW DELHI: Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh on Friday said that Operation Sindoor , the punitive strike targeting terror bases in Pakistan, served as a “reality check” for India’s armed forces, highlighting areas where the country can improve its defence capabilities.Speaking at the Southern Command Defence Tech Seminar (STRIDE 2025), Singh noted that the operation revealed certain capability gaps, including in electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems, low-level radars and the need for a stronger ecosystem to manufacture military-grade drones capable of operating in GPS-denied and contested environments.“It's pretty clear in the context of the geopolitical situation now that most countries are paying a lot of attention to defence and hard power again. Given our neighborhood, India is no exception, and we've just had this experience with Operation Sindoor, which was in some ways a reality check for us in terms of where we can do better, where we need to adapt to changing needs for future warfare,” Singh said.In the context of military operation, defence secretary said that it highlighted certain capability gaps in the armed forces.These gaps included areas such as electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems and the need for a stronger manufacturing ecosystem for military-grade drones that can operate effectively in GPS-denied and contested environments.He also pointed to the requirement for improvements in low-level radar systems. Singh added that these were areas where the armed forces recognized the need to strengthen and enhance capabilities.The defence secretary also emphasised India’s push for indigenous defence production, highlighting that 88 per cent of defence capital expenditure in 2024 was spent within the country.When asked about solutions to address these capability gaps, Singh said the armed forces were given flexibility through emergency procurement rules to quickly acquire equipment needed immediately.For the long term, the focus remains on developing indigenous equipment in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Singh added that while short-term purchases from global suppliers may be necessary, the ultimate goal is to achieve fully indigenous capabilities across all areas.He also reaffirmed that DRDO would continue to work on indigenous alternatives for critical systems, ensuring self-reliance in defence production.The defence secretary praised India’s multi-layered air defence system, which performed effectively during military operation. He said the system prevented major losses or casualties despite repeated attempts by drones and missiles to penetrate it.Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7 in response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. It was designed as a targeted campaign to dismantle terror infrastructure along and beyond the Line of Control , reflecting precision, professionalism and strategic purpose.","Rajesh kumar singh said that operation sindoor served as a “reality check’ for india’s armed forces.

“As a society, we must be reminded that human life is sacred and never disposable.

We must learn again to disagree with words, not weapons. That is exactly what Charlie Kirk modeled — he met opposition with dialogue, not violence, and proved that conviction and civility can walk hand in hand. Evil does not have the final word.

Is Kash Patel Hindu ?







FBI director Kash Patel was called cringe and a dork for his message for Charlie Kirk at the FBI press conference Friday where the agency revealed the name of Kirk's shooter and the details of how the FBI nabbed him after a failed attempt. ""To my friend Charlie Kirk. Rest now brother. We have the watch and I'll see you in Valhalla,"" Kash Patel said.Valhalla belongs to the Old Norse religion (also called Norse paganism), which was practiced by the Vikings and other Germanic peoples of Scandinavia before Christianity spread there.

In Norse mythology, it is believed that warriors who die bravely in battle are chosen by Odin and enter Valhalla.Kash Patel came under fire in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's death, as the FBI got the wrong person initially, whom they let out after they realized he was not the shooter.

NFL’s lack of consistency compared to past public statements drew more criticism



The Green Bay Packers and the NFL held a moment of silence for conservative activist Charlie Kirk before Thursday Night Football against the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field. Kirk, 31, was shot and killed Wednesday during a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.The tribute took place about 25 minutes before kickoff. The in-stadium announcement said, “The National Football League asks that you please join us in a moment of silent reflection following the murder of Charlie Kirk. The NFL condemns all violence in our communities. It will take all of us to stop hate. Thank you.”Former President Donald Trump confirmed Kirk’s death on Wednesday and later said he would posthumously award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The FBI released a photo of a person of interest Thursday, but no arrests have been made.Fox News senior NFL writer Armando Salguero shared video of the silence. The MLFootball account also circulated the clip, describing the moment as a league-wide honor. Critics, however, said the execution fell flat.One frustrated fan in attendance wrote, “They did it when the stadium wasn’t even half full half an hour ago, and it went right to. It was terrible.” Another attendee added, “It was ridiculous; they didn’t even display it on the jumbotron.”On social media, the pushback was even stronger. One user posted, “We doing for just anyone now? There was a school shooting yesterday (AND today) AND a shooting at a US naval academy but I guess that’s not important.” Another wrote, “That wasn’t even a moment. Couldn’t even count one second of silence.”The NFL’s silence in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s assassination frustrated many. The league has issued statements in the past on events such as the killing of George Floyd and support for LGBTQ rights. The absence of a message for Kirk led some to accuse the NFL of picking and choosing when to speak up.Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker posted Kirk’s final text message, calling him a “strong witness for Christ.” Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson also paid tribute, as did New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who wrote, “Praying for him and his family. Charlie did great things for our country!! Political Violence NEEDS TO STOP!! Pray for our country man. This is disgusting and Sad!!”ESPN analyst Pat McAfee called the shooting “startling, saddening, and maddening.” Former NFL players Tim Tebow and Julian Edelman also acknowledged Kirk’s death.Former NFL punter Chris Kluwe, on the other hand, stirred controversy on BlueSky this week after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Kluwe, who earlier this year lost his job as a high school football coach for calling the MAGA movement “Nazi,” posted a profanity-laced message backing Sen. Elizabeth Warren for rejecting claims that Democratic rhetoric had fueled the attack. In his post, Kluwe argued that Republicans are responsible for the hostile climate, writing that they “could stop it at any time” and shouldn’t be treated like “children. ”Outside football, the New York Yankees held a moment of silence before their Wednesday game against the Detroit Tigers.
