India has in the past repeatedly raised with the UK the need to prevent banned groups like Sikhs for Justice from carrying out anti-India activities.The minister, who is on a six-day visit to the UK and Ireland, also discussed progress in India-UK FTA talks in another meeting he had with Secretary of State for Business and Trade Jonathan Reynolds.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged the Indian industry to tap into emerging opportunities in the global supply chain amid disruptions and assured that govt fully backed these moves.""In the last few years, we have seen that when the supply chain gets disturbed, it has its impact on the economy of the entire world. Today, the world needs such a reliable partner from where high-quality products come and the supply is reliable. Our country is capable of doing this. All of you are capable. This is a big chance for us, a huge opportunity. I want that our industry should not look at these expectations of the world as a spectator, we cannot remain as spectators. You have to find your role in this, you have to go ahead and carve out opportunities for yourself,"" he said during a post-budget webinar.India is a growth engine for the global economy, and despite disruptions, India had proven its resilience in several difficult situations, Modi said while referring to the Covid period.""We should open new avenues for manufacturing and export for the country. Today every country in the world wants to strengthen its economic partnership with India . Our manufacturing sectors should come forward to take maximum advantage of this partnership,"" he said.Modi also underlined the importance of states in attracting investments and stepping it up, and once again called for the need for urgent reforms. ""The more the states promote ease of doing business, the greater number of investors will come to them. Your state will benefit the most from this. There should be competition among states as to who can take maximum advantage of this budget. Companies will come to invest in those states which come forward with progressive policies,"" he said. He also said the union budget had taken steps to further ease life for businesses.While listing out the steps taken by govt since 2020 to strengthen MSMEs, the PM said the fresh increase in investment limit will help create more jobs by enabling small businesses to grow.

Hard to believe woman had sex for 16 years under false marriage vow: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hard-to-believe-woman-had-sex-for-16-years-under-false-marriage-vow-supreme-court/articleshow/118718400.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: A woman who is in a live-in relationship for a long period may not be able to accuse her live-in partner of compelling her to get into physical relation on false promise of marriage in order to face rape charges as SC said in such a situation it cannot be said with certaintity that physical relation was purely because of the promise.While quashing criminal proceedings against a bank official who was accused of rape charges by his live-in partner, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta refused to accept the plea of the woman, a lecturer, who alleged that she continued to have sexual relations with him for 16 years on the basis of his marriage promise. The court said both the partners were well educated and it was a consensual relationship as both of them used to visit each other residences even when they were posted in different towns. It is a clear case of a love affair/live-in relationship gone sour, it said.""It is hard to believe that the complainant kept on bending to the demands of the appellant for a period of nearly 16 years without raising any protest to any quarter that the appellant was exploiting her sexually under the pretext of a false promise of marriage. The prolonged period of 16 years during which the sexual relations continued unabatedly between the parties, is sufficient to conclude that there was never an element of force or deceit in the relationship,"" the bench said.Court said in such cases even if it is assumed that a false promise was made, the fact that the relation continued for such a long period would render the plea of the complainant, that her consent for all these years was under misconception of the fact that the accused would marry her, implausible.","Supreme court quashes criminal proceedings against a bank official who was accused of rape charges by his live-in partner.

AHMEDABAD: AC Patel from Gujarat had become Mohammad Najir Hussain of Pakistan - but only for a moment. And in that moment, he had belonged nowhere at all.Patel's passport bore Hussain's name and nationality, but American authorities saw through the deception. The man who claimed to be Hussain was unmasked. Patel arrived at Delhi airport on February 12 via flight AA-292 after US authorities sent him back to India.American agencies have intensified their crackdown on undocumented Indians following Donald Trump's new term since January, targeting immigrants living illegally in US and deporting them home. In the past month alone, three flights packed with Indian deportees - including 74 Gujaratis - have landed in India after being expelled by US authorities.Patel's real troubles had only just begun. Delhi police arrested him on arrival. He faces multiple serious charges, including cheating by impersonation, and misuse of passport. What stunned Indian immigration officials was the Pakistani passport. Not just any forged document, but an actual lost passport that belonged to Hussain.Cornered, Patel confessed. He had paid an agent in Dubai to forge his identity, swapping his Gujarat roots for a Pakistani character, just to secure a spot on a flight to US.Patel's real passport had expired in 2016 and instead of renewing it, he relied on human traffickers who provided him with fraudulent documents and facilitated his illegal journey via Dubai.""Human smugglers pick passports that are strong for getting a US visa or randomly assign some UAE citizen's passport to sneak into US,"" a source said.","Us has intensified crackdown on illegal immigrants following trump’s new term.

DEHRADUN: There was no time to run. One moment, the workers were asleep inside their container homes, the bitter cold pressing in from all sides, the hum of the mountains steady and unbroken. Then came a roar - deep, monstrous, growing louder by the second. The earth beneath them shuddered. The walls groaned. And before anyone could move, the avalanche was there, like a sudden apparition in a horror movie.Ganesh Kumar, a road construction worker from Pithoragarh, barely had time to open his eyes before the container was ripped from its place it was pegged and sent tumbling into the snow. ""It happened so fast, we had no time to think,"" he said from his hospital bed in Jyotirmath. ""One moment, we were asleep. The next, the entire container was flung ahead, rolling over and over. It must have been 50, maybe 60 metres. We had no control. We were just... thrown... like puppets.""Then came the deafening silence. The world outside was gone, above a thick pile of snow. Inside the crumpled container, the men lay tangled, gasping for breath, bodies stiff with cold. ""Darkness, silence, and the unbearable cold wrapped around us like a shroud,"" one of them recalled. ""The snow was everywhere - pushing against us, pressing into our chests. We tried shouting, but the sound just died around us. It felt like the snow was swallowing our voices.""The hours crawled by, stretching endlessly. The cold bit deep, turning their limbs numb. Some of them tried clawing at the walls, but there was no way out. The air felt thinner. Some stopped talking. ""It felt like we were already gone,"" one survivor said.Then, a noise - faint at first. Footsteps. Voices, muffled through the snow. Hope surged through their bodies like a shock. ""At first, I thought I was imagining it,"" another worker said. ""Then the sound got closer, and suddenly, the snow started shifting."" Hands broke through the ice, pulling them from the wreckage, dragging them into the open air. ""They were our saviours - farishtey (angels),"" another survivor said, his voice still trembling at the memory of the Army and ITBP personnel cutting through the snow to reach them. Manoj Bhandari from Uttarkashi district said, ""Even now, the memories haunt us - how close we came to being buried forever. Some of our friends didn't make it. That pain... it's not going anywhere.""","The workers were asleep inside their container homes when the avalanche struck. The men lay tangled, gasping for breath, bodies stiff with cold.

Top Bank Fixed Deposits: Bank Fixed Deposits (FDs) continue to be a favoured investment option for risk-averse investors looking for consistent returns. The present elevated interest rates offer a favourable investment window, particularly with RBI’s recent repo rate cut set to trigger revision in interest rates. Investors need to thoroughly evaluate interest rates and conditions across various banks to select the most suitable FD.RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra in his maidan Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) review announced a 25 basis points rate cut. Experts are of the view that another repo rate cut is likely in the April 2025 review.The expected changes in interest rates might result in lower FD rates in future periods. While earlier FD investments gained from rising rates, subsequent investments could generate reduced returns as interest rates decline.Also Read | Latest EPFO interest rate: How much are you likely to earn on employees' provident fund deposit in 2024-25?

President Donald Trump will deliver a major speech before a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025, marking his first major address since returning to office. The speech, though not officially a State of the Union address, will outline his administration’s early achievements and legislative goals.The address will take place in the House chamber at the US Capitol and will be broadcast live across major networks like CNN, PBS, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. It will also be streamed on YouTube, Hulu, and The Associated Press’s official channel.Vice President JD Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson will be seated behind Trump. However, attention is on Elon Musk , who serves as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and a senior advisor to Trump. Musk’s role in the administration has been under scrutiny, and his presence—or absence—at the speech will be closely watched.Trump’s address comes after a tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where talks over a minerals agreement collapsed. Trump and Vance reportedly issued a firm warning to Zelensky: ""You either make a deal, or we are out.""With US support for Ukraine a divisive issue, Trump’s stance will be a key highlight of the speech. His address is expected to shape both domestic and global discussions on America’s role in international conflicts.","Donald trump will deliver a major speech before a joint session of congress on march 4, 2025.

Why Donald Trump wore a purple tie during his address to US congress?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-donald-trump-wore-a-purple-tie-during-his-address-to-us-congress/articleshow/118721886.cms,"LIVE: Donald Trump delivers speech to Congress

Donald Trump’s during his first joint address of the Congress sported a dark purple patterned tie and not his usual bold red tie. In politics, purple is often seen as a blend of Republican red and Democratic blue, symbolising bipartisanship and unity, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.The speech itself began with a characteristic show of confidence. “America is back,” Trump declared. He framed his presidency as an era of swift and decisive action, portraying his policies as the key to restoring American strength.Melania Trump watched from the gallery, joined by other congressmen. Trump's key ally Elon Musk was also present, wearing a blue tie.The guests also included the widow of a fallen NYPD officer, a victim of explicit deepfake images, and a teacher recently freed from detention in Russia. Democrats, in contrast, invited federal workers affected by Trump’s budget cuts and government watchdogs dismissed under his administration.The address also saw protests across the country, with demonstrators gathering in all 50 states to oppose Trump’s policies. While their grievances ranged from economic concerns to his handling of foreign affairs, the widespread opposition underscored the deeply polarising nature of his presidency.The address comes at a pivotal moment, with Trump navigating economic turmoil, foreign policy tensions, and a deeply divided Congress. Inflation remains a major concern for voters, with consumer confidence sinking and market gains since his re-election now erased. His response has been to double down on aggressive trade policies, including new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. These measures have sparked fears of a trade war, adding further uncertainty to an already volatile economy.Despite the controversies, Trump’s grip on the Republican Party remains firm. His speech was met with enthusiasm from GOP lawmakers, with House Speaker Mike Johnson declaring, “We will not be ripping up the speech tonight. I would like to frame it in gilded gold.”Foreign policy was another major focus. Trump recently froze military aid to Ukraine, pressuring President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into negotiations with Russia. This move has drawn sharp criticism, with many Democrats and some Republicans condemning what they see as an abandonment of a key ally. Lawmakers showed their opposition by wearing blue and yellow in solidarity with Ukraine.","Donald trump sported a dark purple patterned tie during his speech.

Recent designated survivors



Here are the designated survivors from recent years:



2024: Education Secretary Miguel Cardona

2023: Labor Secretary Marty Walsh

2022: Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo

2021: No designated survivor due to limited attendance amid COVID-19

2020: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt

2019: Energy Secretary Rick Perry

Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins has been selected as the designated survivor for President Donald Trump's 2025 joint address to Congress , White House sources confirmed shortly before the speech on Tuesday night.The tradition of appointing a designated survivor ensures continuity of government in the event of a catastrophic incident during the address, which is attended by the president, vice president, and the full line of succession. Collins, a former representative from Georgia, was confirmed as VA Secretary on February 4 and is 17th in the presidential line of succession .A designated survivor is a cabinet member chosen to remain at a secure, undisclosed location during the address. This precaution ensures that a government leader remains available to take charge if an emergency incapacitates those in attendance.While the US Constitution establishes the line of succession, the modern order was set by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Vice President JD Vance is first in line, followed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Grassley, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The list continues through other cabinet members, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem being 18th.Since nearly all these officials attend the joint session, a designated survivor is selected to stay away.The practice of appointing a designated survivor is believed to have started during the Cold War in the 1950s, though it was first officially recorded in 1981 when Education Secretary Terrel Bell was given the role.The selection process remains classified, but the individual must meet presidential eligibility criteria: being a natural-born US citizen and at least 35 years old. Some past cabinet members, such as former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger, were ineligible due to being born outside the USFormer Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, designated in 1996 under President Bill Clinton, recalled her experience, saying, “I was shown the Situation Room and the White House staff talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor.”Past designated survivors have shared their experiences, revealing they are accompanied by security personnel, including a military officer carrying the ""nuclear football.""Former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was chosen in 2000, described his experience, saying, “It’s fun. You’re sitting there, you’re being watched. You got security. And there are a few thrills.”Former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who was designated in the 1990s, recalled in a 2017 Politico essay that he was taken to a secure location outside Washington. He wrote, “I don’t recall getting any specific instructions on what to do if the doomsday scenario happened… All I knew is that if necessary, I could turn to that military officer accompanying me, holding that 45-pound bag, and trigger a military response, including a nuclear strike.”Shalala, who remained in Washington during her time as designated survivor, recalled waiting at the White House and ordering pizza for her staff. “I saw the president when he left and when he came back,” she said. “He said, ‘Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.’”Typically, cabinet members from various departments have been selected for the role, though Secretaries of State, Defense, and Treasury have never been chosen.With Collins now assuming the role for 2025, the longstanding tradition continues as the Trump administration ensures the government's continuity during this high-profile address.",The tradition of appointing a designated survivor ensures continuity of government in the event of a catastrophic incident during the address.

'English in taste'

'Language of learning'

""Dram"", meaning a measure of whisky. ""Turm"", describing a cavalry unit. ""Taupie"", a foolish youngster.Not words in a typical teen's vocabulary, but all come easily to Pakistani prodigy Bilal Asher , world under-14 Scrabble champion.Despite a musty reputation, the word-spelling game has a cult youth following in Pakistan, a legacy of the English languageimposed by Britain's empire but which the country has adapted into its own dialect since independence.In the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble, Pakistan's youngsters reign supreme -- boasting the current youth world champion and more past victors than any other nation since the tournament debuted in 2006.""It requires a lot of hard work and determination,"" said 13-year-old Asher after vanquishing a grey-bearded opponent.""You have to trust the process for a very long time, and then gradually it will show the results.""Karachi, a megacity shrugging off its old definition as a den of violent crime, is Pakistan's incubator for talent in Scrabble -- where players spell words linked like a crossword with random lettered tiles.Schools in the southern port metropolis organise tutorials with professional Scrabble coaches and grant scholarships to top players, while parents push their kids to become virtuosos.""They inculcate you in this game,"" said Asher, one of around 100 players thronging a hotel function room for a Pakistan Scrabble Association (PSA) event as most of the city dozed through a Sunday morning.Daunters (meaning intimidating people), imarets (inns for pilgrims) and trienes (chemical compounds containing three double bonds) are spelled out by ranks of seated opponents.Some are so young their feet don't touch the ground, as they use chess clocks to time their turns.""They're so interested because the parents are interested,"" said 16-year-old Affan Salman, who became the world youth Scrabble champion in Sri Lanka last year.""They want their children to do productive things -- Scrabble is a productive game.""English was foisted onthe Indian subcontinent by Britain's colonialism and an 1835 order from London started to systematise it as the main language of education.The plan's architect, Thomas Macaulay, said the aim was to produce ""a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.""It was instrumental in creating a colonial civil service to rule for Britain according to Kaleem Raza Khan, who teaches English at Karachi's Salim Habib University.""They started teaching English because they wanted to create a class of people, Indian people, who would be in the middle of the people and the rulers,"" said Khan, whose wife and daughter are Scrabble devotees.British rule ended in the bloody partition of 1947 creating India and Pakistan.Today there are upwards of 70 languages spoken in Pakistan, but English remains an official state language alongside the lingua franca Urdu, and they mingle in daily usage.Schools often still teach English with verbose colonial-era textbooks.""The adaptation of English as the main language is definitely a relation to the colonial era,"" said PSA youth programme director Tariq Pervez. ""That is our main link.""The English of Pakistani officialdom remains steeped in anachronistic words.The prime minister describes militant attacks as ""dastardly"", state media dubs protesters ""miscreants"" and the military denounces its ""nefarious"" adversaries.Becoming fluent in the loquacious lingo of Pakistani English remains aspirational because of its association to the upper echelons of society.In Pakistan more than a third of children between the ages of five and 16 are out of school -- a total of nearly 26 million, according to the 2023 census.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared an ""education emergency"" last year to address the stark figures.""People are interested in Scrabble because they can get opportunities for scholarships in universities or for jobs because it provides the vocab,"" said Asher's sister Manaal.But the 14-year-old reigning female number one in Pakistan warned: ""You've got to be resilient otherwise Scrabble isn't right for you.""In the Karachi hotel, Scrabble -- invented in the 1930s during America's Great Depression by an unemployed architect -- is an informal training programme for success in later life.""The main language of learning is English,"" said Pervez.""This game has a great pull,"" he added. ""The demand is so big. So many kids want to play, we don't have enough resources to accommodate all of them.""At the youngest level the vocabulary of the players is more rudimentary: toy, tiger, jar, oink.But professional Scrabble coach Waseem Khatri earns 250,000 rupees ($880) a month -- nearly seven times the minimum wage -- coaching some 6,000 students across Karachi's school system to up their game.In Pakistani English parlance ""they try to express things in a more beautiful way -- in a long way to express their feelings,"" said 36-year-old Khatri.""We try to utilise those words also in Scrabble.""But when Asher wins he is overwhelmed with joy, and those long words don't come so easily.""I cannot describe the feeling,"" he said.",Pakistani prodigy bilal asher is world under-14 scrabble champion.

Israeli army tightens social media rules after probe finds Hamas used posts for Oct 7 attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-army-tightens-social-media-rules-bans-base-photography-after-probe-finds-hamas-used-soldiers-posts-for-oct-7-attack/articleshow/118720849.cms,"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is imposing stricter restrictions on soldiers’ social media activity after an internal investigation revealed that Hamas used online posts to gather intelligence on the Nahal Oz base before its deadly October 7 attack.During the assault, 53 soldiers were killed, and 10 others were taken captive. The probe found that photos shared by soldiers on their first and last days at the base enabled Hamas to map out key locations, including surveillance cameras, generators, safe rooms, and patrol movements. Captured Palestinian fighters later admitted they had built training models of Nahal Oz using this information.To prevent similar intelligence leaks, the IDF is now banning photography inside military facilities, enforcing strict penalties for violations, and extending security classifications to a broader range of roles. Soldiers and officers will also be prohibited from using social media platforms like Facebook while serving in sensitive positions. Additionally, public filming of civilian-attended military ceremonies and events will be restricted.The investigation also found that Nahal Oz soldiers received no warning before the attack. Security protocols did not account for rocket fire or the protection of unarmed personnel, and ground assault drills had not been conducted for years.Further army probes revealed that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad deployed around 5,000 fighters in coordinated attacks on Israeli communities and military positions along the Gaza border. Intelligence about the looming assault was misinterpreted, and the army was more focused on threats from Iran and Hezbollah. The reports, made public on Thursday, addressed operational failures but did not examine political decisions.Growing calls for an independent inquiry into the October 7 failures have intensified. Such a commission, typically led by a senior Supreme Court justice, would have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has opposed the move, saying on Monday he would not support a ""politically biased"" investigation. His remarks sparked clashes between bereaved families and Knesset security personnel.On October 7, Hamas attacks near the Gaza border resulted in at least 1,180 deaths and the abduction of 252 Israelis and foreign nationals. Of the 59 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to have died in captivity.","Hamas used online posts to gather intelligence on the nahal oz base before its deadly october 7 attack.
