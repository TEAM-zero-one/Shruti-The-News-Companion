A 24-year-old Indian woman has gone missing just days after she arrived in the United States for an arranged marriage, authorities in New Jersey said this week.The woman, identified as Simran, landed in the US on June 20. She reportedly arrived in the country for an arranged marriage. However, investigators say there’s a possibility she never intended to follow through with the marriage and may have used the opportunity as a way to travel to the US.Surveillance footage obtained by Lindenwold Police shows her standing alone, looking at her phone and appearing to wait for someone. Officials noted that she did not seem distressed in the video, New York Post reported.Simran was last seen wearing gray sweatpants, a white T-shirt, black flip flops, and small diamond-studded earrings. She stands about 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighs approximately 150 pounds, and has a small scar on the left side of her forehead.Simran has no known relatives in the United States and does not speak English. Her phone is an international device that only functions via Wi-Fi, further complicating efforts to contact her.Police said they have also been unable to get in touch with her family in India.Authorities are urging anyone with information about Simran’s whereabouts to contact Lindenwold Police Detective Joe Tomasetti.","The woman, identified as simran, landed in the us on june 20.

Jaisalmer: Jaisalmer superintendent of police Sudhir Choudhary Sunday said that Pakistani couple, Ravi Kumar (17) and Shanti Bai (15), who had crossed international border near Jaisalmer recently, suspected to have died of thirst and dehydration. Their bodies were found Saturday.A photograph of the scene revealed an empty jerry can positioned on the youth's face, illustrating the suffering they endured before their deaths.Kumar and Bai entered into an arranged marriage four months ago in Mirpur Mathelo, Ghotki district, Sindh province, Pakistan. They aspired to build a safe and prosperous life in India and had applied for visas.However, due to strained relations between India and Pakistan, their visa applications were rejected. Determined to reach India, they chose to cross the border illegally. Despite warnings from Kumar's father and a disagreement between them a week earlier, he proceeded with his plan. After crossing the border a week ago, they became disoriented in the Bhibhiyan desert and ultimately succumbed to dehydration. Their bodies were found with an empty jerry can, which they had used to carry water from Pakistan.

Iran's leading Shiite religious authority issued a ""fatwa"" against US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi's fatwa, a religious decree, like one issued against prize-winning author Salman Rushdie, calls on Muslims to bring down the American and Israeli leaders for threatening the Islamic Republic leadership, as reported by the New York Sun.The decree states that any person or administration threatening the unity and leadership of the global Islamic community (the Ummah) should be classified as a ""warlord"" or ""mohareb"" - one who wages war against God. Iranian legislation permits execution, crucifixion, amputation of limbs, or banishment for those deemed mohareb.""Those who threaten the leadership and integrity of the Islamic Ummah are to be considered warlords,"" Makarem declared in the ruling. He concluded with a prayer seeking protection from these ""enemies"" and requesting the prompt arrival of the Mahdi, a prophesied figure in Shiite Islam.This religious decree followed the ""12-Day War,"" during which American and Israeli operations reportedly caused substantial damage to Iran's nuclear infrastructure.On June 13, Israeli air attacks struck Iranian nuclear and military installations, reportedly causing casualties among senior scientists and commanders.Iran responded by firing ballistic missiles at Israeli urban centres.

Immediately after taking off from Delhi in the early hours of June 14, a Vienna-bound Boeing 777 got stall warning. It also got ground proximity warning system’s (GPWS) don’t sink caution, asking pilots not to lose altitude as the aircraft operating as AI 187 had witnessed altitude loss of about 900 feet during climb.Luckily, pilots recovered the aircraft from this precarious situation and safely proceeded to the destination. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing the incident; have already summoned AI’s head of safety for this case and both the pilots have been taken off flying duty pending the investigation.According to flight tracking sites, the B777 (VT-ALJ) took off at 2.56 am on June 14 in bad weather. Delhi was witnessing a thunderstorm that time. “The aircraft was involved in an inflight occurrence of stick shaker and GPWS caution. Soon after takeoff, stick shaker warning and GPWS don’t sink caution appeared. Stall warning came once and GPWS caution came twice. There was an altitude loss of around 900 feet during climb.Subsequently, the crew recovered the aircraft and continued the flight to Vienna,” said officials aware of the incident.Stick shaker refers to the control column on the flight deck shaking and making a noise to indicate something is not right and that the pilots’ attention to the situation is urgently required. In this case the pilots did that and saved the day. The flight landed safely in Vienna after 9 hours and 8 minutes. After this technical halt in Europe necessitated by longer routes taken these days due to enroute airspace closures, the aircraft then proceeded to Toronto with another set of crew members.However, the flight report for Delhi-Vienna sector only had the “stick shaker due turbulence after takeoff mentioned and not the other occurrences in detail,” said officials. When authorities examined the B777’s flight data recorder (DFDR), possibly as part of the enhanced surveillance ordered by the DGCA after AI 171 crash, the other occurrences of GPWS don’t sink caution and stall warning appearing came to light, they say.An AI spokesperson said: “Upon receipt of the pilot's report, the matter was disclosed to DGCA in accordance with regulations. Subsequently, upon receipt of data from the aircraft's recorders, further investigation was initiated. The pilots have been off-rostered pending the outcome of the investigation.”Both the pilots have been off rostered (taken off flying duty) pending investigation. The regulator has taken a very stern view on the June 14 incident. It is learnt AI head of safety was summoned on this issue.Following AI 171 crash, the DGCA had on June 17 raised “concern regarding recent maintenance-related issues” reported by Air India and directed the airline to strictly focus on safety while “strengthen(ing) internal coordination across engineering, operations, ground handling units.”Multiple industry insiders said: “Old Air India (PSU time) did not have comfortable planes running on time but safety was never an issue. Now planes, at least the narrow body fleet, are better but passengers are apprehensive about safety after the terrible AI 171 crash. The new management and the new owner need to win back passenger and employee trust at the earliest by doing all it takes.""",A vienna-bound boeing 777 got stall warning.

"Deal deadline 8 days away, US talks stay deadlocked",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deal-deadline-8-days-away-us-talks-stay-deadlocked/articleshow/122168388.cms,"Even at 10% base tariff, Indian businesses will be better off than their competitors: Officials

NEW DELHI: With eight days to go for US to restart reciprocal tariffs, there appears to be a stalemate in India-US trade talks, with New Delhi hardening its position on offering duty concessions on agricultural products.Although the Indian team led by chief negotiator Rajesh Agarwal has stayed back in Washington for talks with American officials, the absence of a deal by July 8 will expose exporters to 26% reciprocal tariff. US president Donald Trump has indicated that an extension of the suspension is unlikely.The Americans are very keen to get India to lower duties on maize, soybean, dairy products, apples, and other fruits and nuts - a tough ask for the Narendra Modi govt, given the dependence of a large number of small farmers on these products, and the likely political noise over the concessions. The govt has refused to open the agriculture and dairy sector as part of free trade agreements with Australia and the UK and has conveyed its reluctance to the European Union too.But the US has asserted that any deal without lower duties on agricultural products was not acceptable, even if the opening up was for limited quantities, known as quotas in trade parlance.Indian negotiators are also worried that in return for concessions on automobiles and whiskey, they are not receiving sufficient benefits for products such as garments, home textiles, leather and footwear, engineering goods, and auto components.In fact, there are fears that some of the auto parts and iron and aluminium items may continue to attract sectoral tariffs, which face additional sectoral tariffs of 25% or 50%, depending on the item.Despite the divergent positions, both sides are working on a mini-deal in the run-up to the first tranche of the bilateral trade agreement by Fall (Sept-Oct), the deadline set by Modi and Trump when they met earlier this year.During a meeting with exporters on Monday, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal did not completely rule out the possibility of a deal over the next few days, suggesting that sectors that may get left out in the first round should not lose hope as more items will be added later.While the Americans have virtually ruled out lowering tariffs to zero, at least immediately, officials have told exporters that even at 10%, which is the base tariff imposed by Trump, in case of a deal, Indian businesses will be better off than their competitors who will face reciprocal tariffs.Privately, several industry representatives have met the commerce department brass and suggested that India should agree to the demands from the Trump administration, but govt is keen to ensure that it is not a one-sided deal.For Trump too, showing success through agreements with countries such as the UK, China and India is critical to get the others to the negotiating table. Last Thursday, after the pact with China, the American president had announced that a ""very big deal"" with India was expected.","There appears to be a stalemate in india-us trade talks, with new delhi hardening its position on offering duty concessions on agricultural products.

Here's Why

Poll Do you support India's initiative to launch 52 dedicated satellites for armed forces? Yes No

NEW DELHI: With the need for ‘deep’ as well as ‘persistent’ surveillance of enemy territory being reinforced by Operation Sindoor , India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive military space doctrine.Phase 3 of Space-Based Surveillance (SBS) programme, which was approved by the PM-led cabinet committee on security in Oct last year at a cost of Rs 26,968 crore, involves the construction and launch of 21 satellites by Isro and 31 by three private companies.The first of these satellites is to be launched by April next year, with all 52 to be deployed before 2029-end, as part of the project being spearheaded by Defence Space Agency (DSA) under the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) of defence ministry.“Work is underway to compress these timelines to launch the satellites faster into the low earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbit. The three private companies that have got the contracts have been told to speed up building of the satellites,” a source told TOI.“The aim of SBS-3 is to cover much larger areas of China and Pakistan, as well as the Indian Ocean Region, with shorter revisit times (interval between two consecutive surveillance sweeps of the same location) and much better resolution.The space doctrine is also being fine-tuned,” he added.Parallelly, IAF is pursuing the case for three high-altitude platform system (HAPS) aircraft, which are basically unmanned aerial vehicles or ‘pseudo-satellites’ that operate in the stratosphere for long durations on ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions, as reported by TOI earlier.During Operation Sindoor, which saw intense hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10, India used domestic satellites like Cartosat, as well as foreign commercial ones, for tracking military movements in Pakistan. “We need to shorten our OODA (observe, orient, decide and act) loop. The faster India gets the 52-satellite constellation up in space the better,” another source said.India also needs to put in place its satellite shield since China is developing weapons like direct ascent anti-satellite missiles, co-orbital satellites, electronic warfare equipment, and directed energy weapons like high-powered lasers to contest or deny other nations access to the space domain.China’s military space programme has expanded from operating just 36 satellites in 2010 to over 1,000 by 2024, with 360 of them dedicated to ISR missions.At a seminar earlier this month, IDS chief Air Marshal Ashutosh Dixit had stressed the need to extend India’s “surveillance envelope” while underlining the critical role of “real-time situational awareness” in conflicts.“We must detect, identify and track potential threats not when they approach our borders, but when they are still in their staging areas, airfields and bases, deep within an adversary’s territory,” he said.China’s creation of PLA Aerospace Force in April last year underlined its recognition of space as the “ultimate high ground” in modern warfare. “Their satellites have recently demonstrated sophisticated ‘dogfighting’ manoeuvres in LEO, practising tactics designed to track and potentially disable adversary space assets. They have evolved from a ‘kill chain’ to a ‘kill mesh’ — an integrated network that seamlessly interweaves ISR satellites with weapon systems,” Air Marshal Dixit said.","India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive military space doctrine.

Jaishankar at UN: ‘No impunity to terrorists’; slams proxies and nuclear blackmail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jaishankar-at-un-no-impunity-to-terrorists-slams-proxies-and-nuclear-blackmail/articleshow/122168261.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday called on the international community to stand united against terrorism , stressing that there must be ""no impunity to terrorists"", ""no treating them as proxies"", and ""no yielding to nuclear blackmail"".His comments came while inaugurating a digital exhibition titled ""The Human Cost of Terrorism"" at the United Nations headquarters.Addressing diplomats, senior UN officials and envoys gathered at the venue, Jaishankar highlighted India's firm response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians, and pointed to the broader message it sends.“We have since seen that happen. What that response underlines is a larger significance of the message of zero tolerance for terrorism. The world must come together on some basic concepts — no impunity to terrorists, no treating them as proxies, and no yielding to nuclear blackmail,” he said.The exhibition, on display from June 30 to July 3 and again from July 7 to 11 at the UN, comes a day before Pakistan begins its month-long Presidency of the Security Council.The digital exhibition presents visual documentation of global terror attacks, including the 1993 and 2008 Mumbai attacks and the recent Pahalgam strike, naming Pakistan-based outfits and individuals responsible.Jaishankar noted that five weeks ago, the UN Security Council had issued a strong condemnation of the Pahalgam attack and had demanded accountability. Two weeks after the incident, India launched Operation Sindoor targeting terror infrastructure across the border in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.“Any state sponsorship must be exposed and must be countered,” he said. “By now we know well that terrorism anywhere is a threat to peace everywhere. Let that understanding guide our collective thinking and response.”Calling terrorism one of the gravest threats to humanity, Jaishankar added: “It is the antithesis of everything that the UN stands for — human rights, rules and norms and how nations should conduct their dealings with each other.”He also stressed the need to call out state-backed terrorism and extremism openly. “When terrorism is supported by a state against the neighbour, when it is fuelled by the bigotry of extremism, when it drives a whole host of illegal activities, it is imperative to call it out publicly and one way of doing so is to display the havoc that it has wreaked on global society.”Referring to the exhibition, Jaishankar said: “This exhibition is a modest yet resolute effort to give voice to those who can no longer speak, a tribute to those who were taken away from us and a remembrance of the lives shattered by the scourge of terrorism.”He said the visual and textual displays captured “each moment, each memory, each artifact and every word” that tells the story of interrupted lives.“The pain of the families of the victims of terrorism is a stark reminder of the urgency of our shared responsibility to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” he said, urging the UN to not just remember but act.In a post on X, Jaishankar added: “Appreciated UN Security Council’s strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terror attack, and the need to hold its perpetrators accountable.” He said the exhibition conveyed a broader message of zero tolerance towards terrorism and reaffirmed “the shared and urgent responsibility of the global community to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.”","S jaishankar: there must be ""no impunity to terrorists"", ""no treating them as proxies"", and ""no yielding to nuclear blackmail"" comments came while inaugurating a digital exhibition titled ""the human cost of terrorism"" at the united nations headquarters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122168268,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1247653,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Dwivedi will also interact with senior officials of the Indian embassy, the Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) stationed in the country, and Project Dantak of the Border Roads Organisation, which is engaged in the construction of roads and other developmental work there.“The visit reflects the deep-rooted and time-tested ties between India and Bhutan and reaffirms India’s commitment to a close and trusted partner,” Army spokesperson Colonel Nishant Arvind said.India has been keeping a close watch on the series of border talks between Bhutan and an expansionist China in a bid to resolve their territorial disputes, which include the Doklam plateau in the west and the Jakarlung and Pasamlung valleys in the north.Ever since India’s military confrontation with China erupted in April 2020, after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh, the Indian Army has also been shoring up defenses in the strategically vulnerable Siliguri Corridor, or `Chicken’s Neck,’ the narrow strip of land in north Bengal that connects the northeast with the rest of India.The PLA has steadily stepped up its activities and infrastructure development in the Bhutanese territory of Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction, which witnessed the 73-day face-off between the rival troops in 2017.Indian troops had then blocked PLA attempts to extend their motorable track towards the Jampheri Ridge, which overlooks the Siliguri Corridor. After the disengagement, the PLA has constructed a lot of military infrastructure and permanently deployed troops in north Doklam, as reported by TOI earlier.",General upendra dwivedi is now on a four-day trip to bhutan to further enhance the already close bilateral military ties.

NEW DELHI: As Operation Sindoor continues to unfold, the defence acquisition council (DAC) led by defence minister Rajnath Singh is poised to clear a massive set of proposals worth over Rs 1 lakh crore aimed at modernising India's armed forces.The DAC, the ministry of defence's top decision-making body for capital acquisitions, is scheduled to meet later this week to take up a range of proposals across the Army, Air Force, and Navy, many of which focus on surveillance, air defence, and maritime security.A Rs 30,000 crore proposal to equip the Indian Army with DRDO-developed air defence systems capable of neutralising aerial threats within a 30 km range. The system is seen as a vital step in bolstering India’s layered air defence capabilities.The Indian Air Force is seeking approval to procure three Intelligence, Surveillance, Targeting and Reconnaissance (I-STAR) aircraft. These planes will be sourced from international manufacturers and later modified by DRDO’s Centre for Airborne Systems, in collaboration with private sector partners. The aircraft will enhance battlefield awareness and precision strike capability.The Indian Navy has proposed induction of pressure-based moored mines developed by DRDO, aimed at countering enemy submarines and surface ships in strategic waters.The plan to modernise 84 Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighter jets, already approved in principle, is expected to come up for further consideration. The upgrade will include avionics, weapons systems, and electronic warfare capabilities.The Navy is also pushing for unmanned underwater drones to strengthen undersea warfare and surveillance capabilities.The meeting marks the first major DAC session since the launch of Operation Sindoor, India’s counter-terror and strategic surveillance initiative, and underscores the government’s urgency in enhancing its defence posture amid evolving security challenges.Once cleared, the acquisitions are expected to significantly boost India’s operational readiness and reflect a continued emphasis on both indigenisation and technological upgrades in defence.","The defence acquisition council (dac) is poised to clear a massive set of proposals worth over rs 1 lakh crore aimed at modernising india's armed forces.

""The law has been passed by both Houses of Parliament and is under judicial review.

Institutions like Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia were cited as examples.Raising questions over the use and control of waqf properties, Trivedi alleged that significant portions of land remain underutilised and primarily serve elite interests.Trivedi questioned whether laws like waqf Act existed in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkiye, or Bangladesh.

Group Captain Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair, known fondly as Papa, may not be aboard the International Space Station (ISS) this time, but he’s soaring with pride. As the designated backup to Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux), who is currently making history as the first Indian to fly to the ISS, Papa says he’s happy to be his wingman.The camaraderie runs deep between the two IAF pilots, both trained test pilots, who were selected for India’s human spaceflight programme under Gaganyaan. Their journey together over the last ten months has not only forged a powerful professional bond but will also shape India’s future human spaceflight.“Shux is a fantastic guy,” Papa said ahead of Shux's docking, in a video shared by Axiom Space. “We met a few years ago through our work as fighter and test pilots. I’m actually nine years older than him… Over the last ten months of training, it’s been deeply satisfying for me to be his wingman — if I may use a bit of fighter pilot lingo.”Papa speaks of Shukla with admiration, highlighting his razor-sharp focus. “Once he decides on a goal — like becoming the first Indian to reach the ISS — he clears out all distractions and gives it his all. And that’s exactly what’s got him there.”Yet, Papa’s own path has been no less significant.As Shukla’s backup, he trained alongside him every step of the way. That training, Papa believes, has not only prepared both of them for individual missions but has also laid a broader foundation for the future of Indian spaceflight.“It never felt like work. It was more like one big, exciting picnic, though a professional one,” he says, describing the extensive, rigorous training that involved collaboration with Axiom Space, Nasa, ESA, SpaceX, and other international partners. “To train with legends like Peggy Whitson was just marvellous.”He recalls the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) training experience in the US with particular fondness. “We kayaked through rough weather, survived with limited resources, and what we learnt was this: your real strength in space is your teammate.”That, he says, is the very essence of space missions. “It’s not just about knowing someone’s strengths, but also their limitations so that you’re ready to step in, support and cover. That’s what makes a crew solid.”Among his favourite parts of training? The food. “An army marches on its stomach, and astronauts too fly on theirs,” he jokes. “The space food training was a highlight for me.”While Shukla currently has the nation’s gaze, Papa is quick to acknowledge the collective spirit behind their journey. “I want to give a big shout-out to my Prime Minister, Isro chairman, my wife Leena, daughter Nandini, and my parents. And of course, to all my fellow Indians.”Though grounded for now, Papa’s eyes remain on the skies. While Papa is happy to play wingman on this mission, one has to wait and see if may be in the pilot’s seat when India launches Gaganyaan.","'papa' is the designated backup to group captain shubhanshu shukla (shux), who is currently making history as the first indian to fly to the iss.

Yes, they should have targeted them. No, it was wise to avoid military targets.

NEW DELHI: IAF lost some fighter jets when it conducted strikes on nine terror hubs in Pakistan and PoK on May 7 because India's political leadership had directed that no military establishments or air defences across the border were to be attacked on that day, India's defence attache to Indonesia, Captain Shiv Kumar, said at a seminar earlier this month.The remarks by Captain Kumar, who is a colonel-rank officer from the Navy, followed an acknowledgment of IAF's initial losses by Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan on May 31 in Singapore but he did not specify the exact number of fighters shot down.Modi govt is yet to officially quantify IAF's losses during Operation Sindoor . Pakistan has claimed to have shot down six Indian fighters, including three French-origin Rafales, on May 7 itself - an assertion that CDS Chauhan dubbed as ""absolutely incorrect"".Captain Kumar's comments led Congress to renew its attack on govt over its handling of Operation Sindoor. Speaking at a seminar on 'Analysis of the Pakistan-India Air Battle and Indonesia's Anticipatory Strategies from the Perspective of Air Power' on June 10, Capt Kumar said he ""may not agree (with an earlier Indonesian speaker's claim) that we lost so many aircraft, but I do agree we did lose some aircraft and that happened only because of the constraint given by the political leadership to not attack their military establishments and air defences"".""After the loss, we changed our tactics and we went for the military installations (and radar sites). So, we first achieved suppression of enemy air defences and then that's why all our attacks could easily go through using Brahmos missiles (on May 10),"" he further said, his comments being in line with CDS Chauhan's statement in May that after initial losses, Indian armed forces took remedial measures and were able to carry out precision strikes at Pakistan's airbases.After Capt Kumar's 20-day-old remarks came to light and were cited by Congress to criticise govt, Indian embassy in Indonesia said Capt Kumar's remarks ""have been quoted out of context and the media reports are a mis-representation of the intention and thrust of the presentation made by the speaker"".""The presentation conveyed that the Indian armed forces serve under civilian political leadership, unlike some other countries in our neighbourhood. It was also explained that the objective of Operation Sindoor was to target terrorist infrastructure and the Indian response was non-escalatory,"" it posted on X. Earlier, the CDS had said in Singapore, ""What I can say is that on May 7, in the initial stages, there were losses. Numbers are not important.
