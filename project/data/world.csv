RAIPUR: At least 31 Maoist insurgents and two security personnel were killed Sunday in a fierce gunfight in the dense forests of Chhattisgarh's Bastar region, one of the last Naxal strongholds in the country. The operation is ongoing and officials expect the Maoist death toll to rise.This is the second-largest Maoist casualty count in a single security strike, after 38 guerrillas were gunned down in Narayanpur's Thulthuli on October 3 last year. Since 2024, more than 280 Maoists have been killed in Bastar. The number of Maoists killed this year has risen to 81 in just six weeks. Major operations include the killing of 16 Naxal fighters in Gariaband on Jan 21 and eight in Gangaloor on February 2. Security forces have also faced fatalities. On January 6, eight constables and a driver were killed when Maoists targeted their vehicle with an IED weighing nearly 70kg in Bijapur.Union home minister Amit Shah praised the security forces for the successful operation. ""The nation will always be indebted to these heroes.... I once again reaffirm that by March 31, 2026, we will eradicate Naxalism from the roots of this country so that no citizen loses their life due to it,"" he said. The gunfight erupted early Sunday after a contingent of over 650 security personnel launched a coordinated operation from multiple directions to hem in insurgents in the jungles of Bijapur's Indravati National Park.Intelligence reported the presence of a large group of Maoists and senior commanders.By late afternoon, 31 bodies of Maoist guerrillas had been recovered, Bastar deputy inspector general of police Kamlochan Kashyap said. Two securitymen were wounded, apart from the two killed.A large cache of Maoist weapons was seized, including AK-47s, SLRs, INSAS and .303 rifles, barrel grenade launchers (BGL) and explosives. Reinforcements have been dispatched to the site, nearly 150km from the district HQ and 420km from Raipur. Indravati was the site of another big operation on January 12, when security forces killed three Maoists. The park borders the Maoist headquarters of Abujhmarh, which straddles in states like Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.The area has long served as a stronghold for insurgents, providing them with a safe zone for recruitment and inter-state movement.Chhattisgarh CM Vishnu Deo Sai declared that the state is transitioning from ""gun-tantra"" (rule of the gun) to ""gantantra"" (democracy). ""Our soldiers have entered the Naxal strongholds and are eliminating them. The success achieved by our forces is commendable, and I salute their bravery...,"" he said, while condoling the deaths of two security men.","At least 31 maoist insurgents and two security personnel were killed sunday in a fierce gunfight.

A team of MNF legislators, led by opposition leader Lalchhandama Ralte, visited the airport on Saturday.Ralte said both MNF and Congress governments had put lot of efforts in establishing the state's first airport and successive governments ran the airport. ""When ZPM assumed office in December 2023, one of the first things that CM Lalduhoma did was proposing the handing over of our airport to IAF, which is shameful,"" he said.""Previous CMs Lal Thanhawla (Congress) and Zoramthanga (MNF) were able to retain ownership of the airport despite financial difficulties.

Noise pollution from fighter jets would also disrupt nearby areas, including Aizawl.""""Lengpui and its surrounding areas, including Aizawl, could become high-priority targets during conflicts due to the airport's strategic importance as a military installation.

""disappeared""

In a hilarious yet wild twist, Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, is asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to return a Super Bowl ring that Putin allegedlyback in 2005. This whole drama resurfaced thanks to the release of Apple TV’s “The Dynasty” series, leaving everyone questioning: Did Putin really just walk off with Kraft's bling? Let’s dive into this strange, almost comical, story.Back in 2005, Kraft was in Russia for a business trip. Naturally, he took his Super Bowl ring along to show off—because who wouldn't, right? He had the world's attention, and Putin was in the room. According to Kraft, he showed the ring to Putin, who then put it on, made a chilling comment like,and then—just like that—took it. Yep, he walked away with it while three KGB agents apparently stood around, making it pretty clear this wasn’t your average “Hey, take a look at my ring” moment.Kraft’s ring was valued at around $25,000, although Super Bowl rings typically range between $30,000 and $50,000. So it’s not exactly a cheap piece of jewelry. Imagine how much cooler it would look in Putin’s collection of other gifts from world leaders, which just so happens to include Kraft’s shiny treasure on display in the Kremlin.After the ring mysteriously disappeared into Russian hands, Kraft publicly asked for it back. But here’s where things get weird. The White House reportedly told him to claim that he hadthe ring to Putin in order to avoid causing any tension in US-Russian relations. Kraft went along with it, stating the ring was a token of respect for the Russian people. However, he later admitted that wasn’t true at all—it was actually the U.S. government’s idea, not his.In the end, Russia insists the ring was a gift, so it's now part of Putin's private collection, safely housed in the Kremlin. But Kraft is not letting go. At a lighthearted event honoring Tom Brady, Kraft humorously asked for the ring back, joking that it hadand was still missing.This story is far from over, and with the public attention now back on it, maybe Kraft will get his bling back after all.Also read - How the Super Bowl Got Its Name: The Surprising Story Behind the Iconic Title","Robert kraft, owner of the new england patriots, is asking russian president vladimir putin to return a super bowl ring that putin allegedly stole in 2005.

Trump’s proclamation also calls for public officials and citizens to observe Gulf of America Day with ""appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.""The body of water now known as the Gulf of America was historically referred to as the ""Mexican Bay"" (Seno Mexicano) until the early 19th century. The current name, ""Gulf of Mexico,"" originated from Spanish explorers who named the region based on Mexico's extensive coastline, according to historical records.The renaming comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Mexico. Trump recently threatened 25% tariffs on Mexican imports, later pausing the move after Mexico agreed to deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to the border.","Us president donald trump officially renamed the gulf of mexico as the ""gulf of america"" on sunday.

Canada’s response

Trump doubles down

US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his stance that Canada should become the 51st state, declaring he is “serious” about the idea in an interview aired during the Super Bowl pre-show on Sunday.""I think Canada would be much better off being the 51st state because we lose $200 billion a year with Canada. And I'm not going to let that happen,"" Trump said, adding, ""Why are we paying $200 billion a year, essentially a subsidy to Canada?""However, according to the news agency AP, the US does not subsidise Canada. The trade deficit with the resource-rich nation stood at $72 billion in 2023, largely due to American imports of Canadian energy.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had recently acknowledged Trump’s remarks as a genuine concern, rather than political rhetoric. ""Mr. Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country, and it is a real thing,"" Trudeau reportedly told business leaders, according to CBC.He suggested that Trump’s interest is tied to Canada's critical mineral resources, which are essential for electric vehicles, semiconductors, and clean energy.Trump has made multiple public references to annexing Canada, once referring to Trudeau as “Governor Trudeau” on Truth Social. His administration has also threatened 25% tariffs on all Canadian exports, excluding energy, which would be taxed at 10%. However, a 30-day pause on these tariffs was agreed upon after Canada pledged to enhance border security.To counter the pressure, Canada has launched a $1.3 billion CAD ($900 million USD) border security plan, including drones, helicopters, and a joint task force with the US. It also appointed a ""fentanyl czar"" to address American concerns over drug trafficking.François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry minister, had emphasised the deep interdependence between the two economies. “This is about a confident Canada,” he said.Meanwhile, an Ipsos poll found that 80% of Canadians oppose becoming part of the US, as per BBC.With the tariff reprieve nearing its end, Trudeau warned of potential economic retaliation. “We need to be ready to respond robustly,” he said. Business leaders are also pushing for market diversification to reduce economic reliance on the US.During the interview, Trump also defended Elon Musk’s department of government efficiency (DOGE), stating Musk has been “terrific” in his mission to dismantle government agencies and cut federal workforce inefficiencies. He further hinted that the department of education and military spending could be targeted next.""We're going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse,"" Trump claimed.Trump also used the interview to announce upcoming tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, including from Canada and Mexico and previewed a plan for reciprocal tariffs.While en route to the Super Bowl, Trump signed a proclamation renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the ""Gulf of America.""","Us president donald trump has doubled down on his stance that canada should become the 51st state.

Top Trump administration officials are openly challenging the judiciary’s role as a check on executive power as President Donald Trump’s agenda faces increasing legal hurdles.Over the weekend, Vice President JD Vance and Tesla owner Elon Musk , who heads the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, criticised a federal judge’s decision that blocked Musk’s team from accessing Treasury Department records.As per AP, the ruling led to an intense pushback from Trump allies, with some questioning the legitimacy of judicial oversight itself.Vance, in a post on X, wrote, “If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that’s also illegal. Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.”Musk, in an overnight post, called for the judge’s impeachment, describing him as “a corrupt judge protecting corruption.”Musk’s team had been investigating government spending but was temporarily barred from accessing a Treasury system containing the personal financial data of millions of Americans.According to the New York Times, Vance has previously argued that presidents should defy court orders that interfere with their constitutional authorityMeanwhile, deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller framed the judiciary’s interventions as “an assault on the very idea of democracy itself.” As per Fox News, he claimed that an “unelected shadow force” within the government was obstructing Trump’s efforts to reform federal agencies.The legal challenges come as judges have temporarily halted several of Trump’s key initiatives, including his executive order to end birthright citizenship and his efforts to dismantle government agencies. A hearing on the Treasury case is set for February 14, with Democrats warning of a constitutional crisis .“This is a red alert moment,” Senator Chris Murphy said on ABC’s ‘This Week’. “Our democracy is at risk”, said Chris.",Top trump administration officials are openly challenging the judiciary’s role as a check on executive power.

Why could Harry be deported? What is the visa case?

President Donald Trump unwittingly dropped a major hint about the marital problems of Harry and Meghan Markle as he, in an interview with the New York Post, said he has no interest in pursuing the visa case against Harry. ""I'll leave him alone. He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible,"" Donald Trump said without naming Meghan Markle.A lot has been discussed about Harry and Meghan's marriage problems with insiders claiming that they are on the verge of a divorce. Vanity Fair did a cover story about the ex-royals in which they claimed that Meghan Markle was approached to write a ""post-divorce"" book though there was no such scenario on the horizon. Then there were speculations that they were separating their professional lives -- with Meghan Markle focussing on her shows and entrepreneurial works and Harry remaining busy with his philanthropic works. But Harry and Meghan made several joint appearances since then -- they visited relief centers in Los Angeles to help the fire victims; they appeared together to launch the Invictus Games in Vancouver Saturday.In 2022, Donald Trump spoke about Harry and Meghan on the Piers Morgan show and said he was never a fan of Meghan Markle.""I'm not a fan of Meghan, I'm not a fan, and I wasn't right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose.,"" Trump said in the old interview.""Do you think it's going to end?"" Piers Morgan asked. ""I do, I've been a very good predictor, as you know, I've predicted almost everything, it'll end, and it'll end bad,"" the former president replied. ""I wonder if Harry's going to go back on his hands and knees and say please. You know, I think Harry's been led down a path.""""I would, the only thing I disagree with the Queen on, probably one of the only things ever, is that I think she should have said, 'If that's your choice fine, but you no longer have titles and frankly don't come around,'"" Trump said. ""He has been so disrespectful to the country and I think he's an embarrassment.""After stepping down as royals, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle settled in the US, in Montecito. After Harry's memoir Spare was published, he was accused of lying in his visa form as in his book, he admitted to taking marijuana, cocaine, and psychedelic drugs. Every US visa applicant has to give information about their drug history. Either Harry lied about drugs in the form or he was given preferential treatment, the lawsuit claimed demanding Harry's visa records. But the judge ruled in favor of Harry that his visa records would remain private.

Trump's Immigration Policy Changes Could Impact Indian H-1B Visa Holders and Families,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/immigration-policy-changes-being-considered-by-trump-administration-may-hit-indians-on-green-card-queues-hard/articleshow/118013429.cms,"Poll Does Stricter U.S. Immigration Policy Violate Human Rights? No, It’s Necessary Yes, It’s Unfair

Several steps being considered by the administration of US President Donald Trump are cause for worry for thousands of Indians in the US, who are on H-1B work permits and face long green card backlog.First, the potential revocation of birthright citizenship, for which President Trump has signed an executive order, is a deeply concerning issue for Indian families on H-1B visas who are expecting children in the United States. While this policy is currently being challenged in court and remains on hold, its implementation—however unlikely—would have profound implications.One of the most significant challenges would be the increase in the number of “aging-out” children, who are not covered under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and would lose the automatic legal status that US birthright citizenship provides. There are over 200,000 young immigrants, a large number of them Indians, who went to America with their parents as dependent children and then aged-out when they turned 21, according to estimates. They have to either self-deport, despite having lived in the US for several years and grown up and attended school and college there, or become undocumented immigrants.The issue of children aging out of dependent visa status is already one of the most challenging problems for Indian professionals on H-1B visas, and any policy change revoking birthright citizenship would only exacerbate it.“This would add further complexity to an already overburdened green card backlog, disproportionately affecting H-1B holders from India. Given the existing decades-long wait times for employment-based green cards, the inability to secure US citizenship at birth could leave these children in a precarious immigration status as they reach adulthood,” Neha Mahajan , co-founder of Skilled Immigrants in America (SIIA), an organisation supporting skilled Indians stuck in long green card queues, told the Times of India.The issue of birthright citizenship is currently being challenged in the US courts, and the executive order attempting to revoke it is on hold. Given the strong constitutional precedent supporting birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment, any attempt to alter this long-standing principle is likely to face significant legal hurdles.Earlier this week, a federal judge in Seattle has indefinitely blocked President Trump’s executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship. Historically, US courts have consistently upheld birthright citizenship, making it highly probable that this issue will remain tied up in litigation for an extended period. Any definitive change would require not just executive action but a constitutional amendment or a landmark Supreme Court ruling.“For now, the legal and constitutional precedent supporting birthright citizenship remains strong. However, any change to this principle would necessitate significant legislative and judicial battles, given its far-reaching consequences on immigrant communities and the broader US economy,” Mahajan said.Currently, children born in the United States to immigrant parents—whether on work visas or otherwise—are granted automatic US citizenship, providing a crucial safeguard against the severe green card backlog that disproportionately affects Indian H-1B holders. “This backlog, with decades-long wait times, leaves many high-skilled professionals in an uncertain immigration status for most of their careers. Birthright citizenship has been one of the few stabilising factors for their families,” Mahajan said. She added that the United States’ policy of birthright citizenship has historically set it apart from other developed nations, making it a more attractive destination for global talent.Another issue that could pose challenges for Indian professionals in the US, on H-1B visas, is the move to revoke employment authorisation documents for spouses of H-1B visa holders who are on dependent H-4 visas. “The H-4 EAD was introduced through an executive order by the Barack Obama administration after years of advocacy, providing much-needed relief and economic independence to many spouses of H-1B visa holders. However, under the administration of Trump’s first term, there was a concerted effort to revoke H-4 EADs, creating uncertainty and hardship for thousands of skilled immigrant women. Thanks to relentless advocacy—by organisations like SIIA and many women who chose to raise their voices—the effort to eliminate H-4 EADs was ultimately unsuccessful,” Mahajan said.She added that the broader immigration system has become increasingly difficult to navigate for Indians in the US who are waiting on green card queues. “Even routine H-4 EAD renewals have faced delays, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to employment disruptions and financial instability for many families from India, who already face disproportionately long wait times for permanent residency.”There are also fears now among Indian professionals, on temporary work visas in the US, on reversal of the Joe Biden administration’s order on automatic extension in certain categories of work permits. “These extensions were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to streamline the renewal process and prevent unnecessary employment disruptions. Any move to revoke automatic work permit extensions would have a significant impact on Indian professionals, particularly those on H-4 EADs,” Mahajan said. The automatic extensions allowed individuals to continue working while their renewal applications were pending, eliminating the need for additional biometrics appointments—a requirement that had been introduced under the earlier Trump administration.“Traditionally, H-1B and H-4 petitions were processed together, ensuring timely approvals. However, if the Trump administration issues new guidance to separate these filings, it could lead to increased delays in work authorisation extensions. This would disproportionately impact H-4 visa holders, many of whom are highly skilled professionals contributing to the US workforce,” Mahajan said.For Indian professionals already navigating decades-long green card wait time, these likely policy changes, being considered by the Trump administration create additional uncertainty and financial instability.",Several steps being considered by the administration of us president donald trump are cause for worry for thousands of indians in the us.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118013823,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-664928,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Who is Marko Elez? What is the controversy?



JD Vance vs Ro Khanna over India-hate



Did Ro Khanna blackmail JD Vance?



President Donald Trump was asked about the controversial exit of Marko Elez from Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency over his past social media posts in one of which he called himself 'racist' and also called for normalizing India hate. Trump said he was not aware of it but if Vice President JD Vance is in favor of rehiring the person, he is with the VP. ""Well I don't know about that particular thing but if the Vice President said so..did you say that? (turning to JD), I'm with the VP,"" Trump said.Marko Elez is a 25-year-old lieutenant of Elon Musk who apparently resigned from DOGE, the Wall Street Journal reported. WSJ reported that Elez made some problematic posts on social media through a pseudonym account which was closed in December probably when he started to work for DOGE but many of those White supremacist posts were archived. WSJ said when they contacted White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt for a comment on Elez's past posts, Leavitt said Elez resigned from DOGE.His past posts included: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.”; “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity. Normalize Indian hate"" etc.Elon Musk ran a poll on X on whether to rehire him and the maximum votes were in favor of rehiring him. Even JD Vance said Elez should not be victimized for his past social media activities which became another major controversy -- as Vance is married to Indian-origin Usha Vance and he did not call out the India hate.JD Vance said he ""obviously"" disagrees with some of Elez's posts but added that he also thinks that past social media activity should not ruin Elez's life. Indian-origin Democrat leader Ro Khanna took offence to Vance's stand and asked him whether Vance would seek an apology from Elez for his ""normalize Indian hate"" statement. ""Just asking for the sake of both of our kids,"" Ro Khanna wrote.""For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,"" JD Vance said. ""Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don't threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages congressmen to act like whiny children.""JD Vance called Ro Khanna's statement emotional blackmail. ""I don't worry about my kids making mistakes, or developing views they later regret. I don't even worry that much about trolls on the internet. You know what I do worry about, Ro? That they'll grow up to be a US Congressmen who engages in emotional blackmail over a kid's social media posts.
