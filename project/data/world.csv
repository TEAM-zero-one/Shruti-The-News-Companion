Where HAMMER fits in India’s precision strike ecosystem





India’s decision to manufacture the HAMMER precision-guided air-to-ground weapon marks a quiet but consequential shift in how New Delhi is preparing for future conflict. More than a new addition to the arsenal, HAMMER represents a move away from importing finished munitions towards absorbing the technologies that define modern air warfare.Developed by France’s Safran Electronics & Defense, HAMMER is a modular precision strike system designed to hit targets from stand-off ranges while keeping aircraft outside heavily defended airspace. Its architecture combines guidance kits, propulsion and standard bomb bodies, allowing rapid adaptation across missions and platforms. The system is already combat-proven and integrated with aircraft such as the Rafale.Under a new agreement, Bharat Electronics Limited and Safran will jointly manufacture, customise, supply and maintain HAMMER in India through a 50-50 joint venture. The weapon will be integrated across multiple platforms, including the Rafale and the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, creating a common precision strike capability across both imported and home-grown fleets.At a time when air power is defined less by numbers and more by accuracy, stand-off reach and controlled escalation, the localisation of HAMMER signals a strategic shift from buying weapons to mastering precision strike technology itself.The Indian Air Force deployed HAMMER precision-guided weapons during Operation Sindoor on 7 May 2025 as part of a carefully calibrated cross-border strike against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22. A total of nine sites were struck, including Jaish-e-Mohammed’s primary base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke.Weapon selection was central to the operation’s objectives. The Indian Air Force employed a layered mix of SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER precision-guided bombs and loitering munitions.Within this mix, HAMMER was used where flexibility and adaptability were essential. Its modular design and multiple guidance options allowed the IAF to tailor strikes based on the nature of individual targets and real-time assessments.HAMMER enabled stand-off engagement without requiring aircraft to fly directly over heavily defended areas. Its off-axis launch capability reduced exposure to Pakistan’s air defence network, particularly in areas close to population centres and sensitive military zones.The weapon’s precision supported the operation’s political and military messaging by reducing the risk of collateral damage. By pairing HAMMER with SCALP, the Indian Air Force demonstrated a layered strike doctrine, with SCALP neutralising deep, hardened targets and HAMMER engaging medium-range sites requiring precision and manoeuvrability.HAMMER, short for Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range, officially designated as AASM from the French Armement Air-Sol Modulaire, is a precision-guided air-to-ground stand-off weapon designed to bridge the gap between conventional bombs and cruise missiles.Despite often being described as a missile, HAMMER is fundamentally a guided bomb system. At its core is a standard unguided bomb, which becomes a high-precision strike weapon once fitted with modular guidance and propulsion kits. This design allows air forces to convert existing bomb inventories into modern precision weapons without developing entirely new missiles for each mission profile.The system is built around two main components. The first is a nose-mounted guidance section that determines how the weapon navigates and locks onto its target. Depending on the mission, this guidance kit can combine inertial navigation and GPS for all-weather strikes, infrared imaging for high-precision attacks on fixed targets, or laser guidance for engaging moving targets.The second component is a tail-mounted range extension kit, which includes a solid-fuel rocket booster and manoeuvrable winglets. Once released, the booster ignites to increase stand-off range, while the winglets allow the weapon to alter its flight path, perform sharp turns and attack targets from off-axis angles. In combat, this enables launch aircraft to remain outside heavily defended airspace while still striking accurately.HAMMER kits can be attached to bombs weighing 125 kilograms, 250 kilograms, 500 kilograms and 1,000 kilograms, including widely used Mark 80 series bombs. This scalability allows the same weapon system to be used against a range of targets, from lightly protected structures to hardened bunkers.In operational use, HAMMER has demonstrated the ability to strike targets from significant distances, engage multiple targets in a single sortie and maintain accuracy in contested environments. Its combination of modularity, manoeuvrability and precision makes it particularly suited to modern air operations where speed, flexibility and controlled escalation are critical.In modern air warfare, weapons fall broadly into three categories: unguided bombs, guided bombs and air-to-surface missiles.Unguided bombs are cheap but inaccurate and require aircraft to fly directly over targets. Air-to-surface missiles offer long range and precision but are expensive and limited in numbers.HAMMER sits between these two extremes. It offers missile-like precision and stand-off range while retaining the flexibility and lower cost structure of a guided bomb.This distinction matters. Guided bombs like HAMMER allow air forces to carry larger numbers of precision weapons, adapt them to multiple target types and deploy them from a wide range of aircraft.The defining feature of HAMMER is modularity. Instead of designing a single fixed weapon, Safran developed a system where guidance, propulsion and bomb body can be mixed and matched.The nose-mounted guidance kit determines how the weapon finds and tracks its target. The rear-mounted range extension kit determines how far it can travel after release and how sharply it can manoeuvre.This modular architecture allows the same basic weapon to be used for close air support, deep strike, bunker busting and attacks on moving targets, depending on the guidance kit selected.For India, this means fewer weapon types to manage logistically while retaining operational flexibility.HAMMER is available in three primary guidance configurations.The baseline version combines an inertial navigation system and a Global Positioning System receiver. Data from both systems is fused using Kalman filtering, allowing the weapon to maintain accuracy even if GPS signals are degraded or jammed. This variant achieves a circular error probability of around 10 metres and works in all weather conditions.The second variant adds infrared homing to the INS and GPS combination. This system matches the target area with a reference image stored in the weapon’s memory, allowing accuracy of around one metre. It works day and night in fair weather and is particularly useful against fixed targets with a clear thermal signature.The third variant replaces infrared homing with laser guidance. This allows HAMMER to strike moving targets, provided they are illuminated by a laser designator from an aircraft, drone or ground team. This version was qualified in April 2013.These variants were redesignated in 2010 as SBU-38, SBU-64 and SBU-54 respectively, with the overall system renamed HAMMER for export.HAMMER’s range depends on launch altitude and configuration. Safran cites a range of over 32 nautical miles from high altitude and around 8 nautical miles from low-level release.The winglets and rocket booster allow off-axis launches of up to 90 degrees, meaning the aircraft does not have to point directly at the target. This reduces exposure to enemy air defences.Multiple HAMMER weapons can be released in a single pass against different targets with one trigger press, a capability that significantly enhances strike efficiency.HAMMER entered service in 2007 with the French Air Force and Naval Aviation on the Rafale platform.Its combat debut came in Afghanistan in April 2008, when a Rafale dropped two HAMMER weapons in support of ground troops.The system gained wider attention during the 2011 Libya campaign. A HAMMER weapon destroyed a Libyan Air Force G-2 Galeb aircraft on the runway at Misrata Airport shortly after it landed. Another strike destroyed a Libyan tank at a distance of 55 kilometres. In total, 225 HAMMER weapons were used in Libya.This combat history is critical. Weapons that have been tested in real conflicts carry credibility in terms of reliability, accuracy and resistance to countermeasures.India ordered large numbers of HAMMER weapons in September 2020. Deliveries were completed by November 2020, with the French Air and Space Force transferring part of its own stock to ensure immediate availability.The Indian Air Force initially integrated HAMMER on the Rafale fleet. Work has since begun to integrate it onto the Tejas, a process that involves complex software, avionics and flight control modifications.Successful integration on Tejas would represent a major step in combining imported high-end weapons with indigenous platforms.According to France’s Senate committee on defence manufacturing costs, the total cost of the AASM programme including development and delivery of 2,348 kits was €846 million, placing the per-weapon cost at around $300,000.Earlier figures showed a unit cost of €164,000 excluding development and €252,000 including development. By 2017, Safran reported a unit cost of €120,000 for the AASM Evolution version, with a target of reducing it to €80,000 through larger production runs.For India, domestic production offers the potential to lower costs over time while ensuring availability during crises.India today operates a layered precision strike inventory.Indigenous systems include the Sudarshan Laser Guided Bomb, the Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon, and glide bombs such as Gaurav and Garuthmaa.Imported and jointly developed systems include the SPICE series from Israel, HAMMER from France and the BrahMos-A supersonic cruise missile.HAMMER fills a crucial middle ground between short-range guided bombs and long-range cruise missiles, offering flexibility, precision and affordability.Manufacturing HAMMER in India is not just about supply security. It allows Indian engineers and technicians to gain deep familiarity with guidance systems, propulsion integration and precision strike workflows.This knowledge is transferable to future indigenous weapons programmes and reduces long-term dependence on foreign suppliers for upgrades and maintenance.The deal also strengthens India’s defence partnership with France at a time when New Delhi is diversifying beyond traditional suppliers.The BEL–Safran HAMMER joint venture represents a quiet but important shift in India’s approach to air warfare. Precision, modularity and adaptability are now central to how air power is conceived and deployed.By moving HAMMER production to Indian soil, New Delhi is not merely acquiring a weapon. It is acquiring the ability to understand, modify and eventually design the tools of modern precision strike warfare.","Hammer is a precision-guided air-to-ground stand-off weapon designed to bridge the gap between conventional bombs and cruise missiles.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army on Monday showcased a Turkish-made drone that was brought down by the Indian forces on May 10, the final day of the four-day conflict with Pakistan.The reconstructed, armed Yiiha drone was displayed at an event hosted by army chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, on the eve of the 54th Vijay Diwas, commemorating India’s decisive victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war.The Yiiha, a kamikaze-class drone displayed at the event, was flying at an altitude of around 2,000 metres on May 10. Launched from Lahore International Airport, its intended target was Jalandhar, according to military officials.The unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), carrying a 10-kg explosive payload, was brought down by the Army Air Defence (AAD). Remotely operated, it was designed to detonate on impact.The UCAV has a wingspan of about two metres and is powered by a two-stroke engine with a capacity of 170 cc.Kamikaze-class drones, also known as “suicide drones,” are weapon systems designed to loiter over a target area, searching for a suitable target before carrying out an attack.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, carrying out air strikes on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. It was followed by four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions, following a ceasefire request by Islamabad.Pakistan used a large number of Yiha single-use attack UCAVs to target various Indian military and civilian installations during the conflict.Almost all the Pakistani drones were shot down by the Indian military.","The yiiha was flying at an altitude of around 2,000 metres on may 10.

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday filed its chargesheet in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack case against seven accused, including a Pakistani handler, terror outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and its proxy, The Resistance Front (TRF), and others.The anti-terror agency presented the chargesheet before the NIA Special Court in Jammu.The 1,597-page chargesheet named the handler, Sajid Jatt, along with three Pakistani terrorists neutralised by security forces during Operation Mahadev at Dachigam in Srinagar in July. They have been identified as Faisal Jatt alias Suleman Shah, Habeeb Tahir alias Jibran, and Hamza Afghani.Further, the chargesheet has arraigned the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and The Resistance Front (TRF) as legal entities for their role in planning, facilitating and executing the Pahalgam assault. It has also invoked the penal section against the accused for waging war against India.The development comes nearly six months after the agency arrested two men for harbouring the terrorists who carried out the deadly attack.The men — Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar and Bashir Ahmad Jothar — were arrested on June 22 for harbouring the terrorists, and have been named in the chargesheet. During interrogation, the duo had reportedly disclosed the identities of the attackers and confirmed they were Pakistani nationals affiliated with the proscribed LeT.On April 22, the three heavily armed terrorists shot dead 26 civilians — all men — including a local and a tourist from Nepal, in Pahalgam’s Baisaran Valley.After announcing a series of diplomatic measures, India responded with Operation Sindoor, carrying out airstrikes on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7. The strikes triggered intense cross-border clashes that were halted after Islamabad sought a ceasefire on May 10.","The national investigation agency (nia) on monday filed its chargesheet in the april 22 pahalgam terror attack case against seven accused.

New Delhi: The amended atomic energy bill was tabled in LS Monday, paving way for a huge policy shift in India’s atomic sector that is expected to accelerate civil nuclear energy production by opening doors for private players. The sector has till now been the preserve of govt enterprises.Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, introduced by MoS for department of atomic energy Jitendra Singh in the House, seeks to repeal Atomic Energy Act, 1962, and Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA), 2010. It provides for “a pragmatic civil liability regime for nuclear damage and to confer statutory status to Atomic Energy Regulatory Board”, Singh said.The new legislation seeks to support large-scale expansion of nuclear energy and radiation applications across power & non-power sectors. It is central to India’s goal of achieving 100GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. It proposes a new legal framework that includes modern safety regulations, a dedicated nuclear tribunal for dispute resolution, and reforms to the nuclear liability regime to cap risks & attract investment.While private companies and their joint ventures will be allowed to apply for licences to set up and operate nuclear facilities & transport nuclear fuel, critical functions such as uranium enrichment, spent fuel management and heavy water production will remain under the exclusive control of Centre. Govt will retain control over radioactive substances and radiation-generating equipment to address safety hazards.Singh said the bill was aligned with the goal of increasing the share of nuclear energy in India’s overall energy mix, facilitating innovation in nuclear science and technology, &expanding its use in non-power applications, such as healthcare, food, water, agriculture, industry, environment, research and innovation, and emerging areas such as AI, while continuing to honour India’s obligations on safety, security, safeguards & nuclear liability.The amendments are designed to finally implement the stalled Indo-US nuclear agreement, which has led to little progress beyond fuel imports due to liability issues, and enable US reactor construction in India.",The sector has till now been the preserve of govt enterprises.

NEW DELHI: India on Monday firmly rejected Pakistan ’s reference to Jammu and Kashmir during an open debate at the United Nations Security Council , saying the Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral part of India and will always remain so.Speaking at the UNSC Open Debate on 'Leadership for Peace', India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Harish P, said Pakistan’s repeated mention of Jammu and Kashmir reflected an “obsessive focus” on harming India and its people.He said: ""I refer to the statement made by the representative of Pakistan today. India would like to reiterate that the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India. They were, are, and will always remain so. Pakistan’s unwarranted reference to Jammu & Kashmir in today’s open debate attests to its obsessive focus on harming India and its people. A serving non-permanent Security Council Member that chooses to further this obsession in all meetings and platforms of the UN in pursuit of its divisive agenda cannot be expected to fulfil its designated responsibilities and obligations.The Indian envoy said India signed the Indus Waters Treaty 65 years ago in good faith and with a spirit of friendship. However, he said Pakistan had violated the spirit of the treaty over the decades by waging three wars and sponsoring thousands of terror attacks against India. He added that tens of thousands of Indian lives have been lost in Pakistan-sponsored terrorism over the last four decades.Referring to the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack, the ambassador said, ""The Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, involved religion-based targeted killings of 26 innocent civilians by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists. It is in this backdrop that India has finally announced that the Treaty will be held in abeyance until Pakistan, which is a global epicentre of terror, credibly and irrevocably ends its support for cross-border and all other forms of terrorism. ""India criticised Pakistan's domestic political situation over jailing former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and allowing its armed forces to engineer a ""constitutional coup"" through the new 27th amendment, which granted lifetime immunity to its chief of defence forces Asim Munir.""Pakistan, of course, has a unique way of respecting the will of its people - by jailing a Prime Minister, by banning the ruling political party and by letting its armed forces engineer a constitutional coup through the 27th amendment and giving lifetime immunity to its Chief of Defence Forces,"" Parvathaneni said.He further added that India would continue to counter Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in all its forms with full resolve.",India firmly rejected pakistan’s reference to jammu and kashmir during an open debate at the united nations security council.

Modi also reaffirmed India’s support for efforts being made to achieve durable peace in the region.Modi arrived in Amman for what is the first full-fledged bilateral visit by an Indian PM to the country in 37 years. He had in 2018 transited through Jordan on his way to Palestine.The PM is on a three-nation trip to Jordan, Ethiopia and Oman. The leaders also discussed efforts to expand cooperation in areas like trade, fertilisers, digital technology and infrastructure.“On Gaza, from the beginning, your role has been active and positive. It is the hope of all of us that peace and stability remain in this region,” said Modi in his opening remarks.According to Jordan, the need to step up the humanitarian response in Gaza and ensure implementation of the agreement to end the war on the Strip was also discussed.“Against terrorism, our shared and clear stance exists. Under your leadership, Jordan has given a strong and strategic message to all of humanity against terrorism, extremism, and radicalisation,” he added.During the restricted meeting earlier, the leaders discussed giving more strength to cooperation in this area, with Modi recalling the king’s participation in 2018, during his India visit, in a conference on Islamic Heritage. “I remember that our first meeting happened in 2015 at an event focused on countering violent extremism on the sidelines of the UN. You had given inspirational remarks on this subject then too. To promote moderation, your efforts are extremely important not just regionally but for global peace as well,” Modi told Abdullah, adding both sides would continue moving forward solidly in this direction together.In a special gesture, on arrival at the airport in Amman, Modi was received by Jordanian PM Jafar Hassan and accorded a ceremonial welcome. This full-fledged bilateral visit to Jordan is taking place after a span of 37 years, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, said MEA in a statement.Noting that India was Jordan’s 3rd largest trading partner, Modi proposed the two countries should aim to enhance bilateral trade to US$ 5 billion over next five years.On the sidelines of the visit, govts of Jordan and India are due to sign MoUs on renewable energy and water resource management, a cultural exchange programme, a letter of intent on cooperation in the field of digital transformation, and a twinning agreement between the city of Petra and Ellora Caves site in India.In his departure statement earlier, PM Modi said that India shares both age-old civilisational ties, as well as extensive contemporary bilateral relations, with the countries he’s visiting.","Pm narendra modi underlined the significance of efforts to counter terrorism, extremism and radicalisation in a meeting with jordan’s king abdullah ii.

Who really wins this deal?

Atlanta Braves rumors are gaining serious traction as Atlanta continues to explore a blockbuster trade for Texas Rangers shortstop Corey Seager, a move that would instantly reshape the National League playoff picture. The two-time World Series MVP remains one of baseball’s most dangerous left-handed bats, and even preliminary interest from the Braves has ignited fan speculation across the league. While no deal is close, the combination of Atlanta’s glaring shortstop need and Texas’ willingness to listen on veterans has turned this into one of the most fascinating “what if” scenarios of the offseason.According to multiple reports from the Winter Meetings, the Atlanta Braves have checked in on Seager as they search for a long-term solution at shortstop following years of instability since Dansby Swanson’s departure. However, the biggest complication is structural rather than financial: Atlanta is on Corey Seager’s no-trade list, meaning any deal would require the star shortstop’s direct approval.That reality has kept discussions preliminary. Rangers GM Chris Young has publicly acknowledged openness to moving pieces as Texas adjusts payroll after dealing Marcus Semien, but there have been no substantial negotiations involving Seager’s contract, which still carries roughly $186 million over the next six seasons.Jeff Passan and other national insiders have framed Atlanta’s interest as exploratory, yet persistent.The Atlanta Braves’ motivation is clear. Atlanta’s shortstop production in 2025 ranked among the weakest of any contender, combining for just 1.1 fWAR with minimal power and on-base ability. Seager would immediately flip that weakness into a strength, giving the lineup another elite bat alongside Ronald Acuña Jr. and Matt Olson.Pundits have described Seager as a massive offensive upgrade over options like Mauricio Dubón, not only for his power but for his postseason résumé. His presence would allow Atlanta to stabilize the infield, either by keeping Seager at shortstop or shifting him to DH while adjusting Ozzie Albies defensively.While any proposal remains speculative, industry chatter has centered on a prospect-heavy return rather than elite, untouchable names. One scenario floated by analysts involves Atlanta sending mid-tier arms and depth pieces to Texas, paired with financial relief.Potential structure discussed by insiders includes:• Pitching prospects such as Hurston Waldrep and Dylan Dodd• Additional secondary pieces to balance value• Texas retaining $10–15 million annually to ease Seager’s $31 million AAVThe Rangers would gain controllable pitching for a retooling phase, while the Braves would absorb a superstar contract aligned with a win-now window. The largest hurdle remains Seager’s willingness to waive his no-trade clause, something considered unlikely but not impossible if competitive priorities outweigh geography.From the Texas Rangers’ perspective, moving Seager would signal a clear pivot. After an 81-81 season and mounting payroll pressure, shedding long-term salary while restocking a thinned farm system has appeal. Still, trading away a franchise face and postseason hero would be a tough sell internally and publicly.At 31, Seager’s durability has become part of the conversation, having missed significant time in recent seasons. Texas could choose to move early rather than risk decline, but replacing a hitter with a .289 career average and elite playoff production is no small task.The contrast between Seager and Atlanta’s recent shortstop output highlights why this rumor won’t fade quietly.Advanced metrics paint an even sharper picture. Seager’s .365 wOBA and 15.3 percent barrel rate dwarf Atlanta’s infield production, with projections suggesting 30-plus home run potential in Truist Park.• Proven MVP-caliber talent fills a major lineup hole• Left-handed power plays well against NL East pitching• Postseason experience strengthens October ceiling• Injury history over the past two seasons• $31 million AAV strains payroll flexibility• No-trade clause could halt talks entirely• Prospect infusion for a system needing depth• Long-term salary relief• Opportunity to reset roster timeline• Loss of a franchise cornerstone• Difficulty replacing elite offensive production• Fan backlash following recent payroll cutsIf Corey Seager were to approve a move, Atlanta would land one of the biggest trade prizes imaginable, instantly shifting the NL East balance of power and positioning themselves to challenge Philadelphia at the top of the division. For Texas, the return would help stabilize the future but at the cost of star power and identity.Alsi read: MLB trade rumors: Boston Red Sox might sign $116.5 million Arizona Diamondbacks superstar to bolster rotation in Winter Meetings For now, this remains a high-end hypothetical rather than an imminent blockbuster. Still, as long as the Braves are searching for answers at shortstop and the Rangers remain open to restructuring their roster, Corey Seager’s name will continue to hover over the offseason like a spark waiting for fuel.","Atlanta braves are reportedly exploring a trade for texas rangers shortstop corey seager.

Pahalgam: How Terrorists Filmed Massacre Of Tourists, Recced Area After Originally Planning To Target PM Modi's Event

In A 1st, Lashkar Charged As A Legal Entity

Pahalgam mastermind listed as an individual 'terrorist' under UAPA

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday filed a chargesheet in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack case, naming Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)/The Resistance Front (former's front) among seven accused. Sources said the LeT/TRF role was established after the origin of the two messages put out by TRF on its digital media platform, first claiming responsibility shortly after the attack, and the denial thereafter, were traced to Pakistan.The six other accused listed in the chargesheet, filed before the Special NIA court in Jammu, are top Lashkar mastermind and Pakistani handler Sajid Jatt; neutralised Pakistani attackers Faisal Jatt, alias Suleman Shah, who hailed from Pakistan Punjab, Habeeb Tahir, alias Jibran, from Rawlakote in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and Abu Hamza; and arrested Kashmiri locals Parvaiz Ahmad and Bashir Ahmad Jothad, who had harboured the three Pakistani attackers days before the attack.The 1,597-page chargesheet records how NIA, through a meticulous probe spanning eight months, traced the Pahalgam attack conspiracy to Pakistan, ""which has been unabatedly sponsoring terrorism against India"".The links to Pakistan were confirmed by belongings and articles - IDs, M4 assault weapons and chocolates - recovered from the hideout of the three attackers who were killed in Operation Mahadev in July.This is perhaps the first time that LeT has been chargesheeted as a legal entity; earlier chargesheets filed in terror attacks launched by LeT, including the 26/11 Mumbai strikes, had named its top leaders, including chief Hafiz Mohammad Saeed and Sajid Jatt.There, however, are precedents of an 'unlawful association' like Popular Front of India (PFI) being chargesheeted by NIA.""The chargesheet, which details Pakistan's conspiracy, roles of the accused and supporting evidence in the case, has charged the banned LeT/TRF as a legal entity for its role in planning, facilitating and executing the Pahalgam attack,"" NIA said.TOI had on July 29 reported that Sajid Jatt, who leads TRF/LeT operations in Kashmir, had masterminded the Pahalgam attack as part of a closely-guarded ISI-LeT conspiracy to carry out a high-impact attack in Kashmir. Jatt was specifically instructed by ISI to only deploy foreign terrorists for the gruesome targeted killings on religious lines, while ensuring minimal involvement of local Kashmiris.Sajid Jatt, alias Saifullah, born on Sept 3, 1982, and hailing from Kasur, Pakistan, is listed as an individual 'terrorist' under the UAPA. He was the key handler of terrorists who killed five Indian soldiers in Bhata Dhurian, Poonch in 2023. LeT/TRF as well as the four Pakistani terrorists have been charged under provisions of BNS, Arms Act, and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and for waging war against India. Parvaiz and Bashir had, following their arrest in June, disclosed identities of the attackers, confirming that the latter were Pakistani nationals affiliated to LeT. Sources had earlier told TOI that Parvaiz and Bashir were paid Rs 3,000 by the terrorists.",The national investigation agency (nia) on monday filed a chargesheet in the april 22 pahalgam terror attack case.

The 'hero bystander'





'Pouring oil on the fire of antisemitism'









Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday evening saw Australia's deadliest mass shooting since the Port Arthur massacre, when a father–son duo opened fire on crowds at a Hanukkah event.At least 15 people, including a child, were killed as gunfire erupted from a pedestrian footbridge near Campbell Parade, triggering panic among locals and tourists gathered by the Sea.Police said 50-year-old Sajid Akram and his 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram, fired into the crowd from a raised pedestrian boardwalk overlooking the beach.Armed with long-barrelled guns, the attackers shot at people for nearly 10 minutes, triggering panic as crowds fled across the packed beachfront. As shots rang out, some people hid in nearby shops and buildings, while others sought cover behind beach facilities.Sajid Akram was shot dead in a gunfight with police at the scene, while Naveed was arrested and taken to hospital, where he remains in a critical but stable condition under police guard.Social media footage showed moments of bravery amid the terror, including a bystander who confronted one of the gunmen and wrestled a weapon away.By the time the area was secured, the beachfront was littered with discarded shoes, blankets and picnic items, stark reminders of the sudden violence that shattered across a grassy hill overlooking Bondi Beach.Prime Minister Albanese condemned the shooting, saying, “What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of antisemitism, an act of terrorism on our shores,” as he laid flowers at the Bondi Pavilion.The alleged assailants were a father–son duo. The father, Sajid Akram originally hailed from Pakistan, CBS news reported. Police said investigations are ongoing but noted the attack was clearly intended to terrorise Australia’s Jewish community.Sajid, arrived in Australia in 1998 on a student visa, which was converted into a partner visa in 2001. He has since remained in the country on a resident return visa, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said. While Burke did not confirm Sajid’s country of origin, it has been widely reported that he immigrated from Pakistan.His son, Naveed Akram, is an Australian citizen born in 2001. Anthony Albanese said Naveed had come to the attention of Australia’s domestic intelligence agency, ASIO, in October 2019. However, after an assessment, authorities found “no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence.”Albanese said ASIO’s 2019 assessment was triggered by concerns about Naveed’s associations at the time, rather than his own behaviour or character. “The assessment was made because of the son’s associations that he had, at that time, and the investigation went for a period of six months,” he said.According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Naveed was an unemployed bricklayer who lost his job around two months ago after his employer became insolvent.Naveed’s mother, Verena, said he had been actively looking for work. She described her son as quiet and not particularly social, adding that he did not spend much time online. Naveed, who attended Cabramatta High School, enjoyed activities such as fishing, scuba diving, swimming and exercising, she said.Despite his unemployment, Albanese reiterated that ASIO had assessed Naveed as posing no indication of a threat of violence, stressing again that earlier concerns were linked to his associates rather than his own conduct.Hours after the shooting, police found a homemade bomb in a car parked near the beach, saying the “improvised explosive device” had likely been planted by the attackers.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported the attackers had possible links to the Islamic State group. An ISIS flag was also reportedly found inside the vehicle, ABC news said.Police recovered four firearms at the scene and later seized two more weapons from a rented room in Campsie.Naveed’s mother, Verena, said her son last contacted the family on Sunday morning, hours before the attack.“He rings me up [on Sunday] and said, Mum, I just went for a swim. I went scuba diving. We're going ... to eat now, and then this morning, and we're going to stay home now because it's very hot,” she told The Sydney Morning Herald, adding that he said he was in Jervis Bay with his father.She said she could not identify her son in images from the scene. “He doesn't have a firearm. He doesn't even go out. He doesn't mix around with friends. He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he doesn't go to bad places ... he goes to work, he comes home, he goes to exercise, and that's it,” she said. “Anyone would wish to have a son like my son ... he's a good boy.”Amid the chaos, several bystanders rushed toward the danger to help victims. One man, identified by local media as fruit seller Ahmed el Ahmed, was seen in footage confronting one of the attackers.The 43-year-old wrestled a gun from the assailant and pointed it at him as he backed away. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Ahmed’s cousin Jozay Alkanj said his relative feared for his life when the shooting began.“He was very scared [and said] I’m gonna die,” Alkanj recalled. “He said I’m going to die, please see my family [and tell them] that I went down to save people’s lives.”Speaking in Arabic outside the hospital, he said his son was in good spirits while awaiting surgery. “He said he thanks God that he was able to do this, to help innocent people and to save people from these monsters, these killers. He is a hero.”Ahmed’s father later described him as a hero. Speaking in Arabic outside the hospital, he said his son was in good spirits while awaiting surgery.“He said he thanks God that he was able to do this, to help innocent people and to save people from these monsters, these killers. He is a hero.”Australia lowered flags to half-mast to mourn the victims. Anthony Albanese said the government will push for tougher gun laws following the deadly antisemitic terror attack at Sydney’s Bondi Beach, signalling a possible tightening of Australia’s already strict firearms regime.Albanese said the issue would be taken up at a National Cabinet meeting, with the Prime Minister and state and territory leaders agreeing to pursue major changes to strengthen gun control and bring consistency across states after it emerged that one of the attackers legally owned six firearms.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Australia’s government of “pouring oil on the fire of antisemitism” in the months leading up to the attack.US President Donald Trump called it a “purely antisemitic attack.”Mass shootings have been rare in Australia since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, which led to sweeping gun law reforms. However, Albanese said tougher gun laws may now be needed in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack.","At least 15 people, including a child, were killed as gunfire erupted from a pedestrian footbridge near campbell parade.

Bondi Beach attack: What we know





Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is spreading misinformation about the Bondi Beach attack in Sydney, reports Gizmodo. The shooting which killed at least sixteen people at a Hanukkah gathering is one of the deadliest mass shootings in decades. As per the report, Grok has been glitching since Sunday (December 14) morning, responding to user questions with unrelated or sometimes incorrect answers. When one user asked Grok to explain the video showing Al Ahmed – one of the assailants tackling the shooter, the AI responded with an incorrect claim.“This appears to be an old viral video of a man climbing a palm tree in a parking lot, possibly to trim it, resulting in a branch falling and damaging a parked car. Searches across sources show no verified location, date, or injuries. It may be staged; authenticity is uncertain,” the AI chatbot said.But the glitch does not end here. Another instance quoted in the report depicts Grok claiming that the photo of an injured Al Ahmed was of an Israeli hostage taken by Hamas on October 7. In another instance, the AI chatbot described the video showing shoot out between the assailants and police in Sydney to be from Tropical Cyclone Alfred, that struck Australia earlier this year.On December 14, a Pakistani-origin father and son opened fire at Sydney’s Bondi Beach during Hanukkah, killing 16 people, including one of the gunmen. Authorities have declared the incident a terrorist attack, ABC News reported.Police identified the attackers as a 50-year-old man and his 24-year-old son. The father was shot dead by police, while the son was taken to hospital with critical injuries. Investigators said the father legally owned six firearms, which are believed to have been used in the shooting.Officials also said the pair had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group. Two IS flags were recovered from their car near Bondi Beach, with one seen placed on the bonnet, the report states.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called for stronger gun laws, stating, “The government is prepared to take whatever action is necessary, including tougher gun laws.”","Elon musk’s ai chatbot grok is spreading misinformation about the bondi beach attack in sydney.

Roblox on Russia ban





Russia recently banned US gaming platform Roblox stating it was ""rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children"". According to a report by news agency Reuters, several people protested against the ban in the Siberian city of Tomsk. The protestors were reportedly holding up hand-drawn placards reading ""Hands off Roblox"" and ""Roblox is the victim of the digital Iron Curtain"" in Vladimir Vysotsky Park.The publication claims to have seen photos from the protest which showed about 25 people standing in a circle in the snow, holding up placards. ""Bans and blocks are all you are able to do,"" read one placard.Moscow currently bans social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram , WhatsApp and YouTube. Russia's communications watchdog Roskomnadzor announced the Roblox ban on December 13, triggering a debate over censorship, child safety in relation to technology and even the effectiveness of censorship in a digitalised world where children can bypass many bans in a few clicks.The ban can easily be circumvented by using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). As per the report, some young Russians have questioned the logic of a ban if it can be so easily bypassed while others have questioned why there are so few Russian alternatives to the apps which the state has banned.Russia is not the only country that has banned Roblox. The company headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been banned by several countries including Iraq and Turkey over concerns about predators exploiting the platform to abuse children. Some Russian parents and teachers, as reported by Reuters, have said they were concerned Roblox allowed children to access sexual content and communicate with adults.Commenting on the Russian ban, Roblox said it has ""a deep commitment to safety"" and provides ""rigorous built-in protections to help keep users safe"".","Russia recently banned us gaming platform roblox stating it was ""rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children"" several people protested against the ban in the siberian city of tomsk.

"Bill Gates says: For first time in 25 years, number of child deaths are set to rise; but to be clear, it’s not just the US that’s made cuts; it is that …",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-says-for-first-time-in-25-years-number-of-child-deaths-are-set-to-rise-but-to-be-clear-its-not-just-the-us-thats-made-cuts-it-is-that-/articleshow/125978714.cms,"Global child mortality rates are projected to rise for the first time in 25 years, with an estimated 200,000 additional deaths. Bill Gates attributes this grim reversal to significant cuts in foreign aid by the US and other wealthy nations. He emphasizes the next six months are crucial for securing funding and restoring progress in global health initiatives.

""But to be clear, it’s not just the US that’s made cuts. The UK made cuts, Germany made cuts, and it’s that overall effect that’s going to make this a tough five-year time period.""

“In parts of the world like northern Nigeria, over 10% of the kids die before they reach the age of five. In the US, that number would be well below 1%, and that would mostly be difficulties at the time of birth. Malaria’s been a tough one. The US abruptly fired a lot of people and cut off a lot of money in the first half of the year. So that’s where the bed nets were being handed out, the food was being handed out, TB cases were being detected,”

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

“There were sudden and massive cuts — you just can’t deny that’s led to lots of deaths,”

Why Bill Gates thinks next six months is crucial

“I think the next six months will be very important. It’ll be determined what the Congress’ role is in setting the budgets for global health.

It’ll be determined what these new compacts look like. For the poor countries, do they maintain a level of generosity that can get us back on track? Certainly the U.S. commitment to the global fund was a positive data point. They maintained the huge generosity that they’ve had there, which is very helpful to me as I go to the European countries and say, “Okay, this is a one-for-two match construct.

So please don’t cut this.” That helped me get the cuts in those European numbers to be way less than they would have been.”

“They have aging societies. They of course have pressure to increase their defense budgets. All rich countries have very tight budgets. So that’s why I always make it clear this is less than 1 percent of the budget. When you ask somebody in general, they’ll think it’s quite high, like 5, 10 percent. And no, in the U.S. case, it’s never, never reached 1 percent. The big increase in the U.S. that got us up to almost 1 percent was under President Bush, where he saw that people dying of HIV in Africa — That really wasn’t the golden rule to let those people die when the medicines could be so very, very inexpensive.

Now we have a chance because of the innovation pipeline, to do things that can even more effectively cut deaths.”





Microsoft founder Bill Gates' charitable foundation, the Gates Foundation, has come up with a disturbing forecast concerning child mortality numbers. As stated in a Gates Foundation blog post, for the first time in 25 years, child deaths are expected to increase by 200,000, which is a consequence of reduced aid payments to developing countries initiated by the Trump administration and other wealthy nations. However, Gates clarified US is not the only country doing these cuts. In an interview with The Conversation, Gates said:Gates added.he said, noting that this comes after the global health movement was able to reduce child deaths to half from 10 million annually between 2000 and 2025 due to increased resources like vaccines.When asked about whether he has made progress on the funding front and helping US and other governments to understand the impact that they could have, Gates said:Explaining why a lot of countries follow what the US does on multiple ways, Gates highlighted:","Microsoft founder bill gates' charitable foundation, the gates foundation, has come up with a disturbing forecast concerning child mortality numbers. For the first time in 25 years, child deaths are expected to increase by 200,000.

Watch: US conducts strikes on 3 suspected narco-trafficking vessels; video shows 'kinetic strike',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-us-conducts-strikes-on-3-suspected-narco-trafficking-vessels-video-shows-kinetic-strike/articleshow/125994160.cms,"(Screengrab)





The US military has carried out what it described as a “lethal kinetic strike” against three suspected drug-trafficking vessels in international waters in the eastern Pacific, killing eight people, according to US Southern Command.The operation, conducted on December 15 under the direction of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, marks the latest escalation in Washington’s aggressive maritime campaign against what it calls narco-terrorist networks operating in the region.Southern Command said Joint Task Force Southern Spear targeted three boats travelling along known narcotics routes. Intelligence assessments concluded the vessels were actively engaged in drug trafficking and operated by organisations designated by the US as terrorist groups. Three men were killed on the first vessel, two on the second and three on the third, the command said, adding that all those killed were “male narco-terrorists”.The strike comes against the backdrop of a wider US pressure campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, particularly focused on Venezuela. In recent months, US naval forces have expanded their presence in the region, alongside sanctions and high-profile seizures of vessels accused of transporting illicit oil and drugs. US officials say the operations are aimed at disrupting networks that fund armed groups and hostile regimes through narcotics and smuggling.",Us military carried out what it described as a ‘lethal kinetic strike’ against three suspected drug-trafficking vessels in international waters in the eastern pacific.

Former Hong Kong pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai convicted in landmark national security trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/former-hong-kong-pro-democracy-media-mogul-jimmy-lai-convicted-in-landmark-national-security-trial/articleshow/125994085.cms,"



HONG KONG - Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy former Hong Kong media mogul and outspoken critic of Beijing, was convicted Monday in a landmark national security trial, which could send him to prison for the rest of his life.Three government-vetted judges found Lai, 78, guilty of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiracy to publish seditious articles. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.Lai was arrested in August 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law that was implemented following massive anti-government protests in 2019. Lai has spent five years in custody, much of it in solitary confinement, and his family said his health has declined rapidly. He was previously convicted of several lesser offenses related to fraud allegations and his actions in 2019.Lai's trial, conducted in a Hong Kong court without a jury, has been closely monitored by the U.S., Britain, the European Union and political observers as a barometer of media freedom and judicial independence in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.His son Sebastien Lai said the family had expected a guilty verdict, ""but that doesn't make it any less devastating.""""In the 800-page verdict they have there is essentially nothing, nothing that incriminates him,"" he told reporters in London. ""This is a perfect example of how the national security law has been molded and weaponized against someone who essentially said stuff that they didn't like.""His daughter Claire said she dreams of being reunited with her father without being watched over by guards.""But I think what today has proven is that that reunion that I dream of, it won't be through the once extremely promising but now very, very highly compromised Hong Kong legal system,"" she said in Washington where she has been rallying support for her father's case.Court said Lai spent years plotting against BeijingReading from the 855-page verdict, Judge Esther Toh said Lai had extended a ""constant invitation"" to the U.S. to help bring down the Chinese government with the excuse of helping Hong Kongers.Lai's lawyers admitted during the trial that he had called for foreign sanctions before the national security law took effect, but insisted he dropped these calls to comply with the law.But the judges ruled that Lai had never wavered in his intention to destabilize the ruling Chinese Communist Party, ""continuing though in a less explicit way.""Toh said the court was satisfied that Lai was the mastermind of the conspiracies and that Lai's evidence was at times contradictory and unreliable. The judges ruled that the only reasonable inference from the evidence was that Lai's only intent, both before and after the security law, was to seek the downfall of the ruling Communist Party even at the sacrifice of the people of China and Hong Kong.""This was the ultimate aim of the conspiracies and secessionist publications,"" they wrote.His verdict is a test for Beijing's diplomatic ties. U.S. President Donald Trump, who raised Lai's case with China, said he felt ""so badly."" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said his government has made it a priority to secure the release of Lai, who is a British citizen.Lai could face life in prisonLai, the founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, will be sentenced on a later day. He faces up to life in prison.Hearings were set to begin Jan. 12 for Lai and other defendants in the case to argue for a shorter sentence.The Apple Daily, a vocal critic of the Hong Kong government and Beijing, was forced to shut in 2021 after police raided its newsroom and arrested its senior journalists, with authorities freezing its assets.During Lai's 156-day trial, prosecutors accused him of conspiring with senior executives of Apple Daily and others to request foreign forces to impose sanctions or blockades and engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.The prosecution highlighted his meetings with former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in July 2019 at the height of the protests.Lai testified for 52 days in his own defense, arguing that he had not called for foreign sanctions after the law was imposed in June 2020. His legal team also argued for freedom of expression.Health concerns raised during marathon trialAs the trial progressed, Lai's health appeared to be deteriorating.Lai's lawyers in August told the court that he suffered from heart palpitations.His children have said that he lost 10 kilograms (22 pounds) in the past year alone and lost some of his nails and teeth. They also said he suffered from infections for months, along with constant back pain, diabetes, heart issues and high blood pressure.Hong Kong's government said no abnormalities were found during a medical examination that followed Lai's complaint of heart problems. It added this month that the medical services provided to him were adequate.Hong Kong leader John Lee said Lai harmed the fundamental interests of the country, calling his intentions malicious.Steve Li, chief superintendent of Hong Kong police's National Security Department, disputed claims of Lai's worsening health outside the court building.""Lai's conviction is justice served,"" he told reporters.US and UK slam outcome, as China defends itU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the verdict reflected that Beijing's law was being used to silence those seeking to protect freedom of speech. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said her country condemned the politically motivated prosecution that resulted in the guilty verdict, and that it would continue to call for his release. The Foreign Office summoned the Chinese ambassador to express its objections, she said.The EU also deplored the conviction.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said China expressed firm opposition to the vilification of the city's judiciary by ""certain countries,"" urging them to respect Hong Kong's legal system.Various rights groups condemned the verdict.""It is not an individual who has been on trial - it is press freedom itself, and with this verdict that has been shattered,"" said Reporters Without Borders' director general Thibaut Bruttin.But Hong Kong Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the verdict has nothing to do with press freedom.Before sunrise, dozens of residents queued outside the court building to secure a courtroom seat.Former Apple Daily employee Tammy Cheung arrived at 5 a.m., saying she wanted to know about Lai's condition after reports of his health.She said she felt the process was being rushed since the verdict date was announced only last Friday, but added, ""I'm relieved that this case can at least conclude soon.""","Jimmy lai found guilty of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces. He was arrested in august 2020 under a beijing-imposed national security law. Lai has spent five years in custody, much of it in solitary confinement. His family said his health has declined rapidly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125994085,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-11718,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
