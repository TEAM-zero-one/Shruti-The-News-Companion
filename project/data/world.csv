The nuclear engineer who chose the fields: Randip’s journey from special forces to Stanford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-nuclear-engineer-who-chose-the-fields-randips-journey-from-special-forces-to-stanford/articleshow/121741324.cms,"Randip Singh

At 19, Randip Singh stood in an Amtrak station in Albany, NY when a police officer approached him with an unusual request: “Can I see your passport?” He didn’t ask for a driver's license, but a passport. The implication was clear.Years later, Singh would find himself 300 meters away from a 250kg Russian bomb that left a crater the size of a house in the Syrian desert. The shockwave that followed lifted the entire landscape toward him, like something out of a movie.Between these two moments lies a story that eludes categorization: a nuclear engineer who abandoned a promising corporate career to spend 11 years in the Army , including multiple deployments as a Special Forces medic in Iraq and Syria. Now, sitting in Stanford's Graduate School of Business, Singh represents something increasingly rare: someone who chose the hardest possible path to find belonging.“I believe in things enough to give my life for them. That's why I liked the Army; there are people there who believe in causes,” Singh says matter-of-factly during our conversation.Singh's journey began with displacement. Born in America but raised in India after his parents divorced, he experienced what he calls “the outsider view” from an early age.This perspective shaped him through boarding school, through his nuclear engineering studies at RPI in New York, and eventually through his time at General Electric, which he ultimately chose to leave.Singh’s deeper issue was belonging. Despite being born American, Singh felt like an outsider in his own country. The Amtrak incident wasn't isolated; he endured comments like “Hey, Osama, go back to your home”.“When you’re younger, you think that's gonna solve something,” he reflects on his decision to enlist. “I thought serving would create belonging, not because I’m some patriot, but purely from my internal motivation of feeling like I belong in this country.”Singh didn't just join the Army; instead, he sought out its most demanding roles. He became a Special Forces medic, a position that required learning trauma medicine in one year – something that takes more than 5 – while maintaining the physical and mental standards of elite warfare.""They basically combine what an ER surgeon does into one year, along with some dentistry, veterinarian medicine, and internal medicine,"" he explains. ""You learn to do amputations, chest tubes, tooth extractions, and you only get two or three practice attempts. If you can't get it right in three tries, you're done. 70% of people fail.""The training philosophy was brutal but effective. As one Grizzled Green Beret instructor told Singh: “80% of what you do won't affect the outcome of the patient. 20% will build your reputation.""This lesson in accepting what you cannot control would prove crucial when Singh had to make triage decisions in treating victims of an ISIS attack. “Three people died,” Singh recalls, his voice quieting.“There's some amount of fate that you just can't control,” he says. “That was a big insight because until then I had this engineering mindset that I could control everything. Accepting that has made me much happier.”This perspective shapes how he evaluates human potential now. “Most people compare themselves too early to masters,” he observes. “They try to learn golf and immediately compare themselves to Tiger Woods . You discount your own potential because of that.”Instead, Singh values people who can “break problems down and go into insane detail.” In combat, this meant knowing exactly how many meters away a building was, even if it seemed irrelevant. “When someone's life is on the line, I want to know everything.”Perhaps most striking about Singh is his refusal to choose between his Indian and American identities. “I see myself as 100% Indian and 100% American,” he states. “I can choose the good things from both cultures.”This dual identity, forged through displacement and tested in combat, gives him a unique perspective on belonging. The teenager who felt he needed to prove his Americanness through military service now understands that belonging is “your own meditative thing and how you think about it.”At Stanford, Singh is preparing for his next chapter: returning to the energy sector, working on large infrastructure projects. But business school serves a different purpose than mere career preparation.“I lost some confidence in the Army because I was enlisted,” he admits. “I didn't know if I could make strategic decisions. Being here helps me build confidence that yes, I can do that too.”His three core values are autonomy, persistence, and integrity, which were forged through experiences most people never face. His mother’s decision to leave an unsuccessful marriage taught him autonomy. His grandfather’s success as a self-taught machinist to a successful businessman demonstrated persistence. And the Army's unforgiving standards demanded absolute integrity.As he prepares to leave Stanford and return to building infrastructure that powers society, Singh carries with him the hard-won wisdom of someone who chose the most difficult path to find himself. His story challenges comfortable assumptions about patriotism, belonging, and what it means to serve.“I wanted to see a part of human nature you can't see in corporate settings,” he reflects on his Army years. “It's a very raw form of humanity. That experience was worth everything.”In a world increasingly dominated by safe choices and calculated risks, Randip Singh stands as a reminder that sometimes the hardest path leads to the clearest understanding of who you are and what you're capable of.","Randip singh was born in america but raised in india after his parents divorced.

Indian Judiciary’s commitment to justice transcends borders: Justice Kant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-judiciarys-commitment-to-justice-transcends-borders-justice-kant/articleshow/121740803.cms,"Justice Surya Kant

NEW DELHI: Justice Surya Kant of Indian Supreme Court on Monday told the Indian business community in Washington that Indian judiciary understood the problems faced by the Indian diaspora and NRIs and played a crucial role in resolving unique challenges faced by them relating to property, inheritance and custody of children in soured matrimonial relations.Speaking with Indian businessmen from various states gathered under the banner of ‘Washington Telangana Association’, Justice Kant said, “With procedural adaptations and a growing recognition of cross-border complexities, the courts have made justice more accessible to those living abroad. In certain areas, the judiciary has also extended the protection of Fundamental Rights, ensuring that non-resident citizens are treated with fairness and equality under the law. ”“In doing so, it reinforces the message that India’s commitment to justice does not end at its borders, it reaches all those who continue to carry the country in their hearts,” he added.Commending the resilience of Indian diaspora to maintain their identity while continuing to participate in the technological innovations, research and community service in the countries they have made home while exploring opportunities, Justice Kant said the Indian identity thrives in our languages and festivals, but also in our collective commitment to justice, dignity, and mutual respect.These are the ideals that shape not just who we are, but who we continue to become, no matter where we live. ”Commending the role played by the Indian diaspora as ambassadors of India’s rich cultural and constitutional legacy by not only preserving it for ourselves but sharing it with the world, the next CJI said, “In doing so, we honour not only our past, but also our enduring responsibility to shape a future that is united in diversity, grounded in justice, and inspired by the very best of who we are.”“The success of the Indian diaspora is not only measured in individual achievement - though that alone is remarkable. It is also reflected in the collective identity that communities have preserved and passed on across generations. Whether through temples, cultural centres, schools, or community events, the diaspora has cultivated a sense of belonging and solidarity, making the Indian identity one that thrives far beyond national borders,” he said.","Justice surya kant of indian supreme court told the indian business community in washington that indian judiciary understood the problems faced by the indian diaspora and nris.

Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors:

Strategy: Gold and Silver Buy on dips.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates have seen major fluctuations over the last few weeks, ever since the yellow metal prices hit a lifetime high. Gold is seen as a safe haven investment in times of turmoil and uncertainty. The rapidly evolving geopolitical and trade situations have kept gold investors guessing on the direction of gold prices. So, what is the gold rate prediction for this week and what should investors do?Last week, Gold climbed to a near four-week high, while silver surged past ₹1 lakh on the domestic front, driven by a weakening dollar and escalating global uncertainty. Silver posted one the sharpest gains on daily and weekly basis, gaining 2.7% in the previous session, its strongest daily performance in over three weeks, as investors sought refuge amid concerns over the US-China trade deal.The upcoming trade discussions between US and China remains a key event for market direction. The European Commission is also urging the US to reduce tariffs, adding to the broader trade policy uncertainty.Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions intensified with Russia demanding territorial concessions from Ukraine to end the war. On the macro front, weaker-than-expected US manufacturing and services PMI data, coupled with disappointing private payrolls, raised concerns about stagflation.Still, the better-than-expected non-farm payroll data signalled resilience in the labour market, keeping investor sentiment mixed.Silver, after lagging behind gold, saw renewed interest due to improved fundamentals and technical momentum, pushing it to a 13-year high. The Gold/Silver ratio also dropped sharply, signalling silver’s relative strength.ETF inflows into silver added further support, reflecting growing investor appetite for the metal amid continued global economic and political instability. Focus this week will be on US and China CPI data.","Last week, gold climbed to a near four-week high, while silver surged past ₹1 lakh on the domestic front.

Protesters clashed with federal immigration agents in Los Angeles County for a second consecutive day on Saturday, after raids at a Home Depot and a nearby meatpacking plant sparked renewed unrest in the Latino-majority suburb of Paramount. The clashes came just 24 hours after ICE detained over 121 people across the city, prompting protests outside a federal processing centre where agents used flash-bang grenades and what advocates said was tear gas. The Trump administration accused city officials of failing to support enforcement efforts, with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller calling the protests an “insurrection.” Meanwhile, California leaders, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom, condemned the federal crackdown as provocative and politically motivated, even as the National Guard prepared for deployment under a rarely used rebellion clause.Over 121 immigrants were detained in a single day. Protesters hurled glass bottles and fireworks. Law enforcement responded with pepper balls and flash-bangs. At one point, a Home Depot shopping cart was set on fire and melted into a barricade.In Paramount, one of the epicentres of resistance, federal officers used rubber bullets to disperse a growing crowd—many of whom were chanting in Spanish and waving phones in one hand and makeshift placards in the other.Down the street, motorbikes revved between police and protesters like a surreal video game gone wrong. Music blasted, tear gas lingered, and the tension was palpable.Governor Gavin Newsom called the deployment “a spectacle,” arguing that it was not about maintaining order but staging political theatre. “There is no shortage of law enforcement,” he said. “There is a shortage of federal restraint.” The state had not requested troops. It didn’t want them. And yet, by nightfall, they were en route.Trump’s memo referred to the protests as a “form of rebellion.” By invoking the same clause Lyndon B. Johnson once used in 1965 to protect civil rights protesters in Alabama, Trump flipped the script: this time, troops weren’t defending dissent—they were suppressing it.According to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, the country faced an “insurrection.” He posted online, “Deport the invaders, or surrender to insurrection. These are the choices.” Meanwhile, Trump’s border czar Thomas Homan doubled down, promising the ICE raids would not stop. “They’re not going to shut us down,” he said.If that sounds familiar, it should. The Trump administration attempted similar tactics during the George Floyd protests of 2020, but ultimately held back on federalizing National Guard forces. This time, there was no hesitation.In a move not seen since the Rodney King riots in 1992, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that active-duty Marines at Camp Pendleton were on high alert—ready to be deployed into a major US city. The last time this happened without a governor’s request was nearly 60 years ago.The legal justification? “To protect ICE and federal property.” The political context? Midwestern rallies. Red-state donor pressure. And a GOP base increasingly radicalised by apocalyptic narratives about immigration.Trump’s ICE playbook has evolved. Where once the administration focused on “criminal aliens,” it now targets workforces wholesale—garment factories, construction sites, fast-food chains. In just one week, over 2,000 immigrants were arrested per day, many in dawn raids backed by FBI logistics and IRS intel.The strategy is simple: scale. You can goose arrest numbers faster by raiding a warehouse than by sending agents after individual overstayers. Plus, it sends a chilling message to undocumented workers: no place is safe—not even a laundromat.The raids don’t just affect undocumented migrants. They hit American businesses, too. In industries like construction and landscaping, undocumented workers make up up to 20% of the labour force. One Cleveland builder, Gus Hoyas, put it bluntly: “You get rid of these folks, and it’s going to kill us.”Even hospitality is feeling the pinch. Greg Casten, who runs several D.C. restaurants, warned that losing even 10% of his staff would cripple operations. He’s received annual letters from the IRS about mismatched Social Security numbers. But in today’s climate, those letters now feel like warning shots.Employers walk a tightrope. If they suspect a worker is undocumented and act, they risk discrimination suits. If they don’t, they could be next on the ICE radar. It’s a paradox by design—one that ensures maximum fear with minimal due process.As one immigration lawyer put it: “You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t.”In the end, this isn’t just about law enforcement—it’s about optics. Trump knows that workplace raids filmed on mobile phones, protests with burning carts, and National Guard convoys on CNN aren’t liabilities. They’re campaign material.It’s a spectacle that energises the base, demoralises the opposition, and distracts from more complex questions—like why America’s immigration system has remained broken through Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Biden, and two rounds of Trump.What’s happening in Los Angeles isn’t just about California. It’s a test case for the limits of federal authority over states—and the future of sanctuary jurisdictions. Trump’s memo, laced with legalese about rebellion and insurrection, effectively criminalises protest when it clashes with immigration enforcement.That should alarm anyone who remembers what the First Amendment stands for. Or what “checks and balances” used to mean.As the dust settles and the tear gas fades, one question lingers: Is this the beginning of a new federal playbook—or the end of state sovereignty?Either way, America just entered a dangerous new chapter. And Los Angeles is its ground zero.","Protesters clashed with federal immigration agents in los angeles county for a second consecutive day on saturday.

Defence PSUs Bharat Electronics and Bharat Dynamics will co-produce the QR-SAM systems.""The QR-SAM systems can operate on the move with search and track capability and fire at short halts.They are tailor-made to move along with tanks and infantry combat vehicles to provide them air defence in the tactical battlefield,"" an official said.The Army Air Defence (AAD), which performed exceedingly well during Operation Sindoor, in fact, requires 11 regiments of the QR-SAM, even as it progressively also inducts regiments of the indigenous Akash system, which has an interception range of about 25-km at present.The induction of the QR-SAM systems will add to the existing air defence network of the IAF and the Army, which ranges from the long-range Russian S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile systems (380 km interception range) and Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70 km), jointly developed with Israel, to the Russian shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles (6 km), the upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5 km) and the indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (1km-2 km).While the DRDO is also readying the very short-range air defence missile systems (VSHORADS), which have a 6 km interception range, the real game-changer will be an air defence system with a 350 km range being developed under the ambitious Project Kusha.India plans to operationally deploy this long-range system by 2028-2029, with the defence ministry in Sept 2023 approving the AoN for procurement of five of its squadrons for the IAF at a cost of Rs 21,700 crore, as was first reported by TOI.Also read: India aims to deploy indigenous long-range air defence system by 2028-2029","The defence ministry will soon take up the case for a preliminary nod to a rs 30,000 crore proposal to procure three regiments of the new indigenous quick reaction surface to air missile (qr-sam) systems.

NEW DELHI: The multi-party parliamentary delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on late Sunday concluded its high-level visit to the United States, wrapping up the final leg of a diplomatic mission aimed at building international consensus on India’s counter-terrorism stance following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which left 26 people dead.Taking to X as he wrapped up the US visit, Tharoor wrote: “If you are born a hundred times, you will do it a hundred times. I will love my country with all my heart… A Watan. The whole world now knows the truth. We are lovers of non-violence, but only until someone tests that... Jai Hind!”On the final day of the tour, the delegation paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in Washington. Tharoor later posted on X: “It is striking how many world capitals are adorned with statues or busts of the Mahatma, the 20th century’s greatest apostle of peace, nonviolence, and human freedom.”The group, which arrived in Washington on June 3 after stops in Guyana, Panama, Colombia, and Brazil, met with several key American leaders including US Vice President JD Vance, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, senior members of Congress, policy experts, and members of the Indian-American community.Describing the meeting with Vance as “an excellent meeting,” Tharoor said the Vice President was “warm and welcoming and receptive,” and “expressed complete understanding, first of all, outrage of what happened in Pahalgam and support and respect for India’s restrained response in Operation Sindoor.”A US State Department spokesperson said Landau “reaffirmed the United States’ strong support of India in the fight against terrorism and the strategic partnership between the two countries.”Addressing the Centre on Foreign Relations, Tharoor had said India’s actions were targeted at terror infrastructure, not civilians. “We're not interested in attacking Pakistani civilians, ordinary people. This is about India versus terrorism… If you're not prepared to shut down the safe havens or arrest terrorist leaders, then I'm afraid this is the only way we can deal with it,” he said.Referring to Pakistan’s military, he added, “In India, the state has an army. In Pakistan, the army has a state,” accusing Islamabad of manipulating public opinion through conflict. Tharoor dismissed claims of Pakistani success during the brief hostilities that followed, saying, “Two videos came out on social media, both turned out to be from other conflicts in other years, nothing to do with this one.”","The multi-party parliamentary delegation led by congress mp shashi tharoor concluded its high-level visit to the united states.

This fake screenshot of Elon Musk confirming that he took Stephen Miller's wife Katie Miller went viral

Elon follows Stephen Miller back, Katie supports husband







A screenshot went viral on X showing that Elon Musk replied to a post of White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. ""We will take back America,"" Stephen Miller wrote. The viral screenshot claimed Elon Musk reposted it and wrote: Just like I took your wife. The wife in question is Katie Miller, the former spokesperson of the Department of Government Efficiency, who stepped down from her White House role to work full time for Elon Musk. The kerfuffle between Donald Trump and Elon Musk put the husband and wife in a fix, as the husband is one of the most trusted aides of Donald Trump and the wife works for Elon Musk. Before Trump-Musk's fallout, the Musk-Miller fight was the hot gossip from the White House as rumors had it that Katie Miller left her husband for Elon Musk.In the aftermath of the Musk-Trump fallout, Elon Musk unfollowed Stephen Miller on X. While the text of the viral post 'Just like I took your wife' seemed fake, what complicated things was that Elon Musk deleted many a post in the last few days -- especially the slanderous ones including the one in which he accused Donald Trump of being involved with sex-offender pedophile Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide in 2019.Social media users started asking Grok, Elon Musk's AI, whether the screenshot was real and whether Elon Musk indeed made the post and deleted it.Grok said it's possible that Elon Musk indeed posted it and deleted it. Elon Musk had to intervene and deny that he never posted it. ""No, it’s fake ffs 🤦‍♂️ I never posted this,"" Elon Musk posted making this also his first comment about the throuple controversy.In a major development, Elon Musk has started following Stephen Miller on X, and Katie Miller also showed support for the husband as ABC journalist Terry Moran called him a 'world-class hater'. Terry Moran was suspended by the network while Katie took a strong stand for her husband and called for Moran's immediate firing.","A screenshot went viral on x showing that elon musk replied to a post of white house deputy chief of staff stephen miller.

Symbolism and sovereignty: The protest message

Law enforcement caught in the middle





For the third night in a row, downtown Los Angeles became the epicentre of chaos and confrontation as protests against US President Donald Trump 's immigration crackdown boiled over into violence, with police deploying tear gas, rubber bullets, and flashbangs to subdue demonstrators. Protesters set self-driving cars ablaze, blocked the 101 freeway, and clashed with law enforcement late into Sunday night, leaving parts of the city scorched and on edge.The flashpoint came after Trump took the extraordinary step of deploying the National Guard to California without the consent of the state's governor, an act not seen in decades. More than 300 troops arrived over the weekend, with 2,000 authorised and 500 US Marines on standby.Meanwhile, California governor Gavin Newsom told MSNBC that he will file suit on Monday against the Trump administration and called its order ""an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.""By Monday morning, more than 150 people had been arrested in Los Angeles alone. The streets downtown were littered with scorched cars, shattered barricades, and graffiti-smeared buildings, evidence of a city pushed to the brink.The president, awake past midnight, raged on his Truth Social platform, calling protesters ""thugs"" and demanding mass arrests.""Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!"" Trump wrote at 12.16 am.""ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!"" he added minutes later.Trump invoked a rarely used legal provision, citing ""a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States."" Experts say it is the first time since 1965, when Lyndon B Johnson sent troops to Alabama during the civil rights movement, that a president has activated a state's National without its governor's request for domestic law enforcement purposes.California governor Gavin Newsom condemned the move as a ""serious breach of state sovereignty"" and accused Trump of ""manufacturing chaos and violence.""Downtown Los Angeles witnessed hours of pitched street battles on Sunday. Demonstrators pelted law enforcement with rocks, concrete slabs, electric scooters, and fireworks. In return, officers used crowd-control munitions to disperse them. Several vehicles, including at least four self-driving Waymo cars, were torched, their lithium batteries exploding into dark columns of smoke.As night fell, protesters built makeshift barricades. The Los Angeles police department declared the area an unlawful assembly, and officers moved in as flashbangs echoed off buildings every few seconds.The guard was primarily stationed to protect federal buildings, including the downtown immigration detention centre, where many of the demonstrations have concentrated.Among those caught in the crossfire was Australian journalist Lauren Tomasi of 9News, who was hit by a nonlethal round while reporting live. Footage shows an officer raising his weapon and firing at close range, causing Tomasi to cry out in pain and limp away from the police line.""You just f---ing shot the reporter,"" a voice behind the camera can be heard shouting.Tomasi later confirmed she was safe but described the atmosphere as ""volatile and unpredictable.""Despite the unrest downtown, much of Los Angeles continued its usual rhythms on Sunday. A pride parade marched through West Hollywood, music echoed from the Hollywood Bowl, and families gathered for swim meets in the suburbs. But downtown told a different story, one of mounting civil strife and political collision.Many protesters were first- or second-generation immigrants. Waving Latin American flags, particularly the Mexican tricolor, they marched in solidarity with families affected by the new travel ban, which took effect Monday. The ban blocks citizens from 12 predominantly African and Middle Eastern nations from entering the US.While Trump allies cast the flag-bearing protesters as outsiders or agitators, many said the flags were symbols of pride, not rebellion.Los Angeles police chief Jim McDonnell, while initially hesitant to welcome national guard support, acknowledged on Sunday night that ""a reassessment"" was needed.""This thing has gotten out of control,"" McDonnell said. ""We have great cops in Southern California... but the level of violence we saw tonight is beyond anything we anticipated.""As the sun rose Monday over scorched pavement and shuttered blocks, Los Angeles found itself at a historic crossroads—between federal force and state defiance, between protest and policing, between fear and fury. And with more demonstrations, the city's uneasy calm may not last for long.","Downtown los angeles becomes epicentre of chaos and confrontation as protests against us president donald trump's immigration crackdown boiled over into violence.

Are the US and China finally moving towards some trade agreement?

The photo of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg , smiling at the sight of a sandwich, became the flashpoint on social media as people asked whether she was kidnapped at all, as she claimed. The Israeli foreign ministry called it a drama and posted the photo of the crew members of Madleen, the Gaza-bound aid ship -- sitting side by side while an Israeli soldier offered them bottled water and sandwiches. Greta Thunberg was also among them.But the Freedom Flotilla Coalition claimed earlier that the Israeli military attacked and unlawfully boarded the Madleen which was taking aid to Gaza.“If you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by the Israeli occupational forces, or forces that support Israel,” the FFC released a video in which Thunberg said this.When the FFC lost communication with Madleen, it began posting pre-recorded video messages and Thunberg's one was one of them. In a statement, the FFC said Israel had acted with “total impunity” and that the vessel’s cargo, which included baby formula, food and medical supplies was “confiscated.” Israel said it would transfer the goods to Gaza through humanitarian channels.“Israel has no legal authority to detain international volunteers aboard the Madleen,” said Huwaida Arraf, human rights attorney and Freedom Flotilla organizer. “This seizure blatantly violates international law and defies the (International Court of Justice’s) binding orders requiring unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza.”Israel called the ship a 'selfie yacht' and said the ship was intercepted to give the celebrity activists sandwiches and water and to safely transport them to the shores of Israel.S ocial media users trolled Greta Thunberg, pointing out that the climate activist might not have liked the fact that the sandwiches were wrapped in plastic. One said that those were also white bread with no mayonnaise and not even toasted.""Greta is now being held hostage by Jews, who are taunting her with sandwiches possibly containing artificial additives and wrapped in plastic. These brutes are forcing her to smile!"" one said.British broadcaster Piers Morgan called Thunberg an ""attention-seeking narcissist"". ""What an insult to the actual hostages in Gaza who really WERE kidnapped. This stupid stunt is all about your ego, and will make zero difference to the plight of innocent Palestinians caught up in this dreadful war,"" Morgan posted.",Greta thunberg was seen smiling seeing a sandwich while her pre-recorded video that she had been kidnapped was released.

Longtime Silicon Valley investor Michael Moritz said the tussle between Donald Trump and Elon Musk was inevitable as one of them is a medieval monarch and another is a revolutionary. In his column on Financial Times, Mortiz wrote that one man approached the government like a company and the other considers the government his company and Silicon Valley knows which to choose.Calling the eruption between Elon Musk and Donald Trump mortifying for those in Silicon Valley, Moritz backed Musk and said he is right in calling Donald Trump's budget an abomination.""I feel more than a tinge of sympathy for Musk. Unlike others, I don’t believe he threw himself into this battle for personal gain or to wangle deals for his companies. He, like many, was disenchanted with a Democratic party that had lost its moorings, mismanaged California and whose leader, Joe Biden, let vanity conquer virtue. Sadly, he misjudged the character of the man with whom he threw in his lot,"" Mortiz wrote.Elon Musk is undoubtedly the most accomplished business builder of his generation, Moritz said.""But the government is not a company"". Moritz said Musk failed to understand that Trump was more interested in the daily news cycle than in reform. ""Musk is the revolutionary, the president the monarch"".Musk also underestimated the way in which Trump’s ""cabinet and advisers, and all the targets in his crosshairs, were determined to fight him. He was the outsider. They were the occupants of the swamp.""""What is the result of this meeting of company builder and medieval monarch? It’s the opposite of what was promised: a US budget that has ballooned, debt levels that will only rise and crushing interest payments that make the country vulnerable to its largest creditors — Japan and China.""Moritz took Elon Musk's side and said his reputation is now tarnished and his business interests hurt but Donald Trump's family business inked deals for new hotels and golf courses around the world.""One word of advice for those in Silicon Valley who followed Musk’s lead and sided with Trump. Leave. Don’t delude yourself that you are working to make crypto a part of global finance, minimising artificial intelligence regulation, helping start-up companies or protecting the interests of Silicon Valley. You have no sway. You are just cannon fodder,"" Moritz said.",Longtime silicon valley investor michael moritz said the tussle between donald trump and elon musk was inevitable as one of them is a medieval monarch and another is a revolutionary.
