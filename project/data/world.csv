Pakistan’s defence budget hike sparks fiscal priorities debate amid cash crunch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistans-defence-budget-hike-sparks-fiscal-priorities-debate-amid-cash-crunch/articleshow/121400156.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s decision to boost defence spending by 18% to over Rs 2.5 lakh crore in the 2025-26 budget has ignited fresh debate over the cash-strapped nation’s fiscal priorities as economic woes deepen and inflation hits more than 38%.Economists warned the latest defence allocation framed as a response to escalating tensions with India following the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26, mostly tourists, risks derailing economic reforms and squeezing social spending.Cross-border firing along LoC intensified in 2025. In response, Islamabad has vowed to ramp up military preparedness while simultaneously pushing forward with costly hydropower projects.Planning and development minister Ahsan Iqbal identified water security as a strategic imperative, accusing India of “water aggression” through upstream dam projects on rivers shared under Indus Waters Treaty. “We will not allow India to exploit our water resources,” Iqbal said, pledging accelerated work on the $14bn Diamer-Bhasha Dam.Expected to produce 4,500MW and store 8.1mn acre-feet of water, Diamer-Bhasha is still years from completion, hindered by funding gaps and logistical setbacks.Analysts questioned whether Islamabad can sustain simultaneous defence and infrastructure pushes. Economist Dr Kaiser Bengali called the approach risky. “Diverting funds to defence and megaprojects like Diamer-Bhasha could undermine social spending and economic reforms, leaving ordinary Pakistanis to bear the brunt,” he said Sunday.Pakistan’s debt-to-GDP ratio stands near 70%. With a trade deficit of $25bn in 2024 and import cover for barely three months, fiscal space remains tight. Facing a severe financial crunch with foreign reserves hovering at $3bn, Islamabad is under pressure from a $7bn IMF bailout programme that demands strict fiscal controls.Govt denied IMF pressure delayed the federal budget, attributing it instead to PM Shehbaz Sharif’s foreign travel and Eid holidays. Analysts remain unconvinced.“IMF’s oversight is inescapable,” Bengali said. “This budget reflects a juggling act between security concerns and economic survival.”",Pakistan's decision to boost defence spending by 18% to over rs 2.5 lakh crore in the 2025-26 budget has ignited fresh debate over the cash-strapped nation’s fiscal priorities.economists warned the latest defence allocation framed as a response to escalating tensions with india risks derailing economic reforms.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121400180,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-894651,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Citing 'made in India' defence equipment playing a decisive role in precision strikes under Operation Sindoor , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed gratitude to the country's engineers and technicians, and urged people to take a pledge to prioritise products made in the country and boost the ""self-reliant India"" resolve.""Our soldiers destroyed terror bases; it was their indomitable courage, along with the power of weapons, equipment and technology made in India. It also included the resolve of ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ',"" Modi said in the 122nd edition of 'Mann Ki Baat'.The sweat of our engineers, our technicians, in fact, that of everyone... is involved in this victory,” PM said in his monthly radio talk, which he opened with remarks on the success of Operation Sindoor, lauding the valour of the armed forces.During his recent Adampur airbase visit, Modi had said in the last decade, the world’s best technologies had entered the country’s forces and India now not only fought with conventional weapons but also with drones, data and precision technology.Operation Sindoor witnessed extensive use of ‘made in India’ products as Indian forces, without crossing the Line of Control, struck terror infrastructure and eliminated multiple threats. Whether in drone warfare, layered air defence or electronic warfare, the operation marked a milestone in India’s journey towards technological self-reliance in military operations. Effective deployment of made in India BrahMos missile was cited as another key factor in Operation Sindoor.Modi said the entire country was filled with anger and was united against terrorism. He said, “Operation Sindoor is not just a military mission; it is a reflection of the country’s resolve, courage and a transforming India, infusing the nation with a sense of patriotism. It has deeply influenced people, with many families making it a part of their lives.” He cited examples of thousands of people participating in ‘Tiranga Yatra’, marching to honour the country’s armed forces.Modi praised the precision and accuracy with which the forces destroyed terrorist hideouts across the border and called it remarkable. “Operation Sindoor has instilled new confidence and enthusiasm in the global fight against terrorism,” he added. The PM said renewed energy was visible in the country regarding ‘Vocal for Local’. He cited the remarks of a parent, who said, “We will now buy toys only made in India for our children. Patriotism will start from childhood.”“Some families have taken a pledge, we will spend our next vacation in some beautiful place in the country. Many young persons have taken a pledge to ‘Wed in India’... that they will get married in the country itself.

Amid Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigrants, the US Embassy in India has released a strong advisory warning Indian citizens that they could face a permanent ban on travelling to the US in future. ""If you remain in the United States beyond your authorized period of stay, you could be deported and could face a permanent ban on traveling to the United States in the future,"" the post read.This is applicable to Indians who are traveling to the US on their various time-bound visas like work visas, student visas, tourist visas etc which have their own authorized period of stay.Immigration is the most contentious issue of the Donald Trump administration with the president making his intent clear on the very first day in the office in his first executive order. He targeted the Citizensip Clause of the 14th Amendment that granted US citizenship to almost everyone born on American soil. While the executive order is now facing legal hurdles, the administration id deporiting illegal immigrants, arresting them, encouraging them to self-deport.All foreign nations staying the in the US for over 30 days are now required to register with the federal government -- in a new immigration rule change.Two deportation cases involving Indians became very high profile in the last few months. Ranjani Srinivasan,a PhD student at Columbia University, fled to Canada after her visa was revoked for allegedly participating in a pro-Palestine protest, though she said she did not participate in the protest. Ranjani was made an example by the Department of Homeland Security as to how people should deport themselves out of the US to avoid arrest.Georgetown University scholar Badar Khan Suri was arrested for his alleged link with Hamas -- his wife is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former aide of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.

China Upgrading Pak’s Nuclear Weapons? ‘India’s Fear…’: US Intel’s Sensational Reveal

Poll Should politicians be more cautious with their language in public speeches? Yes, they should be more careful. No, they should speak freely.

NEW DELHI: At the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) meeting on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged leaders to refrain from speaking out of turn, as the BJP faces backlash over off-the-cuff remarks made by two party members in the wake of Operation Sindoor and the Pahalgam terrorist attack, news agency PTI reported citing sources.The BJP found itself stuck in a political quagmire after Madhya Pradesh MP Vijay Shah, in a public meeting, made a derogatory remark against Col Sophia Qureshi.The minister was referring to India's offensive against Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack.Later on Friday, the minister, who is facing an SC-ordered inquiry for his comments on Col Sofiya Qureshi, issued a video apology, calling his remarks a 'linguistic mistake'.Five days before the May 28 SC hearing, when the SIT probe is to be submitted, Shah released a 45-second video on X saying he did not intend to 'offend any community', and has ""sincerely apologised to the entire Indian Army , sister Colonel Sofiya and all the countrymen"".This time, the apology was with folded hands and without the phrase: 'if anyone is hurt'. On Monday, SC had dismissed his first apology as 'crocodile tears'.The MP minister has not been seen in public since his May 11 remarks triggered nationwide outrage.While the party remained mum on the issue, another loose comment from Rajya Sabha MP Ram Chander Jangra replenished the opposition's political ammunition to train guns at the BJP.Ram Chander Jangra, who is an Upper House MP from Haryana, speaking at an event, said the women lacked the courage and spirit of warrior women, ""and that is why the death toll was high"".He further claimed that the victims died ""with folded hands"" and suggested that if they had received training under central government schemes, they might have been able to resist the attackers and reduce the number of casualties.","Prime minister narendra modi urged leaders to refrain from speaking out of turn.

We should be able to defend ourselves. No one should be able to conquer us—not even if multiple powers come together.”The magazine noted that this conversation took place before Operation Sindoor at the Organiser-Panchjanya office, ahead of the RSS's Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha scheduled for March 21–23.Bhagwat reiterated, “A virtuous person is not safe just because of his virtues. Hence, virtues should be combined with strength. Mere brute power can be directionless, leading to blatant violence. Therefore, power should be combined with righteousness.”When asked about global human rights defenders’ concern for Hindus facing oppression in neighbouring countries, Bhagwat suggested that support would only come when Hindus demonstrate strength.“As Hindu society and Bharat are intertwined, the glory of Hindu society will bring glory to Bharat. Such a strong Hindu society can present a model for including the people of Bharat who no longer consider themselves Hindus—as they, too, were once Hindus.”“If Hindu society in Bharat becomes strong, then automatically Hindus will gain strength globally,” he asserted.Bhagwat acknowledged that efforts to strengthen Hindu society are underway, noting that progress is “slow but steady.”“Slowly but surely, the situation is evolving,” he said, adding, “This time, the way anguish over atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh has been expressed is unprecedented. Even local Hindus (in Bangladesh) now say — ‘We won’t flee. We’ll stay and fight for our rights.’”","Rss chief mohan bhagwat reiterates need to unify hindu society and build bharat into a formidable military and economic power.

NEW DELHI: The Kerala government on Sunday declared a statewide emergency after a Liberian container ship, MSC ELSA 3, carrying 640 containers, including 13 with hazardous cargo, capsized and sank off the state’s coast, triggering fears of a major ecological disaster.Following a high-level meeting chaired by chief secretary A Jayathilak, Kerala issued a statewide alert, warning coastal districts of potential environmental damage.Fishermen have been asked to stay ashore, and the public has been told not to touch or approach any drifting containers or oil slicks that may wash ashore. “Maintain a minimum distance of 200 metres and inform the emergency number 112,” read the official note.All 24 crew members aboard were rescued, 21 by the Indian Coast Guard and 3 by Indian Navy’s INS Sujata.According to Navy PRO Athul Pillai, the final three were rescued on Sunday morning after the vessel became too dangerous to remain aboard. “If they stayed put more, it was a danger for them,” he said, adding the rescue was carried out amid high winds and floating debris.As per PTI, the ship had 84.44 MT of diesel and 367.1 MT of furnace oil in its tanks.Some of this has already begun leaking into the sea. The fuel is drifting at around 3 km per hour, raising fears it may reach Kerala’s sensitive coastline.The Indian Coast Guard confirmed a “significant oil leak” and has deployed ICGS Saksham, Samarth, and a Dornier aircraft with oil dispersants to contain the spill.According to ANI, the vessel was carrying 12 containers of calcium carbide, a substance that reacts violently with seawater, producing highly flammable acetylene gas. This cargo poses a serious risk to marine life and coastal communities.The Coast Guard, leading pollution response efforts, is operating under the National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan, directly overseen by its director general.Surveillance aircraft with advanced oil spill mapping technology are conducting assessments. “We are fully geared to respond to the emerging scenario,” the ICG said.The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) warned that oil films or debris may appear along coastal areas. “There is a possibility that the containers and the oil can reach the state's coast,” said KSDMA member secretary Sekhar Kuriakose, as quoted by TOI. Locals have been urged to report any sightings to police.Before the ship sank, salvage operations were being planned, but the situation deteriorated rapidly.The vessel, which had departed Vizhinjam on May 23 and was en route to Kochi, began listing dangerously on May 24 afternoon.A Defence PRO confirmed some containers had already fallen into the sea by Saturday evening.The Kerala coast is home to rich biodiversity and is a key tourist destination. Authorities are bracing for the worst-case scenario, especially for districts like Thrissur, Kochi, and Alappuzha, which could face the brunt of the pollution.Authorities continue to monitor the situation closely as containment operations intensify.","All 24 crew members aboard were rescued, 21 by the indian coast guard and 3 by indian navy’s ins sujata.

They’ve gone tit for tat, so hopefully, they can stop now.” “And if I can do anything to help, I will—I will be there.”He added: “We just heard about it as we were walking through the doors of the Oval [Office]... They’ve been fighting for a long time. They’ve been fighting for many, many decades—and centuries, actually, if you think about it. I hope it ends very quickly.” May 8: Just a day after Operation Sindoor was launched, Trump offered a generic appeal for peace

“That’s fundamentally none of our business.” He elaborated: “What Secretary Rubio said and certainly the President has said is we want this thing to de-escalate as quickly as possible. We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally India has its gripes with Pakistan... But we're not going to get involved in the middle of war.” May 9: Vice President JD Vance, during an interview with Fox News, firmly distanced the US from any active role

“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.” May 10: President Trump dramatically claimed credit for bringing about a ceasefire

“I am monitoring the situation between India and Pakistan closely. I echo President Trump’s comments earlier today that this hopefully ends quickly, and will continue to engage both Indian and Pakistani leadership towards a peaceful resolution.” On the same day (May 10), US Defence Secretary Marco Rubio said

India draws red lines, not Washington





India’s strategy vs Trump’s theatrics





India’s Operation Sindoor





NEW DELHI: In the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack and ‘Operation Sindoor’, a major question emerged on the global stage: Did US President Donald Trump mediate a ceasefire between India-Pakistan or was the decision completely bilateral?While Trump made several claims of brokering truce, India made it clear that the decision was bilateral and was made after Pakistan DGMO approached his Indian counterpart.It all started when Trump, in the middle of cross-border tension between India and Pakistan, claimed on social media that the United States had mediated a ceasefire. The announcement triggered a row as it was announced even before India or Pakistan’s official statement.However, from the outset of India-Pakistan tension, the US response was inconsistent.Following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, Washington oscillated between silence and vague commentary. On April 26, Trump brushed aside questions about the crisis, saying, “They will figure out one way or the other.”India, meanwhile, had already set the tone. It had communicated a clear doctrine: any terrorist provocation would invite a calibrated military response. That stance was made evident through ‘Operation Sindoor’—a precision strike campaign between May 6 and 9 targeting cross-border terror and military infrastructure.Speaking to the Times of India, Prof Rajan Kumar of the School of International Relations, JNU, pointed out the difference between informal diplomacy and structured mediation.“In international relations, making a few calls is not considered negotiation or mediation. Mediation requires laying out clear terms and conditions of a ceasefire. Trump’s gesture of reaching out to both PM Modi and the Pakistani leadership was acknowledged, but India responded because the conditions were already conducive for a ceasefire,” he said.According to Prof Kumar, India had powerfully conveyed its red line to both global and domestic audiences. “It had made clear that any terrorist attack would invite a response—limited strictly to terror camps. That message was sent through its military actions and the supporting evidence.”Dr Ashok Sharma, Visiting Fellow at the University of New South Wales Canberra at the Australian Defence Force Academy, speaking to Times of India, criticised Donald Trump’s understanding of the region’s history. “After the Pahalgam attack, he claimed that India and Pakistan had been fighting for centuries. That’s a clear historical inaccuracy—Pakistan was created only in 1947,” Dr Sharma said. “Statements like these expose a serious gap in geopolitical awareness and undermine the credibility of his remarks about mediating a ceasefire. ”Trump’s commentary on the India-Pakistan standoff grew increasingly dramatic as events unfolded. On May 10, he posted on Truth Social:“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire. Congratulations to both countries on using common sense and great intelligence.”However, in India, officials and analysts were quick to push back.“Trump has a bad habit of taking credit for everything,” Prof Kumar said. “He projects himself as a peacemaker—perhaps even eying a Nobel Prize. But in reality, he's far removed from the ground. Despite his claims, there’s been no ceasefire success in Ukraine or Gaza. Even Netanyahu isn’t listening to him, while the US is negotiating with Iran—something Netanyahu opposes.”Prof Pushpesh Pant echoed similar sentiments: “Donald Trump is irrational and unpredictable. Any attempt to interpret his foreign policy through tweets is bound to be misleading.”Later, in another interview, Trump labelled the entire episode one of his “biggest successes,” claiming that tensions had reached near nuclear levels and that his backchannel diplomacy averted catastrophe. Trump continued to make these claims several times in last few days.Adding to the mixed signals, US Vice President JD Vance, who was on a diplomatic visit to India during the Pahalgam attack, took a markedly different line.“That’s fundamentally none of our business,” he told Fox News on May 9. “We can encourage de-escalation, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of a war.”This distancing came as India and the US announced deeper economic ties, with India agreeing to increase US imports, marginalising China. Trump’s camp portrayed this as another win for his “America First” trade policy.A Republican spokesperson claimed, “Trump’s deal-making genius is reshaping global trade.”India swiftly rejected Trump’s assertion that the US mediated the ceasefire or used trade pressure to influence its decisions. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) issued a firm rebuttal:“From May 7, when Operation Sindoor began, to May 10, when military action ceased, there were conversations between Indian and US leaders. Trade issues did not come up in any of these discussions.”The MEA also reiterated India’s position on Kashmir: the only unresolved issue is the vacation of Pakistan-occupied territory.The handling of the Pahalgam aftermath revealed two contrasting crisis management styles: India’s deliberate, policy-driven approach versus Trump’s flamboyant self-promotion.While Washington may have helped facilitate backchannel communication, Indian officials and scholars assert that New Delhi neither sought nor relied on US mediation.The ceasefire was, in the end, a product of India’s strategic clarity, not Trump’s diplomacy.India launched Operation Sindoor on the night of May 6–7, carrying out precision missile strikes on nine terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK), killing over 50 terrorists, including those linked to the Pahalgam attack.The operation targeted key sites including Jaish-e-Mohammad’s base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s headquarters in Muridke. This marked a major escalation between India and Pakistan, resulting in four days of cross-border tensions, including airborne strikes in border states.The strikes followed the April 29 high-level meeting where Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the armed forces “complete operational freedom” in response to the April 23 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.With the military phase of Operation Sindoor concluded, diplomatic efforts are now underway. India and Pakistan are both engaging in outreach to manage global perceptions and prevent further escalation.India has sent seven all-party parliamentary delegations to 25 countries, including United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members and influential global powers. The 10-day mission, comprising 51 political leaders and 8 former ambassadors, is aimed at countering Pakistan’s terrorism narrative and reaffirming India’s zero-tolerance stance on global platforms.","In the aftermath of the pahalgam terror attack and ‘operation sindoor’, a major question emerged.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan considers India an ""existential threat"" and will continue to pursue efforts to modernise its military and develop its battlefield or tactical nuclear weapons to offset New Delhi's conventional military advantage, the US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) has said.In its 'World Threat Assessment' report, which notes India's Operation Sindoor to strike terror hubs in Pakistan and the subsequent escalation in hostilities, the DIA says PM Modi's defence priorities will ""probably focus"" on demonstrating global leadership, countering China, and enhancing India's military power. ""India views China as primary adversary and Pakistan more as an ancillary security problem to be managed, despite cross-border attacks in mid-May by both militaries,"" the report said.China has played a big role in facilitating a proliferation nexus to help Pakistan and North Korea to steadily boost their nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals over the years.Global estimates say India and Pakistan have around 170 N-warheads each, with Islamabad also frequently brandishing its short-range Nasr (Hatf-IX) and other missiles as a counter to New Delhi's conventional military superiority, as earlier reported by TOI.The report says China's nuclear stockpile has probably crossed 600 operational warheads. ""We estimate China will have over 1,000 operational warheads by 2030, much of which will be deployed at higher readiness levels for faster response times,"" it said.Pakistan is modernising its nuclear arsenal and maintaining the security of its nuclear material, and command and control structures. “Pakistan almost certainly procures WMD (weapons of mass destruction)-applicable goods from foreign suppliers and intermediaries,” the report says.Early on May 10, India had struck nine airbases in Pakistan in what constituted some clear strategic messaging before the understanding on ceasing hostilities came into effect in the evening. In particular, the deep precision hits on the Nur Khan and Sargodha airbases rattled Pakistan. Nur Khan in Rawalpindi is located close to the headquarters of Pakistan’s Strategic Plans Division that handles the country’s nuclear arsenal, as was then reported by TOI.The DIA report says Pakistan “primarily is a recipient” of Beijing’s “economic and military largesse”, and its forces conduct multiple military exercises with Chinese forces every year.“ Foreign material and technology supporting Pakistan’s WMD programmes are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China, and sometimes are transhipped through Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkiye, and the UAE,” it says.The report says India is giving priority to advancing its bilateral, trilateral and quadrilateral defence partnerships in the Indian Ocean Region and Indo-Pacific through exercises, training, arms sales and information sharing to counter China’s influence and boost its global leadership role.India will almost certainly continue promoting its ‘Made in India’ initiative this year to build its domestic defence industry, mitigate supply chain concerns, and modernise its military, it says.In 2024, India conducted a test of its nuclear-capable Agni-I Prime medium-range ballistic missile and the Agni-V multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle (multiple warheads on a single missile). “India also commissioned its second nuclear-powered submarine (INS Arighaat) to strengthen its nuclear triad and bolster its ability to deter adversaries,” it says.Referring to troop disengagement in Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh in Oct last year, the report says it “did not resolve the long-standing dispute about border demarcation but reduced some tension still lingering” since the Galwan clash in 2020.","Pakistan considers india an ""existential threat"" and will continue to pursue efforts to modernise its military.

"With Rs 44,000 crore, India to revive minesweepers plan amid China threat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-rs-44000-crore-india-to-revive-minesweepers-plan-amid-china-threat/articleshow/121399040.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has revived its long-pending case for the indigenous construction of 12 specialized warships to detect, track and destroy underwater mines laid by enemy forces to choke harbours and ports, disrupt shipping and maritime trade.Defence ministry sources say the procurement case for the 12 advanced minesweepers or mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for the Navy, at an estimated cost of around Rs 44,000 crore, will soon be placed before the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council for the grant of “acceptance of necessity (AoN)”.The “open tender” or RFP (request for proposal) will then be issued for Indian shipyards to submit their techno-commercial bids. “It will take at least 7-8 years, if not more, for the first MCMV to roll out after the contract is inked,” a source said.The MCMVs are crucial in the backdrop of Chinese nuclear and conventional submarines, which can quietly lay mines, regularly coming to the Indian Ocean Region. Pakistan, too, is rapidly adding to its underwater combat fleet, with eight new Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines to be delivered by China.The Indian Navy, alarmingly, does not have a single MCMV at present, with its earlier six Karwar-class and two Pondicherry class of minesweepers having progressively retired several years ago.The force is making do with “clip-on mine countermeasure suites” mounted on some ships to plug the critical capability gap when it needs 24 MCMVs to guard the country’s 7,516-km long coastline with 13 major ports and over 200 minor ones.Both state and non-state actors can choke harbours and ports by planting underwater mines, which are cheap and relatively easy to use, to blow up warships, merchant vessels and tankers.The acquisition case for 12 MCMVs had begun way back in July 2005, which eventually led to Goa Shipyard tying up with South Korea firm Kangnam to build the specialized vessels. The negotiations, however, remained deadlocked on the costs, technology transfer and build strategy. The Rs 32,000 crore project was finally scrapped by the MoD in 2017-2018.With a displacement of around 900-1,000 tonne, the MCMVs have non-magnetic hulls and high-definition sonars, acoustic and magnetic sweeps to detect marooned and drifting mines. The vessels then use remote-controlled systems like small underwater vehicles to detonate the mines at safe distances.The over 130-warship Navy, of course, played a silent but crucial role during Operation Sindoor earlier this month in dissuading Pakistan from escalating hostilities by forward deploying its aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, warships and submarines in the northern Arabian Sea.The force currently has 60 warships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards, while it will also commission its second 3,900-tonne multi-role frigate built in Russia as INS Tamal at Kaliningrad next month.It also has the initial approval or AoNs for another 31 warships, including seven new-generation frigates, eight corvettes and six stealth diesel-electric submarines. The MCMVs will add to the numbers.The Navy, however, will reach a force-level of just about 160 warships by 2030, given the slow pace of construction in Indian shipyards as well as the progressive decommissioning of older warships, as earlier reported by TOI.","The procurement case for the 12 advanced minesweepers or mine countermeasure vessels (mcmvs) for the navy will soon be placed before the defence acquisitions council.

While the date hasn't been finalised yet, the visit by Lavrov may take place in the third week of June.PM Narendra Modi had reiterated India's invite to Putin for the summit when the leaders spoke after the Pahalgam terrorist attack and the latter had again accepted the invitation. During that conversation, Putin had agreed with Modi on the need for an ""uncompromising"" fight against terrorism and also stressed that the perpetrators and their backers had to be brought to justice.NSA Ajit Doval is also expected to visit Moscow for the 13th international meeting of high representatives for security issues on May 27-29 for which Russia has invited more than 150 countries.While Modi had twice visited Russia last year - first for the annual summit and later for Brics - Putin's upcoming visit will be his first to India since the Russia-Ukraine war broke out in Feb 2022. The summit this year will provide an opportunity for the leaders to review defence and security cooperation, facilitation of mutual energy security, ongoing cooperation to ramp up bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030 and use of national currencies for bilateral settlement.India wants to increase its supplies of goods to Russia for a more balanced trade relationship.The Modi-Putin summit was expected to take place early this year but Putin has remained preoccupied with the Ukraine war and ongoing international efforts to broker peace.

If the spill spreads, it may harm marine productivity, especially during the monsoon - a critical period for pelagic fish breeding and growth. This could have lasting consequences for fisheries,"" George said.Monsoon typically supports high marine productivity, George said, adding that much will depend on how the ship's leakage can be contained. To examine the impact, CMFRI will conduct field surveys, collect samples, and track the spill's movement.A study on the long-term impact of the very low sulfur fuel oil spill (VLSFO) from the site of Wakashio, a ship which sank off Mauritius in July 2020, shows contaminated sediments and mangroves. The study was published in Elsevier's Marine Pollution Bulletin recently, three years after the sinking. This was the world's first major spill of VLSFO since a global sulfur cap took effect from January 2020.Chemical analysis in March 2023 of sediment samples collected from mangroves close to the site of Wakashio's sinking confirmed biodegradation. The researchers have concluded that the mangroves differed in their sensitivity to oil, resulting in the more tolerant species obtaining a competitive advantage to recolonise other systems.In such cases, it is crucial to know locations of the spilled oil and monitor such sites with health checks on mangroves and associated plants and animals.","The sinking of msc elsa 3 container ship in the arabian sea off kochi's coast will have serious ecological impact on marine and coastal ecosystems.

Documentary revisits scandals that reshaped Favre's post-NFL image

Critics question his legacy, but Favre doubles down

NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre is once again at the center of controversy—not for his past on-field glory, but for how he believes he’s being portrayed in the new Netflix documentary Untold: The Fall of Favre. The former Green Bay Packers quarterback has implied that the documentary’s critical tone is less about justice and more about politics, suggesting he's being singled out for his outspoken support of Donald Trump.While Favre hasn’t issued a direct statement about the documentary, his actions on social media are telling. He recently reposted two messages on X (formerly Twitter) that accuse Netflix of political bias, insinuating that the streaming giant is punishing him for backing Trump. Though Favre didn’t write the tweets himself, his amplification of them speaks volumes and aligns with a narrative that he is a victim of political targeting.The Fall of Favre explores two major controversies linked to the legendary quarterback: his alleged involvement in the $77 million Mississippi welfare fraud scandal, and sexual harassment claims from his brief tenure with the New York Jets. The documentary paints a sharp contrast between the public's image of Favre as the “everyman” quarterback and the less flattering reality of his legal and ethical troubles.One particularly damning detail is the $5 million that allegedly went toward constructing a volleyball stadium at the University of Southern Mississippi—Favre’s alma mater and the school where his daughter played. Text messages released in 2022 show Favre asking if the funding could be kept under wraps, fueling public suspicion. Though he hasn't been criminally charged, he remains involved in ongoing civil litigation.The documentary also revisits the sexting allegations brought by former sideline reporter Jenn Sterger, who accused Favre of sending unsolicited explicit content. The NFL fined him $50,000 for not cooperating with their investigation, though no formal action was taken on the allegations themselves.As The Fall of Favre garners attention, so does the political undertone of its reception. “Never meet your heroes,” one interviewee quips, capturing the disillusionment felt by many.Also Read: Tom Cruise leaves Pat McAfee stunned after comparing death-defying stunts to NFL quarterbacks' pressure and precision Favre, however, sees this as more than a reputation crisis—he sees it as political persecution.
