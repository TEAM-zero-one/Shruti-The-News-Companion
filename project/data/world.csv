Poll Do you think multilateral reforms are necessary to address global conflicts? Yes No

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday delivered a pointed message on global conflicts, terrorism and took a veiled swipe at the United States over its stance on Russian oil while stressing the urgency of multilateral reforms.Addressing the G20 Foreign Ministers' meeting, Jaishankar called out the ""double standards"" over buying of Russian energy and said, ""Apart from jeopardising supplies and logistics, access and cost themselves became pressure points on nations. Double standards are clearly in evidence.""As members of the G20, he stressed, nations have a responsibility to “strengthen stability and give it a more positive direction through dialogue and diplomacy, by firmly combating terrorism, and by appreciating the need for stronger energy and economic security.”Speaking on peace and development, Jaishankar highlighted the impact of ongoing conflicts, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza, which have exposed the high costs borne by the Global South in terms of energy, food, and fertiliser security.“Apart from jeopardising supplies and logistics, access and cost themselves became pressure points on nations. Double standards are clearly in evidence,” he said, in an unmistakable reference to disparities in how global powers respond to crises.The minister stressed that while peace enables development, threatening development cannot facilitate peace. He warned that making energy and other essentials more uncertain in fragile economies benefits no one and urged nations to move toward dialogue and diplomacy rather than further complicating matters.Jaishankar also pointed out that in any conflict, a handful of countries capable of engaging both sides can play a critical role in achieving and maintaining peace. “Even as we attempt to address complex threats to peace, the value of encouraging a buy-in from those supportive of such goals should be appreciated,” he added.","S jaishankar delivered a pointed message on global conflicts, terrorism and took a veiled swipe at the united states over its stance on russian oil.

India ‘Of Critical Importance To US’: Marco Rubio After Meeting EAM Jaishankar On Sidelines Of UNGA

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Thursday, in a veiled message to US President Donald Trump, said the world cannot ignore the need for a global workforce, pointing out that many countries cannot meet labour demands from their own populations.Speaking at an event hosted by Observer Research Foundation on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, Dr Jaishankar said, ""This is a reality. You cannot run away from this reality,"" adding, ""Where that global workforce is to be housed and located may be a matter of political debate. But there’s no getting away. If you look at demand and you look at demographics, demands cannot be met in many countries purely out of national demographics. ”The external affairs minister's remarks come as Indian professionals face new challenges under US President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, including a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas. Indians are the largest group using these temporary work permits.Dr Jaishankar further called for a more “acceptable, contemporary, efficient model of a global workforce” that can be spread across a distributed workplace.He said the new model will see different trade arrangements between countries. “We will see, as part of this re-engineered world, we will see countries which will make decisions which they may not have made in other circumstances, countries which today will feel the desire, sometimes even the compulsion, to have new partners and new regions,” he said.The external affairs minister stressed that trade and technology will continue to reshape international relations despite uncertainties. “For all the obstacles and complications that may arise, I also think they will be countered or mitigated… it is easier to trade today,” he said, pointing to smoother physical and digital interfaces, highlighting the success of India’s digital public infrastructure, which he said other countries find more practical than western models.Dr Jaishankar further said that in today’s global environment, countries, especially larger ones, must strengthen their capacities to become more self-reliant. He argued that multi-polarity would not emerge on its own but must be actively built through national strength and experience.","Dr s jaishankar said the world cannot ignore the need for a global workforce.

Yes, more measures required No, current measures are adequate

Here are ten things to know about the incident:

A 32-year-old man from Telangana’s Mahabubnagar district, Mohammad Nizamuddin, who had moved to the United States in 2016 to pursue higher education, was allegedly shot dead by police in Santa Clara, California on September 3. Nizamuddin had first studied at Florida College before joining a private company, where his performance earned him a promotion that eventually took him to California, according to his family’s account. His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, a retired teacher, expressed shock and grief, saying he was informed only recently about his son’s killing, which reportedly occurred weeks earlier in the United States. The family claimed they were left in the dark for nearly two weeks, learning about Nizamuddin’s death only on September 18, when a friend from Raichur, Karnataka, informed them of the tragic news. According to reports, the incident began with a quarrel among roommates over an air-conditioning issue, which escalated into a violent scuffle involving knives before neighbors called police for help. The Santa Clara Police department said its officers responded to a 911 call reporting a stabbing, encountered Nizamuddin holding a knife, and opened fire, which led to him being shot. Police chief Cory Morgan defended the officer’s actions, saying that the shooting likely prevented further harm and may have saved the life of another roommate who had already been stabbed. Nizamuddin’s relatives, however, have raised questions about the speed of the police response, alleging that no proper inquiry was conducted before shots were fired, leaving the family with unanswered concerns. His body remains in a hospital in California awaiting formalities, while his grieving family in Mahabubnagar has appealed to both the Indian government and the Telangana state government to repatriate his remains. Nizamuddin’s father and community representatives, including Majlis Bachao Tehreek leader Amjed Ullah Khan, have urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene urgently and help bring his body back to India so the family can perform last rites in their hometown.

NEW DELHI: The death of Indian techie Mohammed Nizamuddin in Santa Clara, California, has drawn strong reactions, with police describing him as an armed aggressor, his family alleging a hasty and excessive response, neighbours recalling a domestic quarrel that turned deadly, and him alleging workplace racial harassment, including ""wage-fraud, wrongful termination and obstruction of justice.Santa Clara police said they were called to a residence on September 3 after reports of a stabbing, where they found Nizamuddin allegedly armed with a knife after attacking his roommate. Officers claimed he ignored commands and appeared poised to strike again, prompting them to open fire, fatally wounding him, while his injured roommate was hospitalized and two knives were recovered from the scene.The family of Nizamuddin alleged that the shooting ""happened so quickly."" His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, said they were only informed weeks after the September 3 incident.""The account says the roommates had a quarrel -- something about the AC or something in the room -- and in the ensuing scuffle knives were involved. A neighbour phoned the police. When the police entered the room, they asked the occupants to show their hands. One boy complied; the other did not. The police then fired four rounds and the child was shot.It is extremely regrettable that, according to the reports, no proper inquiry took place and the shooting happened so quickly,"" ANI quoted a relative said.The family of the Telangana man has appealed to the external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene in the matter and help bring back Mohammad Nizamuddin's body.Indian consulate expressed condolences and assured ""all possible consular assistance."" ""We are saddened by the death of an Indian national, Mr. Mohammed Nizamuddin, in an incident involving Santa Clara Police. We are in contact with the local authorities & the family, and we will extend all possible consular assistance. Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved family in this difficult time,"" it said.He accused his employer of ""wrongfully"" terminating his employment and continued ""harassment, discrimination and intimidating behavior by the help of a racist detective and team.""""I have been a victim of racial hatred, racial discrimination, racial harassment, torture, wage-fraud, wrongful termination and obstruction of Justice,"" the post on LinkedIn read.","Mohammed nizamuddin, a 32-year-old man from telangana's mahabubnagar district, was allegedly shot dead by police in santa clara, california on september 3.

Positive for global stability Negative for US relations

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has suggested that the Donald Trump administration may be willing to “fix” the additional 25 per cent tariffs imposed on India over its purchases of Russian oil.In an interview with NBC News, Rubio said the US expects European nations to step up their own sanctions against Moscow. “I think it’s important for Europe to impose sanctions, too. Right now, there are countries in Europe that are still buying massive amounts of oil and natural gas from Russia, which is absurd. They’re asking for the US to impose more sanctions, but there are countries in Europe that are not doing enough,” he said.Rubio added that while the US had taken measures against India, “that’s something we hope we can fix.” He further noted that President Trump retains the option of introducing more sanctions on Russia. “At some point, he may have to decide to impose new sanctions. The President has the ability to do more, and he’s considering doing more because of the direction this has taken,” he said.The Trump administration has levied an additional 25 per cent tariff on India, taking total duties on Delhi’s trade to 50 per cent, among the highest globally.Rubio said Trump remained “deeply disappointed” with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s course of action in Ukraine despite their Alaska summit in August. “But let’s remember, he didn’t start this war. He inherited it, and all he’s wanted to do is end it,” Rubio said.His remarks followed a meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “Our conversation covered a range of bilateral and international issues of current concern. Agreed on the importance of sustained engagement to progress on priority areas,” Jaishankar posted on X after the talks.Also read: 'India is a relationship of critical importance to US': Marco Rubio after meeting S Jaishankar; talks over defence, energy & trade Rubio described India as being of “critical” value to Washington and welcomed ongoing trade interactions.

Time and again, the President has been the only leader in the world that can get involved,” he said.India has maintained that its understanding with Pakistan on cessation of hostilities followed direct talks between the two militaries’ Directors General of Military Operations.","Us secretary of state marco rubio has suggested that the donald trump administration may be willing to ""fix"" the additional 25 per cent tariffs imposed on india over its purchases of russian oil.

Latest Agni-Prime test-fired from rail-based launcher,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/latest-agni-prime-test-fired-from-rail-based-launcher/articleshow/124132466.cms,"NEW DELHI: India successfully tested the new-generation nuclear capable Agni-Prime ballistic missile, which has a strike range up to 2,000-km, from a rail-based launcher system for the first time on Wednesday night.With the road-mobile Agni Prime already being inducted into the tri-Service Strategic Forces Command (SFC), the specially designed rail launcher will enhance the operational flexibility, survivability and cross-country mobility of this smallest and lightest among the Agni series of ballistic missiles.“The rail launcher will allow the SFC to launch on the go with a short reaction time, along with reduced visibility to enemy forces. Rail-based launchers, for instance, can escape detection by enemy satellites by hiding in tunnels,” an official told TOI.Moreover, the Agni Prime is a canister-launch missile system like the Agni-V, the country’s most formidable missile with a strike range of over 5,000-km. In such systems, the nuclear warheads are already mated with missiles in hermetically-sealed canisters.Consequently, the canisters can be stored for longer periods without adverse weather impact, are easier to handle, and can be swiftly transported through rail or road to launch from wherever required.On Wednesday night, DRDO and SFC conducted the test of the solid-propellant fueled Agni Prime “under a full operational scenario” from the rail launcher “having the capability to move on the country’s rail network without any pre-conditions”, the defence ministry said.The missile trajectory was tracked by various ground radar stations and met all mission objectives. “This successful flight test has put India in the group of select nations which have developed canisterised launch systems from on the move rail network,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.An official, in turn, said, “The system is self-sustained and is equipped with all independent launch capability features, including the state-of-the-art communication systems and protection mechanisms.”The Agni-Prime, which incorporates new propulsion systems and composite rocket motor casings as well as advanced navigation and guidance systems, will gradually replace the Agni-I (700-km) and Agni-2 (2,000-km) in the arsenal of SFC, which also has the Prithvi-2 (350-km), Agni-3 (3,000-km), Agni-4 (4,000-km) and Agni-5 ballistic missiles.While fighters like Sukhoi-30MKI, Mirage-2000, Jaguar and Rafale can deliver nuclear gravity bombs, India is also working towards strengthening its naval leg of the `nuclear triad’ – the ability to launch nukes from the land, air and sea.The commissioning of India’s third SSBN (nuclear-powered submarine armed nuclear ballistic missiles) as INS Aridhaman will now take place early next year after some delay. The first two SSBNs, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, are already fully operational.With a displacement of 7,000-tonne, the third SSBN is slightly larger than the first two and will be able to carry more K-4 missiles with a strike range of 3,500-km.While a fourth submarine is under construction under the secretive advanced technology vessel (ATV) project, there is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones, as reported by TOI earlier.",India successfully tested the new-generation nuclear capable agni-prime ballistic missile from a rail-based launcher system for the first time on wednesday night.

Poll Which factor do you think is the most critical in maintaining IAF's combat readiness? Timely delivery of fighter jets Successful weapon trials and testing

NEW DELHI: The largest-ever contract worth Rs 66,500 crore for 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters is now all set to be inked with Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), though the IAF is yet to get even the first such `improved’ jet of the 83 ordered earlier for Rs 46,898 crore in Feb 2021.The mega 97-jet contract for the fourth-generation Tejas could be inked as early as Thursday, a day ahead of the retirement of 36 old MiG-21s that will drag down the IAF to its all-time low of 29 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets), defence sources told TOI.Pakistan, in contrast, is cruising close behind with 25 fighter squadrons, and will get at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation Chinese stealth jets in the near future. China, of course, is leagues ahead, with more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India.After Operation Sindoor, which saw Pakistan use Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles with ranges over 200-km, an IAF internal assessment has held it will need far more than even its “authorized” 42.5 fighter squadrons to tackle the collusive and fused threat from its adversaries.The IAF has repeatedly set the alarm bells ringing over the excruciatingly slow development saga of the single-engine Tejas fighters, stressing that operational preparedness cannot be sacrificed at the altar of `atmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) endlessly. Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself said IAF is “very badly off in numbers” and needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready.All the 83 Tejas Mark-1A jets under the 2021 contract were to be delivered in the Feb 2024-Feb 2028 timeframe. The PM-led cabinet committee on security approved the acquisition of another 97 such jets on Aug 19 this year.“The IAF was insistent the new contract should not be inked before deliveries of the earlier 83 jets begin, with HAL being held accountable. The defence ministry, however, must spend its budget within specified timelines…the initial payment will go to HAL once the contract is signed,” a source said.HAL, on its part, contends it will be able to deliver the first two of the 83 Tejas jets in Oct. Deliveries of the 99 GE-F404 turbofan engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, now appear to be stabilizing, an official said.GE has delivered three engines till now, with another seven slated by Dec.

For the 97-jet deal, HAL will ink another deal with GE for 113 more such engines for $1 billion, as earlier reported by TOI.The IAF, however, wants to accept the first two fighters only if the ongoing firing trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs from them are successfully completed and properly certified.“The weapon trials and integration with the Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system will take time.

Poll Should countries prioritize relationships with allies like Ukraine over energy imports? Yes, alliances are more important No, energy needs come first

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said in an interview to Fox News that he thinks ""India is mostly with us"" and that he hopes US President Donald Trump will be able to convince New Delhi to stop purchasing Russian oil.""Yes, we have these questions with energy, but I think that President Trump can manage it with Europeans, make more close and strong relations with India,"" Zelenskyy said.

Antonio Brown slams Charlie Kirk coin proposal and demands focus on Epstein files

Antonio Brown says real issues are being sidelined

Fans echo frustration with political priorities

Antonio Brown has turned his attention from football fields to Capitol Hill debates, blasting lawmakers over a proposed Charlie Kirk silver coin. The former NFL star called the idea “the dumbest” distraction, arguing that Congress is avoiding bigger issues. Brown insists the real priority should be releasing the Epstein files, a demand echoing public frustration.Antonio Brown, the outspoken former NFL star, is once again making headlines—this time for calling out lawmakers over a bizarre new proposal. Reports surfaced that legislation is being filed in the U.S. House to mint 400,000 silver dollar coins in 2026 featuring conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.The planned coins would reportedly include the phrase “well done, good and faithful servant” on one side, with Kirk’s face on the other. The proposal even goes so far as to designate them as legal tender.Brown, who has built a reputation for sharp and sometimes controversial social commentary, wasted no time responding on X (formerly Twitter). He mocked the idea with a pointed message: “They’re doing literally the dumbest sh*t you can possibly think of just to avoid releasing the Epstein files 😂”For Brown, the coin legislation isn’t just unnecessary—it’s a distraction from something much larger.His call to release the Epstein files highlights a broader public frustration over government transparency. Many Americans believe these documents could reveal powerful names tied to one of the most infamous scandals of the last decade.Brown’s reaction taps into this sentiment, questioning why lawmakers spend time on symbolic gestures rather than addressing issues that could expose corruption and deliver long-awaited accountability.Brown’s comments struck a chord online, with many echoing his concerns that Washington often focuses on political theater rather than substantive action. To his critics, the coin proposal seems like an odd attempt to elevate a media figure while ignoring pressing matters.Also Read: Antonio Brown slams late-night shows such as The Daily Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live for political bias in viral post By turning the spotlight back to the Epstein files, Antonio Brown not only mocked the legislation but also amplified a conversation that continues to resonate with the public. His trademark bluntness may ruffle feathers, but it reflects a growing impatience with how priorities are set in the nation’s capital.","Former nfl star antonio brown calls out lawmakers over proposed charlie kirk silver coin.

Travis Decker dead? US Marshals declare army veteran who 'killed' 3 daughters deceased; DNA test awaited,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/travis-decker-dead-us-marshals-service-declares-suspected-child-killer-deceased-sheriff-awaits-dna-confirmation/articleshow/124102287.cms,"



The US Marshals Service has declared Travis Decker, the 32-year-old Army veteran accused of murdering his three daughters, deceased. But Chelan County authorities said on Wednesday that confirmation of his death is still pending DNA results.In a filing this week, federal prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss the case and quash Decker’s arrest warrant. “The United States Marshals Service has advised the Defendant TRAVIS CALEB DECKER is deceased,” the document said. US Attorney S Peter Serrano confirmed the motion followed the Marshals Service’s advice.Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison pushed back on the timing of the declaration, calling it premature. “We are currently awaiting DNA test results from the state Crime Lab, which are expected to be returned within the next few days,” his office said. “Once the DNA results are confirmed, the Chelan County Sheriff’s Office will hold a press conference to share findings and address any questions from the media and public. ”Skeletal remains believed to be Decker’s were found last week on Grindstone Mountain at an elevation of 4,000 feet.They were discovered with personal items including clothing, a bracelet, and chewing tobacco. Coroner Wayne Harris said his office must rely on scientific confirmation. “Other agencies can speak about their investigation into Mr. Decker and locating human remains, and can state that based on circumstantial evidence that the remains located are his,” Harris said. “The Chelan County Coroner’s Office does not have that luxury. We must rely on scientific methods to establish positive identification.”Decker had been on the run since June, when the bodies of his daughters — 9-year-old Paityn, 8-year-old Evelyn and 5-year-old Olivia — were discovered at a campground near Leavenworth. Investigators said the girls had been bound with zip ties, suffocated with plastic bags, and their deaths ruled as homicides.The discovery of remains came after a drone search spotted a shirt consistent with what Decker was last seen wearing. Morrison said all signs indicate Decker died in that location some time ago.Arianna Cozart, attorney for Decker’s ex-wife Whitney, said in a statement last week: “We are praying that the remains found are confirmed to be Travis’s. We continue to be grateful for law enforcement’s efforts in this case and are forever appreciative of the entire world’s love, compassion, and support for Whitney.”Decker, a former infantryman who served in Afghanistan, was known to have survival skills and lived out of his truck at times. The manhunt for him became the largest in Chelan County’s history.The US Marshals Service had previously offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his capture.","The us marshals service has declared travis decker, the 32-year-old army veteran accused of murdering his three daughters, deceased.

Airspace violation: Norad scrambles jets to intercept Russian bombers near Alaska; claims activity ‘occurs regularly’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/airspace-violation-norad-scrambles-jets-to-intercept-russian-bombers-near-alaska-claims-activity-occurs-regularly/articleshow/124126044.cms,"Representative photo (AP)

Poll Do you believe the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) is effective in ensuring national security? Yes, it is effective. No, it could be improved.





The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled fighter jets on Wednesday to intercept four Russian military aircraft detected near Alaska, the US-Canadian defense organization said Thursday.Norad tracked two Tu-95 long-range strategic bombers and two Su-35 advanced fighter jets operating in the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). In response, the command deployed an E-3 surveillance aircraft, four F-16 fighter jets, and four KC-135 tanker planes to monitor and identify the Russian planes.""The Russian military aircraft remained in international airspace and did not enter American or Canadian sovereign airspace. This Russian activity in the Alaskan ADIZ occurs regularly and is not seen as a threat,"" Norad stated.Norad noted that the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) starts at the edge of US and Canadian airspace.Last month, Norad detected a Russian IL-20 COOT in the zone and responded with an E-3 surveillance plane, two F-16 fighters, and two KC-135 tankers to intercept and identify the aircraft.The Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone is an international airspace where all aircraft must be readily identified to ensure national security.Norad’s announcement on Thursday comes amid accusations that Russia has violated the airspace of Estonia and Poland, both Nato member states.During a UN summit on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump stated that Nato countries should shoot down Russian planes that violate their airspace. Asked by a reporter if they should take such action, Trump replied, “yes, I do,” while meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid escalating tensions over the Ukraine war.NATO scrambled jets last week after three Russian MiG-31s briefly entered Estonian airspace, prompting Estonia to seek a UN Security Council meeting. Earlier, Poland reported repeated Russian drone incursions, calling them an ""act of aggression,"" though Trump has suggested the Polish incidents may have been accidental.","Norad tracked two tu-95 long-range strategic bombers and two su-35 advanced fighter jets.
