PM reply unlikely

NDA allies

want Sindoor debate to highlight govt achievements

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Sunday expressed its readiness to discuss all “important issues” in the monsoon session of Parliament raised by opposition parties, including Operation Sindoor and repeated claims by US President Donald Trump that he had facilitated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan.At the customary floor leaders’ meeting ahead of the session beginning on Monday, opposition raised various issues, including voter rolls revision in Bihar, “lapses” leading to the Pahalgam attack and Trump’s claims.“We are very open to a discussion... These are issues of great national importance. Govt is not shying away and will never shy away, but is open to discussions within rules and conventions,” parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said following the meeting chaired by Union minister J P Nadda.Sources said that there was no assurance about a discussion on the special intensive revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls in Bihar, about which opposition parties have been vocal and critical of Election Commission.Centre’s “reluctance” to discuss EC’s role on the floor of the House also stems from the fact that NDA partners, including JDU, have not raised questions about the Bihar SIR after their own surveys found no irregularities.JDU’s Sanjay Kumar told reporters there were reports that people did not have any issue with the SIR.Normally, defence minister Rajnath Singh, who is deputy leader of Lok Sabha, chairs the floor leaders’ meeting, but he was reportedly unwell and skipped the meeting attended by 54 members from different parties and independent MPs.“We have noted all the points. We have requested all parties to ensure Parliament functions properly. We have to ensure coordination. It is responsibility of all to help Parliament function,” Rijiju said, adding that govt would reply appropriately whenever a discussion takes place on Trump’s ceasefire claims.Although Centre indicated its willingness to respond to Trump’s claims, it will be walking a tightrope. Govt will need to be careful in its response, considering Trump’s position, to ensure that bilateral relations, especially at a time when they are on the verge of signing a trade treaty, remain unaffected.INDIA bloc insisted PM Narendra Modi should respond on the US president’s “ceasefire” claims and the SIR in Bihar. Sources said the PM is unlikely to respond in Parliament on these issues, and the respective ministers will present govt’s point of view.Sources said even BJP’s allies want a discussion on Operation Sindoor to highlight govt’s achievements after all-party delegations visited various nations.At the meeting, Congress’s deputy leader in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi demanded a discussion on “lapses” that led to Pahalgam attack, Operation Sindoor, statements by J&K LG, Chief of Defence Staff, Deputy Chief of Army Staff, and Trump’s claims. Other opposition parties also raised these issues.","Opposition raised various issues, including voter rolls revision in bihar, “lapses” leading to the pahalgam attack and trump’s claims. “we are very open to a discussion... These are issues of great national importance. Govt is not shying away, but is open to discussions within rules and conventions,” kiren rijiju said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122802711,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-127290,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
'Need to cooperate ...': Shashi Tharoor answers question on 'loyalty' amid Congress rift buzz; quotes Nehru,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/need-to-cooperate-with-other-parties-shashi-tharoors-nation-first-message-amid-congress-rift-buzz-quotes-nehru/articleshow/122793668.cms,"Poll Should national interest take precedence over party loyalty in politics? Yes, national interest should come first No, party loyalty is more important

NEW DELHI: ""Who lives if India dies?"" Congress MP Shashi Tharoor invoked Jawaharlal Nehru ' s famous words while responding to a high school student's question about party loyalty at an event in Kochi on Saturday.The Thiruvananthapuram MP, who has been facing criticism within the Congress, affirmed that national interests must transcend party lines.""Politics is, unfortunately or otherwise, in any democracy, about competition. And as a result, when people like me say that we respect our parties—we have certain values and convictions that keep us in our parties—but we need to cooperate with other parties in the interests of national security,"" the Thiruvananthapuram MP added.Tharoor emphasized that, for him, the nation comes first and parties are merely a means of improving the country.""The question you asked—sometimes parties feel that this is disloyalty to them, and that becomes a big problem. Which is your first loyalty? To my mind, the nation comes first. Parties are a means of making the nation better. So to my mind, whichever party you belong to, the objective of that party is to create a better India in its own way.Now, parties have every right to disagree about the best way of doing that—the best way of making a better India. """"In our Parliament today, there are 46 political parties. There must be some issues on which they all unite. That's certainly my passionate conviction. A lot of people have been very critical of me because of the stand I've taken—supporting our armed forces and our government over what happened recently in our country and on our borders. But I will stand my ground because I believe this is the right thing for the country. And when I speak of India, I speak for all Indians, not just those who may like my party,"" he said.Sharing his interaction with the student, Tharoor noted that while he's been avoiding political discussions, he felt compelled to address a student's question.""In Kochi today, I was asked inevitable question by a high school student. While I have been steering clear of such political discussions in public, I felt a student deserved a response,"" he said in his post on X.The friction between Tharoor and the Congress leadership intensified following his role in Operation Sindoor and his leadership of an all-party delegation to the United States to present India's position on Pakistan and terrorism. His article praising Modi's ""energy"" and ""dynamism"" in diplomatic affairs, which was later shared by the Prime Minister's Office, further strained relations with his party.Tharoor’s relationship with the Congress leadership has been under strain since he contested the party president election against Mallikarjun Kharge. The friction reportedly intensified when his name did not appear on the list of Congress leaders suggested for the Union government's Operation Sindoor outreach.Despite this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi later invited Tharoor to lead a delegation to the United States and other countries in the Americas. Tharoor's public statements, including those interpreted as favourable towards the Prime Minister, have also caused discomfort within the Congress’s Kerala unit.The rift came into sharper focus following his recent remarks and social media posts that appeared to challenge the party’s leadership.Tensions further escalated after Tharoor praised PM Modi’s diplomacy during Operation Sindoor in an article describing his “energy” and “dynamism” as assets for India’s global standing. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) shared the piece, triggering questions about Tharoor’s loyalty. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge indirectly rebuked him, suggesting that his praise for PM Modi was inappropriate.""We say nation first, but some consider Modi first, country later. What can we do about that?"" Kharge said. Tharoor, however, clarified that his remarks reflected national interest—not support for the BJP.",The thiruvananthapuram mp affirmed that national interests must transcend party lines. Tharoor’s relationship with the congress leadership has been under strain since he contested the party president election against mallikarjun kharge.

NEW DELHI: The new alternative 130-km road to the country's strategically located Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) military outpost in eastern Ladakh is now in the final stages of construction in the forbidding high-altitude region, with the entire stretch likely to be fully operational by Oct-Nov next year.The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has been working hard to complete this much-needed alternative road to the crucial sector - which includes Depsang Plains where Indian and Chinese troops disengaged in Oct last year - from Sasoma in the Nubra Valley through Saser Brangsa to the DBO outpost, as reported by TOI earlier. DBO, which includes an advance landing ground (ALG) at an altitude of 16,614 feet, overlooks the Karakoram Pass and is just a few km from the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the China-occupied Aksai Chin region.All connectivity work from Sasoma to Saser Brangsa on the new road, including black-topping, and around 60%-70% of it eastwards towards Murgo and Gapshan has been completed by BRO, said sources.""Some heavy military equipment, including artillery guns like Bofors, have been moved on the completed stretches to test their load-carrying capacity.

A seven-km tunnel under Saser La (La means pass), which is at an altitude of 17,660 feet, is also planned for all-weather connectivity.The People's Liberation Army will not be able to easily track military movements on the new road, unlike the existing 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road that runs almost parallel to the LAC before ending around 20 km short of the Karakoram Pass.

It also works both ways, not only can foreign visitors drive in the UAE with their national licenses, but UAE citizens can also use or exchange their driving licenses abroad in partner countries.The Ministry’s framework distinguishes between two key processes: recognition and exchange, each with specific conditions and target users.This applies to non-residents or visitors in the UAE. Under the recognition policy, visitors can drive using their national driving licenses during their stay, provided they are not in the country for residency purposes, no additional tests or local license are required.This applies to residents of the UAE who hold a valid foreign driving license. They are allowed to exchange their national licenses for a UAE driving license upon meeting specific requirements, with no need for theory or road tests. This exchange is valid only after obtaining a UAE residence permit.Both recognition and exchange options apply to vehicle categories, typically motorcycles and light vehicles, which vary by nationality and are enabled through mutual agreements or memoranda of understanding (MoUs) between the UAE and the respective countries.Depending on whether an individual is visiting or residing in the UAE, different requirements apply:To drive in the UAE using a national license:The license must cover the vehicle type, typically motorcycles and light vehicles, which vary by nationalityTo exchange a foreign license for a UAE license:The updated list includes 52 countries whose citizens are now permitted to either use their national licenses in the UAE during visits or exchange them for a UAE license upon acquiring residency. These include:It’s important to note that South Korean citizens can only exchange their driving licenses for a UAE license after becoming residents. They are not allowed to use their national license for driving in the UAE while visiting.This policy update offers significant benefits for both visitors and residents:For UAE Citizens Abroad: The system is reciprocal. Emirati nationals can use their UAE driving licenses in countries with mutual recognition agreements.

China on Saturday started building a major dam on the Brahmaputra river in southeastern Tibet near border with India. Chinese Premier Li Qiang attended the groundbreaking ceremony, news agency AFP reported citing local media.The project was approved by Beijing in December and is being linked to China’s carbon neutrality targets and development goals in the Tibet region.""The electricity generated will be primarily transmitted to other regions for consumption, while also meeting local power needs in Tibet,"" China’s official news agency Xinhua reported after the ceremony in Nyingchi, a region close to Arunachal Pradesh.The construction will involve five hydropower stations, with an estimated investment of 1.2 trillion yuan (around $167 billion), according to Xinhua.Once completed, the dam is expected to generate more electricity than the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, raising concerns in downstream countries, India and Bangladesh. Experts have said the project could affect the water flow and ecology of the Brahmaputra river system.India had raised concerns about the project earlier this year. In January, the ministry of external affairs said, ""China has been urged to ensure that the interests of the downstream states of the Brahmaputra are not harmed by activities in upstream areas.""China had responded saying the dam over the Yarlung Tsangpo ( the Tibetan name for Brahmaputra river) would not cause any “negative impact” downstream.Environmental groups have also flagged the impact of such large projects in the ecologically sensitive Tibetan plateau, warning that it could lead to irreversible changes in the region.",China on saturday started building a major dam on the brahmaputra river in southeastern tibet near border with india.

Who is Lauren Southern?

This Is Not Real Life

A business trip that turned into a nightmare

“He carried me out of the club”: A night Southern says she can’t forget

“He asked me to sleep beside him. I said yes. I was incredibly intoxicated,”

“I tried to fight back. He repeatedly strangled me every time I regained enough consciousness,”

Silent for years, now ready to speak

Lauren Southern isn’t new to controversy, but her latest revelation has stunned even her fiercest critics. The Canadian ex-political YouTuber, once known for her controversial far-right commentary, is now the woman accusing Andrew Tate of sexual assault in a shocking new memoir. The revelation, published Monday, has rocked both internet culture and conservative circles.Lauren Southern, now 29, rose to prominence in the mid-2010s as a loud, unapologetic voice in right-wing politics. Known for her viral YouTube videos, Southern took on feminism, mass immigration, and “mainstream media lies” while amassing a loyal fanbase.In 2018, however, she abruptly stepped away from the public eye. Southern claimed burnout and ideological disillusionment—but now, her latest bookoffers another reason: trauma.According to Southern, the incident happened in 2018 when she was 22. She had traveled to Romania with British political figure Tommy Robinson to pitch a media project to Andrew and Tristan Tate. What began as a seemingly routine meeting at a Bucharest restaurant spiraled quickly.Southern describes how, after dinner, the Tates suggested going back to their place for a work-related chat. Instead, they took her to a nightclub.She recalls drinking a cocktail and a shot, then blacking out almost entirely.She says Tate carried her from the club, placed her into a car, and took her back to her hotel.Southern alleges that Andrew Tate carried her out of the nightclub and back to her hotel room. What happened next, she says, was not just unwanted, but violent.she said.She recounts initially responding to a kiss before saying “no” multiple times when Tate tried to escalate things. That’s when, according to Southern, he placed his arm around her neck and began strangling her unconscious, again and again.she continued in the memoir.Southern explains she didn’t come forward earlier out of fear. Her brand as an anti-feminist commentator, she admits, made her feel like admitting victimhood would destroy her credibility.She also says police in the UK redirected her to Romanian authorities, something she wasn’t prepared to face at the time.Andrew Tate has not responded to the claims as of now. His legal team remains silent. But with 10 ongoing criminal charges against him and mounting scrutiny, Lauren Southern’s voice has added a deeply personal, haunting layer to an already global story.","Lauren southern is the woman accusing andrew tate of sexual assault in a shocking new memoir.

H-1B: Lottery versus weighted selection process







The Donald Trump administration is considering introducing a new process for H-1B hiring under the capped part of the system. The Department of Homeland Security sent the proposal to the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for review. The capped part of the system means the statutory cap decided by Congress for every year. The cap is 85,000 slots, including 20,000 reserved for workers who have a master's degree.Universities and research institutions are eligible for cap-exempt visas.For 2026, the USCIS has already closed the process as they announced Friday that enough petitions had been submitted to reach the annual cap, which means there will be no lottery for FY 2026.In the present system, there's a random lottery each year for visas subject to the cap. After the lottery, employers with winning entries submit petitions to sponsor workers who will join their companies around October.In Donald Trump's first term, the DHS came up with a selection process based on the wage offered for a position instead of the random lottery so that companies hire more high-skilled workers instead of filling their positions with low-wage foreign workers.That rule, one of several offered as part of a “Buy American, Hire American” initiative, was later shelved by the Biden administration in 2021. The draft regulations drew more than 1,000 public comments, including many that argued it would drastically reduce the number of available H-1B workers, Bloomberg reported.The lottery system was brought in so that no company or applicant would get any favor. But larger companies can apply for more visas resulting in such companies getting more H-1Bs.In January, the Institute for Progress, a nonpartisan think tank examining innovation policy, floated the idea of eliminating the H-1B lottery. It argued that the economic value of the visa program could be increased by 88 per cent of applicants were evaluated based on seniority or salary.","No lottery for h-1b?

Yes, the public deserves clarity No, it may hinder the process

NEW DELHI: Following a barrage of reports in the western media that have squarely blamed AI 171 captain for switching off fuel supply to the doomed Air India Dreamliner leading to its June 12 crash, the American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has now termed those articles “premature and speculative. ”In a statement, NTSB chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said: “Recent media reports on the Air India 171 crash are premature and speculative. India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) just released its preliminary report. Investigations of this magnitude take time. We fully support the AAIB’s public appeal, which was released Thursday, and will continue to support its ongoing investigation. All investigative questions should be addressed to the AAIB. ”The appeal comes after AAIB on Thursday called out “irresponsible” drawing of “conclusions through selective and unverified reporting.” The bureau had issued this statement after The WSJ in its latest report on the issue said, “…captain turned off switches that controlled fuel flowing to the plane’s two engines” accidentally or deliberately.But almost everyday reports in the western media come out with reports that have alleged details of the crash which the Indian authorities like AAIB are yet to deny.The preliminary report had identified that first officer Clive Kunder was the pilot flying the doomed AI 171 while Captain Sumeet Sabharwal was the pilot monitoring. The confusion partially stems from AAIB’s prelim report which did not contain any cockpit voice recorder (transcript) and a solitary indirect quote from the same. “One of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” says the AAIB report without identifying which pilot said what.An Italian newspaper has now cited the CVR with time stamps. A translation of this latest in a series of reports coming from the west amid radio silence from authorities in India reads:“At 13:38:39, the aircraft lifts off.At 13:38:42, the engines are starved of fuel while the plane is climbing at 180 knots (333 km/h).At 13:38:44, a microphone attached to the first officer’s seat records him saying in shock:“Why did you shut off the engines?”One second later, the captain’s microphone picks up a vague:“I didn’t do it.”Kunder isn’t convinced and repeats the question for another six seconds.While Kunder is piloting the jet, the captain is supposed to be monitoring.Kunder’s hands were on the yoke and his mind focused on airspeed, heading, and pitch.Even if he didn’t see it, he almost certainly knew the captain had moved the switches: the sound of the levers being flipped down is unmistakable, confirmed by multiple pilots.”TOI has not been able independently verify whether the contents of this Italian media report are correct or not.Pilots and aviation experts in India have blamed the AAIB report for raising more questions than it answers and they have also slammed the reports in the western media.",Reports in western media have squarely blamed ai 171 captain for switching off fuel supply to the doomed air india dreamliner leading to its june 12 crash.

But now, all eyes are on her as she prepares to deliver one of the most anticipated rulings in Canadian legal history: the verdict in the Hockey Canada sexual assault trial.Before taking on the Hockey Canada case, Justice Maria Carroccia presided over a lengthy and emotionally charged murder trial in Windsor, where three men were convicted in the killing of a young woman over drugs and money. Known for her calm demeanor and legal precision, her courtroom style has earned praise from even the most seasoned lawyers. “She’s very steady, very calm,” said Toronto defence attorney Christopher Hicks. “She would listen to you. I want to be able to discuss the law with the judge.”Carroccia, a former top defence lawyer and daughter of Italian immigrants, was appointed to the Superior Court in 2020. Her approach is grounded in empathy and clarity. “A judge’s decision ought to make sense to an ordinary person, not just to lawyers, scholars and other judges,” she once wrote.That guiding principle will be especially important on July 24, when she delivers her judgment in a case involving five former NHL players accused of a 2018 group sexual assault in London, Ontario.Amid two failed jury selections and mounting public scrutiny, Carroccia made the bold decision to proceed with the case without a jury. It was a pivotal move that, according to Hicks, kept the trial from unraveling: “They all got on board because of her.” As the country waits, Justice Carroccia’s verdict will be more than a legal outcome—it will be a defining moment.Also Read: Hockey Canada sexual assault trial: Legal reckoning nears for ex-Hockey Canada players as judge weighs verdict Justice Maria Carroccia, a seasoned criminal law expert and former defence lawyer, is presiding over the case.The verdict is scheduled to be delivered on July 24, 2025.They are each charged with sexual assault in connection with an alleged 2018 incident following a Hockey Canada gala.","Justice maria carroccia is set to deliver the verdict in the highly anticipated hockey canada sexual assault trial on july 24, 2025.
