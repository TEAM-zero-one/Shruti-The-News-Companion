'What if China stops Brahmaputra water?': Himanta Biswa Sarma shuts down 'Pakistan's new scare narrative',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-if-china-stops-brahmaputra-water-himanta-biswa-sarma-shuts-down-pakistans-new-scare-narrative/articleshow/121584347.cms,"NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday hit back at Pakistan’s latest water-related scare narrative, calling it a “baseless attempt” to incite fear over a hypothetical situation involving the Brahmaputra River.Responding to a viral claim, “What if China stops the Brahmaputra’s water to India?”, Sarma issued a fact-driven rebuttal in a strongly worded post on X.His response came as India had suspended the Indus Waters Treaty in a diplomatic move following the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Pahalgam.“After India decisively moved away from the outdated Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan is now spinning another manufactured threat,” Sarma wrote on X.“Let’s dismantle this myth, not with fear, but with facts and national clarity,” he added, emphasising that the Brahmaputra is an Indian river that gains strength downstream, not one diminished by upstream influence.Sarma highlighted that China contributes only around 30 to 35 per cent of the Brahmaputra’s flow, primarily from glacial melt and limited rainfall over the Tibetan plateau. In contrast, 65 to 70 per cent of the river’s volume is generated within India, thanks to monsoon rains and tributaries in the Northeast.Using hydrological data, the chief minister noted that while the river’s flow at the Indo-China border (Tuting) ranges between 2,000 and 3,000 cubic metres per second, it swells dramatically to 15,000–20,000 m³/s in Assam during monsoon season. This, he said, proves India’s dominant role in sustaining the river.“The Brahmaputra is not a river India depends on upstream. It is a rain-fed Indian river system, strengthened after entering Indian territory,” Sarma said.He further argued that in the unlikely event China did attempt to reduce the river’s flow, it could even benefit India by reducing the annual floods in Assam that displace hundreds of thousands.Sarma also pointed out that China has never officially threatened to weaponise the Brahmaputra and dismissed such speculation as fear-mongering.Taking a direct swipe at Pakistan, he said that the country, which has long relied on the Indus Waters Treaty, is now “panicking” as India asserts its water sovereignty.“Brahmaputra is not controlled by a single source. It is powered by our geography, our monsoon, and our civilisational resilience,” he said.The Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary river that originates from the Mansarovar region near Mount Kailash in southwestern China. It flows through Tibet, enters India in Arunachal Pradesh, and continues through Assam before making its way into Bangladesh, where it eventually empties into the Bay of Bengal.",Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma hit back at pakistan’s latest water-related scare narrative.

While Nifty50 went below 24,550 intraday, BSE Sensex tanked over 750 points. Nifty50 ended the day at 24,716.60, down 34 points or 0.14%.

There are global headwinds like renewed tariff concerns that will restrain a breakout rally. At the same time there are domestic tailwinds that will support the market at lower levels. President Trump’s 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium is a clear message that the tariff and trade scenario will continue to be uncertain and turbulent. This headwind will impact markets. On the domestic front the tailwinds are getting stronger with the latest Q4 GDP growth data coming at 7.4%, which is much better-than-expected.”“Trends in consumption expenditure and capital expenditure are promising. This along with low inflation and the expected continuation of the rate cutting policy provide the perfect setting for sustained economic growth in FY26.

Pakistan's Strategic Bitcoin reserve plans

Pakistan’s scramble to please US President Donald Trump by establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve seems to have landed it in a soup! According to a report in the Dawn, senior officials in Islamabad have said that cryptocurrency remains banned in Pakistan. The State Bank of Pakistan and the Ministry of Finance both clarified that cryptocurrency transactions remain prohibited in Pakistan, with all such dealings considered unlawful under existing regulations.At a session of the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal explained that despite the recent establishment of a Crypto Council by the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif through executive order to explore digital asset policies, the prohibition on cryptocurrency remains enforced under SBP and SECP guidelines.According to the Dawn report, Bosal said, ""There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan.""

Gold price prediction today: Investors face uncertainty regarding their gold investment decisions due to multiple factors affecting market sentiment. The ongoing geopolitical conflicts, coupled with evolving US-China trade negotiations, have created ambiguity in the precious metals market. What is the gold rate prediction for this week and what should investors do?Gold prices slipped from a two-week high after US President Donald Trump postponed the implementation of 50% tariffs on EU imports to July 9, easing immediate trade tensions and reducing safe-haven demand. This delay came after the EU requested more time for negotiations, leading to a temporary pullback in bullion prices.However, geopolitical risks continued to support underlying demand, with Russia launching the largest aerial assault of the war on Ukraine and Israel intensifying military strikes in Gaza.Meanwhile, gold remained under pressure from a stronger US dollar, as the dollar index hovered near the 100 mark amid rising US bond yields and mixed economic data.A US trade court initially blocked Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, only for a federal appeals court to reinstate them a day later, injecting uncertainty into markets.On the economic front, US consumer confidence came in stronger than expected at just under 100, compared to a forecast of 87.1, while core durable goods orders rose 0.2% against expectations of a 0.1% decline.However, preliminary US GDP remained in negative territory, reinforcing concerns about slowing growth. The April PCE Price Index rose 2.1% year-on-year, slightly below the 2.2% estimate, suggesting softening inflation pressures. Weekly jobless claims exceeded expectations, adding to mixed economic signals.Minutes from the Fed’s May meeting revealed growing concern about the dual risk of rising inflation and unemployment, with policymakers indicating that rate cuts remain possible later this year but are not imminent. Geo-political tensions are once again on the rise and comments from President Trump’s administration on EU and China are also keeping market participants on edge.Focus this week will be on US Jobs market data, manufacturing and Services PMI from major economies and Governor Powell’s speech. RBI and ECB monetary policy statements will also be in radar this week.","Geo-political tensions are once again on the rise and comments from trump administration on eu and china are also keeping market participants on edge.

India Hosts G20, Pakistan Hosts Top 20 Terrorists? Priyanka Chaturvedi Blasts Islamabad in UK

For the first time in 6 years, PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17. There’s no official invitation yet from Canada for the meeting in Alberta but Modi in all likelihood would not have travelled to the North American country in any case, especially when India still isn’t sure the new government in Ottawa will be more receptive to its concerns about the activities of Khalistan separatists.A Canadian G7 spokesperson didn’t confirm to TOI late on Sunday if Modi was going to be invited.Any eleventh-hour invitation is unlikely to be considered by India because of logistical constraints, likely efforts by the separatists to disrupt the visit and the strained bilateral ties that both Modi and his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney have committed to improve. A bilateral meeting on the margins could have provided an opportunity for the leaders to jointly reaffirm their commitment to rebuilding ties.Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance, but reports in the Canadian media say Ottawa has invited the leaders of Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Ukraine and Brazil. This will be the first time that he won’t be at the meeting of the economically most advanced group of nations since France invited him for the summit in 2019.His presence at the summit of what is also an informal grouping of like-minded democracies has been seen as a sign of India’s growing role in shaping up the global agenda and addressing transnational issues.The Sikh separatists last week called upon the Carney government to not invite the Indian PM, citing India’s alleged reluctance to cooperate in the investigations into the killing of separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau blamed the Indian government for the murder without backing up his claim, as Indian has repeatedly said, with any evidence. The diplomatic row that followed saw the relationship hitting an all-time low as both sides expelled each other’s diplomats for activities hostile to the host nation.Carney has so far not explicitly spoken on the Nijjar issue but, while talking about his plans to use trade to reset ties, has said that Canada is not responsible for the strain on the relationship with India. India is hoping that Carney will act more responsibly than Trudeau in his handling of the case and has said it is ready to work with Ottawa based on mutual trust and sensitivity. India wants Canada to ensure foolproof security for Indian diplomats and also crack down on extremists and secessionists indulging in anti-India activities.","Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance.

Pakistan’s general issues warning

Diplomatic push across the globe

Technology, tensions, and nukes off the table

NEW DELHI: The longstanding hostility between India and Pakistan was on full display at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, where top military officials from both countries presented sharply opposing views amid heightened tensions following a brief but intense military confrontation last month.As the two nuclear-armed neighbours sat in adjacent conference rooms, their generals took part in overlapping sessions late Saturday afternoon, one on defence innovation, the other on regional crisis-management.India’s Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan made pointed remarks referencing Operation Sindoor , a military operation launched on May 7 to strike nine terror infrastructures across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in response to the Pahalgam attack that left 26 people dead.“What India has done, politically, is draw a new red line of intolerance against terror,” General Chauhan said. “I hope this particular operation, which lies within the military domain, brings about some lessons for our adversary, and they learn that this is the limit of India’s tolerance,” he said.“We have been subjected to this proxy war of terror for two decades and more, and we’ve lost a lot of people… we want to put an end to it,” he added.The operation concluded on May 10 after four days of retaliatory action.In a separate session, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of the Pakistan Armed Forces, warned of the dangers if another confrontation escalates.“The strategic stability is threatened by the lowering of thresholds. If next time such a conflict occurs and cities are targeted first and borders become irrelevant... there could be a possibility that before the international community intervenes, because of the restricted or constricted time window, the damage and destruction may already have taken place,” he said.In a broader interview with Channel News Asia, General Mirza said Pakistan continues to combat terrorism on its own soil, including cross-border activity from Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.“Terrorism has cost Pakistan hundreds of billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives,” he said.While the military standoff ended on May 10, the diplomatic offensive is ongoing. India has dispatched multi-party delegations to more than 30 world capitals, including permanent and prospective members of the United Nations Security Council.Congress party leader and former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid, who was part of the Indian delegation visiting East and Southeast Asia, including a stop in Singapore on May 27, called the outreach “unprecedented.”“There are seven delegations sent worldwide to all members of the Security Council. In that sense, it is an innovation,” he said. “You might even put it as something that has started… something that will at least ensure our narrative is carried right through.”Pakistan is expected to launch a similar diplomatic campaign beginning June 2.The 96-hour military exchange in May was closely watched for its use of advanced weaponry. According to Channel News Asia, both sides deployed modern jets, India’s French-made Rafales and Pakistan’s Chinese J-10Cs, equipped with precision-guided missiles. Drones and cyber capabilities were reportedly used as well.General Chauhan highlighted India’s diverse arsenal: “India doesn’t depend on one nation for its defence needs. A number of capabilities were put together, and most were used to good effect.”General Mirza noted Pakistan’s access to a wide range of international defence equipment. “We have military equipment from the US, Turkiye, Italy, the UK, and China,” he said. “We have equipment from all equipment-producing countries.”Despite the rising tensions, both sides maintain that nuclear weapons were never considered. Pakistani officials, including General Mirza, dismissed reports suggesting Islamabad convened its National Command Authority, which oversees the country’s nuclear arsenal.“The tools of modern conflict are artificial intelligence, electronic warfare, cyber, precision firepower, and weapons,” General Mirza said, pointing to how future conflict could look very different from the past.","Top military officials from both countries presented sharply opposing views at the shangri-la dialogue in singapore. ‘india has done, politically, is draw a new red line of intolerance against terror,’ india’s chief of defence staff general anil chauhan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121572842,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-26836,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'National interest sacrificed at the altar of political expediency'

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Salman Khurshid on Monday sent a strong message to ""people at home"" over political allegiances, even as his recent remarks on Article 370 appeared to deepen discomfort within his party.Khurshid expressed concern over political divisions in India, even as a multi-party delegation travels abroad to highlight the country’s united stand against terrorism . Khurshid, a senior politician and former foreign minister, is currently in East Asia as part of an all-party parliamentary group led by JD(U) MP Sanjay Kumar Jha.Posting on X, Khurshid wrote, “When on mission against terrorism, to carry India’s message to the world, it’s distressing that people at home are calculating political allegiances. Is it so difficult to be patriotic?”The post came days after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) cornered Congress over Khurshid's remark backing abrogation of Article 370. While addressing think tanks and academia in Indonesia on last week, Khurshid said it was unfortunate that Pakistan wants to undo the prosperity that has come to Jammu & Kashmir following the abrogation. Khurshid is part of one of the seven- all party delegations currently touring various countries.The Congress had initially opposed the move to scrap Article 370. The party later nuanced its position and has since been ambivalent on the issue of restoration of the Article which granted J&K special status.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country. But Article 370 was abrogated, it was finally put to an end, because so much time had passed,"" Khurshid had said.The BJP jumped on the opportunity and questioned whether the Congress would now target senior leader Salman Khurshid for what it called “speaking an inconvenient truth” like party leader Shashi Tharoor who faced backlash from within the grand-old party for supporting the Centre over Operation Sindoor stance.BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya responded to Khurshid's post, calling it ""both tragic and deeply ironic."" He criticised the Congress for ""sacrificing national interest at the altar of political expediency,"" accusing the party of placing ""partisan interests above the country’s welfare.""""The sentiment expressed here is both tragic and deeply ironic. It reflects the cost of a warped idea of secularism that the Congress party has long championed, one that confuses the urgent need to confront terror with a compulsive instinct to appease. In doing so, they have not only diluted the moral clarity required to fight extremism, but have also compromised national security in the name of vote-bank politics,"" Mavliya wrote in a post on X.Earlier, in a similar messaging, Khurshid on Saturday had said, ""The ruling party could have come alone to bring this message, but they came with us to give India's message... However, sadly, this is not what we hear from India. Somebody is saying that he is supporting the BJP or the Congress, but I am proud that we are here together because we are not supporting , we are supporting one simple idea called India.""Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who is part of another delegation currently in Brazil and facing opposition by own party members, had made similar remarks. He had urged critics to hold off until the delegations complete their mission. “Undoubtedly, in a democracy, criticism is natural. But for now, we should focus on the mission,” he said.Meanwhile, Congress has raised questions on the ceasefire with Paistan after Operation Sindoor. Party president Mallikarjun Kharge and spokesperson Pawan Khera have demanded a Parliament session to get clarity on the terms of the ceasefire with Pakistan. They have accused the government of misleading the nation after retaliatory strikes in response to the terror attack in Pahalgam.","Khurshid expressed concern over political divisions in india, even as a multi-party delegation travels abroad to highlight the country’s united stand against terrorism.

LeT ultras boast about revenge for 1971, mock 'Modi's missiles & bullets'

NEW DELHI: The line, ever so thin, between the Pakistani state and terrorists, is fast disappearing post-Operation Sindoor. Speaker of Pakistan's Punjab assembly, Malik Ahmed Khan, has now come out in defence of Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri, by attending a rally alongside the US-designated terrorist, and Talha Saeed, son of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed Asked by reporters, the speaker of the assembly of Pakistan's biggest province brazened it out by saying Kasuri, one of the masterminds of the Pahalgam terror attack , should not be seen as an accused without an investigation. He also cited a personal connection to Kasur, the town where the May 28 rally was organised.The presence of Talha alongside Kasuri came to light when foreign policy circles were already discussing Kasuri and his jihadi comrades gloating over what they called their success in avenging the partition of Pakistan after its loss to India in the 1971 war.Video footage from the rally showed Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri arriving with a posse of guards carrying American M4 carbines and being serenaded as the ""conqueror"" of India. Flower petals were showered on him.While addressing the gathering, the Lashkar terrorists boasted about their involvement in protests against former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, which forced her to flee and take shelter in India.Kasuri and Muzammil Hashmi, both designated as terrorists by the US, claimed credit for their role in the coup during rallies organised last week. ""We emerged victorious against you in Bangladesh last year,"" they said.Expectedly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been the target of hateful vitriol that marks proceedings of jihadi congregations. ""Tum hamein apni goli se darate ho, Modi hum tujhe paigham dete hain, humare bachche teri missailon se nahi dare, hum teri goli se kya darenge (Modi, you scare us with your bullets, our children were not scared of your missiles, you think we are worried about your bullets),"" Hashmi said during a rally by Pakistan Markazi Muslim League, the political front of Lashkar-e-Taiba, in Gujranwala on May 28.At another rally the same week, Kasuri drew parallels between the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war and recent events, stating that his group had avenged the past defeat.""I was four years old when Pakistan was dismembered in 1971. The then Indian PM Indira Gandhi had declared that she had drowned the two-nation theory in the khaleej (Bay of Bengal). On May 10, we took the revenge of 1971,"" Kasuri said while addressing his supporters in Rahim Yar Khan.He also referenced the brutal Indian air strikes on Muridke, which resulted in the death of fellow terrorist Mudassar, and expressed anguish over being barred from attending the funeral. ""I was not allowed to attend his funeral. On the day of his funeral, I cried a lot,"" Kasuri said.","Lashkar-e-taiba deputy chief saifullah kasuri attended a rally alongside the us-designated terrorist, and talha saeed, son of let chief hafiz saeed.

Congress has slammed Centre's move to send all-party delegations abroad, calling it a sham.""When on mission against terrorism, to carry India's message to the world, it's distressing that people at home are calculating political allegiances. Is it so difficult to be patriotic?"" he wondered in a post on X that appeared to echo the exasperation of his colleague Shashi Tharoor, who has been at the receiving end of attacks from party spokespersons for agreeing to head one of the all-party delegations.Explaining his post, Khurshid said the need of the hour is to speak in a single voice in favour of the country, irrespective of party affiliations, as the delegations have been doing on foreign soil. ""When I say, is it so difficult to be a patriot? - that is the question that has to be asked of those who are putting out tweets and saying things that I believe are not very encouraging when you want to do something for the nation,"" he wrote.Khurshid's remarks Friday backing abrogation of Article 370 while addressing think tanks and academia in Indonesia had caused a stir.

India's First Reaction After Bangladesh Bans Sheikh Hasina's Awami League Party

Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh





DHAKA: Prosecutors at Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on Sunday formally charged former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and two others with crimes against humanity and other charges, including mass murder, for their alleged role in a violent crackdown last year in which hundreds of people were killed.The other two charged for the crimes with Hasina are former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former inspector general of police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun.""We do hereby take into cognisance the charges,"" the three-judge ICT bench led by Justice Golam Mortuza Majumdar said after a prosecution team accused them of attempting to tame the student-led protests using brutal force. The tribunal ordered investigators to present all three accused before the court on June 16. Mamun is in police custody. Hasina and Kamal are residing abroad.Sunday's proceedings marked the start of Hasina's trial in absentia nearly 10 months after the ouster of her government following protests. Under ICT law, if convicted, Hasina and the co-accused could face the death penalty.The proceedings were broadcast live on television for the first time in Bangladesh’s history.The complaint, submitted by chief prosecutor Tajul Islam, outlined five counts of alleged crimes, including murder, attempted murder, torture and other inhumane acts.The accused are also charged with abetting, inciting, facilitating and being complicit in, as well as failing to prevent, a series of crimes reportedly committed against civilians by law enforcement agencies and armed affiliates of the Awami League. One count specifically refers to a violent crackdown on unarmed student demonstrators, which allegedly followed a press briefing by Hasina on July 14. Prosecutors claim that in the aftermath, Kamal, IGP Mamun and other senior government officials were directly involved in enabling and overseeing the assault.“Upon reviewing the evidence, we concluded that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,” Islam told the court. “The accused unleashed all law enforcement agencies and her (Hasina’s) armed party members to crush the uprising.”The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009 to investigate crimes committed by the Pakistani army during Bangladesh’s war for independence in 1971. Six top leaders of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and one leader of former PM Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party were hanged to death after being convicted by the court. According to a UN rights office report, some 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and Aug 15 last year as violence continued even after the fall of Hasina’s Awami League regime.","Proceedings aired live, a first for bangladesh.

'Water is Our New Red Line': Pakistan Army Chief Warns India Over Indus Waters Treaty Suspension

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season with a major dip in live storage at its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - and the ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab river inflows due to regulation of water flow by India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.The situation may further aggravate this month during early kharif sowing and this is possibly what prompted Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to raise concerns at a conference on glacier preservation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, last week to draw global attention to India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Latest estimates by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA) show the country is already facing an overall shortage of 21% in water flow and around 50% in live storage of the two key dams which play a crucial role in providing water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan and generating hydropower.Referring to its latest assessment of availability of water for summer sowing operations during May-Sept, the IRSA in its statement ""noted with concern"" that the ""sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortage in early kharif season"".It declared an overall shortage of 21% and advised dam authorities and irrigation supply monitoring agencies to use water from reservoirs judiciously, ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Though the situation may improve with monsoon rainfall in the catchment area, possibly by next month, Pakistan's farming operations will depend more on how India regulates the flow through limited infrastructure of its own reservoirs - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.India has, so far, only flushed these reservoirs and made additional water storage available by clearing sediments. Besides, it also stopped sharing water flow data with Pakistan after putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam massacre.Publicly available information on live storage of Pakistan's critical reservoirs shows that Mangla dam is currently left with less than 50% of its fill level (2.7 million acre feet out of the total capacity of 5.9 MAF) whereas Tarbela dam's live storage is slightly over 50% (6 MFA) of its total capacity of 11.6 MFA.Officials here believe that since India is under no obligation to share water flow data with Pakistan after suspending the IWT, it would be difficult for the neighbouring country to even manage floods during the peak flow season once monsoon hits the catchment areas of the Indus river system as a large part of it falls within India.Farming operations in two provinces of Pakistan, Punjab and Sindh, fully depend on irrigation canals linked to the Indus river system, which gets almost its entire waters from the western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. Though India has full rights on the waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) under the IWT, inadequate infrastructure to use the waters by the Indian side benefits Pakistan.India is permitted to construct water storage facilities on western rivers up to 3.6 MAF but has not been able to fully utilise this, making Pakistan a beneficiary by default.","Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season.
