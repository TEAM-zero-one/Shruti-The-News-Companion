Rudra may change how Army operates: Upgrade likely from ‘Cold Start’ to ‘Cold Strike’ doctrine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rudra-may-change-how-army-operates/articleshow/125374266.cms,"CDS General Anil Chauhan Highlights Inter-Service Jointness And Integration In Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: With the successful testing of a newly-raised integrated 'Rudra' all-arms brigade in the major tri-Service Trishul exercise on the western front with Pakistan, the Army may now well upgrade its ‘Cold Start’ doctrine to 'Cold Strike' for swifter and greater offensive thrusts into enemy territory.This doctrinal evolution has gained ground after Southern Army Command chief Lt-General Dhiraj Seth said performance of the Rudra brigade under the 12 `Konark’ Corps, with integration of all fighting arms backed by combat support and logistics, was “fully validated operationally” during the `Akhand Prahar’ drills in the desert sector under the just-concluded Trishul exercise.“Now, with the Rudra brigade, the time has come to change the Cold Start doctrine into the Cold Strike one. I am fully satisfied that the Rudra brigades in the coming times will be successful in multi-domain operations and executing their task effectively against the enemy,” Lt-Gen Seth said.The Army had formulated its “pro-active conventional war strategy”, colloquially called the Cold Start doctrine, after its “strike formations” under Operation Parakram took almost a month to mobilise at the border launch pads against Pakistan in wake of the terror attack on Parliament in Dec 2001.By that time, Pakistan had shored up its defences, and the US also had jumped in to pressurize India against launching any cross-border attack. Having learnt a harsh operational lesson, the Army since then has been refining its strategy for faster mobilisation for multiple but limited offensives into enemy territory under the nuclear overhang.Pakistan, which does not have a “no first-use” nuclear policy like India, in turn, took to brandishing its short-range Nasr (Hatf-IX) and other nuclear-capable missiles as an effective counter to the Cold Start conventional military strategy.Now, the 11.5-lakh strong Army is converting a few of its over 250 single-arm brigades (each has over 3,000 troops) into Rudra all-arms brigades, with integration of infantry, mechanized infantry, armoured (tanks), artillery, air defence, engineers, signals and drone units, along with logistics and combat-support elements.In effect, a Rudra brigade brings together all fighting arms and support units into a self-contained group even during peacetime to ensure much better cohesion and faster mobilization for combined arms operations.Two Rudra brigades have already come up on the northern borders with China, one in eastern Ladakh and the other in Sikkim. “Each Rudra brigade will be tailor-made as per its earmarked area of operation, the type of terrain there and the operational task to be executed. The brigades will have units that can be attached or detached as per the requirements,” an officer said.As for the `Akhand Prahar’ drills, the “full-spectrum combat readiness” of the Konark Corps was validated through integrated employment of all arms and services from mechanised and infantry manoeuvres to the execution of land operations by the Rudra Brigade called ‘Black Mace’, special heliborne operations, and coordinated attack helicopter missions. “It also witnessed seamless synergy between the Army and IAF, with fighter ground attack missions in close support of the land forces,” another officer said.","The army may now well upgrade its 'cold start' doctrine to 'cold strike' for swifter and greater offensive thrusts into enemy territory.

What trends in Bihar show

What did the exit polls say?

As trends in the Bihar assembly election results emerge, NDA alliance has taken decisive leads across the state with Mahagathbandhan trailing. However, one name that is notably absent from the numbers is Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj. Despite promises to reshape Bihar’s political landscape, the results so far show no significant traction for the party.According to latest trends, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) sweeping elections with Mahagathbandhan lagging behind.The early picture is dominated by the two major blocs:NDA has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the BJP and JD(U) registering strong performances.Mahagathbandhan (MGB) trails behind, with RJD performing significantly better than alliance partner Congress — but still not matching the NDA’s spread.RJD, despite MGB trailing overall, is showing up as one of the top individual parties in several seats.Jan Suraaj, however, does not appear in the early seat charts, and its vote share — where visible — is marginal, rarely impacting the margins in competitive constituencies.The Jan Suraaj Party contested its maiden elections this month with more than 200 candidates in the fray. The party, formed by poll strategist Prashant Kishore, initially announced plans to contest all 243 seats in the Bihar Assembly.The number dipped slightly after Jan Suraaj faced defections, ‘forced’ withdrawals, and other setbacks during the nomination process.Prashant Kishor, the election strategist turned politician, set an ambitious victory target for his party in the state assembly elections. He had also stated that if his party fails to achieve this, he will consider it a personal defeat.However, all exit polls predicted a dismal performance for Prashant Kishore’s Jan Suraaj Party in the Bihar assembly elections . The maximum number of seats any pollster is willing to give to the party is five. While Kishore himself did not contest the polls, his party’s vote share numbers will determine whether they have been able to make any significant dent in the votes of either the NDA or the Mahagathbandhan.","Nda has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the bjp and jd(u) registering strong performances.

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

High votes, low wins: The big contradiction



Contest more seats



NDA's math clicked, MGB's math cracked



JD(U)'s comeback flipped the story



BJP grows bigger than ever



MGB slipped because allies didn't deliver



Jan Suraaj and AIMIM changed the margins



So, what really happened?



NEW DELHI: Bihar's 2025 election results threw up a story full of surprises. Tejashwi Yadav 's RJD turned out to be the party with highest vote share in the state, yet it ended up with one of its lowest seat tallies ever. On the other hand, the NDA kept the power with landslide victory, clinching over 200 seats in 243-member assembly, keeping the Mahagathbandhan far from the seat of government.RJD recorded a vote share of around 23 percent, just few decimals down from 2020, when it got 23.11 and emerged as the largest party with 75 seats. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats. So the big question is: how can a party get the most votes, yet finish into just 25 seats, a huge loss of 50 from the last elections. So the striking question is: how can a party get the most votes, yet finish with so few seats?The answer lies in how votes were spread. RJD seems to have polled a large number of second-position votes. It remained popular, but not with enough concentrated support in winning zones.In simple terms, RJD got votes but not victories. This is no surprise in India's electoral mechanism of 'First Past the Post System.'RJD contested 143 seats this time, the highest among all parties across both the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan. In the 2020 assembly elections, the Lalu-led party had fielded one more candidate, contesting 144 seats.Contesting widely helped the party accumulate more total votes, contributing to the highest vote share. But losing candidates also add to vote share totals.Meanwhile, BJP and JD(U) fought on 101 seats each. They contested fewer seats but converted their votes efficiently into victories. That is why their seat count shot up, even with a lower vote share than RJD.A major turning point this election was the return of Chirag Paswan's LJP (Ram Vilas) to the NDA camp. In 2020, the LJP had hurt the NDA's chances by cutting into its votes, but this time its support helped strengthen the alliance instead of splitting it.In the previous election, LJP (RV) was unhappy with the NDA's seat-sharing formula in Bihar. Even though it was part of the alliance at the Centre, Chirag Paswan chose to go solo in the state and contested 134 seats, which ended up damaging NDA numbers—especially Nitish Kumar 's JD(U).Similarly, Upendra Kushwaha's party contested 104 seats independently in 2020, further cutting into votes that could have benefitted the NDA.This time, with both LJP (RV) and Kushwaha’s RLM back in the NDA fold, the alliance appeared far more united, organised, and prepared. The result: NDA outperformed the Mahagathbandhan by a wide margin.One of the biggest turnarounds happened in seats where RJD and JD(U) were in direct fight.In 2020, RJD dominated these contests. But in 2025, JD(U) turned the tables and won 50 out of 59, almost wiping out RJD in head-to-head battles. JD(U)'s vote share also jumped from 15.39 percent in 2020 to 19.25 percent this time, helping it win 85 seats from the tally of 43 last time.RJD simply failed to see this drastic reversal coming.The BJP crossed 89 seats, its highest tally ever in Bihar, marking a historic leap for a party that once had almost no grassroots base or ideological legacy in the state. By staying aligned for years with ""sushasan babu"" and steadily expanding its footprint, the saffron party has now grown into Bihar's biggest political force.With this mandate, the BJP has effectively redrawn the political map of Bihar. It now sits at the centre of power, holding the strongest bargaining position in the alliance. For years, Nitish Kumar played the ""big brother"" to the BJP, but for the second election in a row, the BJP has outperformed the JD(U), this time doing so with its best-ever numbers.The shift isn't just about arithmetic -- it's psychological. For decades, Bihar's political story revolved around the Lalu–Nitish axis. Today, it revolves around the BJP’s weight, influence and negotiating power.Unlike NDA, the Mahagathbandhan struggled with coordination and clarity.Congress contested on 61 seats as compared to last time's 70, but won only six. The Left parties, which surprised everyone in 2020, could not repeat their performance either. Seat-sharing disagreements and confusing ""friendly fights"" meant votes did not transfer smoothly within the alliance.The opposition was visible but not united -- and unity decides tight contests.Prashant Kishor's much-talked about startup -- Jan Suraaj did not open its account, but it made a strategic dent, in at least 35 seats, its vote share was higher than the winning margin, influencing outcomes for both alliances.Meanwhile, AIMIM repeated its strong Seemanchal performance, winning five seats with 1.85 percent of votes and signalling a shift in political thinking among Muslim voters.The traditional Muslim–Yadav (MY) vote base of the RJD showed signs of fragmentation, with Muslim voters exploring alternative platforms in multiple constituencies, leading to a near wipeout of the Mahagathbandhan in Seemanchal, barring one Congress candidate who scraped through.Mayawati's BSP also registered a presence, securing 1.62% of the total vote share with one seat in the west.RJD did not lose popularity, but lost positional advantage. It remained a strong choice for many voters but could not cross the finishing line often enough. High vote share created the impression of strength, but seats reflect actual power -- and that is where NDA towered above everyone.","Bihar's 2025 election results threw up a story full of surprises. Tejashwi yadav's rjd turned out to be the party with highest vote share. But it ended up with one of its lowest seat tallies ever. On the other hand, the nda kept the power with landslide victory.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125363704,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-759459,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Growing need for anti-drone systems

NEW DELHI: The Army and the Air Force are preparing to place orders for 16 indigenous drone detection and interdiction systems. These systems can hit unmanned aerial vehicles at a distance of 2 km using lasers and disable them.The defence ministry is expected to clear DRDO ’s Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System (Mark 2). Officials told ANI that this version can engage enemy drones with a 10-kilowatt laser at 2 km. The earlier system could target drones only up to around 1 km.DRDO has also test-fired a direct energy weapon system that can target threats at 5 km. Trials are under way with support from the armed forces. This 5 km range will come from a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon.In April, India showcased, for the first time, its ability to shoot down fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser weapon. With this demonstration, India joined a small group of countries, such as the US, China, and Russia that have shown similar capability.CHESS, a DRDO lab, recently carried out a successful field demonstration of the land version of the vehicle-mounted Laser Directed Weapon DEW MK-II(A) in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh.It brought down a fixed-wing UAV and swarm drones, causing structural damage and disabling their surveillance sensors.Also read: 'Nari Shakti' in force?

CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.",Cji b r gavai calls 1979 rape verdict a'moment of institutional embarrassment' he says it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable.

NEW DELHI: In a major booster shot for military capabilities in eastern Ladakh, India on Wednesday operationalised its new Nyoma airbase close to the frontier with China, even as a large Army exercise called 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' is now under way in Arunachal Pradesh on the eastern front.The developments at the opposite ends of the 3,488-km LAC underscore the high military readiness being maintained along the China frontier. ""There is ongoing reset in bilateral diplomatic ties. Military CBMs are also being progressively strengthened but the trust deficit on the ground remains high,"" a senior officer told TOI. ""With no de-escalation along LAC, troops will continue to be forward deployed for 6th successive winter since multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020,"" he said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, to formally inaugurate the strategically located airbase. He was accompanied by Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Jeetendra Mishra.Located just about 35 km from the LAC, Nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth Rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway, a new ATC complex, hangars, crash bay and accommodation, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Mudh airfield is now fully capable of handling and sustaining operations by heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. Primarily, it will help quickly rush troops, weapons and supplies to areas such as Pangong Tso, Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026 though high altitude will be a limiting factor. China has assiduously upgraded all its airbases facing India over the last five years to offset the terrain constraints due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.China now has additional fighters, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones deployed at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports all along the LAC.In the far reaches of the Eastern Himalayas, thousands of soldiers from the 3 Spear Corps of the Indian Army, along with elements of IAF, ITBP and others, are now also engaged in the 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' exercise in the high-altitude terrain of Mechuka and other areas of Arunachal Pradesh.From airlift and force projection to mountain warfare manoeuvres and multi-domain integrated operations, the exercise aims at validating rapid mobilisation, operational logistics and precision-strike capabilities. ""The right force must reach the right place at the right time during conflicts,"" an officer said.While Nyoma will be another operational base for the IAF in Ladakh after Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and the Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground), India has also progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, civil ALGs in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal) of the LAC are also now being increasingly used for military purposes.","Indian air force opens nyoma airbase in ladakh, a strategic game-changer along the china frontier.located just about 35 km from the lac, nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125286003,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1011904,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Swifties think Taylor Swift’s ‘The Fate of Ophelia’ is aimed directly at Joe Alwyn

More coverage on NFL:





Taylor Swift’s latest track, “The Fate of Ophelia,” is sparking a fresh wave of online theories and Swifties are convinced she’s weaving real-life heartbreak into a Shakespeare-inspired narrative. The song, featured on The Life of a Showgirl, flips the tragic Ophelia storyline into one of revival, and fans immediately tie the imagery to Taylor’s emotional journey after her six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn.With lyrics that feel pointed, timing that feels deliberate, and symbolism that leans heavily into themes of rescue, rebirth, and choosing a new path, this track has become the latest cultural flashpoint as listeners dissect what Taylor may be saying between the lines.Swifties didn’t waste time pulling receipts. The lyric “dug me out of my grave” is being hailed as a symbolic nod to Travis, the man fans believe helped lift Taylor from the emotional stagnation she experienced during her long romance with Joe.

Who Wins This Trade?

Final Outlook: A Potential Offseason Earthquake





The MLB offseason has taken a dramatic turn as the Toronto Blue Jays have surfaced as a projected frontrunner to acquire elite outfielder Kyle Tucker. Widely regarded as one of baseball’s most complete two-way stars, Tucker’s sudden availability has reshaped the league’s trade conversation. His blend of power hitting, defensive value, and age-advantaged upside has made him one of the most sought-after names on the market, and Toronto appears ready to pursue him with full force.What makes this rumor especially compelling is the timing. The Toronto Blue Jays enter the new season facing pressure to retool a roster that has repeatedly come close to a deep postseason run but has lacked game-changing consistency from the middle of the lineup. Kyle Tucker represents exactly the sort of megastar addition who could elevate them from fringe contender to legitimate championship threat. With the outfielder inching toward free agency and the Astros dealing with payroll constraints, the trade landscape has shifted just enough to push this blockbuster scenario closer to reality.The crux of this developing trade scenario revolves around Houston’s willingness to move Kyle Tucker before his price escalates further.His next contract is projected by many insiders to far exceed $400 million, making him one of the future highest-paid players in MLB. As Houston considers its long-term financial structure, a trade offers a chance to gain controllable young talent while avoiding a massive future commitment.Toronto, meanwhile, sees a rare opportunity to land a perennial All-Star entering his prime. The Jays have the prospect capital to make a competitive offer, but the deal would likely require them to part with top-tier farm talent or even major-league-ready contributors. The situation mirrors a previous significant trade where the Cubs secured Kyle Tucker in exchange for a major prospect haul, setting a precedent that Toronto must be prepared to match or exceed.Landing Kyle Tucker would immediately enhance Toronto’s run-producing ability. His track record - multiple seasons hitting above .280 with 23+ home runs and more than 100 RBIs when healthy - fills a major need for consistent, middle-order firepower. Beyond numbers, he brings star appeal, boosting marketability and energizing a fanbase waiting for a marquee acquisition.A move to Toronto could unlock a new chapter in Tucker’s career. He would step into a strong lineup, receive a platform in a major media market, and likely secure a record-breaking long-term deal. From both financial and competitive standpoints, the Blue Jays offer an attractive landing spot.• Major offensive upgrade with reliable power and run production.• Coverage for potential departures, including the possibility of losing Bo Bichette in the future.• Increased ticket sales, fan engagement, and brand visibility.• Significant financial flexibility ahead of Tucker’s predicted megadeal.• A youth infusion that keeps the franchise competitive without fully resetting.• Potentially higher earning power and a bigger spotlight.• Opportunity to become the face of a rising contender.• High prospect cost, which could strip future depth.• Tucker’s recent injury concerns—including the shin fracture and 2024 missed time—add risk.• Immediate decline in lineup power and overall star quality.• Risk that young players acquired may take years to develop or fail to meet expectations.• Stress of changing leagues, cities, and expectations.• Toronto’s intense baseball culture brings heightened scrutiny.In the short term, Toronto would be the clear winner if Kyle Tucker stays healthy. His age, production, and defensive ability fit perfectly into the Toronto Blue Jays’ competitive timeline. For Houston, the true verdict depends on the development of the prospects they receive. Should even one or two become impact starters, the Astros could ultimately claim the long-term win.For Tucker, the move is a win if he secures the massive contract projections tied to his name and thrives in a hitters-friendly environment with a competitive roster around him.If completed, this trade would electrify the entire league. The Toronto Blue Jays would enter the season armed with one of baseball’s most explosive outfields, the Astros would gain the pieces needed to sustain future success, and Kyle Tucker would take a major step forward in both fame and financial security. The risk is real for all parties, but the reward is equally massive.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets could land $220 million ex Houston Atros ace pitchers to anchor a championship-caliber staff The upcoming offseason promises drama, speculation, and perhaps a blockbuster move that redefines the AL landscape.

Islam Makhachev on UFC 322 Fight vs. JDM, Khabib Ending Conor’s Career, and Dagestan Meme

How did Islam Makhachev build up his 2025 wealth and career dominance?





Islam Makhachev's journey from a gifted fighter from Dagestan trained in the mountains to a dual-division champion has profoundly altered Makhachev's financial fortune, which is a rare occurrence amongst fighters. In the year 2025, he is a fighter who not only has a prestigious past but also a present with star power; therefore, he is one of the most marketable fighters in the mixed martial arts world. His modest character may put him aside from the typical celebrity limelight, yet his supremacy in the ring has spoken much louder than words. The year has ranked him among the highest-earning athletes in UFC, with a personal fortune reflecting the same consistency and accuracy that he brings in every fight.His worth in 2025 is estimated to be in the range of $5 million to $7 million, a number that is influenced by a base salary for fights that are said to be between $500,000 and $1 million, as well as a myriad of other ways, such as cuts from pay-per-view sales, bonuses for winning, and incentives for good performances. Makhachev's fights, especially his title fights, which are all high-profile, have the potential to generate incomes of $2 million and above, whereas his fight with Alexander Volkanovski produced a whopping $2.54 million payout.Also, on the side of the cage, the deals with Monster Energy, Gorilla Energy, Wahed, and Al Hadaya are contributing to the increase in his financial area. Makhachev, despite his large wealth, is still leading a humble life, never showing off his largest possessions—except once when he had a $1.5 million Richard Mille RM 62-01 watch, which still draws discussions among the fans whether he bought it or it was a gift.Islam Makhachev’s MMA record has now reached 28–1 (ESPN: 27–1–0), which includes the impressive numbers of 5 KOs and 13 submissions, showing off his great grappling and finishing ability. Some of the significant wins are against Charles Oliveira (submission for lightweight title), Alexander Volkanovski (twice: KO/TKO and decision), Dustin Poirier (submission), Renato Moicano (submission), and Jack Della Maddalena at UFC 322 (unanimous decision) for the welterweight title. His regularity in the ring, a disciplined lifestyle based in Dagestan, and the guidance of Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, plus the lifelong friendship with Khabib Nurmagomedov, have laid the ground for both his professional and financial success. Together with a considerable number of valuable sponsorship deals, social media impact, and PPV earnings, Makhachev’s commercial and competitive profile continues to ascend very rapidly.Islam Makhachev in 2025 is the epitome of the combination of athletic supremacy and financial wisdom. His status as a champion in multiple divisions, an impressive record of fights, and an ever-increasing number of promotions together make him one of the UFC’s most valuable and respected stars, whose net worth corresponds to the scale of his accomplishments in the octagon.Also Read: Dustin Poirier finally reveals his true pick in the long‑running Islam Makhachev vs Khabib debate","Islam makhachev's financial fortune is estimated to be in the range of $5 million to $7 million.

Candace Owens explains her list of “verifiable lies” told after Charlie Kirk’s assassination



Image via Candace/Podcast

She said the first lie was the story that Mikey McCoy had “blood all over him.” She said this story was made up and was told by Pastor Rob McCoy.

The second lie, she said, came from Alex Clark and Andrew Kolvet. She said they pushed a story that Charlie Kirk was a “committed evangelical” who only liked Catholic buildings. Owens said this was not true.

The third lie was a strange story that Charlie Kirk’s “strong bones” stopped a 30-06 bullet. She said Andrew Kolvet pushed this and that it made no sense.

The fourth lie, she said, was the claim that Charlie “never blinked” in his support for Israel. Candace Owens said this was not true.

For the fifth lie, she said TPUSA told people that Mikey McCoy first called his dad during the crisis. Owens said this story was also false.

The sixth lie was about Terryl Farnsworth, the AV worker. She said TPUSA claimed police told him to remove cameras. Owens said her video review shows this did not happen.

The seventh lie was the claim that Farnsworth moved SD cards because “people were stealing them.” She said this made no sense because SD cards are cheap and cameras are expensive.

The eighth lie came from Alex Clark, who said there was “no bad blood” between Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk. Owens said that was “propaganda.”

The ninth lie was that TPUSA’s yearly audits proved nothing odd. Candace Owens said this was misleading because Doge worked differently from normal TPUSA work.

The tenth lie was calling Mikey McCoy a “hero.” Candace Owens said this was not fair because he did not call 911 right away.





Candace Owens spoke on her podcast on November 13, 2025. She said she found ten “verifiable lies” that she believes Turning Point USA (TPUSA) told after Charlie Kirk was killed. Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The next day, 22-year-old Tyler James Robinson was arrested for the shooting. Owens said she will keep talking about this case because she feels she is getting “very close” to the real truth, and she believes some people at TPUSA are upset with her for this.In her show, Candace Owens said TPUSA gave wrong or confusing stories about what happened that day. She said some stories made people sound more heroic, more loyal, or more important than they really were. She also said some stories changed facts about Charlie Kirk, his beliefs, his staff, and what happened at the scene.Candace Owens then shared the ten lies she says TPUSA spread.

Seahawks mourn Kenny Easley: Hall of Fame safety dies at 66, cause still not public



Dialysis three times a week





A full kidney transplant in 1990





A long recovery that forced him to rebuild his life away from football





More coverage from NFL:







When news broke that Seattle Seahawks legend Kenny Easley had passed away at 66, the NFL world felt the shock instantly. Fans, former teammates, and Hall of Fame members all reacted with the same heavy silence because the Enforcer wasn’t just a player. He was a presence. And now that voice is gone.Easley died on November 14, 2025, according to confirmations from the Pro Football Hall of Fame and his family. But one crucial detail remains unknown: no cause of death has been released.And that mystery has left many revisiting the long, difficult health journey that shaped Easley’s life long after he left the field.But what we do know is this: no official source has linked his death to any past health condition. Until the family or medical authorities release more information, the cause of death remains undisclosed.This silence has left fans wondering especially because Easley had a well-documented medical history that dramatically changed the course of his life.Long before his Hall of Fame induction, Easley suffered through one of the toughest medical battles an athlete can face.In the late 1980s, he was diagnosed with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, a severe kidney disorder that ultimately ended his NFL career at just 28 years old.At the time, it shocked the league, he was in his prime, playing at an elite level, and widely considered one of the greatest safeties of his generation.The situation grew more painful when Easley later revealed the underlying cause. In a lawsuit, he claimed that excessive ibuprofen use, a common pain-management routine in the NFL had worsened his kidney failure.His life quickly turned into a medical fight:Even after the transplant, he carried the weight of that diagnosis for decades. Easley’s medical battles didn’t stop with the kidney transplant.In 2016, he underwent triple-bypass heart surgery, another major challenge that could have easily knocked him down. But in true Kenny Easley fashion, he bounced back, showing up for Seahawks events, supporting charitable causes, and remaining a powerful voice in the Seattle community.But even then, he stayed private about his health. And that privacy continues today, with his family choosing not to release the cause of death.His death at 66 leaves behind unanswered questions, yes. But it also leaves behind an undeniable legacy, a reminder that greatness doesn’t always last long, but it always lasts loud.","Easley died on november 14, 2025, according to confirmations from the pro football hall of fame and his family.

Percy Harvin’s Florida home fire brings fast response and raises safety concerns







Percy Harvin, the former NFL wide receiver and Florida Gators star, had a scary moment on Thursday evening when his home in Gainesville, Florida, suddenly caught fire. The flames grew fast, and people living on the same street could see the bright glow from their windows. One neighbor even took a quick video as the fire moved across the roof. Fire trucks reached the home within minutes, and the lights from the trucks filled the whole block. Early updates say everyone is okay, and no serious injuries have been reported.The house is only a short drive from the University of Florida campus, where Percy Harvin became a huge name while playing from 2006 to 2008. Because the fire spread quickly, firefighters and deputies asked people nearby to step out of their homes until things were safe again. Crews worked from different sides of the house to calm the flames. Officials still do not know what started the fire, and the investigation is still active.The Alachua County Sheriff’s Office said on Friday morning that deputies and fire rescue teams responded right away after getting the call about the fire on Thursday night.While deputies worked on evacuating nearby residences and obstructing the road, a representative stated Alachua County Fire Rescue managed the flames.Firemen used hoses from various angles to ensure the fire stopped spreading. It is unknown right now whether any family members including Percy Harvin were inside the house when the fire erupted.Because of his college career before becoming the 22nd pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, Percy Harvin, 37, is still really well liked in the Gainesville neighborhood.When they heard the news, several city supporters were anxious but were comforted after discovering no one was severely hurt.Also Read: Is Eminem Performing On NFL Thanksgiving?

Inside H-1B row: How Trump’s sudden U-turns could leave America losing the talent war to foreigners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/inside-h-1b-row-how-trumps-sudden-u-turns-could-leave-america-losing-the-talent-war-to-foreigners/articleshow/125333580.cms,"'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers

What are H1-B visas and who uses them



How are American jobs at risk



Supporters say the programme keeps America competitive



MAGA does not like Trump's U-turn







A heated national row over jobs, immigration and the future of the American workforce has intensified after President Donald Trump suggested that the United States “doesn’t have certain talents” earlier this week, even as the Trump Administation tightens rules around the H1-B visa programme.The GOP leader's latest comments have reignited a long-running political fight over whether foreign workers are helping American innovation or displacing American workers.The H1-B visa allows companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialised fields for up to six years. It is intended for people of “exceptional merit and ability”, typically with at least a bachelor’s degree. The tech sector remains the biggest user of the programme, accounting for up to 70 percent of applications each year. Engineering, consulting, healthcare and university research also rely heavily on the visa.India dominates the applicant pool, making up 73 per cent of all H1-B visa holders, followed by China at 12 per cent, according to Fox News. Universities and non-profit research institutions are exempt from the usual annual cap of 65,000 visas, plus an additional 20,000 for applicants with advanced degrees, which means the total number of approvals is often far higher.Pew Research Center estimates around 400,000 approvals in the last year alone.Opposition to the programme spans both Republicans and Democrats. Critics argue that the system is being abused to import cheaper labour and push aside American workers.In September, Trump issued a presidential proclamation accusing the H1-B system of being “deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labour”. He said this practice “has undermined both our economic and national security”.Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on each new H1-B visa application, effective September 21. His administration is also introducing stricter definitions of “specialty occupation”, expanding compliance inspections, and requiring employers to file applications directly rather than through third-party contractors.Many business leaders warn that harsh restrictions could push talent and investment overseas. The US Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit to block the new $100,000 fee, arguing it violates immigration law and would make the programme “cost-prohibitive” for small and mid-size companies.Elon Musk is among the most vocal defenders of the visa system, noting that many of the engineers who helped build Tesla and SpaceX first arrived in the United States on H1-B visas. He said, “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.”Despite his own sweeping restrictions, Trump stirred a row this week by insisting that the United States still needed foreign workers because “people have to learn”. He added that “the United States doesn’t have certain talents” and warned that some highly technical defence and technology roles cannot simply be filled by “taking people off an unemployment line”.His remarks have frustrated parts of his MAGA base, who view the comment as undercutting his America First message. Others argue it reveals the core tension at the centre of the H1-B debate: the nation wants to protect American jobs, but it also fears falling behind global competitors like China, which recently launched its own talent visa known as the K visa.",'no talent in u.s.': trump burns maga base for india reset?

Karoline Leavitt stirred a fresh row after claiming that climate change is “based on a fallacy."" Environmental activists were not very happy with White House Press Secretary's comments.Leavitt made the remark during an appearance on Fox News while attacking California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. Leavitt accused him of damaging the state with environmental policies she mocked as the “Green New Scam”.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





Vice President JD Vance spoke out on the issue of foreign workers in the US amid the ongoing H-1B row triggered by President Donald Trump's recent statement that US needs 'certain' talents from other countries. As Vance spoke to Sean Hannity, he said the Democrat model was to import more low-wage immigrants which he said hurt the jobs, wages and prosperity.Vance said the choice is between low-wage immigrants and American citizens empowered by technology. The VP said Trump's model is the second one which will pave prosperity for America.As Vance said US should avoid relying on low-wage workers and instead focus on using technology to empower the blue-collar workers, he struck a different chord with the President. Because the president said America lacks certain types of talent and cited the example of the battery plant in Georgia that was raided.“They raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out. They had people from South Korea that made batteries all their lives. You know, making batteries are very complicated. It’s not an easy thing and very dangerous,"" Trump said adding that the South Korean company had “like five or six hundred people, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it.Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. ""You're going to need that,"" Trump said when he was asked whether H-1B visa will be a big priority for his administration.H-1B visa program is for high-skilled individuals, mostly employed in tech and education sectors. But while Trump said US needs foreign workers, Vance said US does not need low-wage foreign workers.“Their (the Democrats) idea was the way that we get more prosperity is that you import more and more low-wage servants and that actually I think reduced prosperity, because it meant that a lot of our blue-collar workers were struggling. But if you use technology and you empower the blue-collar workers rather than replace them with foreign labor, I think they are going to do way better, they are going to make higher wages and the whole country is going to be better off,"" Vance said.""In other words, do you depend on low-wage immigrants or do you depend on American citizens bolstered by technology and innovation? That’s the Trump model,"" Vance added.","Vice president jd vance says america does not need low-wage foreign labors.
