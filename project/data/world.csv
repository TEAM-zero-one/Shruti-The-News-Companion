Sacred Piprahwa Buddhist relics put up for auction brought to India after 127 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sacred-piprahwa-buddhist-relics-put-up-for-auction-brought-to-india-after-127-yrs/articleshow/123006932.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a significant assertion by India of its ""cultural diplomacy"", the sacred Piprahwa relics of Buddha - taken away during the colonial period - have been brought back after 127 years through an outreach that started with the govt stepping in to stop their auction by Sotheby's Hong Kong in May. PM Narendra Modi hailed the return of the relics -gems as ""a joyous day for our cultural heritage"", after culture minister Gajendra Shekhawat received them at the Delhi airport on Wednesday. ""It would make every Indian proud that the sacred Piprahwa relics of Bhagwan Buddha have come home after 127 long years,"" Modi said on X. The relics have been kept at the National Museum and will be placed on public display after a special ceremony. ""It may be recalled that the Piprahwa relics were discovered in 1898 but were taken away from India during the colonial period. When they appeared in an international auction earlier this year, we worked to ensure they returned home. I appreciate all those who have been involved in this effort,"" the PM said.These sacred relics highlight India's close association with Buddha and his noble teachings, he said. ""It also illustrates our commitment to preserving and protecting different aspects of our glorious culture,"" the PM said.The return of the relics is a benchmark in cultural diplomacy and marks the first of its kind public-private partnership to repatriate antiquities with the govt collaborating with Godrej Industries Group, which privately acquired the entire collection of 349 gems, according to the culture ministry. This 'PPP' is being cited as a model in cultural collaboration that can help protect and preserve global heritage.It said amid global solidarity post-Pahalgam terror attack, the return of relics also strengthens India's role as the national steward of Buddhist heritage. The Piprahwa relic jewels were discovered in 1898 at the ancient Buddhist stupa at Piprahwa in UP.The relics were part of a larger find, including bone fragments, soapstone and crystal caskets, a sandstone coffer, excavated by British civil engineer William Claxton Peppe from the stupa - widely identified as ancient Kapilvastu, birthplace of the Buddha.","The sacred piprahwa relics of buddha - taken away during the colonial period - have been brought back after 127 years.

India-US trade deal stalemate: Ahead of his self-imposed tariff deadline, US President Donald Trump has said that a trade agreement with India has not yet been finalized. “India trade deal not been finalized,” said Trump. Asked whether India would face 20-25% tariff rates, he said, ""Yeah, I think so. India is my friend. They ended the war with Pakistan at my request...The deal with India is not finalised. India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs than almost any other country..."".

In the last few weeks Trump had said that the US is ‘nearing’ a deal with India. The likelihood of an interim trade deal announcement before the deadline appears slim for now.Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that India is preparing for a temporary reciprocal tariff rate ranging between 20-25%.

India Reacts To Trump’s Tariffs

India-US Trade Deal Stalemate

NEW DELHI: US president Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that India will have to pay 25 per cent tariff from August 1. Trump also said that India will have to pay an additional penalty for buying energy and arms from Russia. The 25% tariff rate announced for India is 1% less than the 26% declared by Trump in his April 2 'Liberation Day' conference.""Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.""Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD! INDIA WILL THEREFORE BE PAYING A TARIFF OF 25%, PLUS A PENALTY FOR THE ABOVE, STARTING ON AUGUST FIRST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.

What happens if they stay… Trump has indicated possible tariffs on Russia, potentially including secondary charges affecting nations that purchase Russian commodities, particularly oil.The United States and its allies supporting Kyiv consider these oil transactions as implicit backing for Russia, believing they strengthen Moscow's economy whilst undermining international sanctions.Meanwhile, Trump's reciprocal tariffs for countries will be effective August 1, 2025, without any further delays. Trump posted on Truth Social, ""THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE — IT STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED. A BIG DAY FOR AMERICA!!!"".India has made it clear that it will put national interest first in finalising any trade agreement. “The Government attaches the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of our farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs. The Government will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest, as has been the case with other trade agreements including the latest Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the UK,” a statement from the Ministry of Commerce & Industry reads.The government has said that it is assessing the impact of the 25% tariffs and also added that trade deal negotiations have been ongoing with US. “Over recent months, both India and the United States have participated in discussions aimed at establishing an equitable and reciprocally advantageous trade agreement. The commitment towards achieving this goal remains steadfast,” it said.Despite announcing the intent for a bilateral trade agreement during PM Narendra Modi's visit to the US, the two countries have not been able to work out an interim trade deal. Five rounds of talks have taken place between officials of the two countries and a sixth round is slated to take place in August end when a US team will visit India.Yesterday Trump had hinted that India could face tariffs between 20-25% since a trade deal had not been finalized. According to a Reuters report, Indian government officials have said that any tariffs the US may impose from August 1 are likely to be temporary in nature since talks are on to finalise a bilateral trade agreement by fall.Trump has repeatedly called for India to open its market to US goods, but the sticky points in the trade deal talks have been agriculture and dairy sectors.

NEW DELHI: In a fiery address in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar launched a stinging, thinly veiled attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi . Jaishankar branded him a ""China-guru"" and accused him of acquiring his knowledge of Beijing through ""Olympic invites and private tuitions from Chinese diplomats.""The foreign minister, defending his recent visit to China, hit back at allegations that he hasn't done enough on the China front, saying he held no ""secret meetings or deals"", unlike those who ""took China tuitions"" during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.""Some people got their China knowledge by going to the Olympics there. But, whom did they meet there? They did not just meet the Chinese, but also others,"" he said, in an apparent jibe at Rahul and Sonia Gandhi, who had attended the event as special invitees.""But there are 'China-gurus' now and one sir is sitting across from me, whose affection for China is so great that he made a deal between India and China – 'Chindia',"" Jaishankar said, referring to a term coined by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh.The minister said he had spent 41 years in foreign service and served as India's longest-serving ambassador to China, but still faced accusations from the opposition of being soft on Beijing.""There may have been some shortcomings on my part on China, as I did not get China teaching by going to the China Olympics, as I was not invited and was not a special person,” he remarked sharply.He alleged that cooperation between Pakistan and China had begun in the 1960s, but previous Indian governments failed to act decisively. “This 'China guru' says that China and Pakistan have come very close, which is the reality. They came together as we left PoK,” he added.Jaishankar dismissed the opposition's concerns on national security and reminded the House of China's control of Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port, a strategic loss, he said, which occurred during the UPA government’s tenure.""The China-guru gives us lectures on China, they should understand that this happened during their era,"" he asserted.On his recent China visit, Jaishankar maintained, ""Whatever I did and discussed was publicly open. I discussed terrorism, I discussed de-escalation and I discussed restrictions on trade which China has put. I made it clear that relations with China will develop only on three mutuals — mutual interest, mutual sensitivity, mutual respect.""""Unlike some other people, I made no secret meetings, I did no secret deals.

On the Pahalgam terrorist attack



On Operation Sindoor



""We attacked their (Pakistan) terror camps, terror launching pads and terror training camps, but they (Pakistan) considered it as an attack on their country. As a response, on 8th May, Pakistan attacked residential areas in India and defence installations. On 9th May, India attacked and destroyed Pakistan's 11 defence installations and airbases...After this, Pakistan was not in a position to fight back,"" Amit Shah said.

""They (Opposition leaders) are asking on whose request the ceasefire happened, it didn’t happen on anyone’s request. Pakistan, brought to its knees, called our Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) and pleaded to stop. From the very beginning, our intention was not war, nor did we want to harm the people of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi immediately said that if Pakistan is willing to stop, then let it stop. But even now, Rahul Gandhi is trying to escalate the matter and questioning it... Some people even raised doubts about who exactly was killed,"" he added.

On Operation Mahadev



""To the security forces behind Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev, who brought honour to India, I extend my heartfelt gratitude and salute their bravery. I also wish to convey my deep appreciation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who showed the firm resolve to respond precisely in line with the wishes of 1.4 billion Indians. For this, I wholeheartedly commend him,"" the Union home minister said.

""Under Operation Mahadev, our armed forces successfully killed three terrorists. Among them, Suleiman, a commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), was identified as the individual who had opened fire during the Pahalgam attack. Hamza Afghani, also a commander of LeT, was another high-ranking operative eliminated during the operation. Additionally, Zibran, a senior terrorist associated with LeT, was among those killed. The evidence unequivocally points to Lashkar-e-Taiba's involvement in orchestrating the Pahalgam attack,"" Shah added.

""During the security review meeting held after the Pahalgam attack, it was decided that the terrorists should be apprehended as quickly as possible. More critically, measures were taken to ensure they could not flee the country. As a result, 100 days after the attack, the perpetrators were located and neutralised,"" he added.

""The Intelligence Bureau (IB) received information about the terrorists' location on May 22. Following that, the IB and military intelligence conducted further investigations. Around July 22, their precise location was identified. Three terrorists have been killed. I received several messages from across the country, especially from families of those who were killed, saying these terrorists should be shot in the head. Coincidentally, during the encounter, they were indeed shot in the head.""

Attacks Chidambaram, criticises Congress-led UPA era



""Chidambaram ji posed a question, asking what evidence existed to prove that the terrorists were Pakistani. He openly challenged the justification for Operation Sindoor. This raises a critical question: Whom was Chidambaram ji trying to protect, Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), or the terrorists themselves?"" Shah asked.

""Interestingly, the very day he raised this question, terrorists were neutralized, underscoring the urgency and necessity of such operations. Chidambaram ji's statements reflect the mindset of the Congress party, which seems willing, for the sake of votebank politics, to lean towards supporting Pakistan, shielding terror outfits like LeT, and offering rhetorical solace to terrorists,"" he said.

""The people of this country are witnessing the mindset of the Congress party. Their priority is not national security, but politics. Their priority is not to eliminate terrorism, but to protect their vote bank. Their priority is not securing our borders, but indulging in appeasement politics,"" the Union home minister said.

NEW DELHI: The Rajya Sabha witnessed heated scenes on Wednesday during Home Minister Amit Shah's reply on Operation Sindoor, as the opposition led by Mallikarjun Kharge disrupted proceedings and raised slogans demanding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's presence in the House, before eventually staging a walkout.As Amit Shah rose to speak, opposition MPs began shouting slogans and hooting, demanding that the Prime Minister himself address the Upper House on India's cross-border strikes following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Responding to the uproar, Amit Shah said, “I want to respond to those asking about the Prime Minister.

If I can respond and clarify, then why insist on hearing from him?”Meanwhile, Kharge stood up and said, “There was a demand from the opposition that the PM should come to the House and give a reply. If the PM doesn't come to the House despite being present in Parliament premises, then it is an insult to the House.”After this, the debate soon turned confrontational, with Shah taking a sharp swipe at the leader of the opposition, saying, “It is irony that the person asking to speak here is the one not allowed to speak by his own party.”Following the exchange, opposition MPs walked out of the Rajya Sabha in protest, continuing to demand a response from the Prime Minister Narendra on Operation Sindoor.Later as the opposition walked out, Amit Shah briefed the House about a new counterterror operation ""Mahadev"". “On Monday, our security forces conducted Operation Mahadev, in which three terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack were killed,” he said.Meanwhile, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh posted on X, “The INDIA parties have just walked out of the Rajya Sabha at the gross insult to it by the Prime Minister who refused to be even present in the House at the end of the 16-hour debate on Op Sindoor-Pahalgam terror attack, let alone speak as a reply to the discussion.”Amit Shah responded to the opposition's criticism of the government over the Pahalgam terrorist attack during the Operation Sindoor debate on Wednesday.""I know why these people (INDIA bloc) are walking out -- they're doing it because, for years, they did nothing to stop terrorism due to their vote bank politics... that’s why they can't even bear to listen to this debate,"" the Union home minister said.""In Pahalgam, our citizens were brutally killed, selected and shot after being asked their religion, right in front of their families.

Top developments on Trump's imposition of 25% tariff on India :



'While India is our friend ... '



'Penalty' for Russian oil

What next for India-US trade talks?



'India paying price for Modi's friendship': Congress



NEW DELHI: President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff on imports from India, effective August 1. In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated that the country maintains ""some of the highest tariffs in the world"" and ""non-monetary trade barriers"" that he described as restrictive. He also raised concerns over India’s continued defense and energy purchases from Russia.“India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25%, plus a penalty for the above, starting on August first,” Trump said in his post.Trump announced a 25% tariff on India amid signs of some stalemate in the ongoing negotiations between the two countries on a bilateral trade deal.Trump, announcing the tariff, listed India's high tariffs, its procurement of ""vast majority"" of military equipment and energy from Russia as well as ""obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers"".India will be paying a ""tariff of 25 per cent plus a penalty"" from August 1, he said, adding ""we have a massive trade deficit with India"".The US president, in a social media post, however, described India as a ""friend"". While India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their tariffs are far too high, among the ""highest"" in the world, and they have the ""most strenuous and obnoxious"" non-monetary trade barriers, he said.Trump, announcing the tariff, listed India's procurement of ""vast majority"" of military equipment and energy from Russia as well as ""obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers"".""Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD! INDIA WILL THEREFORE BE PAYING A TARIFF OF 25%, PLUS A PENALTY FOR THE ABOVE, STARTING ON AUGUST FIRST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. MAGA!"" he said.Trump’s remarks on India come a day after he issued a 10-day ultimatum to Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine. As part of this push, Trump has threatened secondary sanctions on countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas.The proposed penalties are part of broader US efforts to isolate Russia economically and discourage countries from engaging in energy trade that could be seen as undermining international sanctions.The United States and US are engaged in high-level diplomatic talks to finalise a bilateral trade agreement.However recent weeks saw a stall in negotiations, with disagreements emerging around agriculture and market access. Trump, who had earlier hinted at a “very big” trade deal with India, shifted tone and said tariffs between 20% and 25% were under consideration.Despite the new levies, Indian officials are expected to continue pursuing trade negotiations with the US. The two countries had finalised a framework for a bilateral pact in April following a meeting between US Vice President JD Vance and PM Modi in New Delhi. The US officials are expected to visit India later in August to finalise the deal.The United States remains India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade amounting to $127.9 billion in 2024.Soon after Trump's announcement, Congress lashed out at the Centre saying the ""country is now bearing the cost of Narendra Modi’s ‘friendship’"".""Trump slapped a 25% tariff on India, along with a penalty. The country is now bearing the cost of Narendra Modi’s ‘friendship’. Modi campaigned for Trump, hugged him eagerly, posed for photos, and made it trend on social media. In the end, Trump still imposed tariffs on India. India’s foreign policy has completely failed,"" Congress said on X.""President Trump has slapped a tariff of 25% plus penalty on imports from India. All that taarif between him and Howdy Modi has meant little,"" Jairam Ramesh said.","President donald trump on wednesday announced a 25% tariff on imports from india, effective august 1.

A 41-year-old Indian man, believed to be an Indian national, has been charged with assault and endangering the safety of an aircraft after an easyJet flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Glasgow on Sunday after he threatened to bomb the plane while shouting “Allahu Akbar”.Abhay Devdas Nayak, who lives in Luton, appeared at Paisley Sheriff Court, in Paisley on Monday for his petition hearing, where he was presented with the first draft of charges against him, namely assault and endangering the safety of an aircraft, in solemn proceedings. “Solemn procedure” is the legal process used in Scotland for prosecuting serious criminal offences.Nayak was arrested and charged after the flight made an emergency landing at Glasgow airport at 8.20 am on Sunday.In the middle of the flight from Luton to Glasgow departing at around 7am, passengers were left terrified when a man came out of the toilets and started raising his fists shouting: “I am going to bomb the plane! Death to America! Death to Trump”, and then repeatedly shouting “Allahu Akbar”. He also pushed and was aggressive towards female air hostesses. A male passenger in row 21 then got out of his seat and grabbed the man and threw him to the ground, tackled him and pinned him to the floor.Two other men also helped restrain him. The men searched the man’s pockets whilst the airline crew searched his bag.A witness told the Sun that the men got the man’s wallet out of his pocket and “he appeared to be an Indian national carrying a refugee status card”. They asked him why he was threatening to bomb the plane. He replied: “Because I want to send a message to Trump.”They continued to pin him to the ground whilst the flight landed in a remote corner of Glasgow airport where it was met by fire engines. Police officers came on board, handcuffed the man and escorted him off.Counter-terrorism officers are assessing videos of the incident.A large number of illegal migrants and asylum-seekers live in Luton.Nayak’s first hearing was held in private in front of a sheriff. He did not enter any pleas and was remanded in custody. He will next appear on Aug 5 for a full committal.The bomb threat happened whilst US President Donald Trump was on a five-day private trip to Scotland to play golf at his golf resorts.easyJet said their “crew are trained to assess all situations and act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other customers is not compromised at any time”.","A 41-year-old indian man, believed to be an indian national, has been charged with assault and endangering the safety of an aircraft.

Indus Waters Treaty inked by Nehru bars India from desilting dams: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indus-waters-treaty-inked-by-nehru-bars-india-from-desilting-dams-pm-modi/articleshow/122983420.cms,"Poll Should India consider revising or renegotiating the Indus Waters Treaty? Yes, it's necessary No, it should remain unchanged

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday hit out at the decision to sign the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, disclosing that the water-sharing pact signed by first PM Jawaharlal Nehru had a clause which required India not to carry out desilting of dams, with the gates of one of them welded to prevent any accidental opening up.""The country will be shocked to learn that these facts have been hidden and suppressed. Whenever a dam is built, there is a mechanism for cleaning it, for desilting, as silt and other debris reduce its capacity. Nehru agreed to a condition from Pakistan that the silt and debris accumulating in these dams could not be cleaned. Our dams, our water, but Pakistan's decision. There's even a dam where the desilting gate has been welded shut to prevent accidental opening. Pakistan had Nehru write that India would not clean the silt from its dams without Pakistan's consent. This agreement was against the country, and Nehru later admitted the mistake,"" Modi said in Lok Sabha Tuesday.He said that Nehru acknowledged the mistake to Nirajan Das Gulati, who was involved with the agreement. ""Nehru told him that he hoped the treaty would open the way for solving other problems, but they were still where they started.Nehru was only able to see the immediate effects, but the truth is that this agreement set the country back significantly, harming our farmers and agriculture. Nehru's diplomacy didn't consider existence of farmers,"" Modi said.After the Pahalgam massacre, India had suspended the Indus Waters Treaty and has begun desilting exercise, apart from drawing up plans to channel the water to Rajasthan and Gujarat through a network of canals. The welded gate is, however, preventing agencies from undertaking complete desilting of the dam.Hitting out at Congress for signing the agreement and mortgaging national interest, the PM said: ""These rivers have been a part of India's cultural heritage for thousands of years, contributing significantly to making India fertile and prosperous... The Indus Waters Treaty was a direct betrayal of India's identity and pride... He agreed to give 80% of the water from these rivers, originating from India, to Pakistan, leaving this vast country with only 20%. Can someone explain the rationale, what was the national interest, where was diplomacy?""He said that the water, which rightfully belonged to India, was given to Pakistan and created a water crisis and conflict among the states. ""If this treaty had not been signed, several major projects could have been built over the western rivers. Farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi would have ample water, and there would be no drinking water issues. India could have generated electricity for industrial progress. Not only that, Nehru also gave millions of rupees to Pakistan for canal construction,"" he said.","Pm narendra modi hit out at the decision to sign the indus waters treaty with pakistan.

He even went on to talk about my mother's tears. But he never answered why the ceasefire was announced. Sahab, you talk about history, I will talk about the present,"" Priyanka said in Lok Sabha.""Union home minister spoke about my mother's tears today. I want to answer this. My mother's tears fell when terrorists killed my father. Today, when I talk about those 26 people (victims of the Pahalgam attack), it is because I understand their pain,"" she added.Earlier in the day, Shah accused Sonia Gandhi of shedding tears for the terrorists who were killed in the 2008 Batla House encounter in Delhi.Shah said he was surprised to see then Congress chief Sonia Gandhi crying after the encounter.""I would like to remember Salman Khurshid. One day, I was having an early breakfast when I saw him weeping on TV while leaving Sonia Gandhi's house. I thought something big had happened. He said that Sonia Gandhi was in tears over the Batla House incident. If you had to cry, you should have done that for Shaheed Mohan Sharma and not the Batla House terrorists,"" Shah said.""The Congress has no right to question the government over what steps it has taken to tackle terror,"" he added.On September 19, 2008, two terrorists of the Indian Mujahideen, hiding in a flat at Batla House in Jamia Nagar, were eliminated by an armed police unit. Mohan Chand Sharma, an inspector with the Delhi Police, was killed in action during the encounter.Shah also traced the back to India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, as he criticised successive Congress governments for an alleged lack of strength in their foreign policy, particularly towards Pakistan.“Today, China is in the United Nations Security Council, and India is not,” Shah said, referring to the permanent membership of the UNSC.""Jawaharlal Nehru's stand is responsible for this. When our jawans were facing Chinese soldiers in Doklam, Rahul Gandhi was holding a meeting with the Chinese ambassador. This love for China has passed down three generations—from Jawaharlal Nehru to Sonia Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi,"" Shah added.He further said, “PM Narendra Modi is trying his best to get India to become a part of the UN Security Council.”Referring to the 1962 war with China, Shah claimed, “Then PM Nehru bid goodbye to Assam in a speech on Akashvani (state radio).”He also said that in 1948, Indian armed forces were in a decisive position to take back Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, but “then PM Nehru declared a unilateral ceasefire.”","Priyanka accused the centre of evading accountability for the pahalgam attack by ""listing out the entire gandhi family"" shah accused sonia gandhi of shedding tears for the terrorists who were killed in the 2008 batla house encounter in delhi.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122973999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1134620,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Operation Sindoor debate: BJP claims 'Indira Gandhi sought US help to end 1971 war'; hits back at Rahul Gandhi's 'political will' remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-debate-bjp-claims-indira-gandhi-sought-us-help-to-end-1971-war-hits-back-at-rahul-gandhis-political-will-remark/articleshow/122999405.cms,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Wednesday launched a sharp counterattack in the Lok Sabha against leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi ’s criticism of the Modi government’s handling of Operation Sindoor Citing historical records, BJP MPs Anurag Thakur and Nishikant Dubey alleged that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had sought US intervention to halt the 1971 India-Pakistan war — a move they claimed undercut India’s battlefield advantage.This political flashpoint erupted a day after Rahul Gandhi, in his speech in the Lok Sabha, accused the government of lacking political will and imposing restrictions on the armed forces during the May 7 cross-border strikes launched in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. Comparing Operation Sindoor with the 1971 war, Gandhi said Indira Gandhi gave the military full freedom, even as the US Seventh Fleet approached Indian waters.Responding during Zero Hour, Anurag Thakur said, “If you dig a little deeper in history, the layers start unravelling. The then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had written to US President Nixon. It appears as though a supplicant was pleading before the US president.”Thakur read out from a letter dated December 5, 1971, in which Indira Gandhi asked Nixon to persuade Pakistan to desist from aggression.Thakur added, “The nation has to decide whether the government of that day was iron or an irony.”He accused the Congress of distorting history and questioned whether Indira Gandhi lacked trust in India’s armed forces. “This family is adept at bending and begging the US to ask Pakistan to end the war,” he said, drawing protests from Congress benches.Echoing Thakur’s claims, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said, “This is a letter dated 5 December 1971, which Indira Gandhi wrote to the President of America, Richard Nixon. She wrote that our government is in danger, and India wants a ceasefire; you convince Pakistan. Such a big surrender, such a big lie.”Dubey claimed that despite India having captured 93,000 Pakistani soldiers, the war ended with a sudden ceasefire. “The entire history of 1971 is contained in this one letter. When people thought we could take Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, a ceasefire happened. After looking at this history, don’t you think the Congress controlled the entire media?” he said.He further alleged that Congress misrepresented the events of 1971 to elevate its leadership’s image, saying, “India Gandhi surrendered in 1971.”The BJP’s attack came after Rahul Gandhi’s remarks questioning the Modi government's strategic messaging and military decisions during Operation Sindoor. Gandhi had stated, “Yesterday, Rajnath Singh compared 1971 and Sindoor. I’d remind him — there was political will in 1971. The Seventh Fleet was approaching, and the PM said do whatever is needed. Indira Gandhi told General Manekshaw: take six months, one year — you must have freedom of action. One lakh Pakistani soldiers surrendered and a new country was formed.”Rahul Gandhi also raised questions over instructions given to the Indian Air Force during the May 7 operation, alleging that pilots were told not to target Pakistani air defence systems. “IAF made no mistake. The mistake was made by the political leadership, which said military targets could not be attacked,” he said, citing statements by Captain Shiv Kumar, Defence Attaché to Indonesia, and CDS General Anil Chauhan.Slamming the government’s post-operation messaging, Rahul Gandhi said, “The Government of India informed Pakistan we don’t want to fight. We have simply carried out this action.” He also referred to US President Donald Trump’s multiple statements claiming he brokered the ceasefire. “If he’s lying, then let PM Modi stand here and say: ‘Donald Trump, you are a liar.’ If he has the courage of Indira Gandhi, let him say it here in Parliament,” Rahul Gandhi said.",Bjp mps anurag thakur and nishikant dubey alleged that former prime minister indira gandhi had sought us intervention to halt the 1971 india-pakistan war.

""The nation has to decide whether the govt of that day was 'iron or an irony',"" he said, amid protests from Congress members.Urging Birla to reprimand Rahul for his ""habitual delinquency"" and highlighting the letter to Nixon, Dubey said, ""She had literally begged before him to use his influence to stop the war with Pakistan."" Rahul has once again ""unabashedly betrayed"" public trust by twisting well-documented historical facts, which has become his ""habit to glorify his family"", Dubey said.Thakur wondered whether Indira did not trust the armed forces and chose to plead with the US to halt the war. ""Why did she approach the US?"" he asked.Putting up inaccurate facts is a straight case of violation of speaker's directions, Dubey said and alleged Rahul has an ""uncanny habit of making false claims"".","Bjp mp nishikant dubey accused lop rahul gandhi of using ""distorted and inaccurate facts"" dubey attached a copy of indira's letter to nixon on dec 5, 1971, in the house.

"Pakistan, China in a tango due to Congress government's decisions: EAM Jaishankar in Rajya Sabha",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-china-in-a-tango-due-to-congress-governments-decisions-eam-jaishankar-in-rajya-sabha/articleshow/123005949.cms,"NEW DELHI: EAM S Jaishankar Wednesday took a swipe at Congress netas pretending to have expertise on India's bilateral ties with China, calling them ""China gurus"" while countering their claims that Pakistan and China have come closer in recent years. He said the two have come close over decades as earlier Congress regimes left the land of POK between them.Intervening during the discussion on Operation Sindoor in Rajya Sabha, Jaishankar dismissed opposition's questions on whether US President Trump brokered the ceasefire, saying there was no call between PM Modi and Trump between April 22 and June 16. The ceasefire was announced on May 10. He also said the halt to military action was not linked to trade, as Trump claimed.Countering claims made by Rahul Gandhi that Pakistan and China are working as a nexus, the EAM said the countries are in a tango because of the decisions taken during Congress's governance. ""There are China gurus now, one is an honourable member sitting across me (Jairam Ramesh). His affection for China was so much he conjoined India and China - Chindia. There is another China guru (referring to Rahul),"" the minister said. The term Chindia was used by Ramesh in his book 'Making Sense of Chindia: Reflections on China and India'.""China gurus say Pakistan and China have close ties; that is true. But how did they come close? It was because in the middle, we had left POK.This has been happening since 1962 and 1963. In 1963, Pakistan gave Shaksgam Valley to China. Karakoram highway's planning started in 1967 and finished in 1986. You know whose govt was there. Military cooperation between Pakistan and China happened in 1967 and nuclear collaboration happened in 1976, and they make it appear that all this has happened overnight. ..,"" the EAM said.Jaishankar drew a comparison between how past govts and Modi regime responded to terrorism . Months after the blasts in Mumbai trains (July 2006), he said, there was a meeting in Havana in Sept where an agreement was signed between PMs of India and Pakistan. ""Instead of holding Pakistan responsible, we said we condemn all acts of terrorism and agree it's a scourge that needs to be dealt with and by the way we will resume our composite dialogue... You were equating the perpetrator and victim,"" he said. Referring to the 26/11 attack in Mumbai in 2008, Jaishankar said in July 2009, at a meeting in Sharm El Sheikh, it was agreed that terrorism was the main threat to ""both countries"".""After a gruesome terror attack, they were ready for dialogue. How can the world take you seriously?"" he said.",Eam s jaishankar called congress netas pretending to have expertise on india's bilateral ties with china. He said the two have come close over decades as earlier congress regimes left the land of pok between them.
