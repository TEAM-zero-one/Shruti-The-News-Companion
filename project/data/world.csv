Gold Card versus EB-5



EB-5's rising momentum



MUMBAI: With a waiting queue running into several decades for an employment-linked Green Card, a growing number of Indians continue to resort to a faster way to live permanently in the US.The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it-despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card. The EB-5 program also finds favour among high networth individuals (HNIs) in India, who are looking at securing their children's future in America. Investors initially obtain a conditional Green Card, which is later converted into a permanent Green Card. (See table).Applicants are required to invest $800,000 (about Rs 7.1 crore) or $1,050,000 (about Rs 9.3 crore), depending on the project's type and/or location, and must create or preserve at least 10 full-time American jobs. Most investors route their funds through regional centers (USCIS-designated entities) that pool EB-5 capital into large-scale projects. Over 90% of EB-5 investments in recent years have been made through these centers rather than via direct investments.Soon after being sworn in as US president, Donald Trump announced he would launch a 'Gold Card'; commerce secretary Howard Lutnick added this could replace the EB-5 program with Gold-Card funds going directly to the US govt. This led to jitters among the EB-5 investors and those aspiring for a Green Card under this investment-linked route.On Sept 19, Trump signed an executive order to introduce the 'Gold Card' visa program. Individuals wishing to qualify for Gold Card must make an unrestricted gift of $1 million (about Rs 8.4 crore) to US Department of Commerce. If a corporation or similar entity makes the gift on behalf of the individual, the required amount rises to $2 million (about Rs 16.8 crore).The modalities of the Gold Card are yet to be rolled out. A key difference between the two programs lies not just in the amounts to be paid, but the fact that the Gold Card entails a 'fee', whereas the EB-5 program requires an 'investment'-with a return on capital.As things stand, the long-term future of the EB-5 program remains unclear. Immigration attorneys point out that the EB-5 Regional Center (RC) Program has been reauthorised until 2027 by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) of 2022. Those who have invested, or plan to invest, before Sept 2026 will be protected from future lapses in the program owing to the RIA's grandfathering clause. The clause seems to have eased initial jitters among aspiring investors. Many of India's high networth families are turning to this path to secure long-term US residency for their kids. Mid-career professionals already in the US on H-1B visas -where Green Card backlogs stretch to decades-are increasingly joining them.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, the EB-5 program drew $4.1 billion in the first three quarters of FY2025- nearly matching investment for the entire previous year.Since the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) came into effect in 2022, around 1,050- 1,150 Indians have filed EB-5 applications, according to USCIS filing data. This places India as the second-largest EB-5 applicant group globally, accounting for roughly 20- 22% of all new post-RIA filings. The demand has remained consistent month-to-month, driven by both H-1B families already in the US facing decades-long Green Card wait times and by high networth families in India planning long-term residency and education pathways for their children.""Most people still believe that once their child gets into a decent US university, they can build a career there,"" said Piyush Gupta, vice-president of CanAm Enterprises, which operates several licensed regional centers. However, uncertainties arising out of ever-changing and tightening H-1B policies prompts many to explore EB-5, he added.For Prahlad Purohit, a 43-year-old Google engineer from Mumbai, the decision was driven by family rather than finance. After nearly a decade in the US, he feared his two India-born children would lose their dependent status when they turned 21. ""My son couldn't even apply for internships because he wasn't a resident,"" Purohit said over a call from San Francisco. ""Both my children grew up here, they don't know the system in India. That's when I chose EB-5.""Speaking to TOI on a Zoom from Mountview, California, he recalls how he selected his investment. ""It's like the Wild West, with many claiming they're the best and promising exorbitant returns on top of the Green Card-from almond farms to hotel chains,"" he said. ""I finally chose a real estate development in Manhattan that was building a corporate skyscraper.""Despite the high approval rate for applications, the EB-5 route remains a high-stakes bet: a blend of financial investment, immigration strategy, and faith in the American market. As Gupta put it, ""For many of our clients, this isn't about returns-it's about certainty. They'd rather invest in a project than a house, if it means their family never has to rely on H-1B visa lottery again.""","Investment-linked green card program (eb-5) comes in handy for those h-1bs who can afford it.

Taliban to appoint its 1st diplomat in Delhi this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/taliban-to-appoint-its-1st-diplomat-in-delhi-this-month/articleshow/125041810.cms,"Taliban Confirms India’s Intel, ISI And Pakistan Army Backing IS-Khorasan Terror Network Operations

NEW DELHI: India and Afghanistan are set to further ramp up their diplomatic relations with the appointment of a diplomat by the Taliban regime here this month. This will be the first official placement of a diplomat by the Taliban in India since their return to Kabul in August 2021 and will be followed - as conveyed by Kabul to Indian authorities - by the appointment of another diplomat in late December or early January.The relationship has progressed steadily this year, culminating in an unprecedented visit by foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India last month. India has reinforced its role as a trusted partner of Afghanistan with its continued supply of aid and medical supplies to the country, even in the absence of an official recognition by the Indian govt of the dispensation in Kabul.Muttaqi's visit saw India announcing its decision to upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to the level of embassy and also agreeing to accept Taliban diplomats. Both sides are expected to soon have a charge d'affaires leading their respective missions.A Taliban spokesperson on Sunday expressed appreciation for India's donation of over 16 tonnes of anti-vector-borne disease medicines. ""This latest donation underscores India's longstanding partnership and developmental support to Afghanistan. By contributing essential medical supplies, India reaffirms its role as a reliable partner in promoting health, stability and humanitarian cooperation in the region,"" he said.Muttaqi's visit was significant as it also saw the Taliban backing India's sovereignty over J&K. India too has firmly supported Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity, at a time the Taliban's ties with Pakistan have hit a nadir because of heavy border clashes. The two countries have reached a ceasefire but the threat of an escalation is yet to fully dissipate.

American rapper Nicki Minaj stirred row after publicly thanking President Donald Trump after he spoke out about the persecution of Christians in Nigeria. Minaj praised Trump’s remarks as “powerful” and “heartfelt,” but some fans accused her of aligning with the MAGA base.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Friday, claimed that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and that “radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter.” He added, “The United States cannot stand by while such atrocities are happening in Nigeria, and numerous other countries. We stand ready, willing, and able to save our great Christian population around the world!”Minaj shared her response, expressing gratitude. “Reading this made me feel a deep sense of gratitude,” she posted on X. “We live in a country where we can freely worship God. No group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion. We don’t have to share the same beliefs in order for us to respect each other.”Minaj has been vocal about her Christian faith and its impact on a global scale. “Numerous countries all around the world are being affected by this horror [and] it’s dangerous to pretend we don’t notice,” she said. “Thank you to the president [and] his team for taking this seriously.God bless every persecuted Christian. Let’s remember to lift them up in prayer.”Her comments drew praise from some conservatives but backlash from a portion of her fanbase. Others pointed out that Minaj had previously spoken about social justice and women’s rights, accusing her of inconsistency.The situation in Nigeria remains alarming, with reports of entire villages being destroyed and thousands displaced by Islamist groups. “Even being conservative, it’s probably 4,000 to 8,000 Christians killed annually,” said Mark Walker, Trump’s ambassador-designate for International Religious Freedom. “This has been going on for years, from ISWAP to Islamist Fulani ethnic militias, and the Nigerian government has to be much more proactive. ”Trump has said he directed members of the House Appropriations Committee to investigate and that Nigeria will be redesignated a “country of particular concern” under US law, a label reserved for severe violations of religious freedom.",Nicki minaj publicly thanked president donald trump for speaking out about the persecution of christians in nigeria.

The trade talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan last week resulted in several breakthrough agreements, easing tensions for the two economies.These ranged from soybean purchases, tariff cuts and rare-earth export restrictions and more, though details were initially withheld.The White House on Saturday unveiled the complete terms of the deal, confirming that both sides have agreed to a temporary pause in their prolonged trade dispute.The agreement freezes new tariffs and export curbs, reinstates major agricultural purchases, and creates a one-year negotiation window. The White House said it also blocks a planned 100% tariff on Chinese goods, while China will pause its latest restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets used in key industries.Here are what the two nations have agreed to:A key provision is a reduction in US tariffs on Chinese imports linked to supplies of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl. The tariff rate on those products, imposed earlier this year at 20%, will be lowered to 10%.Officials said this will bring the overall US tariff rate on Chinese imports down to roughly 47%, from the current 57%, once Trump’s earlier duties and a 10% “reciprocal” tariff introduced in April are accounted for, Reuters reported.Beijing has agreed to suspend for one year the new export controls announced this month, which would have required licences for the export of rare earths and magnets, even when present only in trace amounts. The White House described this as “the de facto removal of controls China imposed in April 2025 and October 2022.”China will issue general licences covering rare earths, gallium, germanium, antimony and graphite for US users and their supply chains.Washington has agreed to freeze plans for a one-year expansion of its commerce department entity list, which would have prohibited US companies from selling technology, including semiconductor manufacturing equipment, to any firm more than 50% owned by an already-restricted entity.The measure would have added thousands of additional Chinese companies to the blacklist.China will also suspend all retaliatory tariffs introduced since 4 March, covering a wide range of American products including chicken, wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy.In addition, it will withdraw non-tariff countermeasures taken over the same period, such as putting US companies on “end user” and “unreliable entity” lists, Reuters reported.China has committed to buying at least 12 million metric tonnes of US soybeans during the final two months of 2025, and at least 25 million metric tonnes per year for the following three years. Purchases of US sorghum and hardwood logs will also resume.The White House acknowledged that China had “largely stopped buying US soybeans this autumn,” after turning to Brazil and Argentina instead.China will extend its market-based tariff exclusion process on US imports until 31 December 2026 and will terminate antitrust, anti-monopoly and anti-dumping investigations targeting American firms in the semiconductor supply chain.Beijing will also restart trade operations from Nexperia’s China facilities, allowing legacy chip production to reach global markets.China will remove retaliatory measures linked to the US Section 301 investigation into China’s control over global shipbuilding and logistics. The US, in turn, will pause for one year the new port fees that took effect on October 14, which applied to Chinese-built, -owned and -flagged vessels and were designed to boost US shipbuilding, as per a Reuters report. The White House said these fees, coupled with newly imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese-made ship-to-shore cranes, had already disrupted cargo movements and driven up shipping costs.Negotiations on maritime issues will continue alongside talks with South Korea and Japan on reviving US shipbuilding.The new arrangement marks a fragile but significant de-escalation in the trade war between Washington and Beijing, at least for the next 12 months.","The white house on saturday unveiled the complete terms of the deal.

Power bat, DH/OF option





Theare entering a crucial offseason, and all eyes are on the uncertain future of their franchise slugger, Pete Alonso. With Alonso potentially heading toward free agency or a trade, the Mets could be forced to find a new power bat to anchor their lineup. One intriguing - and surprising - name emerging as a potential target is Atlanta Braves veteranOzuna, a three-time All-Star, two-time Silver Slugger, and Gold Glove winner, has been a central figure in the Braves’ offensive success in recent seasons. Now, as Atlanta reportedly looks to shift its approach to the designated hitter position, Ozuna’s future with the team appears uncertain - and the Mets could take advantage of that situation.With Alonso’s future hanging in the balance, New York Mets’ front office is expected to explore every avenue to maintain offensive firepower. Ozuna could offer a proven, right-handed power bat capable of driving in runs and keeping pressure on opposing pitchers. The 34-year-old slugger remains a formidable threat at the plate, known for his ability to produce consistent power numbers and handle high-leverage situations.Last season, the Braves reportedly attempted to trade Marcell Ozuna at the deadline, but multiple deals fell through. The veteran, who holds 10-5 rights (10 years in MLB, 5 with the same team), was said to have vetoed three separate trade proposals. Despite that, the expectation heading into 2026 is that Atlanta could revisit potential moves involving him as they adjust their roster strategy.Reports suggest that Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos and his staff are leaning toward a more flexible approach for the designated hitter role. Instead of relying on a full-time DH, the team plans to rotate players like Ronald Acuña Jr., Jurickson Profar, Sean Murphy, and Matt Olson through the position to keep them fresh. This marks a strategic shift that could make Ozuna expendable as Atlanta focuses on lineup versatility for the 2026 campaign.If Alonso departs, the New York Mets will need an established veteran presence to fill the void in the middle of their order. Marcell Ozuna’s proven track record and familiarity with NL East pitching make him an ideal candidate. A short-term deal - likely one or two years - would give New York both stability and flexibility while allowing Ozuna to continue showcasing his value.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Detroit Tigers could sign $130 million Philadelphia Phillies All-Star as he prepares to enter free agency Seeing Marcell Ozuna in Mets colors would certainly shock fans, given his long-standing rivalry with New York as a Brave. However, the move could be exactly what the New York Mets need to stay competitive in the NL East. If Alonso’s time in Queens is nearing its end, Ozuna could serve as both a short-term spark and a bridge to the next era of Mets baseball - ensuring the team’s power production doesn’t skip a beat heading into 2026.","Marcell ozuna is a three-time all-star, two-time silver slugger, and gold glove winner.

Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley is facing a heartbreaking loss after his older brother, Jabari Henley, was shot and killed on October 31, 2025, in Los Angeles. The 34-year-old’s death has left the Henley family devastated and the NFL community rallying behind the young defender, who now carries the weight of personal grief in the middle of a demanding season. Authorities confirmed that Jabari died after being shot in what investigators believe was not a random attack.Early reports suggest the shooting may have stemmed from a personal dispute, though details remain limited as the Los Angeles Police Department continues to investigate. So far, no arrests have been made, and police have asked witnesses to come forward with any information that could help identify the suspect. The timing of the tragedy couldn’t be more difficult for Daiyan, who learned the news just days before the Chargers’ scheduled matchup against the Tennessee Titans. Still, the 24-year-old linebacker made the emotional decision to play, turning his pain into motivation.“My brother was more than his life’s mistakes. He was family. I’ll carry him with me this game,” Henley said before kickoff.The Henley family has endured multiple heartbreaks in recent years.Daiyan’s father, Eugene “Big U” Henley Jr., is currently on trial for the death of Rayshawn Williams, Daiyan’s close friend and former teammate. That case has already placed the family under intense public scrutiny, and Jabari’s murder now adds another layer of sorrow and complexity to their lives. Those close to the family say they’ve been leaning on faith and each other while navigating the dual weight of tragedy and public attention. As investigators work through leads, the family continues to plead for justice and privacy.Inside the Chargers camp, teammates and coaches have rallied around Daiyan Henley, offering him space, support, and understanding as he grieves. Those close to the rookie say he’s remained composed and focused despite the heartbreak. Henley has always been known for his toughness and perseverance — traits that helped him rise from his college days at Washington State to the NFL. But this loss has tested him in a way that goes far beyond the game.As the Chargers take the field, fans and teammates will be watching not just his performance, but the quiet strength of a player honoring his brother’s memory through determination and heart.","Shooting in los angeles kills jabari henley, brother of chargers linebacker daiyan henley.

The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold

For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The asian arowana (scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

From college glory to family milestones



More coverage on NFL:

J.J. McCarthy made his long-awaited comeback in grand style, leading the Minnesota Vikings to a thrilling 27-24 road win over the Detroit Lions on Sunday. After missing five games with a sprained ankle, McCarthy’s performance reminded everyone why he’s one of the NFL’s most promising young quarterbacks. Throwing for 143 yards and two clutch touchdowns, he powered Minnesota to a .500 record and back into NFC North contention—just as both the Lions and Packers stumbled on the same day.But as much as Sunday was about redemption on the field, it was also about family off it.Just weeks after welcoming their first child, McCarthy’s fiancée Katya Kuropas celebrated her partner’s big win in the sweetest way possible. She shared an adorable photo of baby Rome dressed in his tiny Vikings onesie, calling him dad’s “No. 1 fan.” Born on September 12, little Rome has already become the heart of McCarthy’s world—and the newest symbol of joy for the young couple.McCarthy and Kuropas’ love story began long before the NFL lights. They met back in high school at Nazareth Academy in Illinois and have been inseparable ever since. Even when McCarthy transferred to IMG Academy during the pandemic, their bond only grew stronger. After McCarthy led the Michigan Wolverines to the 2024 NCAA Championship, he proposed—marking a new chapter in their journey.Their romance has always been filled with genuine affection. On Kuropas’ birthday in January 2025, McCarthy penned a touching message to his “Queen,” writing, “She’s my everything - my muse, my rock, and the heart of my universe. For what is a flame without its wick. A Viking without a star to guide him. Thank you forever, my love, for never wavering when the inevitable storms arise on our voyage together.”The couple’s relationship has unfolded beautifully both in private and public. In May 2025, they shared that they were expecting their first child, posting, “The best surprises come when you least expect them. Our sweet baby boy is arriving in September and we couldn’t be happier🩵🍼.”A few months later, their dream came true. They introduced their son to the world, writing, “Welcome to the world Rome Micah McCarthy ✨The sweetest, most perfect gift from God!! We are so unbelievably blessed to be your parents💙.”As McCarthy continues to rise in the NFL, it’s clear that his biggest win isn’t just on the field—it’s the family waiting for him at home.","J.j. mccarthy made his long-awaited comeback in grand style, leading the minnesota vikings to a thrilling 27-24 road win over the detroit lions on sunday.

The MedMen LAX lawsuit adds a legal weapon to an ongoing perception war



Cardi B pregnancy with Stefon Diggs puts Offset’s name in yet another tabloid cycle

Offset is walking into a perfect storm and this time, it isn’t a music rollout, a messy tweet, or a rapper-vs-rapper rivalry fueling the headlines. The former Migos rapper is now being dragged into a civil courtroom after a Los Angeles security guard accused him of assault, battery and emotional distress during an incident at a MedMen dispensary earlier this year. Lawsuits are one thing but this situation isn’t happening in a vacuum.This legal fight arrives at the very same moment Offset’s personal life is under the microscope again, as his divorce from Cardi B plays out publicly, while she prepares to welcome a baby with Patriots WR Stefon Diggs. It's a scandal, timeline collisions and reputation damage all at once.The guard, Jim Sanchez, alleges he was physically attacked after simply asking Offset for identification, a basic dispensary requirement. His lawsuit describes “significant physical and emotional injuries,” a hospital visit, headaches, and neck trauma. Offset’s side counters with an entirely different story, claiming Sanchez escalated, “spat” at him and charged toward the rapper, which they say triggered Offset to punch back in self-defense.Two versions of the same moment. One real verdict is still pending. But the stakes are bigger than just damages, this is happening in the exact era where Offset’s public image cannot survive another hit.Cardi B’s personal arc, from “in a good space” to preparing to have a child with Stefon Diggs in February 2025, has made every Offset headline feel heavier, louder, and more symbolic.Her past accusation that he harassed her, tried to manipulate bloggers, and even contacted his new girlfriend has already shaped how people react to any new allegation involving his name. This case now reads like a character test to fans, not just a police-style incident report.Offset isn’t just fighting a lawsuit. He’s fighting a narrative and that may be tougher to beat than Sanchez.Also Read: “Hailee gotta sue”: Stephen A.

Possible connection to ISIS

Political reaction









A potential ISIS-inspired attack in Michigan was foiled just hours before Halloween, after FBI arrested multiple suspects allegedly plotting a “pumpkin day” assault, reports CNN.The operation was carried out early Friday, preventing what director Kash Patel described as a “violent attack” planned for the holiday weekend.The plan was uncovered after months of online surveillance of a chatroom where several men allegedly discussed carrying out an ISIS-inspired attack in US. According to officials, an undercover FBI operative had been inserted into the group during the early stages of planning.The suspects had recently gone to a shooting range armed with AK-47s and other weapons, practising tactical reloads and firing dozens of rounds. That was when investigators intercepted a spooky reference to “pumpkin day” — believed to be a coded term for Halloween. This led the FBI to act immediately.“This morning the FBI thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend,” FBI Director Kash Patel said on X.“Thanks to the men and women of FBI and law enforcement everywhere standing guard 24/7 and crushing our mission to defend the homeland.”Raids were conducted in the Detroit suburbs, where heavily armed FBI and Michigan State Police teams stormed at least three homes. Investigators seized several legally owned firearms, computers and mobile devices as part of their operation.“This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” according to CNN’s chief law enforcement analyst John Miller, citing briefings from officials.At least two suspects have been arrested, while three others are being questioned. Among them, one was identified as a 16-year-old juvenile. The group had allegedly debated the timing of their attack, with some members pushing to strike on Halloween, while others argued they needed more time to prepare.Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she had been briefed on the arrests and thanked authorities for their swift action. “This morning, I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” Whitmer posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed operations in Dearborn and Inkster, saying, “There is no current threat to public safety.” The Dearborn Police Department also reassured residents that there was “no threat to the community.”Investigators are now probing any links between the arrested individuals and 19-year-old former Michigan Army National Guardsman Ammar Said, who was detained in May for plotting an ISIS-inspired attack on a US Army facility in Warren, Michigan.Officials described the Michigan cell as “home-grown radicals” with possible overseas connections, and credited close surveillance and quick coordination for preventing what could have been a Halloween tragedy.","Fbi swoops in after 'pumpkin day' clue in online chatroom.

The FBI responded to the allegation that director Kash Patel flew on a $60M FBI jet to attend his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins' performance in Pennsylvania, and said he broke no rules while he did that. The allegation came from a former FBI agent-turned-podcaster Kyle Seraphin who commented about Patel flying around the country during the ongoing government shutdown.“We’re in the middle of government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy heads,” Seraphin said. “And this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?”This is not the first time that Kash Patel 's use of FBI jets for personal reasons came under fire.

Following the established rules, Director Patel pays a reimbursement in advance, Ben Williamson, assistant director for public affairs at FBI, said.Williamson detailed the steps Kash Patel personally takes to minimize spending.

President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill has resulted in a $16 billion hit for Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta. Meta Platforms has taken a near $16 billion one-off charge in the third quarter (Q3) related to President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said that the bill had led the business to take a non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion. Meta said that excluding this, its third-quarter net income would have increased by $15.93 billion to $18.64 billion, compared with the reported net income of $2.71 billion. The expense crashed Meta's third-quarter profit.Incidentally, this is the same bill that Elon Musk and President TrumpThe implementation of Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act led to “the recognition of a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of the U.S. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax,” Meta said.

US Energy Secy Clarifies On Trump's Nuclear Test Bombshell; ‘No Choice Left' | Watch





US President Donald Trump has ordered fresh tests of the American nuclear weapons system, sparking questions on whether the United States is preparing to resume nuclear explosions after more than three decades. The announcement was made on social media last week and followed by remarks ahead of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.However, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Sunday clarified that the testing would not involve nuclear explosions but would instead focus on “the other parts of a nuclear weapon” to ensure they are working properly.Wright’s comments came four days after Trump declared that he was ordering the US military to resume nuclear testing “on an equal basis” with other countries, raising the spectre of a return to the worst days of the Cold War. “I think the tests we’re talking about right now are systems tests,” Wright said in an interview on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing. “These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions. ”Wright said Americans in places such as Nevada, where the United States has a nuclear test site bigger than the state of Rhode Island, should not expect to see a mushroom cloud. On Wednesday — minutes before he met with President Xi Jinping of China in South Korea — Trump said in a social media post that he was ordering the Pentagon to step up testing of nuclear weapons.“We’ve halted it years — many years — ago,” Trump later told reporters, referring to the last US explosive test of a nuclear weapon in 1992. “But with others doing testing, I think it is appropriate that we do also.”Wright reiterated that testing was underway on the new nuclear systems. “And again, these will be nonnuclear explosions,” he said, adding, “These are just developing sophisticated systems so that our replacement nuclear weapons are even better than the ones they were before.”The confusion over Trump’s intentions began just minutes before his key meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump appeared to signal that he was preparing to end the decades-long US moratorium on testing nuclear weapons.Later that day, as he returned to Washington, the President remained evasive about whether he was ordering the resumption of full-scale nuclear detonations — a practice seen only in North Korea this century — or referring instead to routine tests of the systems used to deliver such weapons.Detonation tests are no longer common. The only nation that has been regularly conducting nuclear tests in the past quarter-century is North Korea, whose last test was in September 2017.China has rapidly expanded its nuclear stockpile and deployed missiles in new silos but has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1996. Russia has not conducted a confirmed test since 1990, although it recently declared that it had tested two new delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons — a nuclear-powered cruise missile and an undersea torpedo, called Poseidon, capable of crossing the Pacific to the US West Coast. The United States itself routinely tests unarmed missiles.In 1993, the Clinton administration announced plans for a treaty under which nations would forgo nuclear blasts. Although the 1996 test-ban treaty never officially entered into force, it established a global norm of not testing destructive bombs.Washington is currently undertaking a major effort to replace its warheads with updated versions. The overall cost of the sprawling programme over three decades is estimated at $1.7 trillion.","Us energy secretary chris wright on sunday clarified that the testing would not involve nuclear explosions.
