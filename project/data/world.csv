Engine 1 and Engine 2 cut off within 1 second: What caused Air India plane crash? 10 key findings from probe report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/engine-1-and-engine-2-cut-off-within-1-second-what-caused-air-india-plane-crash-10-key-findings-from-probe-report/articleshow/122398273.cms,"Air India 171 crash

Here are the key findings from the preliminary investigation report:

Fuel to both engines cut off mid-air: Just three seconds after liftoff at 08:08:39 UTC, the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were triggered, one second apart. ""The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec,"" the report states.

Cockpit voice recorder captures pilot confusion: The cockpit voice recording reveals confusion in the final moments. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so."" Investigators are looking into whether the switches were triggered manually, inadvertently, or by a system malfunction.

Relight attempt on engines: The flight data shows that an automatic relight was attempted. Engine 1 briefly responded, but Engine 2 did not recover despite multiple attempts to reintroduce fuel. This failure ultimately made it impossible for the aircraft to maintain thrust.

Emergency RAT deployment: The Ram Air Turbine (RAT), an emergency power source deployed in response to power failure, activated right after takeoff, a clear indicator of loss of electrical power to critical systems.

Mayday call issued moments before: At 08:09:05 UTC, one of the pilots issued a distress call: ""MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY."" The Air Traffic Controller attempted to confirm the call sign but received no further response. Seconds later, the aircraft crashed.

Aircraft crashed in nose-up attitude: Flight path analysis shows the aircraft hit buildings near BJ Medical College with an 8-degree nose-up pitch and level wings. With no thrust from either engine, the aircraft could not sustain flight.

Thrust levers found in idle post-crash: Although the thrust levers were in takeoff position during flight, they were found in idle after the crash. Flaps and landing gear were confirmed to be in standard takeoff positions, ruling out abnormal configuration as a factor.

Wreckage spread across 1,000 feet: The plane disintegrated across a wide zone, hitting multiple buildings. Debris, including engines and landing gear, was scattered over more than 1,000 feet, indicating the force of the impact and trajectory.

Aircraft airworthy, no fuel control issues logged earlier: The aircraft had valid airworthiness certification. Though there were some minor Category C and D MEL (Minimum Equipment List) issues, none related to fuel control. Notably, no previous issues with fuel cutoff switches had been reported.

Optional Boeing advisory not followed: While Boeing had issued an optional advisory on fuel control switch locking mechanisms, Air India had not carried out the recommended checks. The aircraft’s throttle control modules had been replaced in 2019 and 2023.

Next steps in investigation



NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIM) Saturday released its preliminary report into the tragic crash of Air India 171 in Ahmedabad on June 12, which claimed 260 lives.The 15-page preliminary report, released a month after tragic crash, details the early findings and current status of the investigation into the crash of Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner bound for London Gatwick.

What are the India-US trade deal key hurdles



NEW DELHI: Looking to finalise a trade deal, an Indian commerce ministry team is set to visit Washington soon for another round of talks with the United States over the ongoing tariff dispute and a proposed bilateral trade agreement, a government official said on Thursday.The dates for the visit are yet to be confirmed, but the team is likely to visit Washington next week, according to sources quoted by PTI.During this upcoming visit, discussions will focus on both the interim and first phase of the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA).India is working to finalise a trade agreement with the United States, said Rajesh Agrawal, Special Secretary in the Department of Commerce and the chief negotiator for the proposed India-US bilateral trade pact, on Thursday.Speaking at an export logistics event, Agrawal said, ""Now we are integrating with major markets also... we just concluded an agreement with the UK, we are in an advanced stage of negotiations with the European Union, we are trying to negotiate and finalize a deal with the USA.""He further said that the goal is to complete the first phase of the deal by September-October this year, with an interim agreement expected before that.Agrawal noted that India has successfully implemented over 14 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) involving 26 countries.He also shared that India is exploring trade agreements with Latin American countries, including Chile and Peru, and is in talks with New Zealand.""We have done (trade pact) with Australia and UAE. We are in negotiations with New Zealand... So, the idea is that we are also integrating in a big way with the major trading partners and major economies,"" he added, according to PTI.Earlier this month, an Indian team led by chief negotiator Rajesh Agrawal had concluded a previous round of discussions in Washington.Also read: Donald Trump's tariff war: Which 21 countries got US President's letters? Check full list India and the US have been holding talks for several months, aiming to finalise the first phase of a bilateral trade deal by this fall (September–October).India aims to secure enhanced market opportunities in the US for its workforce-driven sectors, particularly textiles and electronics. The US, in turn, seeks permission to export genetically modified (GM) crops and cattle feed to India, which remains a delicate matter for the Indian government.These demands pose key challenges, especially since many Indian farmers rely on small-scale, subsistence farming. Meanwhile, the US continues to resist lowering import duties below the 10% mark.This visit is crucial, especially as the US has extended the suspension of additional duties on Indian goods, currently set at 10% until August 1.Earlier, Trump had announced a 26% tariff on Indian imports in April 2025, but the rate was reduced temporarily for a 90-day period starting April 10.On Monday, Trump said the US was ""close to making a deal with India,"" after announcing new tariffs for 14 countries, including Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, South Korea, and Japan, which are also set to kick in from August 1.Also read: US vs Brazil: Trump slaps 50% tariff; President Lula hits back, says 'will not accept tutelage'","An indian commerce ministry team is set to visit washington soon for another round of talks with the united states.

"US vs Brazil: Trump slaps 50% tariff; President Lula hits back, says 'will not accept tutelage'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/brazil-vs-us-trump-slaps-50-tariff-president-lula-hits-back-says-will-not-accept-tutelage/articleshow/122353841.cms,"NEW DELHI: Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Wednesday (local time) warned of retaliation and condemned “tutelage” after United States President Donald Trump announced a steep 50 per cent tariff on ""any and all"" imports from Brazil. The move, widely seen as linked to Trump’s continued support for coup-accused former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, has triggered a diplomatic standoff between the two countries.Reacting strongly to Trump’s remarks and trade decision, Lula on X said, ""Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage.” He added that “any unilateral tariff increases will be addressed in accordance with Brazil’s Economic Reciprocity Law.""Lula also addressed the larger context of judicial independence and foreign interference in Bolsonaro’s ongoing trial. “The judicial proceedings against those responsible for planning the coup d'état fall exclusively under the jurisdiction of Brazil’s Judicial Branch and, as such, are not subject to any interference or threats that could compromise the independence of national institutions,” he wrote.The announcement came shortly after Brazil summoned the US ambassador in Brasília to protest a statement by the American embassy describing Bolsonaro as a victim of “political persecution.”Bolsonaro, who lost the 2022 presidential election to Lula, is on trial for allegedly plotting to remain in power after the defeat.President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly defended Bolsonaro, issued a fiery post earlier this week on his platform Truth Social: “LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE. They have done nothing but come after him, day after day, night after night, month after month, year after year!” Lula called this an unacceptable intrusion into Brazil’s internal affairs, stating firmly: “No one is above the law.”The 50 percent tariff on copper imports, effective August 1, is part of Trump’s broader strategy to rebuild America’s industrial base. In his announcement, he linked copper to national security and defence: “Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many. ”Calling copper the “second most used material by the department of defense,” Trump blamed past US leaders for weakening the sector and criticised the Biden administration’s policies as “thoughtless” and “stupid.” According to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, the administration has already collected $100 billion through tariffs and aims to reach $300 billion by December.In a letter to President Lula, Trump escalated the dispute, calling the Bolsonaro trial an “international disgrace” and warning of additional trade measures if Brazil retaliated. He also announced a formal review of Brazil’s trade practices. Although Trump has recently issued tariff threats to several US trade partners, Brazil had not been previously targeted. It is currently the second-largest exporter of steel to the United States, after Canada.Lula, in his X post, also addressed Trump’s claim about the US trade deficit with Brazil, saying it was misleading. “The claim regarding a US trade deficit in its commercial relationship with Brazil is inaccurate. Statistics from the US government itself show a surplus of $410 billion in the trade of goods and services with Brazil over the past 15 years,” he said.He further commented on foreign companies operating in Brazil: “All companies—whether domestic or foreign—must comply with Brazilian law in order to operate within our territory.” He warned that “freedom of expression must not be confused with aggression or violent practices,” especially in the context of digital platforms and content moderation.The diplomatic tension also played out at the BRICS summit hosted by Brazil this week, where member nations criticised Trump’s tariff moves and US military actions in Iran. Trump responded by threatening an additional 10 percent tariff on all BRICS-aligned countries, accusing them of launching “insidious attacks on Free Elections.”On Wednesday, the US embassy in Brasília reinforced Trump’s position, stating: “Jair Bolsonaro and his family have been strong partners of the United States. The political persecution against him, his family, and his followers is shameful and disrespects Brazil’s democratic traditions.”Despite being barred from contesting future elections due to spreading falsehoods about Brazil’s electoral system, Bolsonaro remains a central figure in the country’s politics. He thanked Trump for standing up for “peace, justice and liberty.” Trump, in turn, claimed Bolsonaro remains the frontrunner for Brazil’s next election — a race he legally cannot enter as of now.As the cases around both Bolsonaro and Trump unfold in parallel, the escalating rhetoric and retaliatory economic threats between the US and Brazil are drawing global attention. Lula concluded his X post with a broader message: “Sovereignty, respect and the unwavering defense of the interests of the Brazilian people are the values that guide our relationship with the world.”","Brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva warned of retaliation and condemned ""tutelage"" after united states president donald trump announced a steep 50 per cent tariff on ""any and all"" imports from brazil.

Air India acknowledges report

NEW DELHI: The initial probe into the crash of AI 171 has revealed that three seconds after getting airborne from Ahmedabad on June 12, fuel supply to both engines of the Air India Boeing 787 operating as AI 171 got cut off. The engines’ fan speed began dropping and the aircraft weighing 213.4 tons — which was close to its maximum take off weight with 54,200 kg of jet fuel — started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall. The reason: fuel cutoff switches of the London-bound Dreamliner’s engine 1 and 2 transitioned from “run” to “cutoff” position one after another with a time gap of a second.How and why this happened is not yet known. But what it led to is: The pilots issued a “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY” call 26 seconds after getting airborne and after that the crash happened within six seconds.The two pilots were taken aback by the unexpected fuel cutoff. “One of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” says the report prepared by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and made public early Saturday.As a result the engines’ fan rotation speed (N1 and N2) started decreasing even as the ill-fated aircraft weighed 2,13,401 kg on take off — close to its maximum take off weight of 2,18,183 kg. “The aircraft achieved maximum recorded airspeed of 180 knots indicated air speed at about 08:08:42 UTC (Greenwich time) and immediately thereafter, the engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of one sec. The engine N1 and N2 (fan rotation speed of different stages) began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off,” says the report.The aircraft’s “Ram Air Turbine” (RAT) got deployed during the initial climb immediately after lift-off as “both engines’ N2 (fan rotation speed) values passed below minimum idle speed,” it says. No significant bird activity was observed in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall.Ten seconds later (08:08:52 UTC) the engines’ fuel cutoff switches for one engine transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN, resuming fuel supply. Four seconds later the same happened for the other engine. Engine 1 “started to progress to recover” with the other re-introducing fuel to achieve the same. However, by then it was too late. Nine seconds later (08:09:05), pilots transmitted “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY”.“The air traffic controller (responded).. did not get any response… observed the aircraft crashing outside the airport boundary, activated the emergency response. At 08:14:44 UTC, crash fire tender left the airport premises for rescue and firefighting.”“After takeoff, the aircraft impacted the BJ Medical College hostel which is 0.9 nautical miles (1.6 km) from the departure end of runway… As the aircraft was losing altitude, it initially made contact with a series of trees and an incineration chimney inside the Army Medical Corps compound before” crashing on the hostel.The AAIB report says “scrutiny of maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module was replaced on VT-ANB (the ill-fated Dreamliner) in 2019 and 2023. However, the reason for the replacement was not linked to the fuel control switch. There has been no defect reported pertaining to the fuel control switch since 2023 on VT-ANB.”Why did the fuel cutoff switch transition from “run” to “cutoff” for both the engines on June 12 on the Dreamliner may be known once the ongoing probe is complete.Without linking it to the cause, the report says US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had in Dec 2018 issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) “regarding the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature. This SAIB was issued based on reports from operators of Model 737 airplanes that fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged. The airworthiness concern was not considered an unsafe condition that would warrant airworthiness directive (AD) by the FAA. The fuel control switch design, including the locking feature, is similar on various Boeing airplane models including part number 4TL837-3D which is fitted in B787-8 aircraft VT-ANB. As per the information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory. The scrutiny of maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module was replaced on VT-ANB in 2019 and 2023.”Soon after the release of the report, Air India issued a statement acknowledging the report. ""Air India stands in solidarity with the families and those affected by the AI171 accident. We continue to mourn the loss and are fully committed to providing support during this difficult time. We acknowledge receipt of the preliminary report released by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) today, 12 July 2025.

Air India 171 crash probe: Cockpit audio reveals pilots' confusion over mid-air fuel cutoff - 10 key points from AAIB preliminary report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-171-crash-probe-cockpit-audio-reveals-pilots-confusion-over-mid-air-fuel-cutoff-10-key-points-from-aaib-preliminary-report/articleshow/122395222.cms,"Here are 10 key findings from the preliminary probe report:

Fuel supply to both engines was cut off mid-air: Just three seconds after takeoff, both engines’ fuel control switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF within one second of each other, leading to sudden loss of thrust. Pilot confusion in cockpit: One pilot is heard asking “Why did you cutoff?” to which the other replied, “I did not do so,” suggesting a potential technical malfunction or inadvertent activation. Relight attempt failed on one engine: The flight data shows relight was automatically attempted and succeeded for Engine 1, but Engine 2 failed to recover despite multiple fuel reintroductions. RAT deployed immediately: The Ram Air Turbine (RAT), an emergency power source, deployed right after liftoff, indicating a total loss of power to essential systems. Mayday call issued seconds before crash: At 08:09:05 UTC, a distress call was made, just seconds before the aircraft impacted buildings outside the airport perimeter. Aircraft crashed nose-up but with engines off: Analysis shows the plane hit buildings with an 8° nose-up attitude and level wings, but with both engines inactive, unable to sustain climb. Cockpit controls in normal takeoff mode: Flap and landing gear levers were in standard takeoff positions; thrust levers were found in idle post-crash, though they were at takeoff thrust during flight — confirming an in-flight cutoff. Debris and wreckage strewn over 1,000 ft: The aircraft hit several buildings and structures, with components like engines, wings, and landing gears scattered across a wide crash zone near BJ Medical College hostel. Aircraft was airworthy with minor MEL issues: The aircraft had valid airworthiness certificates and a few Category C and D MELs (non-critical maintenance issues), none linked to fuel control. No prior issues reported with fuel control switches: While Boeing had issued an advisory (not mandatory) on fuel control switch lock concerns, Air India had not conducted the optional inspections. The aircraft had previous throttle module replacements in 2019 and 2023.

NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has released its preliminary report into the Air India plane crash that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad on June 12.The 15-page report, published early Saturday, outlines the initial findings and status of the investigation into the crash of Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner headed for London Gatwick.

Pakistan-based terror outfits could use Nepal to launch attacks on India: Nepalese official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-based-terror-outfits-could-use-nepal-to-launch-attacks-on-india-nepalese-official/articleshow/122397764.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a blunt warning that has confirmed the worst fears of Indian security establishment, a senior Nepalese govt advisor has cautioned that Pakistan-based terrorist organisations were likely to exploit Nepal's geography to launch attacks on India.During a seminar on challenges to regional peace and security in South Asia in Kathmandu, Sunil Bahadur Thapa, principal political advisor to the president of Nepal and former minister of industry, said Pakistan-based UN-designated terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) posed risks to India and could potentially use Nepal as a transit point for their nefarious objectives.The vulnerability of Nepal to terrorism was highlighted through specific incidents, such as hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 from Kathmandu.Pakistani terrorist groups have been known to utilise Nepal as a transit route to infiltrate into India. Notable cases include the arrest of Abdul Karim Tunda, a top LeT operative involved in over 40 bombings in India, who was held on the India-Nepal border in 2013. The case of Mirza Dilshad Beg, an assassinated Indian-Nepali parliamentarian who had links with Dawood Ibrahim's D-company and ISI, is another case in point.Yasin Bhatkal, co-founder of Indian Mujahideen, was apprehended by Nepal police in 2013 and handed over to Indian authorities. In April 2024, Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) had arrested two Pakistani nationals - Mohammed Altaf Bhat and Sayyed Gajanfar - along with their aide Nasir Ali, near the Nepal border.A Nepalese citizen was among those who were targeted on the basis of their Hindu faith by jihadis in Pahalgam in April this year.The seminar, organised by Nepal Institute for International Cooperation & Engagement, brought together experts, policymakers and former officials to discuss the threat of terrorism in the region. Speakers emphasised that terrorism in the region has far-reaching consequences, including economic losses, and hindered regional integration and stressed the need for global unity and cooperation to combat terrorism, citing the importance of intelligence sharing and joint border patrolling between India and Nepal.Speakers at the seminar included Thapa; Minendra Rijal, former defence minister of Nepal; Chanda Chaudhary, member of Parliament; Shisir Khanal, former minister; Dinesh Bhattarai, former diplomat; N P Saud, former minister of foreign affairs; Purna Silwal, former major general of the Nepal army; and Madhu Raman Acharya, former foreign secretary of Nepal.",Senior nepalese govt advisor has cautioned that pakistan-based terrorist organisations were likely to exploit nepal's geography to launch attacks on india.

Muslims are world's fastest growing religious group: Pew,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muslims-are-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group-pew/articleshow/122396546.cms,"NEW DELHI: Muslims emerged as the fastest growing religious group in the world over 2010-2020, while the share of Christians - the world's largest religious group - in the global population fell by 1.8 percentage points to 28.8%, a Pew Research Centre analysis stated. Hindus grew at about the same rate as the world's overall population, reaching 1.2 billion in 2020, of whom 95% are in India.As of 2020, Hindus made up 79% of the population in India, compared to 80% in 2010. The share of Muslims rose from 14.3% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2020, revealed the analysis titled 'How the Global Religious Landscape Changed From 2010 to 2020'.Globally, people with no religious affiliation - sometimes called ""nones"" - were the only category aside from Muslims that grew as a percentage of the world's population, rising by 270 million and reaching 1.9 billion. The share of ""nones"" climbed by nearly a full percentage point to 24.2%.The research shows that the number of Muslims increased by 347 million - more than for all other religions combined. The share of the world's population that is Muslim rose by 1.8 percentage points to 25.6%.As a proportion of the global population, Hindus held steady at 14.9% in 2020. The figure was 15% in 2010. The number of Hindus worldwide grew 12% from 2010 to 2020, rising from a little less than 1.1 billion to nearly 1.2 billion.Buddhists were the only major religious group that had fewer people in 2020 than a decade earlier. In 2010, Christians accounted for 30.6% of the global population, followed by Muslims (23.9%), Hindus (15%), Buddhists (4.9%), unaffiliated (23.3%), other religions (2.2%) and Jews (less than 1%).The analysis draws attention to the various factors driving change in religious demographics. A key factor for Christians shrinking as a share of the global population is the widespread switching out of religion. This ""religious disaffiliation"" among Christians overrides their demographic advantage (high fertility).Muslim population growth is largely driven by their relatively young age profile and a high fertility rate. Hindus remain a stable share of the world's population because their fertility resembles the global average, and surveys indicate that Hindus rarely switch out of their religion.The analysis shows that Muslims had the highest proportion of children in 2010 (35% of the world's Muslims were under the age of 15), followed by Hindus (31%).The research observes that Muslims and Hindus are the least likely to gain or lose adherents from religious switching. About one in every 100 adults raised Muslim or Hindu has left their native religion, and a similar number from a different religious group have switched to Islam or Hinduism.","Muslims emerged as the fastest growing religious group in the world over 2010-2020.

Poll Which aspect of Operation Sindoor do you find most compelling? Precision and planning Impact on terror infrastructure

NEW DELHI: National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on Friday called out international media, specifically naming the New York Times, for its reportage on Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. He dared foreign media to ""show even one image"" of damage on the Indian side.Speaking at the 62nd Convocation of IIT Madras, Doval said, ""We have to develop our indigenous technology. Mention of Sindoor was made here. We are really proud of how much of indigenous content was there... We decided to have 9 terrorist targets in the criss-cross of Pakistan, it was not in the border areas. We missed none. We hit nowhere else except that. It was precise to the point where we knew who was where. Entire operation took 23 minutes. ""Criticising international media coverage of the operation, particularly the New York Times, Doval challenged their narrative: ""You tell me one photograph that shows any Indian damage done... They wrote things, New York Times... but the images showed 13 air bases of Pakistan before and after 10th May...""The NSA added, ""Foreign press said that Pakistan did that and this...You tell me one photograph, one image, which shows any damage to any Indian (structure), even a glass pane having been broken...Theywrote these things and put out things...The images only showed 13 air bases in Pakistan before and after 10th May, whether it was in Sargodha, Rahim Yar Khan, Chaklala...I am only telling you what the foreign media put out on the basis of images. ..We are capable of doing that (damage to Pakistani air bases...""Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7, was India's strong retaliatory strike following a Pakistan-backed terror attack in Pahalgam, that claimed 26 lives.The Indian Air Force hit nine key terror hubs deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, including the Jaish-e-Mohammad headquarters in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s key base in Muridke.In response, Pakistan attempted a counter with drones and missile attacks, all of which were intercepted by India’s air defence systems.

NEW DELHI: Even as they expressed the view that the bill on simultaneous elections passes muster with the basic structure of the Constitution, former Chief Justices of India J S Khehar and D Y Chandrachud questioned the legislation's entrusting of unbridled powers to the Election Commission, and also raised questions about other aspects of the legislation.In a meeting of the JPC on One Nation-One Poll (ONOP) that lasted over six hours, the two former CJIs are learnt to have expressed reservations about various clauses that the panel members went over. Justice Khehar is said to have deposed for around two-and-a-half hours and Justice Chandrachud for three hours. Crunching the protracted depositions on Friday, sources said the two argued that the contentious bill passed muster on the touchstone of the basic structure, but its specific features failed on the anvil of legalities. Both the judges are said to have suggested a lot of amendments.On Clause 82A (5) of the proposed bill, it was said the EC was being given such vast powers that it could postpone election in any state on the ground that the situation was not conducive. According to the bill, the EC can postpone election in one state if it feels they cannot be held with the Lok Sabha polls, but the said assembly's term would ultimately end with the term of LS.Previously, former CJI Ranjan Gogoi had also questioned the broad authority given to the EC under Article 82A (5). To date, four former CJIs, including Justice U U Lalit, have shared their opinion with the committee.It was felt that such a clause would end up in the court with legal challenges.

Justice Khehar is said to have asked what would happen if Emergency is announced in one state which could be extended for up to one year: something which would throw the electoral cycle out of sync with others.A senior JPC member welcomed the suggestions of the CJIs and said the committee was open to refining the bill based on expert input.

'Doesn't behove state authority': MEA rebukes Punjab CM Mann over PM Modi statement; calls remarks 'irresponsible',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-behove-state-authority-mea-rebukes-punjab-cm-mann-over-pm-modi-statement-calls-remarks-irresponsible/articleshow/122371130.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Thursday condemned remarks made by Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent five-nation tour, calling them “irresponsible and regrettable. ” Without directly naming Mann, the MEA disassociated the central government from the statements, which it said undermined India’s ties with friendly nations from the Global South.“We have seen some comments made by a high state authority about India’s relations with friendly countries from the Global South. These remarks are irresponsible and regrettable and do not behove the state authority,” said MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. “Government of India disassociates itself from such unwarranted comments that undermine India’s ties with friendly countries,” he added.The response came shortly after Mann made a series of sarcastic remarks to the media, questioning the relevance of the Prime Minister’s visit to countries such as Ghana, Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Brazil and Namibia. Taking a swipe at the destinations, Mann joked that Modi may as well have been visiting places called “Magnesia,” “Galveaisa,” or “Tarvesia.”Also read: Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann's odd jibe at PM Modi's foreign trips; says PM doesn’t stay in India, visits small countries “PM has gone somewhere. I think it is Ghana. He is going to be back and he is welcome. God knows which countries he keeps visiting — ‘Magnesia’, ‘Galveaisa’, ‘Tarvesia’,” Mann said. “He does not stay in a country with 140 crore people. He is visiting countries where the population is 10,000 and he is getting the ‘highest awards’ there. Here, 10,000 people gather to watch a JCB… What has he gotten himself into!...,” he added.Mann’s comments coincided with PM Modi’s return from a landmark tour spanning two continents, where he focused on building stronger partnerships with key nations in the Global South. In Ghana, Modi was conferred the “Officer of the Order of the Star of Ghana,” while in Trinidad and Tobago — the first visit by an Indian PM in over two decades — he addressed Parliament and was honoured with the “Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. ”PM Modi’s visit to Argentina was the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 57 years. Talks centred on critical minerals, energy, and digital platforms. Argentina expressed interest in adopting India’s UPI system. In Brazil, Modi attended the BRICS Summit and received the “Grand Collar of the National Order of the Southern Cross.” Namibia became the first country to adopt India’s UPI platform and awarded PM Modi the “Order of the Most Ancient Welwitschia Mirabilis. ”","The ministry of external affairs (mea) on thursday condemned remarks made by punjab chief minister bhagwant mann regarding prime minister narendra modi’s recent five-nation tour.
