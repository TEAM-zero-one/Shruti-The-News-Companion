'PoK will be ours on it own'



NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday commented on the possibility of second and third phase of Operation Sindoor . He reiterated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's comments and said that the military operation against terrorism can be ""started again."" However, he did not provide any further details of when and how it would unfold.""Whether part 2 remains to be done or part 3, we can't say. It depends on their (Pakistan's) conduct. If they indulge in terrorist activities, they would get a reply,"" he said during an interaction with the Indian community in Morocco.""PM too has said that this is just a pause. Operation Sindoor has only been halted...It can be started again,"" he added.Talking about the May 7 operation post Pahalgam attack that killed 26, Singh said, ""The first question I asked in the meeting with CDS, the three service chiefs and defence secretary the next day, on 23rd April, was if they are ready for an Operation if the Govt decided upon one. You would be delighted to know they didn't take even a second and responded that they are absolutely ready.""""We then approached PM Modi, he told us to go ahead and gave a free hand.You saw what happened after that. Not at the border, we destroyed terror hotbeds 100 km inside their land. A top terrorist of JeM was saying that Masood Azhar's family was torn apart by India,"" he added.PM Modi has clarified that India has merely paused its military action and remains prepared to respond decisively to any future terror attacks.Commenting on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Singh said, ""PoK will be ours on its own. Demands have started being made in PoK, you must have heard sloganeering.""""I was addressing the Indian Army at a program in Kashmir Valley 5 years ago, I had then said that we will not need to attack and capture PoK, it is anyway ours; PoK itself will say, 'Main bhi Bharat Hoon'. That day will come,"" he added.India initiated Operation Sindoor following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives. In retaliation, armed forces carried out precision strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (PoJK), eliminating over 100 militants. Additional strikes targeted Pakistani air bases after Islamabad escalated tensions.","'pok will be ours on it own,' says defence minister rajnath singh.

"Indian techie shot dead by US police: What cops claim, what kin allege - 10 things to know about the incident",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-student-shot-dead-by-us-police-what-cops-claim-what-kin-allege-10-things-to-know-about-the-incident/articleshow/123988190.cms,"Poll Do you think more measures are needed to protect citizens abroad? Yes, more measures required No, current measures are adequate

Here are ten things to know about the incident:

A 32-year-old man from Telangana’s Mahabubnagar district, Mohammad Nizamuddin, who had moved to the United States in 2016 to pursue higher education, was allegedly shot dead by police in Santa Clara, California on September 3. Nizamuddin had first studied at Florida College before joining a private company, where his performance earned him a promotion that eventually took him to California, according to his family’s account. His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, a retired teacher, expressed shock and grief, saying he was informed only recently about his son’s killing, which reportedly occurred weeks earlier in the United States. The family claimed they were left in the dark for nearly two weeks, learning about Nizamuddin’s death only on September 18, when a friend from Raichur, Karnataka, informed them of the tragic news. According to reports, the incident began with a quarrel among roommates over an air-conditioning issue, which escalated into a violent scuffle involving knives before neighbors called police for help. The Santa Clara Police department said its officers responded to a 911 call reporting a stabbing, encountered Nizamuddin holding a knife, and opened fire, which led to him being shot. Police chief Cory Morgan defended the officer’s actions, saying that the shooting likely prevented further harm and may have saved the life of another roommate who had already been stabbed. Nizamuddin’s relatives, however, have raised questions about the speed of the police response, alleging that no proper inquiry was conducted before shots were fired, leaving the family with unanswered concerns. His body remains in a hospital in California awaiting formalities, while his grieving family in Mahabubnagar has appealed to both the Indian government and the Telangana state government to repatriate his remains. Nizamuddin’s father and community representatives, including Majlis Bachao Tehreek leader Amjed Ullah Khan, have urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene urgently and help bring his body back to India so the family can perform last rites in their hometown.

NEW DELHI: The death of Indian techie Mohammed Nizamuddin in Santa Clara, California, has drawn strong reactions, with police describing him as an armed aggressor, his family alleging a hasty and excessive response, neighbours recalling a domestic quarrel that turned deadly, and him alleging workplace racial harassment, including ""wage-fraud, wrongful termination and obstruction of justice.Santa Clara police said they were called to a residence on September 3 after reports of a stabbing, where they found Nizamuddin allegedly armed with a knife after attacking his roommate. Officers claimed he ignored commands and appeared poised to strike again, prompting them to open fire, fatally wounding him, while his injured roommate was hospitalized and two knives were recovered from the scene.The family of Nizamuddin alleged that the shooting ""happened so quickly."" His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, said they were only informed weeks after the September 3 incident.""The account says the roommates had a quarrel -- something about the AC or something in the room -- and in the ensuing scuffle knives were involved. A neighbour phoned the police. When the police entered the room, they asked the occupants to show their hands. One boy complied; the other did not. The police then fired four rounds and the child was shot.It is extremely regrettable that, according to the reports, no proper inquiry took place and the shooting happened so quickly,"" ANI quoted a relative said.The family of the Telangana man has appealed to the external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene in the matter and help bring back Mohammad Nizamuddin's body.Indian consulate expressed condolences and assured ""all possible consular assistance."" ""We are saddened by the death of an Indian national, Mr. Mohammed Nizamuddin, in an incident involving Santa Clara Police. We are in contact with the local authorities & the family, and we will extend all possible consular assistance. Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved family in this difficult time,"" it said.He accused his employer of ""wrongfully"" terminating his employment and continued ""harassment, discrimination and intimidating behavior by the help of a racist detective and team.""""I have been a victim of racial hatred, racial discrimination, racial harassment, torture, wage-fraud, wrongful termination and obstruction of Justice,"" the post on LinkedIn read.","Mohammed nizamuddin, a 32-year-old man from telangana's mahabubnagar district, was allegedly shot dead by police in santa clara, california on september 3.

Your government ought to apologise to the people!"" he added.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee claimed that the Centre is taking undue credit for lowering GST rates and said that the move was initiated by state""Some people are making big claims about GST.

"PM Modi's address to nation: GST reforms will accelerate India's growth story, says PM - top quotes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modis-address-to-nation-gst-reforms-will-accelerate-indias-growth-story-says-pm-top-quotes/articleshow/124027452.cms,"Here are the top quotes from the Prime Minister's address:

From tomorrow, the festival of Navratri is starting. I extend my best wishes to you. From the first day of Navratri, the country is taking an important step towards Aatmanirbhar Bharat. Tomorrow, on the first day of Navratri, Next-Generation GST reforms will come into effect with sunrise.

reforms will come into effect with sunrise. These reforms will accelerate Bharat's growth story, enhance ease of doing business, attract greater investment, and ensure that every state becomes an equal partner in the nation's development.

In a way, starting tomorrow, a GST savings festival will commence in the country. During this GST savings festival, your savings will increase, and you’ll be able to purchase your favourite items much more easily. The poor, middle class, neo-middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, traders, and entrepreneurs of our country will all greatly benefit from this savings festival. In other words, during this festive season, everyone’s heart will be filled with sweetness.

In 2017, India embarked on a transformative journey by implementing GST reforms, marking the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in its economic history.

I remember, in 2014, when the country entrusted me with the responsibility of Prime Minister, an interesting incident was published in a foreign newspaper during that initial period. It described the difficulties of a company. The company said that if it had to send its goods from Bengaluru to Hyderabad, 570 km away, it was so difficult that they considered it and said that they would prefer the company to first send its goods from Bengaluru to Europe and then send the same goods from Europe to Hyderabad. This was the situation at that time due to the complexities of taxes and tolls...At that time, millions of such companies, along with millions of countrymen, faced daily problems due to the maze of various taxes. The increased expenses incurred in transporting goods from one city to another were borne by the poor, and customers like you were charged. It was essential to free the country from this situation.

In the last eleven years, 25 crore people in the country have defeated poverty. Having emerged from poverty, a large group of 25 crore people, known as the neo-middle class, is playing a significant role in the country today. This neo-middle class has its own aspirations and dreams. This year, the government presented a gift by making income up to Rs 12 lakh tax-free and naturally, when income tax relief up to Rs 12 lakh is granted, the lives of the middle class undergo a profound transformation, bringing about so much simplicity and convenience...Now, the poor, the neo-middle class, and the middle class are receiving a double bonanza. With the reduction in GST, it will be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfil their dreams.

Whatever the country’s people need, whatever we can make domestically, we should produce it within the country.

For a developed India, we must follow the path of self-reliance, in which MSMEs have a very big responsibility. The reduction in GST will greatly benefit our small-scale industries.

Many foreign products have entered our daily lives; we need to move away from them and buy only what is made in India.

Our small-scale industries should become the best in the world, and our products should meet the highest global standards.

PM appeals to states: Boost manufacturing in your states and create a conducive environment for investment.

We are moving forward by following the mantra of 'Nagrik Devo Bhava' and we can see its reflection in the next generation's GST reforms. If we combine the income tax exemption and the GST exemption, the decisions made in one year will save the people of the country more than Rs 2.5 lakh crore and that's why I say, this is a savings festival.

Yes, it's a serious concern No, it's manageable

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia defence pact, calling it a matter of grave concern for India’s security and another failure of what it described as “personality-driven diplomacy. ”Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, said, “One month after abruptly halting Operation Sindoor, President Trump hosted Field Marshal Asim Munir for lunch at the White House—the very individual whose inflammatory, provocative, and communally divisive statements provided oxygen to the brutal terrorist attacks in Pahalgam in April 2025. Just days after our Prime Minister’s much-publicised visit to China, President Xi Jinping opened the doors of China’s covert military complex to Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari. Now, Saudi Arabia—where the Prime Minister was present during the Pahalgam terrorist attacks on 22 April 2025—has signed a ‘strategic mutual defence’ agreement with Pakistan. This is undoubtedly a matter of grave concern for India’s national security. The Indian National Congress expresses deep concern over this and considers it yet another setback for our Prime Minister’s highly publicised personality-driven diplomacy.”Earlier today, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan announced the signing of a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” during Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to Riyadh.The pact pledges mutual support in the event of external aggression and marks a transition from decades of informal security cooperation to an institutionalised military framework. “This agreement…aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” a joint statement said.Also read - Defence pact: Pakistan-Saudi Arabia declare joint response to any aggression; India reacts A senior Saudi official told Reuters the deal was the result of “years of discussions” and not linked to any recent conflict, while declining to clarify whether Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal was covered under its scope. The announcement comes shortly after a joint Arab League and OIC session convened in response to Israel’s strike on Doha earlier this month.India, meanwhile, said it had been aware of discussions on the pact. External affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, “We have seen reports of the signing of a strategic mutual defence pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The government was aware that this development, which formalises a long-standing arrangement between the two countries, had been under consideration. We will study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability. The government remains committed to protecting India's national interests and ensuring comprehensive national security in all domains.”Despite the defence alignment with Islamabad, a Saudi official said that Riyadh’s relationship with India remained strong. “Our relationship with India is more robust than it has ever been. We will continue to grow this relationship,” the official said.Meanwhile, union minister Piyush Goyal said, ""I am not aware of the details of that. I was busy with my meetings in the UAE. So, I think I will refrain from commenting on this subject. But as far as our relations with the UAE go, they are very strong. They are underpinned by deep relationship between Prime Minister Modi and His Highness the President of UAE. At every level, from people to people contact, business exchanges and government and leadership levels. We are very close to each other, and I don't think the UAE-India relationship will be affected by any of these developments.""",The congress criticised prime minister narendra modi over the pakistan-saudi arabia defence pact.

This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition. Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday’s proclamation. This applies only to new visas, not renewals, and not current visa holders.





The recently announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee will apply only to new visa applications and is not an annual charge, the White House press secretary clarified on Saturday. The announcement comes after widespread confusion and concern over the implications of a presidential proclamation signed Friday by US President Donald Trump The proclamation, titled “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,” introduced a major overhaul of the H-1B visa program, significantly increasing the fee from the current $2,000–5,000 range to $100,000. The move sparked fears among immigration attorneys, Indian IT professionals, and companies that holders outside the US might face urgent deadlines to return, and raised questions about potential disruption to the country’s tech talent pipeline.In response, the White House press secretary clarified the following points:This comes amid reports that companies asked employees on visit to India to rush back to avoid the fees.Amid the chaos, a senior US administration official told ANI also, “Those visiting or leaving the country, or traveling to India, do not need to rush back before Sunday or pay the $100,000 fee,"" echoing similar statement to Levitt's adding, ""It is applicable only for new visa applications.”Industry representatives in both India and the US have highlighted that H-1B talent mobility is crucial for innovation, economic growth, and technological development. The White House said policymakers will continue to assess the steps, taking into account mutual benefits, including strong people-to-people ties between the two countries.","The $100,000 h-1b visa fee will apply only to new visa applications and is not an annual charge, the white house press secretary clarified.

The gamble vs reward involved in this trade for the Cubs

Here’s a quick breakdown of the situation:

Aspect Pros Cons Cubs’ bullpen need



Helsley could fill in immediately with Palencia sidelined



Risk if Palencia cannot return and Helsley also struggles



Helsley’s profile



Proven velocity and dominance before trade



Performance fell sharply with Mets



Financial side



Lowered price tag after poor Mets stint



Still requires multiyear commitment





Themay be forced to take a bold approach in fixing their bullpen this winter. With injuries and underperformance leaving their closer situation in flux, Sports Illustrated’s Zach Pressnell suggests the team could take a chance on, a once-dominant reliever whose stock has dropped following a disappointing stint with the New York Mets.The Cubs entered the season with Ryan Pressly as their designated closer after signing him over the winter. However, Pressly’s struggles quickly led to a change. Daniel Palencia stepped in and thrived in the role, becoming a steady presence at the back of the bullpen.• Palencia appeared in 52 games this year• He posted a 3.00 ERA across 51 innings• He converted 22 saves before suffering a right shoulder strainPalencia is now on the 15-day injured list, and his postseason availability remains uncertain. This setback leaves the Cubs with a significant hole in their bullpen as they prepare for potential October baseball.The Mets acquired Ryan Helsley at the trade deadline in an effort to boost their relief corps. But his performance took a nosedive after joining New York. While he pitched effectively in the first half of the season, his struggles in a Mets uniform have diminished his free-agent value heading into the offseason.Pressnell believes this is where the Cubs could pounce: “Helsley was dominant in the first half, but fell off when he joined the Mets. His price tag is likely a bit lower now than it was a few months ago, though his talent is still there. The Cubs could target him on a four-year deal to make the flamethrower the closer of the future in the Windy City.” – Zach Pressnell, Sports IllustratedIf the Cubs pursue Helsley, it will be a calculated risk. His struggles in New York have raised questions, but his track record shows he has the talent to dominate when healthy and confident.The Cubs are expected to target bullpen help this winter regardless of Palencia’s health status. Helsley represents a high-risk, high-reward option. If he returns to his pre-trade form, he could become one of the biggest steals of the offseason and stabilize the closer role in Chicago for years.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Detroit Tigers Reportedly Eyeing $120 Million Boston Red Sox All-Star in Aggressive Free Agency Pursuit The coming months will determine if the Cubs are willing to take that gamble and make Helsley a key piece of their future bullpen plans.","Ryan helsley's stock has dropped following a disappointing stint with the new york mets.

Police have detained a suspect following a shooting at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Saturday that left one person dead and several others injured. Officers responding to 911 calls discovered a man had entered the club and fired multiple shots.Attorney General John M. Formella and Nashua Police Chief Kevin Rourke confirmed that the person killed was an adult male. The suspect, also an adult male, was detained on the scene. “Initial reports indicating there were two shooters were erroneous,” officials said, adding that there is no current threat to the public. The condition of the wounded victims has not yet been released.Aerial footage from WMUR-TV showed numerous emergency responders arriving at the scene. Police later confirmed via social media: “Video surveillance has confirmed there was only one shooter and they are currently being detained. The scene is still an active investigation but there is no further danger to the public.”U.S. Representative Maggie Goodlander said she was “closely monitoring the tragic reports of a shooting tonight at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua” and expressed her sympathies, stating that her heart was with “the victims, their families and the entire community.”Nashua, located approximately 45 miles (70 kilometres) northwest of Boston, borders Massachusetts. Authorities in nearby Dunstable, Massachusetts, issued a shelter-in-place order following the incident as a precaution. Police continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the shooting.","Police have detained a suspect following a shooting at sky meadow country club in nashua, new hampshire.

: The Trump White House walked back a more stringent interpretation of the enhanced $100,000 H-1B visa fee, clarifying over the weekend that it does not impact current visa holders and applies only to visa applicants in the next lottery cycle, which starts around March 2026.Directly contradicting US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's statement made alongside President Trump that the $100,000 sticker shock on H-1B visas would be an annual fee, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt also clarified it would be a one-time fee that applies only to new petitions, not to renewals or to current visa holders.""Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday's proclamation,"" Leavitt said in a statement, after the Trump-Lutnick presser in the Oval office on Friday had triggered panic among foreign guest workers in US and across the world because it suggested the $100k fee would be effective immediately.Scores of foreign guest workers in the US canceled trips abroad and those already abroad scrambled to return to US before September 21 after some tech companies sent out advisories asking them to come back as soon as possible, fearing the new fees would kick in on Monday.Separately, the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agency said President Trump's updated H-1B visa requirement applies only to new, prospective petitions that have not yet been filed. ""Petitions submitted prior to September 21, 2025 are not affected. Any reports claiming otherwise are flat-out wrong and should be ignored,"" it said in a statement. The US Customs and Immigration Service also issued an identical statement.Both agencies reported to the Department of Homeland Security, which was not represented in the Friday fiasco at the White House. Instead, it was the Department of Commerce that took a lead role.As with many such initiatives during the Trump administration, the imprecise language and botched announcement triggered angry denunciations on both sides of the debate over foreign guest workers. Well meaning interlocutors who have worked to build bridges between the two countries also warned that disrupting the H-1B pathway could be more harmful for the US than to India in the long run. ""This will be a windfall for India to get American educated students back to India if the H-1B numbers drop significantly. For the US, it's going to be a massive blow if Indian students are not leveraged as part of the competition against China. Trump has truly addressed a self goal here by limiting Visas,"" said Asha Jadeja Motwani, a Silicon Valley VC who calls herself an “America-India optimist.”While there has been intense focus on the impact of the H-1B crackdown on the tech sector, state level public servants are also warning about the fallout in boondocks America where foreign medical graduates, specialty nurses, and teachers serve where Americans are reluctant to go. While many of them use the J1 visa meant for exchange visitor programs to promote education and training, some hospitals and school districts also sponsor them via the H-1B program. Michelle Au, a physician and state lawmaker in Georgia was among those who cautioned that the $100K H-1B fee would decimate US healthcare because 1 in 4 medical residents + physicians in the US are international medical graduates and “often they match into unfilled residency slots and work in underserved communities in rural America.”But MAGA hardliners are now mad about the Trump White House soft pedaling on the “foreign invasion” and are stepping up their campaign to expand the visa crackdown beyond H-1B.","$100,000 h-1b visa fee does not impact current visa holders and applies only to visa applicants in the next lottery cycle, which starts around march 2026.

The Middle East crisis has entered a dramatic new phase as several world leaders move to recognise a Palestinian state, challenging decades of diplomatic norms and drawing sharp opposition from Israel. As UK, Canada, Australia, and France announce their decisions, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to fight the recognition, warning it threatens Israel’s very survival.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday vowed to oppose international efforts to recognise a Palestinian state, warning it would threaten Israel’s survival. His comments came as France, the UK, Canada, Australia, and Belgium prepared to announce recognition of Palestinian statehood at the United Nations next week.""We will also need to fight, both at the UN and in all other arenas, against the false propaganda directed at us and against calls for a Palestinian state, which would endanger our existence and serve as absurd reward for terrorism,"" Netanyahu told his cabinet. He added that Israel’s recent military victories in Lebanon against Hezbollah opened possibilities for peace with Lebanon and Syria. ""We are conducting talks with the Syrians -- there is some progress, but it is still a long way off.Israel’s foreign ministry issued a sharp response, saying it “categorically rejects the one-sided declaration of recognition of a Palestinian state made by the United Kingdom and some other countries.” It warned that such recognition “does not promote peace, further destabilises the region and undermines chances of achieving a peaceful solution in the future.” The ministry added that Israel will not accept “any detached and imaginary text that attempts to force it to accept indefensible borders. ”Israel’s security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir criticised the moves by Britain, Canada, and Australia, calling their recognition of a Palestinian state a reward for “murderers,"" reports news agency Reuters.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that Britain formally recognises a State of Palestine, marking a historic shift in decades of policy. ""Today, to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two-state solution, the United Kingdom formally recognises the State of Palestine,"" Starmer said on X. He emphasised that Hamas would have no role in governance. ""Our call for a genuine two-state solution is the exact opposite of their hateful vision,"" he said. Starmer called for a ceasefire in Gaza and demanded the release of hostages taken in Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on X that Canada recognises a Palestinian state, joining the UK and Australia. The move comes despite opposition from the US and aims to pave the way for a two-state solution. ""We are working to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution, to not allow the facts on the ground, deaths on the ground, the settlements on the ground, the expropriations on the ground, to get to such an extent that this is not possible,"" Carney said.Later, Portugal also announced it's decision to recognise Palestinian state. ""Recognizing the State of Palestine is therefore the fulfilment of a fundamental, consistent, and widely agreed policy,"" Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel told reporters in New York ahead of the annual UN General Assembly, which opens Monday, as reported by AFP.Netanyahu said Israel’s war with Hezbollah has created opportunities for peace with Lebanon and Syria. Israel has maintained troops in southern Lebanon since a November ceasefire and continues to strike Hezbollah targets. Talks with Syria are ongoing, with Israel seeking a demilitarised zone, while Damascus has withdrawn heavy weapons from contested areas.Israeli strikes killed at least 34 people in Gaza City overnight, including children, according to health officials. Late-night strikes hit residential blocks and hospitals. Israeli forces have urged civilians to move south, opening humanitarian corridors. Aid groups warn forced evacuations worsen the crisis, while families of hostages demand a ceasefire.French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to recognise a Palestinian state, a move to be formalised at a UN conference in New York. Macron defended the decision as a way to isolate Hamas and said it is part of a broader roadmap involving Saudi Arabia. Nine other countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the UK, are expected to follow.Israeli strikes killed 91 Palestinians in Gaza in a single day, targeting residential areas, tents, and evacuation routes. Victims included relatives of Gaza’s largest hospital director. Many displaced civilians are living in harsh conditions, without access to water, electricity, or healthcare, according to aid agencies and Al Jazeera reporting.Hamas released images of 48 Israeli hostages in Gaza, calling it a ""farewell picture"" as Israeli assaults intensify. Israeli authorities estimate around 20 captives remain alive. Families and activists continue to demand a ceasefire and the safe return of hostages amid escalating violence.Since Hamas’ October 7, 2023 invasion of Israel, more than 65,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry. Around 166,000 have been injured, 90 per cent of Gaza’s population has been displaced, and famine conditions are reported in Gaza City.

Brazil’s streets filled with anger on Sunday as tens of thousands rallied against moves in Congress to pass an amnesty that could spare former president Jair Bolsonaro from a 27-year prison sentence. Demonstrators accused lawmakers of plotting to shield themselves from prosecution while protecting the far-right leader.The protests, organised in all 26 states and the federal district, erupted just days after the lower house rushed forward a bill that could pardon Bolsonaro, his allies and hundreds of supporters convicted over the storming of government buildings in January 2023.Crowds roared “No amnesty” as they waved flags and carried signs condemning what many described as a shameless attempt to grant impunityProtesters were also outraged by a separate measure, dubbed the “Banditry Bill,” which would require secret ballots in Congress to authorise criminal proceedings against lawmakers. Critics said the move would effectively grant politicians immunity.“This protection they seek is to camouflage corruption, impunity,” said psychology student Giovana Araujo, who joined a musical rally on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro. There, legendary musicians Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Chico Buarque performed songs of resistance from Brazil’s dictatorship era. “Once again, artists are mobilising the people to demand justice in this country,” added sociology student Yasmin Aimee Coelho Pessoa.The University of São Paulo’s Political Debate Monitor estimated 42,000 protesters in São Paulo and a similar turnout in Rio — the largest left-wing mobilisation since Lula’s election victory in 2022. The scenes included blow-up dolls of Bolsonaro in prison stripes alongside one of Donald Trump, whose tariffs and sanctions on Brazil were cited by protesters as evidence of foreign meddling.Outrage has been fuelled further by revelations that several deputies voted for the “Shielding Bill” under pressure from party leaders. Some later apologised publicly, while President Lula vowed to veto any amnesty measure.“The left is reorganising in the face of all these atrocities. And I feel like we’ve reached that choking point,” said environmental engineer Henrique Marques, among thousands demonstrating in Brasilia.Polls underline the divide: 50% of Brazilians support Bolsonaro serving jail time, while 43% oppose it.",Anger at ‘ banditry bill ’ which would require secret ballots in congress to authorise criminal proceedings against lawmakers.

Will UAE residents get five-day weekend for UAE National Day? Here’s why it’s possible this December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/a-rare-5-day-weekend-for-uae-national-day-is-possible-heres-why-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/124006129.cms,"UAE National Day holidays in 2025 are officially December 2 and 3, with possible shifts to extend the weekend/ Image: Dubai Media Office

UAE National Day 2025 – The possibility of a very long weekend

Commemoration Day is officially recognized on November 30, but is typically observed on December 1.



If December 1 (Monday) is also declared a holiday, either in addition to or replacing December 3, residents would get a 4-day or even 5-day weekend when combined with the Saturday-Sunday weekend before it.



Key dates to know:





Saturday, November 29, 2025 – Regular weekend

– Regular weekend Sunday, November 30, 2025 – Official date of UAE Commemoration Day(not typically a day off)

– Official date of UAE Commemoration Day(not typically a day off) Monday, December 1, 2025 – Observed Commemoration Day(could potentially be declared a public holiday)

– Observed Commemoration Day(could potentially be declared a public holiday) Tuesday, December 2, 2025 – UAE National Day (official public holiday)

– UAE National Day (official public holiday) Wednesday, December 3, 2025 – Second official day off for National Day (may be shifted to Monday, December 1, under the public holiday law)

The law that could give UAE National Day weekend a 5-day break





Key points of the law:





The law applies to non-Eid holidays, including New Year’s Day, Islamic New Year, Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), and National Day

The two major religious holidays, Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha, are excluded from this flexibility. If they fall on a weekend, they cannot be moved.





Commemoration Day – Its role in the holiday equation

If December 1 (Monday) is officially added as a public holiday in 2025, and paired with December 2 and 3, residents would get three consecutive weekdays off.



Combine this with the standard Saturday-Sunday weekend (November 29–30), and the result is a 5-day break.



Alternatively, a more probable scenario is that the Cabinet moves the December 3 holiday to Monday, December 1, effectively offering a 4-day weekend instead.





How the UAE celebrates National Day

Final word





Will UAE residents get a five-day weekend this December? With National Day falling midweek, a flexible holiday policy, and a perfectly timed calendar alignment, there’s a real possibility that 2025 could bring one of the longest breaks of the year.The UAE will celebrate its 54th National Day on Tuesday, December 2, 2025, marking more than half a century since the unification of the Emirates. National Day, also called Eid Al Etihad, commemorates the 1971 federation of six emirates, with Ras Al Khaimah joining in 1972, and symbolizes the country’s independence from British treaties and the start of nationhood under Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.By law, December 2 and 3 are official National Day holidays across the UAE. In 2025, these dates fall on Tuesday and Wednesday, placing the celebration midweek. However, due to updates in the UAE’s public holiday law, there's potential for this to turn into a much longer break.Here’s how it could play out:Nothing has been officially confirmed yet, but similar decisions in past years, and the UAE’s ongoing focus on improving work-life balance, make this scenario increasingly likely.In 2024, the UAE introduced a key revision to its public holiday law aimed at enhancing work-life balance.This legal amendment, announced in the summer of 2024, allows non-Eid public holidays to be moved to the beginning or end of the week if they happen to fall midweek or on weekends. The intent is to help residents benefit more from their holidays through longer, uninterrupted breaks.The official wording states:“With the exception of Eid holidays, the Cabinet may – pursuant to a resolution it issues – transfer any of the public holidays referred to in Article (1) of this Resolution to the beginning or end of the week.”Previously, if a holiday like the Islamic New Year fell on a Sunday, already part of the weekend, workers in the private sector didn’t get an extra day off. For instance, in 2024, Muharram 1 fell on Sunday, July 7, rendering the paid holiday ineffective for many. Under the new rule, that holiday could now be shifted to a Friday or Monday, ensuring residents still benefit.In short: the National Day holiday falling midweek in 2025, combined with Commemoration Day on Monday, sets the stage for either a 4-day or 5-day holiday, depending on how the government chooses to apply this flexibility.UAE Commemoration Day honors the memory of Emiratis who have given their lives in service to the nation. While officially designated as November 30, but usually not with a public holiday, it has been observed on December 1 in recent years, especially when aligning with National Day schedules.Here’s why Commemoration Day matters in this scenario:The UAE's local governments also have discretion to declare additional public holidays not explicitly listed in federal resolutions. This means that emirates such as Dubai or Abu Dhabi could theoretically extend the break by adding Commemoration Day to the public holiday calendar as part of the National Day celebrations.UAE National Day on December 2 is always a big deal, and 2025 is set to be no different. Expect the skies to light up with fireworks and laser shows across landmarks like Burj Khalifa, Dubai Festival City, and the Abu Dhabi Corniche.Streets and buildings will be draped in the national colors, red, green, white, and black, and everyone from kids to grandparents gets into the spirit with festive outfits and flag displays.Traditional dances like Al Ayallah and Al Harbiya, along with poetry and music, bring the country’s heritage to life. In Dubai, the Rashid Boulevard parade steals the spotlight with marching bands, eye-catching floats, and surprise characters. The highlight, though, is the official celebration attended by the rulers of all seven emirates, a powerful show of unity and national pride.While the official announcement is still pending, the calendar setup, holiday law, and past practice suggest there’s a good chance of an extended 5-day UAE National Day weekend. Whether it ends up being four or five days, UAE residents can likely expect a meaningful and festive holiday period this winter.Stay tuned for the official word, but maybe don’t book your December 1 meetings just yet.","Uae national day holidays in 2025 are officially december 2 and 3, with possible shifts to extend the weekend.
