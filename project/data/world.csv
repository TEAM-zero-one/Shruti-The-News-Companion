India’s port curbs threaten regional trade: Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-port-curbs-threaten-regional-trade-bangladesh/articleshow/121255685.cms,"Agency photo

DHAKA: Bangladeshi exporters are raising concerns over India’s newly imposed port restrictions on key export items such as readymade garments (RMG) and processed foods, warning that the move will lead to “delays, higher costs, and disruptions” in bilateral and regional trade. While experts view the restrictions as non-tariff barriers that could significantly impact Bangladesh’s export competitiveness, the interim govt has said that any issues arising from the new measures will be addressed through dialogue, expressing hope that trade ties will remain stable.Commerce adviser SK Bashir Uddin on Sunday said the govt has not yet received any formal notification on the restrictions. Expressing optimism that trade will continue, he said, “This is in the interest of consumers and production sectors on both sides.”Meanwhile, 17 trucks carrying food products were stuck at the Burimari border due to the restrictions. These truckloads of goods were scheduled to cross the border on Sunday morning and head to Siliguri (West Bengal).A former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) said it will now take longer for Bangladeshi garments to reach their destinations than before, and costs will rise. “That means exports will decrease to some extent,” he added. “At a time when world trade is beset by various problems, such reciprocal trade restrictions will further increase the level of damage to both sides,” the exporter noted.The commerce adviser also said the govt has started assessing the potential impact of the Indian govt’s move. “We have initiated a preliminary review to determine the steps Bangladesh should consider,” he said.On Saturday, in a “retaliatory move”, the Indian govt restricted the import of several products from Bangladesh, including a ban on the entry of readymade garments through the land route.In a notification issued on Saturday, the directorate general of foreign trade, however, allowed garments, the mainstay of Bangladesh industry, to be only shipped via Nhava Sheva and Kolkata ports. While fish, edible oil, LPG and crushed stones have been spared, import of several products via all land customs stations and integrated check posts in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Changrabandha and Fulbari in West Bengal will be discontinued.",Bangladeshi exporters are raising concerns over india’s newly imposed port restrictions on key export items.

India continues to stress there’s only a pause in

NEW DELHI: The understanding with Pakistan to cease cross-border military hostilities does not have an “expiry date”, Indian Army said on Sunday, rejecting reports from Islamabad that the “ceasefire” was being extended periodically.India has made it clear that the ongoing truce, which came into effect at 5 pm on May 10 after India’s deep precision strikes on nine Pakistani airbases as well as a few radar sites earlier that day, is conditional and depends on Islamabad’s behaviour.The Indian Army also said that no further talks were scheduled between its DGMO Lt-General Rajiv Ghai and his Pakistani counterpart, Major General Kashif Abdullah.Stressing that India has kept Pakistan “on probation” to ascertain whether it ceases cross-border terror, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said on Friday, “If Pakistan’s behaviour improves, it is fine. But if there is any disturbance, harshest punishment will be given.”“As far as continuation of the break in hostilities is concerned, as decided in the interaction between the DGMOs of May 12, there is no expiry date to it,” the Army added, in a brief statement on Sunday.The two countries have decided to continue their confidence building measures to gradually reduce the high alertness levels between the rival militaries ranged against each other all along the western front.“This is being done to ensure neither side fires or initiates any aggressive and inimical action,” an official said. On May 10, the two sides had also agreed to “consider immediate measures” to ensure troop reduction along the Line of Control as well as the international boundary.India, however, has repeatedly stressed that there is only a “pause” in Operation Sindoor, with the armed forces maintaining full operational readiness to respond to any misadventure from Pakistan. “Our actions were just a trailer, and if need be, we will show the full picture. Attacking and eliminating terrorism is the new normal of New India,” the defence minister had said at the Bhuj air force station on Friday.","India has made it clear that the ongoing truce is conditional and depends on islamabad’s behaviour.

Supreme Court Criticizes Repeated PILs on Rohingya Deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-irked-by-repeated-pils-to-stop-rohingya-deportation/articleshow/121220210.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday was irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims within a fortnight and told senior advocate Colin Gonsalves that he can’t be filing PIL after PIL on the same issue without any new fact to seek modification of SC’s May 8 decision refusing relief.On May 8, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had refused to grant interim stay on apprehended deportation of Rohingyas despite spirited arguments from Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan. The bench had said Rohingyas, who are not Indian citizens, do not have a right to reside anywhere in the country.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said India is not a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees and disputed validity of UNHCR granting refugee status to Rohingyas, who are from Myanmar and had fled to other countries because of serious threat to their lives from the military.On Friday, Gonsalves said on May 8 itself the Union govt had deported 28 Rohingyas, who were handcuffed and taken to Andaman Island, given life jackets and pushed towards Myanmar. After somehow reaching Myanmar, they took help of fishermen to make phone calls to their relatives in Delhi to inform them that they faced imminent threats to their lives.The bench of Justices Kant and Singh said these are bald averments and who is there to verify these facts are true to his knowledge. “When the country is facing such a situation at present, you cannot come up with fanciful PILs like this. There is no material to support vague and sweeping allegations made in the petition. Unless the petitioner provides prima facie credible material, it is difficult to pass an interim order which is contrary to the one refused on May 8 by a 3-J bench.”Gonsalves cited a SC judgement on protection of Chakma refugees to seek similar relief for Rohingyas. He also cited a UN Report as well as an order of the International Court of Justice to claim that Rohingyas are not migrants but refugees whose protection of lives is mandated by the UN.The bench said, “We do not want to comment on the UN Report today. We will give an answer to that on July 31, when this petition along with the pending one would be taken up for hearing.” Gonsalves said this would allow govt to deport more Rohingyas, whose number exceed 8,000 in different parts of the country and 800 of them are in Delhi.","Supreme court irked by successive attempts through pil to stop alleged deportation of rohingya muslims within a fortnight.

"Trump Jr’s buddy pushes group’s biz in Pak, Bangladesh & Turkiye",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-jrs-buddy-pushes-groups-biz-in-pak-bangladesh-turkiye/articleshow/121254847.cms,"US President Donald Trump

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump ’s interest in Pakistan seems to go deeper than just the cryptocurrency venture his aides have been found pushing for recently with Islamabad for his family firm.It has now emerged that Gentry Beach , a hunting buddy and college friend of Donald Trump Jr , the US President’s son, visited Pakistan in Jan and later Bangladesh and Turkiye, and came back to brief Trump Sr and his close aides at Mar-a-Lago about the “amazing place called Pakistan” and a potential to cut deals worth billions of dollars in explorations of rare earth minerals , oil & gas, and real estate.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hosted him twice, first in Islamabad in Jan in the presence of his senior cabinet colleagues, including the ministers for finance and foreign affairs, and again in Dubai on Feb 11, on the sidelines of the summit of world govts.Beach was an exceptionally unknown face among hosts of foreign dignitaries and heads of state Sharif met and posted pictures with on his official twitter handle @PakPMO.In Bangladesh, where Beach met the country’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, a day after meeting the Pakistani PM (on Jan 29), Trump’s close associate promised Dhaka of bringing in huge FDIs in oil and gas exploration businesses and investments in aerospace, defence and real estate.Controversy is not new to Trump Jr and his association with his buddy Beach, a Texas hedge fund manager. In 2018, The Guardian wrote how Trump Jr’s hunting buddy had helped raise millions of dollars in the 2016 campaign funding for Donald Trump. This led him to gain access to Trump’s top administration officials, including the National Security Council officials “to push a plan that could curb US sanctions in Venezuela and open up business for US companies in the oil-rich nation”.Beach scouting for businesses in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Turkey brings in a similar concern that was raised when the Trump aide was seeking withdrawal of sanctions for Venezuela. In both cases, there was scant regard for national security concerns when it offered lucrative deals to Trump & Co in return. It is a well-known fact that Beach’s father, Gary, was convicted in a bankruptcy fraud.When Pakistan was busy conspiring the Pahalgam terror attack, Beach was signing a deal in Istanbul (on Apr 17) with a Turkish group Tera Holding for a joint venture to be set up in Dubai on oil and mining. In all three countries he was feted as Trump’s point person who meant business. While in Pakistan he noted the Islamic country had rare earth reserves of more than $50 trillion; to Turkey, he offered to turn the country into the next factory of the world, replacing China.On May 15, TOI had reported how Donald Trump’s attempt to be a broker in the conflict between India and Pakistan has the spotlight on a deal the hostile neighbour recently negotiated with World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture in which the family of the US President has 60% stake.The deal was signed between the hastily-launched Pakistan Crypto Council, which appointed early last month Changzpeng Zhao(CZ), the founder of Binance, world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, as its advisor with the ambitious objective of making Islamabad South Asia’s crypto capital.Though the Crypto Council was barely days old, World Liberty Financial sent its heavy guns , including Zachary Witkoff son of Trump’s golf buddy Steve, to Islamabad where they were feted by Sharif and, more crucially, army chief general Asim Munir who just days later “cleared” the mass killing in Pahalgam of tourists who were segregated on the basis of their faith.World Liberty Financial’s stakeholders include Trump's two sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr who, along with their brother-in law, Jared Kushner, have been scouring different parts for lucrative business deals and have attracted allegations of leveraging their links to the White House.",Gentry beach is a hunting buddy and college friend of donald trump jr.

She was in Pakistan before the Pahalgam attack , and the investigation is ongoing to establish any possible linkages,” he told reporters.Police said she had travelled twice to Pakistan and was in touch with other Indian influencers as well as Pakistan Information Officers (PIOs). During questioning, she reportedly admitted to meeting a Pakistani officer, Ahsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish, at the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi in 2023. She allegedly exchanged numbers with him and later met with Pakistani intelligence officials during her trips.“Suspicious materials were recovered from her mobile phone and laptop,” said Hisar DSP Kamaljeet.

GANDHINAGAR: Operation Sindoor dismantled terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan and exposed Islamabad’s longstanding denial of harbouring terrorism, Union home minister Amit Shah said Sunday in Ahmedabad. “As our indigenously developed BrahMos (supersonic cruise missile) destroyed Pakistan’s airbases, its air defence system — borrowed from China — remained unused,” he said.Shah said armed forces penetrated 100km into Pakistani territory in response to Pahalgam terrorist attack that claimed 26 lives. The operation, he said, obliterated terrorist hubs in both Pakistan and PoK. “Our air force carried out precise attacks on locations previously considered impregnable. Operation Sindoor will be written in golden letters when the history of border security is recorded,” he said.Shah contrasted the mission with earlier surgical and airstrikes, saying those were confined to POK, whereas Operation Sindoor targeted deep Pakistani territory. He said Pakistan was exposed globally when Indian missiles took out terrorists whom Pakistan claimed did not exist on its soil. “Terrorists were eliminated, and the next day senior officers of Pakistani army attended their funerals and offered prayers — revealing the direct link between Pakistan, its army, and terrorism,” Shah said.Shah credited Modi’s “strong political will”, along with military precision and intelligence accuracy, for the operation’s success. Shah said govt had sent a clear message to Pakistan: terrorism and trade cannot coexist: “Modiji made it clear that Indus and blood will not flow together.”","Shah said armed forces penetrated 100km into pakistani territory in response to pahalgam terrorist attack that claimed 26 lives.

Didn’t ask Congress for names for foreign outreach: Govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/didnt-ask-congress-for-names-for-foreign-outreach-govt/articleshow/121255131.cms,"Union minister Kiren Rijiju

Didn’t go by Congress’s internal dynamics: Rijiju

NEW DELHI: The govt has dismissed Congress’s charge that it asked the opposition party to nominate four MPs for all-party delegations going abroad for anti-terror outreach , only to reject three of them.Leader of opposition in LS Rahul Gandhi and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge were informed about the delegations only as a matter of courtesy, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said in his first formal response to Congress’s charge.In an exclusive conversation with TOI, Rijiju also said asking parties to recommend their nominees had never been the practice. “We let them know as a matter of sheer courtesy,” he said.Seven delegations of MPs are headed to different parts of the world to sensitise global opinion on Pakistan’s continuing use of terrorism. Four Congress MPs are part of the teams; Kerala MP Shashi Tharoor heads one of the delegations.Asked about Congress’s criticism of the choices from its ranks, Rijiju maintained that the govt went by who would be more suitable for the delegations’ mission. “We are surprised by the opposition to the nomination of their members like Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari. The two have been essential voices from their side in any debate on foreign policy and matters related to national security . And it is not even a year since they recommended Tharoor to head the standing committee on external affairs,” the minister said.Responding to the suggestion implied in Congress’s criticism that Tharoor and Tewari were picked to taunt the party leadership, Rijiju said, “This is an insinuation. We did not go by a party’s internal dynamics and the insecurity and jealousies that come with that. We also chose Salman Khurshid and Amar Singh, their MP from Punjab. What do you have to say about those?”Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had criticised the govt for settling on the names of Tharoor and Tewari at the expense of Rahul Gandhi’s recommendations. “This proves the complete insincerity of the Modi govt and shows the cheap political games it always played on national issues,” he had said.Congress believes Tharoor, formerly with the United Nations and also minister of state for external affairs, was chosen because he took a different line from the party on Operation Sindoor . His statement last week that he was proud of the operation came just when Congress had announced its plan to sharpen the charge that US President Donald Trump had brokered the ceasefire with Pakistan. When told that his views were at odds with Congress’s official line, the Thiruvananthapuram MP had said he was “speaking as a proud Indian”. Few were surprised when Rahul left him off the list that included Gaurav Gogoi, Anand Sharma, Raja Warring and Syed Naseer Hussain. The govt only accepted Sharma, former commerce minister.BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya had defended the decision saying that three supporters of Hussain were arrested for shouting “Pakistan Zindabad” to celebrate his election to Rajya Sabha. Malviya had also questioned Congress’s choice of Gogoi, saying the Congress deputy leader in LS had spent 15 days in Pakistan, while his wife was involved with an NGO focused on Pakistan.",Seven delegations of mps are headed to different parts of the world to sensitise global opinion on pakistan’s continuing use of terrorism.

The arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad , who teaches at Ashoka University , was based on a complaint filed by a BJP Yuva Morcha leader, news agency PTI reported.""Ali Khan Mahmudabad has been arrested from Delhi,"" Ajeet Singh, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Rai police station, was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI. He confirmed that the arrest is linked to remarks made about Operation Sindoor.According to, the student newspaper of Ashoka University, the associate professor was taken from his residence in Delhi on Sunday morning and is currently being held at the Rai police station in Haryana.The Haryana state commission for women had earlier issued a notice to Mahmudabad regarding his comments on Operation Sindoor. The notice, dated May 12, said that the Commission had taken suo motu cognisance of the ""public statements/remarks"" made by him ""on or about May 7."" Mahmudabad heads the political science department at Ashoka University in Sonipat.On May 8, Ali Khan Mahmudabad, head of the political science department at Ashoka University, posted on social media pointing out what he saw as irony in the praise from right-wing commentators for Colonel Sofia Qureshi. Qureshi had represented the Army during media briefings on India’s military strikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.""Perhaps they could also equally loudly demand that the victims of mob lynchings, arbitrary bulldozing and others who are victims of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s hate mongering be protected as Indian citizens,"" he had written.Mahmudabad also said the appearance of Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh at press briefings was significant, but added that ""optics must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy.""The professor added in his facebook post, ""For me the press conference was just a fleeting glimpse- an illusion and allusion perhaps- to an India that defied the logic on which Pakistan was built. As I said, the grassroots reality that common Muslims face is different from what the government tried to show but at the same time the press conference shows that an India, united it its diversity, is not completely dead as an idea.""He later said the women’s commission had ""completely misunderstood"" his comments and that its notice did not show how his posts were ""contrary to the right of or laws for women.""Mahmudabad said, ""If anything, my entire comments were about safeguarding the lives of both citizens and soldiers. Furthermore, there is nothing remotely misogynistic about my comments that could be construed as anti-women.""On May 7, Armed forces carried out Operation Sindoor, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This action came in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed.","The arrest of ali khan mahmudabad was based on a complaint filed by a bjp yuva morcha leader.

IMF to Pakistan

IMF lists 11 new riders for Pakistan to avail loan

NEW DELHI: Days after clearing fresh assistance despite India’s strong opposition, International Monetary Fund (IMF) has flagged that heightened tension with its neighbour could increase the “enterprise risk” for Pakistan’s agreed reforms, while also cautioning about “reputational risk” due to a perception of fund diversion.Setting out 11 new structural benchmarks for reforms under the bailout scheme, the multi-lateral agency warned “an intensification of political or social tensions” could also impact policy and reform implementation, in what was probably a reference to internal conflicts in Pakistan.India’s concern, however, has more to do with the way Pakistan is being provided assistance despite its strong links with terror, as pointed out by Rajnath Singh last week. He had sounded an alert about possible diversion of funds by Pakistan govt to rebuild terror bases destroyed by Indian forces, and called for a rethink of the IMF assistance.In the midst of Operation Sindoor , at the IMF board meeting on May 9, India had red-flagged disbursement of $1 billion loan to Pakistan, along with fresh assistance of $1.4 billion in the name of climate resilience, but the US and European countries backed the proposal and approved it.Reputational risks could also come from any perceived lack of even handed or if there was a perceived misuse of Fund disbursements. As mitigants, the Pakistani authorities have reiterated their strong commitment to the programme, which is designed to help restore economic stability, build resilience through stronger reserve buffers, and advance reforms to create stronger and inclusive growth,” the IMF documents noted.Amid strong criticism from India, it said, “Careful Fund (IMF) communication will be essential to underscore the Fund’s neutral role and avoid misperceptions about its lending activities.”Some of the international ratings agencies have also cautioned against an adverse impact on Pakistan of long-drawn tensions with India and the ceasefire is seen to have provided some relief to its fragile economy. The IMF documents sought to underline that the assistance to Pakistan has been given as it met the loan conditionalities.While reiterating three structural benchmarks for the 37-month programme, which started last Sept, the global body added 11 new parameters including parliamentary approval for FY26 budget in line with its prescriptions, tax reforms and a governance diagnostic assessment and phaseout of tax benefits for SEZs and industrial parks.Besides, it has underlined the need to move ahead with power and gas pricing reforms and phaseout of restrictions on automobile imports.",Imf lists 11 new riders for pakistan to avail loan.

‘Saifullah confidante of LeT launch commander’

NEW DELHI: Abu Saifullah , a high-ranking Lashkar-e-Taiba operative and key recruiter, was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in Pakistan’s Sindh province early on Sunday, dealing a significant blow to the terror outfit, already reeling from the aftermath of Operation Sindoor Saifullah had been overseeing the group’s operations in Nepal, and was a key plotter in multiple terrorist attacks in India in the early 2000s, including one on RSS headquarters in Nagpur in 2006, the 2008 strike on a CRPF camp in UP’s Rampur and the attack on IISc in Bengaluru in 2005.Saifullah’s signature tactic of deploying jihadis disguised in Army fatigues or police uniforms was a distinctive feature in all three attacks, a source said.Of late, Saifullah had been asked by ISI to restrict his movements and was also provided security cover. “However, today, he had stepped out of his house in the city of Matli when he was gunned down at a nearby intersection by unidentified armed assailants on a bike,” Pak police told the local press.Saifullah was a confidante of LeT’s launch commander Azam Cheema aka Babaji, sources said. Originally named Razaullah Nizamani, he was rechristened Abu Saifullah while being dispatched for terrorist activities in Kashmir. Upon his return, Lashkar’s top brass gave him the title ‘Ghazi’, a highly sought after label by jihadis. He was since known as Ghazi Abu Saifullah.Saifullah had nine aliases, including that of Vinod Kumar, and was in-charge of LeT’s Nepal module for a long time. “He was responsible for recruitment of cadres providing financial and logistics support and facilitating movement of LeT operatives across the Indo-Nepal border. He used the alias of Vinod while operating in Nepal,” a dossier on him says.He returned to Pakistan after carrying out jihadi activities in India and started working with LeT’s chief accountant Yaqub and started fundraising for Jamaat-ud-Dawah and Lashkar. Gradually, he started overseeing recruitment at the launchpads as well, sources said.He had settled in Balochistan with his wife. Of late, he had been working closely with Hamas functionaries and fundraising for Gaza and Palestine.On June 1, 2006, three terrorists—Afzal Ahmad Butt, Abu Al Kalam Alad and Usman Habib—were killed while attempting to attack the RSS headquarters in Nagpur.The attack on a CRPF camp in Rampur on Jan 1, 2008, had resulted in the death of seven jawans of the paramilitary forces and a civilian.The attack on Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru took place on Dec 28, 2005. Two-three terrorists in Army fatigues opened fire randomly, killing Manish Chander Puri, a retired professor, and injuring four others.",Abu saifullah was a high-ranking lashkar-e-taiba operative and key recruiter.

DGCA tells flying schools to maintain updated sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-tells-flying-schools-to-maintain-updated-sites/articleshow/121254861.cms,"Generative AI

NEW DELHI: Aspiring commercial pilots in India will now be able to make an informed choice for a flying training organisation (FTO) to learn the ropes.In a major reform, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Friday directed all flying schools in country to “maintain a dedicated website” with updated information on several parameters. These include, among other things, minimum and maximum time taken to complete 200 hours of flying; number of aircraft, instructors, designated examiners, availability of ground school and simulators.Apart from clearing DGCA exams and medical tests, completing 200 flying hours is a key requirement to earn a commercial pilot licence (CPL) in India. However, the long time it usually takes to do so due to multiple factors like availability of planes and instructors — apart from other concerns like safety and quality of training at many schools — sends a large number of aspiring Indians pilots abroad every year for CPL training.As reported by TOI on March 23, 2025, DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai decided to bring in transparency on FTOs. He sought to do so by requiring them to put information in public domain, based on which students choose them. The aim is to make them competitive, safer and student-friendly. Setting that plan in motion, DGCA wrote to all flying schools in country Friday. “FTOs advised to maintain a dedicated website… it must be updated regularly. Specified information must be prominently displayed and kept current,” DGCA’s letter states.",Aspiring commercial pilots in india will now be able to make an informed choice for a flying training organisation (fto) to learn the ropes.

NEW DELHI: NSA Ajit Doval spoke to Ali Akbar Ahmadian , secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran and representative of the Supreme Leader, underlining Iran’s constructive role in the region and expressed India’s interest in expanding bilateral cooperation — particularly in the development of Chabahar Port and the International North-South Transport Corridor ( INSTC ).According to an Iranian readout, he also thanked Iran for its continued assistance and support. The readout said Ahmadian affirmed that Iran and India, as two ancient civilizations, share deep-rooted ties and vast potential for political and economic collaboration. “He stressed the need to swiftly implement strategic projects and reiterated that bilateral cooperation serves the broader interests of regional peace and stability,” said the Iranian govt.Doval and Ahmadian spoke after the recent spike in tensions between India and Pakistan. The conversation came a day after Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif had a phone conversation with Iran President Masoud Pezeshkian and discussed the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours and the subsequent pause in conflict.Iran had strongly condemned the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack and also worked to defuse tensions between India and Pakistan, following India’s targeting of terrorist camps in Pakistan and POK.

Poll Should countries increase trade and humanitarian aid to help rebuild nations facing conflict and crises? No, it may create more challenges Yes, it promotes peace and development

NEW DELHI: India is learnt to have approved as a “special gesture” entry of 160 Afghan trucks carrying dry fruits and nuts through the Attari border with Pakistan, as bilateral ties with the Taliban develop rapidly even in the absence of a formal recognition for the regime in Kabul. According to sources, Pakistan held up clearance for a while on the Wagah side for the movement of the trucks before allowing some of them to unload at Attari on Friday.India had decided to shut the Attari-Wagah border on April 23, following the Pahalgam terrorist attack that took place a day earlier. Pakistan has in the past allowed one-way trade between Afghanistan and India through that border, facilitating export of Afghan goods to India but not any reverse export from India to Afghanistan.Expanding trade ties was one of the issues that external affairs minister S Jaishankar discussed with the Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in what was the first political engagement between India and the Taliban on May 15. Despite the hurdles created by transit issues in Pakistan, India remains the largest market for Afghan products in South Asia and annual trade stands at approximately $ 1 billion.The one time in the recent past Pakistan did allow India to send goods to Afghanistan through the land border was in late 2021, after India proposed sending 50,000 tonnes of wheat as aid to the drought-affected country. The Taliban, who had just returned to Kabul, pushed Pakistan to not hold up clearance for the supply.Muttaqi had called Jaishankar on Thursday ahead of his upcoming visit to Iran and China, a fact India attaches a lot of significance to. Both leaders had agreed to remain in touch and Jaishankar thanked Muttaqi for the solidarity Kabul expressed for India after the Pahalgam attack and for not buying into subsequent attempts by Pakistan authorities to sow discord between India and the Taliban, including through the claim that India fired missiles at Afghanistan. A source said this was significant “posturing” given the tense situation that followed India’s Operation Sindoor.Since foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Muttaqi in Dubai earlier this year, India has been looking to resume work on its projects in Afghanistan and, while also considering more development cooperation projects for the people of Afghanistan. These efforts will likely be further expedited by India’s move to politically engage Kabul.“We are also considering humanitarian assistance for the Afghan refugees expelled by Pakistan,’’ said a source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Formal recognition, however, will have to wait until the international community remains convinced that the Taliban dispensation is not serious about providing inclusive governance and removing restrictions on women.“Since 2021, India has sent 50,000 tonnes of wheat, 350 tonnes of medicines, 40,000 litres of Malathion and 28 tonnes of earthquake relief material to Afghanistan. We have also provided 2000 online scholarships for Afghan students. This aid was appreciated by the Afghan side,’’ added the source.",Afghan trucks allowed to unload goods at attari border with pakistan.

Justice Trivedi's career recap

Boycott of judge’s farewell not in good taste, says CJI

NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai on Friday disapproved of the decision of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the SC Advocates-on-Record Association to boycott the courtroom farewell for Justice Bela M Trivedi , the tenth woman judge in the 75-year history of the court.The boycott stemmed from a split decision of an SC bench on punishment to an AoR who had reportedly suppressed material and attempted to mislead the court in a criminal case. While Justice Trivedi had ordered the AoR’s name to be struck off the rolls for a month, her colleague Satish C Sharma had let him off with a warning.During the farewell in the CJI’s courtroom, many advocates, especially women, complimented Justice Bela M Trivedi for a sterling career that exemplified integrity, hard work and protection of institutional dignity.She had joined Ahmedabad City civil court as an additional district and sessions judge in 1995, when her father, too, was a judge in that court. She became an high court judge in 2011 and was appointed as a judge of Supreme Court in Aug 2021.CJI B R Gavai said though Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Kapil Sibal was present, the boycott of farewell of a judge by the two associations was not in good taste. “We deprecate such a stand of SCBA and SC Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA).” CJI’s bench partner Justice A G Masih said, “Good traditions must be followed and respected.”Justice Trivedi, who will retire on June 9, would not be available on the last working day of SC on May 23 prior to the summer break as she has a family wedding in the US. She said it is for the first time that the CJI has broken tradition to invite all her relatives for tea after the ceremonial bench, and dinner.Attorney general R Venkataramani said Justice Trivedi delivered justice while scrupulously adhering to the law. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Justice Trivedi has never attempted to mould relief to suit popular sentiments, which is a rare thing. This needs courage of conviction, courage to displease people. I lost most of the matters before her, as HC or SC judge, but our respect can never depend on the relief we got or refused.”SG Mehta said, “There are certain individuals who feel that ‘my word should be the last word in law’ and that never happened in Justice Trivedi’s court, where the last word was the word of law even if it was at the expense of displeasing some people... Our respect and love for the judge is not contingent upon whether relief is being granted or not.”",Cji b r gavai disapproved of the decision of the supreme court bar association and the sc advocates-on-record association to boycott the courtroom farewell for justice bela m trivedi.
