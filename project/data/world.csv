'Half of student visas US revoked are of Indians',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-of-student-visas-us-revoked-are-of-indians/articleshow/120421897.cms,"Representative Image

The US state department and Immigration & Customs Enforcement continue to aggressively target international students with visa revocations, termination of their legal status, and removal. With Indians constituting the largest cohort of international students, it isn't surprising that the majority of those impacted are from India.The American Immigration Lawyers Association collected 327 reports of visa revocations and SEVIS terminations from attorneys, students, and university employees and found that 50% of these international students were from India, followed by 14% from China.Other significant countries represented in this data include South Korea, Nepal, and Bangladesh.“These reports paint aconcerning picture of the arbitrary nature of these visa revocations and terminations,” it states in its policy brief.As per an Open Doors Report for the academic year 2023-24, India sent over 3.3 lakh students to pursue higher education in the US — an increase of 23% over the previous year. China was the second leading place of origin with almost 2.8 lakh students —this was a slight decline of 4% over the previous year. Anecdotal evidence shows that the number of Indian students aspiring to study in US is dipping sharply.However, even as the crackdown on international students continues, several hundred students have filed lawsuits in US district courts challenging arbitrary termination of their legal status. Several courts have also granted ‘temporary restraining orders’, enabling students to continue their study in US.Referring to AILA’s policy brief, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh posted on X: “A press statement issued yesterday by the American Immigration Lawyers Association is cause for concern to us in India. Out of the 327 visa revocation cases of international students collected by the organisation so far, 50% are Indians. The reasons for revocation are random and unclear. There is growing fear and apprehension. Will the external affairs minister take note and raise the concern with his US counterpart?” He also tagged foreign minister S Jaishankar.“We are aware that several Indian students have received communication from the American govt regarding their F-1 visa status, which happens to be the student visa. We are looking into the matter. Our embassy and consulates are in touch with the students to provide support,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said at a weekly press briefing.International students on completion of their studies are allowed to gain work experience under the optional practical training program for a year — this is further extended by two years from students hailing from the science, technology, engineering and mathematics field. According to the Open Doors Report, over 97,000 students undergoing OPT post completion of their studies were from India, whereas Chinese students pursuing OPT stood at around 61,000.AILA’s policy brief points out that 50% of the impacted students were on OPT. “These individuals are unable to work immediately upon the termination of their SEVIS record. The road to reinstating status for those who have already graduated and are employed on OPT is much more difficult and murkier than those who are currently students,” it stated.The grounds on which action was taken against international students were arbitrary. In some cases international students found their SEVIS records were terminated and/or visas revoked owing to a criminal record — and they did not have a history of interaction with police and there was nothing in their record that would prompt a visa revocation.Students who encountered police for infractions are instances which most US citizens would consider a daily occurrence. These included not wearing a seatbelt, tickets for illegal parking, or speeding tickets and did not warrant visa revocation and/or SEVIS termination , states AILA.There was no uniformity in the issue of notices of SEVIS termination. There were many cases where there was a delay between the SEVIS termination and when the student was informed. This is risky because if students kept working without knowing their SEVIS was terminated, it could affect their immigration status, states AILA’s policy brief.","The american immigration lawyers association collected 327 reports of visa revocations and sevis terminations from attorneys, students, and university employees. 50% of these international students were from india, followed by 14% from china.

Assure accused will not go to Tihar: UK extradition authority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assure-accused-will-not-go-to-tihar-uk-extradition-authority/articleshow/120421791.cms,"Tihar Jail

NEW DELHI: The deputy chief crown prosecutor who oversees extraditions from the UK has advised India to provide sovereign guarantee that any accused being sought to be extradited to New Delhi will not be kept in Tihar Jail, or subjected to torture and inhuman treatment in prison, reports Pradeep Thakur.The advice comes after two back-to-back rejections of extradition requests by UK courts, the last one on Apr 11 of Virkiran Awasty and his wife Ritika who are wanted in India in connection with an alleged Rs 750 crore bank fraud case. On Feb 27, the UK high court had rejected alleged arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari’s extradition while also refusing India permission to appeal in UK Supreme Court against its verdict.“...The Bhandari ruling will likewise affect other cases we are conducting which involve detention in Tihar Jail, namely the (Awasty) ‘Hassad Fraud’ case...” the prosecutor said in a communication to the Indian govt.Subject to what I set out below, all these cases will inevitably fail and further legal activity on them is futile,” the deputy chief crown prosecutor wrote.The prosecutor, who is supposed to help India with its extradition requests, told the govt it has to immediately assure UK courts in writing that no accused will run afoul of Article 3 of ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights), which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment of prisoners. In rejecting Bhandari’s extradition, the court had concluded “a real risk of Article 3 mistreatment in Tihar Jail and a generalised risk of torture during interrogation”.The deputy chief crown prosecutor said that pending an assurance, “there is no prospect of a successful appeal in this case”, referring to the rejection of the Awastys’ extradition plea and further prospects of rejection of an appeal before higher courts in the UK.“I have to stress in the strongest possible terms that the only prospect left to us to salvage the case against Mr and Mrs Awasty is the urgent provision of an unequivocal assurance from the GoI. This has been discussed in various and repeated advice and conferences but has so far not been forthcoming,” the deputy chief crown prosecutor said.The assurance pertains to the govt giving an undertaking that the accused “will not be detained in Tihar Jail, either on remand or if and when convicted; if they are to be detained on remand or upon conviction, then the detention conditions will comply with Article 3”.The deputy chief crown prosecutor said if govt failed to give these undertakings, it would “not pursue any appeal” not only in the Awasty case but also in others even if there was merit in filing an appeal.A senior district judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London had on April 11 discharged the case of Awasty “on the grounds that, firstly and because he could not be satisfied Awasty’s Art 3 ECHR rights would not be violated in the event he was detained in Tihar Jail”. The other reason cited by the judge was “insufficient evidence for a prima facie case and for abuse of process based on the two-year delay in submitting the case following its earlier discharge”.The Crown Prosecution Service said it was ready to appeal against the verdict but as per existing conditions, it was difficult to assure a favourable outcome.“As far as the Article 3 grounds are concerned, based on the papers and the latest correspondence we have received from the govt of India, I advise now that there is no prospect of a successful appeal in this case. Further, if that remains the case, the Crown Prosecution Service will not be able to lodge the necessary grounds of appeal to sustain the appeal and accordingly Awasty will be discharged, bringing the case to an end,” it said.",Advice comes after two back-to-back rejections of extradition requests by uk courts. Virkiran awasty and his wife ritika are wanted in india in connection with an alleged rs 750 crore bank fraud case.

NEW DELHI: Opposition leaders have strongly criticised Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar ’s recent comments targeting the Supreme Court, accusing him of undermining the judiciary and violating constitutional norms. Dhankhar had questioned the Supreme Court’s authority under Article 142 and criticised its verdict setting timelines for presidential assent to bills, sparking sharp reactions from opposition leaders.""Article 142 has become a nuclear missile against Democratic forces available to judiciary 24x7. We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India and on what basis? The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3). There it has to be five judges when Article 145(3) was there, the number of judges in the Supreme Court was eight, 5 out of 8, now 5 out of 30 odd more,"" Dhankhar had said.Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala expressed his deep disagreement with the Vice President's position, despite acknowledging Dhankhar's experience and intellect. He said the Supreme Court’s verdict was “timely, courageous and correct,” and clarified that even high offices such as the President or Governors are not immune to constitutional checks.“In our democracy, only the Constitution of India is supreme,” Surjewala said, adding, “Judicial independence is indeed a ‘nuclear missile’—to strike down injustice, arbitrariness and misuse of power.” He argued that if the President or Governors were allowed unchecked authority, it would render elected legislatures powerless. “The Constitution would never confer such unbridled powers,” he warned.Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee launched a scathing attack, accusing the Vice President of repeatedly making derogatory remarks about the judiciary. “This is not expected from someone holding a constitutional position,” he said.Banerjee demanded Dhankhar’s resignation, stating, “He does not deserve to remain in the post of Vice President of India. He cannot attack one of the pillars of our democracy.” His remarks came in response to Dhankhar calling Article 142 a “nuclear missile against democratic forces,” while questioning the Supreme Court’s power to direct the President.Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Manoj Kumar Jha urged for a more balanced and sensitive approach among all institutions of democracy. ""Whether it is the executive, legislature, judiciary, or media, there has to be a fine balance,"" he said.Jha stressed the need for constructive engagement instead of conflict. “We are in an era of politics where we need to think with sensitivity,” he said, cautioning against confrontations that could damage institutional integrity.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi Siva slammed Dhankhar’s comments as “unethical,” asserting that they violate the principle of separation of powers.“When all three branches act within their own spheres, we must remember that the Constitution is supreme,” Siva said. He backed the Supreme Court’s ruling, which set timelines for presidential assent, as a step towards protecting legislative authority from indefinite delays. “No constitutional authority can override bills passed by elected legislatures,” he added.Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate Kapil Sibal also criticised comments on the judiciary, expressing disappointment and questioning his understanding of constitutional principles. Sibal said he was “saddened and surprised” by Dhankhar’s remarks, particularly the comparison of Article 142 to a “nuclear missile.”He defended the judiciary as one of the most trusted institutions and accused the government of selectively accepting court rulings based on political convenience. Sibal clarified that Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to ensure complete justice and stressed that the President is a titular head who acts solely on the advice of the Cabinet. He warned against distorting this framework and criticised the Vice President for questioning the court’s composition in key verdicts.Responding to Union ministers who echoed Dhankhar’s concerns, Sibal said the bench size is determined by the Court itself and must be respected.

I say that a minister should go to the governor and be there for two years, so they can raise issues which are of public importance, will the governor be able to ignore them?"" Sibal asked during a press conference in Delhi.Calling the governor’s withholding of bills “an intrusion on the supremacy of the legislature,” Sibal added,(this is opposite of what should we). If Parliament passes a bill, can the President indefinitely delay its implementation? Even if it is not signed, does no one have the right to talk about it?”He also directed his attack at Union ministers Arjun Ram Meghwal and Kiren Rijiju for their remarks on the court’s verdict.""I am surprised about the fact that sometimes (Union minister) Meghwal says that one should stay within limits, other times (Union minister) Kiren Rijiju asks what is happening and what if they also do it? Dhankar ji says that before, 5 judges decided on a matter when there were only 8 judges, but now only two judges decide on it. However, either two or three judges decide on it anyway, as the Supreme Court sits as a bench, even with nine or eleven judges, and once thirteen also sat together, that is how it happens. People have to follow the ruling,"" Sibal, who is also SC Bar association president, said.Citing a past judgment against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Sibal questioned why Dhankhar was raising objections now.""People would remember that when the Supreme Court's decision came regarding the election of Indira Gandhi, then only one judge gave the decision, and she was unseated. It was a one-judge decision, Justice Krishna Iyer, then it was okay for Dhankar ji? But now a two-judge decision came, so that is not correct because it is not in favour of the government,"" Sibal said.Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Randeep Surjewala also expressed his dissatisfaction with Vice President Dhankhar's remarks criticism the Supreme Court's recent ruling.In a post on X, Surjewala wrote: “The Supreme Court judgement putting Constitutional fetters on the power of Governors and President of India is timely, accurate, courageous and corrects the notion that ‘those holding high offices are above any fetters or imposition of checks and balances’ in exercise of their powers.”He further added, “If President or Governors were to have such power, it will go against the very tenets of democracy, for the elected Parliament and Legislatures will be rendered powerless and helpless.”Earlier this week, Dhankhar, while addressing Rajya Sabha interns, had criticised the Supreme Court’s judgment, saying some judges are now “legislating,” performing “executive functions,” and acting like a “Super Parliament.”""President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super Parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because law of the land does not apply to them,"" Dhankhar had said.""There is a directive to the president by a recent judgment. Where are we heading? What is happening in the country? We have to be extremely sensitive. It is not a question of someone filing a review or not. We never bargained for democracy for this day,"" he said.He also invoked Article 145(3) of the Constitution, which deals with the composition of benches deciding constitutional matters.""We cannot have a situation where you direct the president of India and on what basis? The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3).

Poll What do you think about PM Modi's approach to international partnerships? Aiming to attract investment and technology. Focus on strengthening global ties and innovation.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said he had a conversation with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , revisiting topics from their earlier in-person meeting in Washington DC earlier this year. The two leaders spoke about bolstering collaboration between India and the United States in the areas of technology and innovation.“Spoke to Elon Musk and talked about various issues, including the topics we covered during our meeting in Washington DC earlier this year,” PM Modi posted on social media platform X. “We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation. India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the US in these domains,” he added.The call comes amid growing interest from Musk’s companies - particularly Tesla and Starlink - in entering the Indian market. Tesla has been in talks with Indian officials over setting up a manufacturing base in the country. Meanwhile, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio in March had announced a pact with Musk's SpaceX to bring Starlink satellite internet services in India. Telecom tycoon Sunil Bharti Mittal's Bharti Airtel has also signed a similar partnership deal with SpaceX.PM Modi and Musk had previously met in February during PM’s two-day state visit to the US, where both sides expressed optimism about future cooperation in emerging sectors such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, and space.During the meeting, the PM had presented books to Elon Musk’s three children. He had gifted them The Crescent Moon by Rabindranath Tagore, The Great RK Narayan Collection, and Panchatantra by Pandit Vishnu Sharma. He later shared photos that show the kids reading the books.PM Modi had shared a post on social media addressed to Elon Musk where he wrote, “Had a very good meeting with Elon Musk in Washington DC. We discussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology and innovation. I talked about India’s efforts towards reform and furthering ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’.”The PM Modi-Musk call comes at a crucial juncture when permission for Starlink is stuck for security clearance. It also comes against the backdrop of ongoing negotiations for a proposed bilateral trade agreement between New Delhi and Washington.The two sides have aimed at finalising the first phase of the pact by fall (September-October) this year.Meanwhile, the government has already granted license to Startlink rivals Bharti Group-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio Satellite Communications for about one-and-a-half years for providing satellite internet services.However, these companies are yet to start their operation as the government has so far not finalised spectrum allocation rules.Starlink is considered to be a disruptor in this segment as it operates the world's biggest constellation of over 6,750 satellites whereas Eutelsat OneWeb has little over 600 satellites and Jio's satellite partners operate nearly 70.","Pm modi and musk had previously met in february during pm’s two-day state visit to the us.

What is Article 142?



VP Dhankhar's concern



Tamil Nadu case



Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar expressed serious concerns on Thursday regarding the judiciary's increasing reliance on Article 142 of the Constitution.The Vice President described Article 142 as a ""nuclear missile against democratic forces"" that remains ""available to the judiciary 24 x 7,"" and called for a comprehensive review of constitutional interpretation practices in India.His comments came in the backdrop of recent judicial decisions directing presidential actions on bills. This came in response to the Supreme Court's recent ruling that set a three-month deadline for the President to decide on bills forwarded by state governors.Article 142 of the Constitution grants the Supreme Court wide discretionary powers to pass any order necessary to ensure “complete justice” in a case before it.This provision allows the apex court to override existing laws or fill legal gaps in order to comprehensively resolve a dispute. It can be used to issue directions, enforce decrees, compel production of documents, or even punish for contempt.While often seen as a powerful tool to deliver justice, Article 142 has increasingly drawn criticism from some political quarters for enabling judicial overreach .Speaking at the Valedictory Function of the Rajya Sabha Internship Programme, Dhankhar cautioned against a situation where the judiciary appears to direct the President, questioning the constitutional basis for such authority.""We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India, and on what basis? The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3),” he said, adding that such interpretation should come only from Constitution benches of five or more judges.He suggested amending Article 145(3), which governs the size of benches for deciding substantial constitutional matters, arguing that the current practice dilutes the strength originally intended when the Supreme Court had just eight judges.Referring specifically to the use of Article 142, Dhankhar said, ""Article 142 has become a nuclear missile against democratic forces, available to the judiciary 24x7.""The Vice President's comments came in response to the Supreme Court’s April 8 ruling in a case involving the Tamil Nadu government and governor RN Ravi.The top court held that once a bill is re-passed by the assembly, the governor must assent to it and cannot reserve it for the President unless substantial changes are made.The ruling, made by a bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, invoked Article 142 to provide “complete justice” by deeming all 10 bills cleared from the date they were re-presented to the governor.","Vice president jagdeep dhankhar expressed serious concerns on thursday regarding the judiciary's increasing reliance on article 142 of the constitution.

Growing up, I never heard a single swear word or indecent expression at home. The harshest one I remember was the rare reprimand, “Don’t be stupid”, from our mother which would send my sisters and me into tears for hours.In those days, decency was a non-negotiable virtue, and profanity, even when uttered by fringe voices, remained contained in the shadows, by a world untouched by social media's omnipresence. Public meetings with foul-mouthed speakers were forbidden territory.But today, the dam has burst.Words, once abandoned and found only rarely in Harold Robinson novels, are now flung around like stones in the street. The once-hushed four-letter words now find their way into our films and homes, seeping into innocent ears. College corridors ring with sexually explicit banter, and the virtual world overflows with vulgarity masquerading as stand-up comedy or free speech.Even amidst this, a recent political speech shocked the conscience of many. Delivered by a senior leader holding high office, it was a cocktail of crudeness—misogynistic, irreverent, and peppered with deliberate obscenity.Yes, free speech is the bedrock of a thriving democracy. But when profanity is dressed up as freedom, when it targets some genders, communities and denigrates symbols held sacred, it ceases to be expression and becomes aggression.It is at such junctures that the wisdom of Thiruvalluvar shines with piercing clarity.In the chapter titled “The Power of Speech”, he writes:Valluvar places this couplet in the section meant for ministers who advise kings, wield power, and influence the masses. Why? Because words, in the hands of the powerful, are like fire in the hands of a sorcerer—they can illuminate or incinerate.The—the Book of Wealth in—is often considered a manual on governance. Scholars further divide it into guidelines for kings, ministers, and frameworks for good governance. The fact that speech is highlighted in the ministerial section is no coincidence. Valluvar saw what many modern minds often overlook: governance isn't just about policies, it's about poise.Science is increasingly acknowledging the power of language on human perceptions. A study at the University of Wisconsin-Madison subjected participants to mismatched visuals and audio. When they were shown an image of a tiger but told it was a bear, their brains believed what theyrather than what they. The takeaway? Language doesn’t just describe reality; it shapes it.imagine the influence of a public speech. Every word carries a weight far heavier than the breath that bore it. It moulds opinions, cements prejudices, or inspires action. A speech cannot be separated from the speaker; words are but a larger picture of one’s inner self.Let every speaker ask himself or herself a question before stepping onto the stage:“Would I say these words in front of my daughter or granddaughter?” If that falters, the script must change.In an era that prizes volume over value, it is all the more vital that we return to the wisdom of restraint, prescribed by Valluvar.Let us choose our words with care. For they are not just sounds.They are seeds.","Thirukkural is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. Written by tamil poet and philosopher thiruvalluvar, the kural consists of 1,330 short couplets. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion bharathi bhaskar explores the masterpiece.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120404555,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76494,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: With 26/11 conspiracy accused Tahawwur Hussain Rana , recently extradited from the US, being questioned by NIA about the larger Lashkar-e-Taiba conspiracy behind 26/11attacks as well as co-accused David Headley 's reconnaissance trips to India between 2006 and 2009, any new disclosures from Rana's interrogation may prompt NIA to consider questioning Headley afresh.Headley is currently serving jail in the US, having been handed 35 years in prison following a plea bargain, under which he cannot be extradited to India, Denmark or Pakistan. Headley was interrogated by NIA in the US just once in 2010.An officer privy to the case developments said an NIA team is probing Rana to gather undisclosed details of the 26/11 conspiracy - including the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds Hafiz Saeed, Zakir ur Rehman Lakhvi, Abdur Rehman, Ilyas Kashmiri and ISI officers Major Samir Ali and Major Iqbal etc, besides a contact in Dubai - that don't figure in the US department of justice's case records. NIA will take a call ""as and when needed"" on whether it should seek fresh access to Headley to confront him with any additional information revealed by Rana, an officer told TOI. It will be interesting to see how the US will view such a request.Sources said Rana, who had cited multiple health concerns in pleas before US courts to stall his extradition, is being subjected to medical examination every 48 hours in NIA custody. A source said Rana has been cooperating with the investigation, but brings up his ailments from time to time.Meanwhile, former home secretary G K Pillai, who was in office when Headley was questioned in the US by NIA, told TOI that Headley was Rana's prime link to the 26/11 conspiracy and would regularly update the latter on the Pakistani handlers' terror plans and reconnaissance tips. Headley had first informed Rana in 2006 that he was tasked by LeT to conduct surveillance of 26/11 targets. Rana, a deserter from Pakistan Army, was included in the terror plot by Headley, in consultation with his LeT handlers. Rana arranged travel documents for Headley and allowed his immigration business to be used as a ""cover"" for Headley's reconnaissance trips to both India and Denmark.","Tahawwur hussain rana is being questioned by nia about the larger lashkar-e-taiba conspiracy behind 26/11attacks.

NEW DELHI: In the biggest such reshuffle in economic ministries in several years, government Friday appointed four new secretaries in the finance ministry - expenditure, economic affairs, revenue and public enterprises - while naming new heads for commerce, labour and civil aviation. In all, 18 new secretaries were named across departments.Aviation secretary V Vualnam is expenditure secretary, replacing Manoj Govil, who moves as secretary (coordination) in cabinet secretariat. PMO's Arvind Srivastava will head revenue.Anuradha Thakur will take charge of department of economic affairs once finance secretary Ajay Seth retires at the end of May. K Moses Chalai, currently in Inter State Council, is the new public enterprises secretary. Rajesh Agrawal, additional secretary in commerce department and India’s chief negotiator for the pro- posed trade deal with the US, has been designated commerce secretary and will take over once Sunil Barthwal retires at the end of Sept. The appointment is meant to signal continuity at a time when the global economy has been pushed into turmoil by US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. Agrawal, also from the 1994 batch, has been dealing with crucial negotiations including those with Asean, and farm trade.It is virtually unprecedented to name new secretaries for the three core departments in the finance ministry, revenue, expenditure and DEA, on the same day. In recent months, the finance ministry has seen several changes in the top deck, but the latest round appears to put a team in place to work with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman . Thakur and Srivastava have over five years of service, while Vualnam has more than three years to go.Vualnam from the 1992 batch has had stints in DEA, including as additional secretary, while Srivastava was handling economic issues in PMO after heading the budget division in the finance ministry.

Military operations crippled as ALHs continue to remain grounded,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/military-operations-crippled-as-alhs-continue-to-remain-grounded/articleshow/120416162.cms,"'Dhruv' advanced light helicopters

NEW DELHI: It’s a double whammy for the armed forces. Already grappling with the high crash rate and low serviceability of their 350 obsolete single-engine Cheetah and Chetak choppers, the prolonged grounding of the around 330 twin-engine `Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) has majorly hit military operations and preparedness.The armed forces bank heavily on the multi-role ALHs for ‘sustenance flights’ to forward areas and posts along the unresolved borders with China and Pakistan as well as for observation and reconnaissance, search and rescue missions. “All have suffered major disruptions for over three months now. ALH pilots are also losing flying currency, and forced to make do with simulators,” a senior officer told TOI.The most affected is the over 11.5-lakh strong Army, which has a fleet of over 180 ALHs, including 60 weaponized versions called `Rudra’, manufactured by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL).The IAF, in turn, has 75 ALHs, while Navy 24 and Coast Guard 19. The 5.5-tonne ALHs have been military workhorses since their induction began in 2002, with the choppers in the Army alone clocking around 40,000 hours of flying in 2023-24.The grounding of all the ALHs, ever since a crash killed two Coast Guard pilots and an aircrew diver in Porbandar on Jan 5, has also compounded the long-standing problem of huge shortfalls in rotary-wing birds.The armed forces, in fact, have projected a requirement of over 1,000 new choppers of different types over the next 10-15 years, including 484 light utility helicopters (LUH) in the 3.5-tonne class and 419 Indian multi-role helicopters (IMRH) in the 10-15-tonne class. But there has been huge delays in these projects being executed by HAL.These new choppers are in addition to the 156 `Prachand’ light combat helicopters (Army 90, IAF 66) that have to be delivered in the 2028-2033 timeframe under the Rs 62,700 crore deal inked with HAL last month.A small silver lining in the overall grim situation has been the Army’s hiring of some civil choppers for transportation of troops and supply of logistics to remote high-altitude posts along the northern and western borders.“The use of civil choppers was started by the Army’s Northern and Central Commands last Nov due to the huge shortage of helicopters. If that had not been done, it would have become extremely tough to supply troops deployed in forward locations after the grounding of ALHs,” an officer said.Under this first-ever outsourcing of logistical support, the Army has inked contracts worth over Rs 70 crore with Pawan Hans, Himalayan Heli Services, Global Vectra, and Thumby Aviation for airlift of over 1,000 tonne of supplies from mid-Nov to mid-July. Till now, these civil choppers have flown over 1,500 hours to deliver about 900 tonne in Kargil, Gurez, Kishtwar, Garhwal and Himachal sectors, among others.“They proved a boon for soldiers deployed in over 30 remote posts in high altitude areas of Himalayas in J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand especially after the ALH fleet was grounded. The Army plans to begin this soon in the eastern sector as well,” the officer said.The use of civil helicopters for such logistical tasks also helps preserve the operational service life of military helicopters for more critical roles during conflicts or emergencies.The ALHs, of course, need to take to the skies again soon. HAL, however, is yet to conclusively establish the “root cause” behind the “swashplate fracture” in the ill-fated helicopter that made the Coast Guard pilots lose control of their flying machine over three months ago. Safety checks have found signs of similar material failures in some other ALHs, officials said.“ALHs have been grounded three-four times for safety checks after crashes in recent years. This time, the entire process should be thorough and transparent without any patchwork solutions. Precious lives and operational preparedness, after all, cannot be put at risk,” an experienced military pilot said.",The prolonged grounding of the around 330 twin-engine `dhruv’ advanced light helicopters has majorly hit military operations and preparedness.

Let the worms and skeletons be in public domain: Dhankhar on discovery of cash at high court judge's house

NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday criticised the Supreme Court’s recent judgment that set a timeline for the President to decide on bills forwarded by governors, saying such a directive undermines the constitutional role of the country’s highest office.Speaking to the sixth batch of Rajya Sabha interns at the Vice-President’s Enclave, Dhankhar questioned, “We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India and on what basis?”""There is a directive to the President by a recent judgement. Where are we heading? What is happening in the country? We have to be extremely sensitive. It is not a question of someone filing a review or not. We never bargained for democracy for this day. President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, becomes law,"" Dhankhar added.""President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super Parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because law of the land does not apply to them,"" he further added.Also read: In a first, SC sets 3-month deadline for President to decide on bills referred by governors He added that the Constitution gives the judiciary the power to interpret the law under Article 145(3), but it does not authorise courts to issue directives to the President.""The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3). There it has to be five judges or more,"" the VP said.His comments come in response to an April 8 judgment by the Supreme Court, which for the first time imposed a three-month deadline for the President to act on bills reserved by state governors. The apex court held that any delay beyond this period must be justified, and urged state governments to cooperate with the Centre on such matters. The ruling followed a constitutional standoff in Tamil Nadu, where Governor RN Ravi had withheld assent to several bills for extended periods, prompting the state to seek judicial intervention.Speaking on the alleged discovery of cash at former Delhi high court judge Yashwant Verma's house, Dhankhar said the President and Governors enjoy constitutional immunity from prosecution, a privilege not extended to other public figures, including judges.Dhankhar said it has been over a month since the issue came to light and “let the worms and skeletons be in public domain”.""It is now over a month. Even if it is can of worms. Even if there are skeletons in the cupboard, time to blow up the can. Time for its lid to go out. And time for the cupboard to collapse. Let the worms and skeletons be in public domain so that cleansing takes place,"" VP Jagdeep Dhankhar said.The Supreme Court, in its ruling, had set aside the Tamil Nadu Governor ’s second round of referring ten bills to the President, calling it legally flawed. The justices clarified that if the President withholds assent, the state government has the right to challenge the decision in court.","Vice president jagdeep dhankhar criticised the supreme court's recent judgment that set a timeline for the president to decide on bills forwarded by governors.

As far as trade issues are concerned, last week we had made an announcement regarding trans-shipment facility,"" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said during weekly media briefing when asked about India-Bangladesh trade relations.""We had taken that measure because of the congestion that we see on our Ports and our Airports. But I would also remind you, please do have a look at the developments that have happened on the Bangladeshi side prior to us announcing these measures,"" he added.India has disallowed transshipment of cargo from Bangladesh to third countries, dealing a blow to Dhaka exporting apparel through air freighters, largely from Delhi.Global brands such as Zara, which use the route to meet their international need, will have to rework their sourcing strategy. The customs circular, issued Tuesday, said cargo that had already entered India would be allowed to be shipped out. Confirming the development that comes amid the strife in India-Bangladesh ties, MEA said the transshipment used to cause congestion at Indian airports and ports, but added the order won't hit Dhaka's exports to Nepal and Bhutan passing through India.The transhipment arrangement, established in 2020 to enhance trade relations, has been affected by recent developments.Jaiswal mentioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's message to Muhammad Yunus during their initial meeting in Thailand at a BIMSTEC Summit, expressing India's desire for ""positive and constructive"" relations with Bangladesh.Bangladesh suspended Indian yarn imports through land ports in March. Additionally, a committee under Bangladesh's interim government suggested closing Chilahati, Daulatganj and Tegamukh land ports along the Indian border, while recommending suspension of Balla land port operations.India-Bangladesh relations deteriorated significantly after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's departure from Dhaka in August last year amid large-scale anti-government protests.Relations worsened further when the interim government led by Yunus proved unable to prevent attacks against minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh.",India has disallowed transshipment of cargo from bangladesh to third countries.

US Visa Denial: Indian national’s US visa denied in 40 seconds.

NEW DELHI: An Indian national shared their disappointing experience on Reddit of being denied a US B1/B2 tourist visa within 40 seconds of their interview, despite having a steady job and a clear travel plan. The post has since drawn widespread attention, sparking a discussion on common pitfalls in the US visa application process.The user, who planned a two-week vacation in Florida to visit popular attractions like Disney World and Universal Studios, said their visa interview at the US Embassy was cut short after just three questions.“Why do you want to travel to the US?”, “Have you travelled outside of India?”, and “Do you have family or friends in the US?”, these were the only questions asked before the consular officer handed over a 214(b) refusal slip.In response, the user admitted they had no prior international travel experience and that their girlfriend resides in Florida. “I said yes, my girlfriend lives in Florida whom I plan to visit,” they explained. Immediately after this, the officer declared them ineligible.A fellow Reddit user summed up the situation bluntly: “You’re a textbook denial, unfortunately for you. You have zero travel history, and a girlfriend in the US. That’s a strong tie to America and no strong reason to return to India.”Failure to demonstrate strong ties to one's home country is among the most common reasons for visa rejection. These ties can include stable employment, property, or family commitments.In this case, despite the applicant having a steady job in India, the lack of international travel history combined with the mention of a romantic partner in the US may have raised red flags regarding the risk of overstaying.Visa applicants are also advised to ensure clarity and consistency in presenting their travel purpose. Providing incorrect or inconsistent information about travel plans, or failing to adequately explain the purpose of the visit, can raise doubts and lead to denial.While the Redditor was honest about their reasons, others on the thread suggested a more cautious approach. One user advised, “You could have just said, ‘I have a friend.’ There was no need to say girlfriend.” Another recommended building a stronger travel record by first visiting countries in Europe or Asia.Before applying for a US visa, applicants must prepare thoroughly for the interview by familiarising themselves with the purpose of their trip and being able to articulate their travel plans clearly.","An indian national shared their disappointing experience on reddit of being denied a us b1/b2 tourist visa.
