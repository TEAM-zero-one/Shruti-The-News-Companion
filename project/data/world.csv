NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday asked his French counterpart, minister of the armed forces and veterans affairs of France Catherine Vautrin, “to raise India-made component” in the upcoming deal for 114 Rafale fighter jets “by up to 50%”, defence sources told TOI.During their 6th India-France Annual Defence Dialogue in Bengaluru, Rajnath also told Vautrin to “try to ensure that the engines of the (fighter) planes are made and overhauled in India. This will help our ‘Make-in-India’ effort,” the sources quoted the minister as saying.The two ministers also discussed a range of bilateral security and defence issues, including priority areas for co-development and co-production of defence equipment. India and France also renewed their defence cooperation agreement for another 10 years, announced reciprocal deployment of army officers, and inked a pact to manufacture Hammer missiles in India. An MoU on JV was signed for the manufacturing of Hammer missiles by defence PSU Bharat Electronics Limited CMD and executive vice-president of Safran Electronics and Defence.Defence PSU Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and France’s Safran company will form a JV to produce Hammer precision-guided munitions, used during Operation Sindoor, in India.Earlier, Rajnath and Vautrin attended the inaugural ceremony of the H125 Light Utility Helicopter final assembly line, jointly built by Tata Advanced Systems Ltd (TASL) and Airbus at Karnataka’s Vemagal, when PM Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron virtually inaugurated the facility from Mumbai.After the facility inauguration, Modi said, “We take pride in the fact that, together, India and France will manufacture in India the world's only helicopter capable of flying to the heights of Mount Everest and export it to the entire world.” The delivery of the first ‘Made in India’ H125 is expected in early 2027 and the helicopter will help meet the requirements of the Indian armed forces for a light multi-role helicopter and will essentially contribute to army operations on the icy heights of the Himalayas. Rajnath said the total investment for the H125 project is expected to exceed Rs 1,000 crore and create direct and indirect employment.In the presence of Modi in Mumbai, Macron said, “From Rafale jets to submarines, we are expanding defence cooperation. India and France are also working together to build a helicopter assembly line and fifth-gen fighter jet engines.”The President’s remark came days after Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisition Council gave the go-ahead for purchase of 114 Rafale jets from France. After Tuesday’s meet between Modi and Macron, the cost negotiations between two sides for the upcoming Rafale deal will get a big push and the agreement will be inked after the Cabinet’s clearance in near future.With Macron also talking about defence collaboration on submarines, India may buy additional Scorpene-class conventional submarines from France. India had already acquired six Scorpene-class submarines (Kalvari class) from France under the Project 75 programme.The French defence minister appreciated the conversion of Exercise Shakti with the Army from biennial to an annual event.During the meeting, Rajnath also raised the issue of Pakistan terrorism. He said Pakistan has a long history of nurturing, nourishing, and promoting cross-border terrorism to create disturbance and violence in India. This, he said, has created a serious threat to peace in the region.","Rajnath singh asked his french counterpart catherine vautrin to raise india-made component in the upcoming deal for 114 rafale fighter jets.

Ajit Pawar plane's black boxes damaged in fire: AAIB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ajit-pawar-planes-black-boxes-damaged-in-fire-aaib/articleshow/128481028.cms,"Plane crash on Jan 28 near Baramati airport.

Mumbai: The two independent black boxes of the Learjet aircraft that crashed at Baramati airport, killing the then Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar, sustained fire damage, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said on Tuesday. The AAIB said specialised support from the manufacturer was sought to retrieve data from one of the recorders, the cockpit voice recorder.The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR), manufactured by L3-Communications, was successfully downloaded at the AAIB Flight Recorder Laboratory, it said. The DFDR records technical parameters of the flight like aircraft speed, altitude and heading. ""The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), manufactured by Honeywell, is undergoing detailed technical examination. Assistance has been sought from accredited representative of the state of manufacture for specialised support in data retrieval,"" it said. The CVR records conversation between the pilots, the radio communications with the air traffic controller and ambient noises in the cockpit. ""Both recorders were exposed to intense heat for a prolonged period during the accident and sustained fire damage,"" it said.On Jan 28, a Learjet-45 aircraft operated by charter company VSR Ventures crashed during approach and landing at Baramati airport, killing all five people on board.While the fire that broke out after the accident left major portions of the fuselage charred, pictures from the accident site showed the tail section of the aircraft intact.""Both the black boxes are installed in the tail section and that part of the aircraft was largely intact. In fact, cartons and other cargo stored in the tail section can be seen strewn around in the wreckage with hardly any fire damage. So how did the black boxes sustain so much fire damage?"" asked Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert. Black boxes like DFDR and CVR are placed in metal armour and insulation to survive the impact, high temperatures and pressure.Sena UBT MP Sanjay Raut said the damage to CVR was ""mysterious"" and ""very serious"". The comments came in the backdrop of allegations by NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar last week. He had hinted at possible conspiracy and sabotage in the crash. Among the allegations he levied against VSR Ventures was one about the CVR. Pawar said he learned from the company's former employees that they regularly kept the CVR switched off on most flights. It is illegal to keep the CVR off.The wait now is for the preliminary report, which under investigation norms should be submitted to the International Civil Aviation Organisation within 30 days of an accident. The investigating state, India in this case, can decide whether to release the preliminary report to the public or keep it confidential.","The two independent black boxes of the learjet aircraft that crashed at baramati airport sustained fire damage, the aircraft accident investigation bureau said on tuesday.

'From 25 Years To 5’ Rajnath Singh Pushes DRDO With 5-Year Ultimatum On 5th And 6th Gen Engines

The significance of aero engines

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday urged Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) scientists to complete the indigenous aero-engine project within five years, instead of taking decades as is conventionally expected.Stressing India's strategic autonomy and the significance of mastering critical technologies at speed, the Union minister said that factoring in the nation's current circumstances and strategic requirements, the 25-year target must be compressed to five years.Rajnath Singh acknowledged the deadline as a challenge; however, he said it should not come ""as a shock or a surprise.""""If developing an engine takes 25 years, then given India’s current circumstances, our strategic requirements and our national ambitions, we must assume that 20 of those years are already gone and only five remain. This should not come as a shock or a surprise. It is a challenge. We have to achieve in these five years what other countries typically accomplish in twenty. And within that compressed timeframe, we must deliver our very best,"" said the defence minister.Rajnath Singh further said that India cannot remain limited to fifth-generation engines and must begin work on sixth-generation and advanced technologies immediately.The increasing global use of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and advanced materials in defence systems, he said, requires India to stay ahead of the curve.Speaking at the Gas Turbine Research Establishment in Bengaluru, Rajnath Singh said the establishment, functioning under the DRDO, has become ""the foundation of India's strategic capability,"" crediting its scientists for consistently delivering successful tests and strengthening the country's defence preparedness.The minister reiterated that self-reliance in critical defence technologies was no longer an option amid rapidly evolving geopolitical realities.""When we came to power, we took steps towards self-reliance. In the defence sector too, we made several efforts to promote self-reliance. As defence minister, during my nearly 7-year tenure, I made every effort to prioritise the development of the Aero engine, and we did so,"" he said.""Looking at today's global political situation, I don't think there's any need to explain how crucial self-reliance is in such critical technology. The world's geopolitical scenario is changing very rapidly. Supply chains are breaking, and new ecosystems are developing. In such a situation, only the country that has its own technology will remain safe, secure, and able to sustain itself,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.""We are passing through that historical phase when the eyes of the entire world are on India. All countries want to be a part of India's this growth story. All countries want to partner in our 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative. In such a situation, we have a lot of options, a lot of opportunities. We have to take full advantage of these opportunities and further strengthen our technological capabilities,"" he further stated.An aero engine in defence refers to the propulsion system that powers military aircraft such as fighter jets, transport planes, helicopters and certain unmanned aerial vehicles.In the case of combat aircraft, it is typically a high-performance turbofan engine that generates the thrust required for supersonic speed, rapid climb, manoeuvrability and sustained operations in demanding conditions. It also supports critical functions such as afterburner performance, payload capacity and combat range. In simple terms, the engine determines how fast, how far and how effectively a military aircraft can operate.Its significance lies in strategic autonomy. Aero engines are among the most complex and tightly controlled defence technologies in the world, mastered by only a handful of countries. If a nation depends on foreign suppliers for engines, it remains vulnerable to supply restrictions, upgrade limitations and export constraints.For India, developing an indigenous aero engine is crucial not just for powering current platforms like Tejas but also for future projects such as next-generation fighter aircraft. Mastery of this technology strengthens national security, reduces long-term dependence and places the country in an elite technological league globally.",Defence minister rajnath singh urges drdo to complete indigenous aero-engine project within five years. India cannot remain limited to fifth-generation engines and must begin work on sixth-generation and advanced technologies immediately.

'World Recognises India’s AI Power': Norway To New Zealand Praise India As AI Impact Summit Begins

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday criticised the Centre over mismanagement at the ongoing AI Impact Summit in the national capital. Party president Mallikarjun Kharge called it an example of “PR hungry” government that had turned a global opportunity into “utter chaos”.In a post on X, Kharge said that what could have been a major moment for India’s digital and artificial intelligence leadership had instead resulted in distress for participants.“What could have been a showpiece AI Summit for the entire world demonstrating the digital & AI capabilities of India, has reportedly turned into utter chaos and rank mismanagement by this ‘PR hungry’ government!” he wrote.The Congress chief alleged that founders, exhibitors and visitors faced multiple problems during the event, particularly on the first day.“Founders, exhibitors and visitors - all face extreme distress due to the PM gatecrashing for a photo opportunity on the very first day,” Kharge said.Listing the complaints, he added, “Exhibitors are left without food and water, their products are stolen, Digi Yatra miserably fails, laptops, personal electronic devices and even bags are prohibited, only cash instead of digital/UPI payment is accepted, and founders are made to pay huge sums without basic facilities, among many other reasons of distress.”Calling it an embarrassment for the country, Kharge said, “It is extremely unfortunate that, our country has to suffer this global embarassment due to the incompetancy of our own government.”He also suggested that the Centre take lessons from a state-level technology event. “Perhaps the Modi Govt should learn from the Bengaluru Tech Summit (BTS) which is an annual feature in smoothly organising such large scale Digital & Tech congregations,” he wrote.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw acknowledged the issue and assured that all problems will be addressed.""If any issue or inconvenience has come to exhibitors at AI Summit, we apologise for that. All issues will be addressed,"" Vaishnaw said.The AI Impact Summit, which began on Monday at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, is being described as the world’s largest artificial intelligence gathering. The five-day event, running from February 16 to 20, has drawn thousands of participants, including tech leaders, policymakers, startup founders and industry experts.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the summit, which will also see the participation of more than 20 heads of state and government, including France’s Emmanuel Macron and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Technology leaders such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Google’s Sundar Pichai are also scheduled to attend.The summit aims to shape a “shared roadmap for global AI governance and collaboration” and focuses on themes of “People, Planet, and Progress”. India is positioning itself as a hub for digital infrastructure and artificial intelligence, and is expected to push for wider access to AI technologies and the creation of global AI commons.PTI reporters at the venue observed long queues outside session halls due to packed schedules and high demand. Organisers said that registrations exceeded expectations, reflecting growing global interest in AI infrastructure, enterprise adoption and governance.While there were reports of logistical challenges due to heavy footfall and parallel sessions running simultaneously, the event has seen strong participation, with panel discussions and exhibitions drawing large crowds.The government has highlighted the summit as an opportunity to showcase India’s digital public infrastructure, engineering talent and its ambitions to lead global conversations on responsible and inclusive AI development.",The congress on tuesday criticised the centre over mismanagement at the ongoing ai impact summit in the national capital.

NEW DELHI: With Kerala heading towards Assembly elections, the ruling Left government on Tuesday refrained from spelling out its stand on the entry of women of menstruating age into the Sabarimala Temple , saying it would decide after consultations and when the Supreme Court seeks its response.Facing sustained pressure from the opposition, states law minister P Rajeev and Devaswom minister V N Vasavan said the apex court had only constituted a larger bench to examine review pleas and had not yet asked the state government to clarify its position.“We have always been with the devotees. There is no doubt about it. We will never stand against devotees,” Vasavan told reporters, but avoided directly answering whether the government would support or oppose women’s entry, reported PTI.He said arguments in the matter would begin in April and that the government would inform the court of its stand after necessary consultations.Rajeev echoed the position, noting that the court would first examine whether it had the authority to intervene in traditional ritualistic practices at places of worship. “So, it is illogical to ask the government to announce its stand at this juncture,” he said, according to PTI.The minister added that the SC had indicated it would consider review pleas only after addressing seven fundamental questions, giving the government time to consult constitutional experts and scholars before taking a decision.The issue has resurfaced as a political flashpoint in poll-bound Kerala, with the Congress and BJP demanding clarity from the CPI(M)-led government, which had earlier backed the implementation of the 2018 verdict allowing women of all ages to enter the shrine – a move that had sparked widespread protests across the state.CPI(M) general secretary M A Baby also avoided a categorical reply. He said that if the government wished to clarify its stand, it would hold discussions and take an appropriate decision. Referring to the earlier unrest, he said any decision must be taken after due deliberations and that no steps should lead to avoidable social tensions.The controversy regained momentum after the Supreme Court on Monday reopened the matter, announcing that a nine-judge bench would begin final hearings on petitions relating to discrimination against women in religions and places of worship, including Sabarimala.Under pressure from Hindu caste organisations and opposition parties, the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government has maintained that the issue involves constitutional complexities and that it would adopt an appropriate stand after discussions.

Why Congress finally drew the line

Spin doctor without a party

NEW DELHI: When veteran leader Mani Shankar Aiyar declared that he was a ""Gandhian, Nehruvian, Rajivian but not a Rahulian,"" it sounded, at first glance, like another bout of his familiar provocation. But the remark, delivered amid the Congress 's attempt to present discipline and unity ahead of key assembly elections, quickly raises larger debate about the ideology, authority and dissent inside the grand old party.The Congress moved swiftly to distance itself from Aiyar's remarks and said the leader had no association with the party. But was Aiyar merely indulging his taste for rhetorical rebellion, or was he pointing to something real about how Congress has changed in ""under"" Rahul Gandhi Political analyst and Congress chronicler Rasheed Kidwai believes Aiyar's claim contains ""a grain of truth,"" but not in the way the former minister imagines.""What Mani Shankar Aiyar is saying has a grain of truth because Congress has moved from a Nehruvian way of looking at things or so to say the Nehruvian ideology to a civil society,"" Kidwai explains.According to him, this shift has not happened overnight. The Congress, he argues, has travelled through three distinct ideological phases.""What used to be the Nehruvian thinking ... the Congress moved from Nehruvian to economic reforms and from economic reforms, which was there during Narsimha Rao and Manmohan Singh Rao, now it has moved to more of a civil society thinking,"" he says.This transition, Kidwai argues, helps explain why Aiyar's attack on ""Rahulian"" politics resonates in some quarters. The Congress ""under"" Rahul Gandhi does not function within a rigid ideological framework in the classical sense.""So what you see around Rahul Gandhi is people who come from civil society and they are influencing him. So civil society does not have a dogmatic kind of ideology,"" Kidwai says.This absence of dogma, he suggests, has consequences for how the party responds politically. Unlike the Nehruvian era, where ideology shaped policy, or the reform years, where economic pragmatism dominated, today's Congress often appears reactive and issue-driven rather than programmatic.Kidwai has written earlier about what he describes as a growing ""civil society"" imprint within the Congress, particularly around Rahul Gandhi. This school of thought, he argues, privileges moral argument, decentralised activism and individual agency over state-led or party-led political action.This orientation, which gained visibility during the Sonia Gandhi-led UPA years through bodies like the National Advisory Council, has now ""almost taken over the party organisation under Rahul Gandhi,"" Kidwai has written.Civil society protagonists, often associated with the so-called ""Jai Jagat"" group, are said to enjoy proximity to Rahul Gandhi and occupy influential organisational roles. Their emphasis on plain living, minimalism and symbolic politics has become part of the Congress's contemporary aesthetic.Yet, as Kidwai notes in his earlier writing, this culture sits uneasily with traditional Congress leaders who rose through the ranks and understand politics as negotiation, organisation and power management rather than moral signalling.While Aiyar positions himself as a custodian of Congress ideology, Kidwai is blunt about his standing within the party.""Mani Shankar Aiyar thinks he represents the Congress ideology, whether it is panchayati or foreign policy or socialism with a leaning towards the poor ... that is not fine. So there are no takers for Mr. Aiyar,"" Kidwai says.""Mr. Aiyar is totally isolated. There is no group, there is no leader in Tamil Nadu or outside who would be subscribing to Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar,"" he adds.Kidwai contrasts Aiyar's isolation with other Congress leaders who have disagreed with Rahul Gandhi but retain organisational traction.""Shashi Tharoor and many others still have some traction in the Congress ... Manish Tiwari and many others. But there is nobody who would support Mani Shankar Aiyar,"" he says.Aiyar's paradox, Kidwai argues, lies in his political identity. ""Mani Shankar Aiyar's claim to fame was his loyalty towards Rajiv Gandhi,"" he says.""Now there is a bit of a paradox that he is confronting Rajiv Gandhi's son,"" Kidwai adds.That contradiction goes to the heart of Aiyar's frustration.Aiyar once again claimed that the Congress of the past tolerated rebels while today's leadership punishes them. But is it true?""In most political parties, when adversity strikes them, they split,"" he says, recalling the Congress splits after 1967, 1969, 1977 and the fragmentation of the party during and after the Narasimha Rao years.What makes the post-2014 period unusual, Kidwai argues, is not intolerance but endurance.""What happened in 2014 to 2024, and now it's 2026, is very unique, because there's been a long spell of adversity, but no split. 150 leaders have left, but there's been no split in the Congress,"" he says.The result is a party carrying multiple generations of leadership baggage.""Rahul Gandhi does not have a clean slate. He has three, four uncles watching over him,"" Kidwai says. ""Mani Shankar Aiyar is one uncle who says - you are not doing things right.""Aiyar's anger is deeply personal.""He felt that during Rajiv Gandhi's time, he was at 'arsh', which means the cloud line. And he's come to 'farsh' (ground),"" he says.Aiyar, he adds, has not reconciled himself to his diminished access to the Gandhi family. ""He's very hurt and angry about this whole thing,"" Kidwai says.Aiyar has repetedly left the Congress red faced with his remarks like ""chaiwala"" and ""neech aadmi"". The recent outburst had nothing new. So did Congress act now after all these years, clearly stating he has no association with the party?Kidwai attributes this to shifting internal equations.""There was a perception that Mr. Sam Pitroda and Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar are close to the family,"" he says. That perceived proximity once acted as insulation.But that cover, Kidwai argues, has vanished. ""Now people know that he does not have a backing of the family. So Mr. Aiyar had a false kind of cover ... now that stands exposed,"" he says.By contrast, Kidwai notes, Pitroda remains protected. ""Mr. Sam Pitroda is still in good books of Rahul Gandhi, so nobody says a thing about him,"" he says, even though both men, in Kidwai's says, are ""motor mouths"" whose remarks have often ""hurt the political interests of the Congress.""Kidwai traces Aiyar's instinct for provocation to his past.""Before social media and the internet boom, Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar was an original spin doctor,"" he says, recalling Aiyar's diplomatic career and his role as a key Rajiv Gandhi aide.That instinct, Kidwai argues, remains intact, but now operates without institutional relevance.""He's trying to seek attention of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul and Priyanka ... and he's not getting it,"" Kidwai says.Aiyar's use of the term ""Rahulian,"" Kidwai believes, is part of this attention-seeking strategy rather than a serious ideological intervention.""He has that ability to give a spin, and that is what he's doing,"" Kidwai says.But is there any truth in Aiyar's warning?While dismissive of Aiyar's influence, Kidwai does not entirely reject his diagnosis.""There is a discomfort, which is not evident,"" he says, referring to unease within the Congress over Rahul Gandhi's reliance on civil society inputs rather than organisational consensus.He points to campaign slogans and movements like ""chowkidar chor hai"" and ""vote chori"" as examples of strategies that did not emerge from internal party deliberation.""None of these things have come from the Congress organisation,"" Kidwai says.Yet, unlike Shashi Tharoor, who secured 11–12 percent of votes in the 2023 Congress presidential election, Aiyar commands no following.""Mani Shankar Aiyar will get zero,"" Kidwai says bluntly.For now, Aiyar has coined new term ""Rahulian"" which the Congress's opponents may try to stick to public memory. Its originator, however, may fade further into irrelevance.Aiyar may have named something real, an ideological shift from structured doctrine to civil society politics. But in doing so, Kidwai argues, he has personalised a transformation that is larger than Rahul Gandhi and older than Aiyar's own grievances.In the end, Aiyar's rebellion may say less about the Congress's future than about one veteran's inability to accept that the party he once shaped has moved on without him.","Mani shankar aiyar said he was a ""gandhian, nehruvian, rajivian but not a rahulian"" rasheed kidwai says the former minister's claim contains ""a grain of truth"" the congress ""under"" rahul gandhi does not function within a rigid ideological framework. Civil society protagonists, often associated with the ""jai jagat"" group, occupy influential organisational roles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128460107,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1399678,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

'World In Twilight Zone': Jaishankar Warns Of Changing Global Order, Outlines India’s Strategic Push

Bharat

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday expressed concern over the changing global order that he said appeared to be ""headed for a long twilight zone,"" which the minister predicted would be ""messy, risky, unpredictable, and even dangerous"".Speaking during the FECC Three-Day Global Economic Cooperation (GEC) Summit, Jaishankar said that replacements are hard to create, however, acknowledged that present aspects of world order ""will coexist with elements of the emerging one"".""The established global order is clearly changing before our very eyes. Replacements are hard to create, and we appear to be headed for a long twilight zone. This will be messy, risky, unpredictable, perhaps even dangerous. We have already seen this across different geographies. Aspects of the present order will coexist with elements of the emerging one,"" the minister said.Jaishankar said that economics will give way to politics and security ""when it comes to making choices and technology in the age of AI will be even more transformative than ever before.""The minister also highlighted how the world today has been witnessing ""weaponisation of production, finance, leveraging of market shares and tightening of export controls"".In the backdrop of the India-US trade pact and ""mother of all deals"" with the European Union, the minister saidis engaging with international partners ""more intensively from a position of strength"".""From a position of strength, India is engaging international partners more intensively. This is demonstrated in the recently concluded trade deals,"" he said.Following a phone conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump, both sides recently announced a reduction of US tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent from 50 per cent.Last month, India and the European Union (EU) concluded negotiations for the proposed free trade agreement (FTA), which will help boost two-way commerce and strengthen economic ties between the two sides, Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal earlier said.","External affairs minister s jaishankar expressed concern over the changing global order.
