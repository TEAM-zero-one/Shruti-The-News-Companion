No casualties have been reported.”Military sources confirmed similar incidents had occurred a day earlier, with Pakistani forces initiating small arms fire at several points along the LoC. “The firing was effectively responded to,” a source said.The ceasefire violations come amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan following Tuesday’s terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people. The Indian Army has since stepped up counter-terror operations and reviewed preparedness, with Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi visiting Srinagar to assess the situation with senior commanders.India has announced a series of strong diplomatic and strategic measures in response to the attack, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty , closure of the Attari land-border crossing, and expulsion of Pakistani military attachés. All Pakistanis who entered via Attari have been asked to leave India by May 1.In retaliation, Pakistan shut its airspace to Indian airlines and suspended trade with India, including through third countries. It also rejected India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, warning that any attempt to stop water flows will be treated as an “act of war”.Amid national outrage, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday vowed to bring the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack to justice.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

The United States on Friday urged India to hunt down the Islamist terrorists who murdered 26 Hindus in Pahalgam amid continued American support for New Delhi despite Islamabad raising alarm about an all-out war if India acted to eliminate terrorists in Pakistan.""We are with you and support you as you hunt down those responsible for this heinous attack,"" US Intelligence czar Tulsi Gabbard said in a statement that minced no words, calling it an ""Islamist terrorist attack, targeting and killing 26 Hindus.""Gabbard, who is a Hindu-American, was following up President Trump phone call to Prime Minister Modi in which he pledged ""full support"" to India to bring the perpetrators to justice.Trump has previously said, in the aftermath of the Pulwama terrorist attack, that India has the right to self-defense against terrorist attacks. The latest statements seemed to suggest Washington would have no issue if New Delhi took action against Pakistan, inside Pakistan, particularly after a Pakistan minister openly acknowledged institutional backing for terrorism, while blaming the west for becoming a rentier state.“We’ve been doing this dirty work for the United States and the West — including Britain — for about three decades,” Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif acknowledged in a widely circulated interview on Sky News, followed by a meltdown in Pakistani media about a government official implicating his own country in terrorism.While Khwaja was referring to US bankrolling the so-called mujaheddin during the war in Afghanistan to drive out the Soviets, Washington turning a blind eye to Pakistan pivoting its jihadis towards India is now being recognized in the current dispensation that has little tolerance for Islamist terrorism .""No country should be forced to endure such heinous acts of terrorism year after year. We all bear responsibility for this — especially the U.S. — for failing to hold Pakistan accountable for embracing terrorism as a tool of its foreign policy for decades,"" said Jeff Smith, Director of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation.Urging the Trump administration to break new boundaries strengthening counterterrorism cooperation with India, Smith said if the Pahalgam attack , like so many of its predecessors, is traced back to Pakistan, ""there must be accountability.""Leading a vast intelligence apparatus with the tools and capacity to home in on evidence, Gabbard appeared to go even further, encouraging a hunt for the perpetrators beyond India's borders.US support in the Trump dispensation following the latest attack is markedly different from the cautious restraining hand that Democratic administrations exercised. The approach still influences the mostly liberal US media, one of whose sentinels, the New York Times, headlined its story ""At least 24 tourists gunned down by militants in Kashmir.""The Republican-controlled House Foreign Affairs Committee, posted the headline with the word ""militants"" struck down and replaced by ""terrorists"" and a snarky message: ""Hey, @nytimes we fixed it for you. This was a TERRORIST ATTACK plain and simple.""""Whether it’s India or Israel, when it comes to TERRORISM the NYT is removed from reality,"" it added.","The attack in pahalgam left 26 dead and several injured.

NEW DELHI: Following a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah, Union jal shakti minister CR Paatil on Friday said that the central government has developed a comprehensive strategy to halt Indian river water from flowing into Pakistan.This comes after the Indian government suspended the Indus Waters Treaty in reaction to a deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam that claimed the lives of 26 people.Paatil said that urgent actions are being given priority, with river desilting being one of the primary measures. ""A roadmap was prepared in the meeting with Amit Shah. Three options were discussed in the meeting. The government is working on short-term, medium-term, and long-term measures so that not even a drop of water goes to Pakistan.

We will ensure that not a single drop of the Indus River's water reaches Pakistan,"" he further said in a tweet on X.Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah also expressed his firm opposition to the Indus Waters Treaty, declaring that the 1960 agreement between India and Pakistan represents the 'most unfair document' for the Union Territory's residents.In his press statement, Omar Abdullah said, ""The government of India has taken some steps. As far as J&K is concerned, we have never been in favour of the Indus Waters Treaty. We have always believed that the Indus Waters Treaty has been the most unfair document to the people of J&K.""""It is regrettable that this attack took place, and we ensured that any issues that were brought to our attention in the meeting, we will work on them. During this meeting, I spoke with the Union home minister and he assured me that all steps will be taken to ensure the safety of the people of J&K who are staying in other states. An advisory will be issued by the Home Ministry and the Union Minister also spoke with the Chief Ministers of many states,"" he further stated.During the cabinet committee security meeting led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India resolved to suspend the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty until Pakistan definitively renounces support for cross-border terrorism and has shut down the integrated Attari Check Post.Pakistan rejected India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, describing it as the lifeline for 240 million Pakistanis and warned that any attempt to divert water under the Indus Water Treaty would be considered an act of war.Pakistan announced multiple retaliatory measures, including blocking airspace for Indian airlines, closing the Wagah border crossing, suspending trade relations. These decisions came after a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.""Any threat to Pakistan's sovereignty and to the security of its people will be met with firm reciprocal measures in all domains. India should refrain from its reflexive blame game and cynical staged, managed exploitation of incidents like Pahalgam to further its narrow political agenda. Such tactics serve only to inflame tensions and obstruct the path to peace and stability in the region,"" stated the NSC meeting release.Pakistan also suspended visas under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme for Indians, making an exception only for Sikh pilgrims.

Centre holds all-party meeting

Amit Shah asks states to ensure Pakistanis leave

NEW DELHI: The Centre has taken several key decisions over the last three days following the brutal April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam that claimed 26 lives.As news of the attack broke, Prime Minister Narendra Modi immediately cut short his Saudi Arabia visit and rushed back to India to assess the situation and formulate proper retaliation and response against the perpetrators and planners of the attack.In its first move, India severed its diplomatic ties with Pakistan, accusing Islamabad of having a hand in the attack. The Ministry of external affairs said the attack came ""in the wake of the successful holding of elections in the Union Territory and its steady progress towards economic growth and development"".Following a high-level Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting chaired by PM Modi, foreign secretary Vikram Misri outlined the steps during a special press conference.India held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance with immediate effect until Pakistan ceases support for terrorism.Brokered by the World Bank in 1960, the treaty has dictated the distribution and use of the Indus river and its tributaries between India and Pakistan. The treaty benefited Pakistan as it received about 80% of the total water flow from these rivers, which are vital for agriculture in Pakistan, especially in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh.Union Minister of Jal Shakti, CR Paatil recently said: ""A roadmap was prepared in the meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Three options were discussed in the meeting. The government is working on short-term, medium-term, and long-term measures so that not even a drop of water goes to Pakistan. Soon, desilting of rivers will be done to stop the water and divert it.""Pakistan said any attempt to divert water meant for it under the Indus Waters Treaty will be an ""act of war.""The government also formally handed persona non grata to Pakistan's top diplomats in India. India also expelled Pakistan's three military attaches and directed Islamabad to downsize the staff strength at its high commission in New Delhi from 55 to 30.India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.The government suspended all kinds of visas for Pakistani nationals and asked them to leave the country by April 27. However, the medical visas will be valid for an additional two days and will stand revoked on April 29.""In continuation of the decisions made by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack , the Government of India has decided to suspend visa services to Pakistani nationals with immediate effect,"" the ministry of external affairs said.The ministry advised the Indians in Pakistan to return at the earliest.India also stopped the only operational land border crossing between the two countries. Integrated Check Post at Attari in Punjab were shut and those who crossed over with valid endorsements were directed to return through that route before May 1.Indian Navy's guided missile destroyer INS Surat on Thursday completed a successful test of a medium-range surface-to-air missile with an approximate range of 70 km.Meanwhile, Indian Air Force (IAF) executed 'Exercise Aakraman', a comprehensive operational drill across the central sector, featuring its premier fighter aircraft, including the Rafale jets.Defence ministry has given the Army permission to fly the 'Dhruv' advanced light helicopters (ALHs) in Srinagar and adjoining areas to help the intensive counter-terror operations launched after the Pahalgam terror massacre. All the 330 twin-engine ALHs in the armed forces were grounded for safety checks since a crash killed two Coast Guard pilots and an aircrew diver in Porbandar on Jan 5.This majorly hit military operations and preparedness, especially along the borders with China and Pakistan. ""Permission has been given to the Army to fly its ALHs in Srinagar and adjoining areas as per the requirements of the ground force commanders,"" an official said on Wednesday.Border security force also ""scaled down"" the Beating Retreat ceremony at the Attari border. The Indian parade commander also did not move forward to shake hands with his Pakistani counterpart during the ceremony.Many visitors came to watch the retreat ceremony at the Joint Check Post (JCP) Attari border.The India-Pakistan border at Suchetgarh in Jammu has been closed to civilian movement by the Border Security Force (BSF) following the deadly terror attack in Pahalgam.The BSF has halted civilian access at the Octroi Post in Suchetgarh, which is a popular spot for visitors to see the zero point of the border. This closure is part of heightened security measures amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan after the attack, which was carried out by a Pakistan-based terrorist group. The decision also follows similar closures at other border points, including the Attari Integrated Check Post in Amritsar.An all-party meeting was held on April 24 to discuss the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians and injured several others.Chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh, the meeting included leaders from 15 political parties and key Union ministers such as Amit Shah, Nirmala Sitharaman, and S. Jaishankar. The leaders unanimously condemned the attack and expressed full solidarity with the government’s zero-tolerance policy toward terrorism.The government briefed the participants on the attack, security lapses, and the retaliatory measures taken, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty and the expulsion of Pakistani nationals from India.Opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, extended their full support to the government’s actions but also raised concerns about security lapses and called for accountability.A day after the Centre suspended visas for all Pakisanti nationals in India, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday reached out to all chief ministers, directing them to identify Pakistani nationals residing in their states and initiate steps to ensure their exit from the country by April 27-29.The Centre had a day earlier suspended all visa services for Pakistani nationals, except for medical visas, which will remain valid till April 29. ""In continuation of the decisions made by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack, the Government of India has decided to suspend visa services to Pakistani nationals with immediate effect,"" the ministry of external affairs said.The ministry further advised all Indian nationals in Pakistan to return at the earliest and warned Pakistani citizens in India to leave before the expiry of their amended visas.",The centre has taken several key decisions over the last three days following the brutal april 22 terror attack in jammu and kashmir's pahalgam that claimed 26 lives.

Intelligence sources suggest he served as a guide and logistics coordinator for Pakistani terrorists involved in the recent attack.The Anantnag Police has announced a reward of Rs 20 lakh for information leading to the arrest of three Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists: Adil Hussain Thokar, Ali Bhai, and Hashim Musa. All three are suspected of orchestrating the devastating attack in Baisaran, Pahalgam, on April 22.Earlier, the security agencies on Wednesday revealed that the three terrorists suspected to have carried out the deadly Pahalgam attack used specific code names, Moosa, Yunus, and Asif, to mask their identities during the operation that killed 26 people, mostly tourists.In what marks the most devastating terrorist incident since the revocation of Article 370 in 2019, 26 tourists lost their lives and several others were wounded on April 22. The attack unfolded at Baisaran Meadow, a popular tourist destination situated 7 kilometers from Pahalgam resort town.Eyewitness accounts indicate that six foreign terrorists, disguised in Army uniforms, targeted victims based on their religious identity. The assailants reportedly forced individuals to reveal their names and recite Islamic verses before executing them at close range.The assault occurred at around 1.30pm while tourists were enjoying the scenic meadow, known for its snow-capped mountains and pine forests. Despite robust security measures, including multiple checkpoints and armed patrols in the area, the terrorists managed to breach the security cordon and carry out the attack in this otherwise peaceful tourist destination.","Houses of two lashkar-e-taiba terrorists adil thokar and asif shaikh destroyed in a blast.

India has suspended the Indus Waters Treaty: What does it mean,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-has-suspended-the-indus-waters-treaty-what-does-it-mean/articleshow/120621117.cms,"India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty after deadly Pahalgam attack on Tuesday. (IANS pic)

What the suspension entails?



Stopping data sharing: India will cease sharing hydrological data such as water flow, snowmelt, and river discharge information with Pakistan, which Pakistan relies on to manage its water resources.

No operational restrictions: India is no longer bound by the treaty's restrictions on how it uses water from the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab), potentially allowing it to build new storage or hydropower projects and manage water flow more freely.

Suspension, not termination: The treaty does not have a provision for unilateral suspension or termination, so India is holding it ""in abeyance"" rather than formally quitting. This is a diplomatic move signaling pressure on Pakistan to stop supporting cross-border terrorism.

No immediate impact on water flow: Despite the suspension, India currently lacks the infrastructure to significantly reduce or stop water flow to Pakistan, so any major impact on Pakistan's water supply would take years to materialize.

Significance and potential impact:



The IWT has been a rare example of cooperation between India and Pakistan, surviving wars and conflicts over six decades. Its suspension marks a serious deterioration in bilateral relations.

Pakistan depends heavily on the western rivers for about 80% of its agricultural water and a significant portion of its hydropower. Disruption could severely affect Pakistan's agriculture and economy.

Pakistan has warned that any attempt to block or divert water would be considered an act of war, raising the stakes of this dispute.

India's suspension is part of a broader diplomatic and economic crackdown on Pakistan following the Pahalgam attack, including visa cancellations and border closures.

NEW DELHI: India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) means that India has put on hold its obligations under the 1960 water-sharing agreement with Pakistan, which governs the use of water from six rivers in the Indus basin.This is the first time that India has suspended the treaty since its signing, and it comes as a response to a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 people including a tourist from Nepal.The Indus river system consists of the main Indus River and its six major tributaries, with five on the left bank and one on the right bank. This extensive network plays a vital role in water supply for both India and Pakistan. The left bank tributaries include the Ravi, Beas, Sutlej, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers. The Kabul River, the sole right bank tributary, does not flow through Indian territory. The river system is categorized into two groups. While Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej are designated as eastern rivers, Chenab, Jhelum, and main Indus form the western rivers.India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty means it is pausing its treaty obligations in response to Pakistan's alleged support for terrorism. This allows India to stop sharing water data and potentially use the Indus basin waters more freely, though immediate water flow to Pakistan is unlikely to be affected.The move signals a major escalation in India-Pakistan tensions and threatens the longstanding water-sharing arrangement critical to Pakistan's agriculture and economy.","India suspended the indus waters treaty after deadly pahalgam attack on tuesday.

Pahalgam Terror Attack: Why Western media loves to call terrorists 'gunmen',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-terror-attack-why-western-media-loves-to-call-terrorists-gunmen/articleshow/120617514.cms,"Manufacturing Consent

Poll Do you believe that Western media has a bias in its reporting on terrorist attacks based on the religion of the victims? No, media coverage is consistent. Yes, there is a clear bias.

gunman

militant

rebel

A famous anecdote about Mahatma Gandhi claims he was once asked by a reporter what he thought of Western civilisation. He ostensibly replied: “It sounds like a good idea,” a tongue-in-cheek remark critiquing the moral decay that surrounds any society built on the edifice of slavery and the opium trade. The same could be said about the Western media ’s propensity for “neutral coverage” when reporting events outside Europe and the Anglosphere. Hanlon’s Razor states: “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.” Ignorance or stupidity is the most benign explanation for the Western media’s habit of finding whitewashed euphemisms for terrorists, as evidenced by their recent coverage of the Pahalgam terror attack , where terrorists brutally killed 26 people.Alternatively, perhaps they are haunted by the patron saint of typos, Titivillus — the demon from medieval Christian folklore who would whisper distractions into the ears of monks copying manuscripts — preventing modern journalists from using the word “terrorist” and instead pushing them to reach for vague, anaemic euphemisms like gunmen, militants, or rebels to describe radical fanatics who checked people’s religion before executing them.Levity aside, Noam Chomsky , the Devil’s Accountant , argued inthat language is a powerful tool of propaganda: a mechanism of power, control, and ideology designed to manipulate meaning, shape perceptions, and quietly tilt the moral compass without anyone noticing. He wrote: “The way the world is structured, the way it's talked about, the way it's perceived — all of that is shaped in a very large measure by the structure of language and by the use of language.""Perhaps that explains why, when 26 people were executed in cold blood — not caught in crossfire, not victims of a riot, but deliberately and methodically hunted down — in the hills of Pahalgam, it took mere hours for the world’s most “respected” news organisations to do what they do best: sanitise the truth, neutralise the outrage, and euphemise the crime into something palatable enough. It’s almost a redux of Arundhati Roy’s infamous Gandhians with guns remark to describe Maoists.It is a predictable pattern, and that predictability is not a flaw but a feature.When Hindus are killed, the story must always be reframed — not as religious persecution or ideological terror, but as part of some nebulous, ongoing “tension,” a word so vague it could mean anything, and therefore means nothing.The victims are quietly transformed into faceless statistics, stripped of religion, identity, and dignity; the perpetrators are softly described as “unknown assailants” or “radicals with grievances,” and terrorism itself is neutered into a regrettable but unavoidable “incident.”This is not a matter of laziness, nor is it an excess of journalistic caution; it is bias — deliberate and sustained — the kind that recasts murderers into misunderstood actors in a conflict too complex for moral clarity, and victims into inconvenient footnotes.In the global newsroom’s carefully maintained hierarchy of grief, Hindu lives occupy a peculiar space: simultaneously too privileged to be mourned and too politically awkward to be acknowledged.As a result, even when Hindus are targeted — not randomly, but systematically and ideologically — the coverage edges delicately around the truth, lest the narrative fracture under the weight of inconvenient facts.One only needs to contrast this with the media coverage after September 11. The towers had not even stopped burning before every major outlet called the event what it was: a terrorist attack, an assault on civilisation itself. There was no hesitation, no forensic caution, no whispered euphemisms. It was not described as an “incident.”It was not softened into a “militant strike.” It was not obfuscated as a “gunman-led explosion.” The perpetrators were named: Islamic terrorists, jihadists, al-Qaeda operatives. The victims were named: Americans. The moral lines were drawn in thick, black ink, and nobody seemed concerned about nuance or complexity.In fact, even when a country was decimated based on fabricated intelligence — when Iraq was bombed into the Stone Age without a single WMD in sight — the media couldn’t find its spine.Yet when Hindus are lined up, interrogated about their religion, and shot for not being Muslim, the global media suddenly discovers the need for verification, for context, for delicate vocabulary. Because to call it terrorism would be to assign ideology; and to assign ideology would be to shatter the comforting mythologies that surround Islamist violence when its victims do not fit the West’s preferred archetypes.Thus, the editorial policy becomes one of quiet erasure. The language is flattened; the ideology blurred; the blood, metaphorically speaking, scrubbed from the frame until the memory of the victims fades into a haze of “tensions” and “militants” and “gunmen” whose motivations must, somehow, remain forever mysterious.It is important to understand exactly what these euphemisms achieve.suggests randomness.implies a political grievance.hints at a noble cause.Every word strips away the ideological core of the act, recasting a deliberate, religiously motivated massacre into something almost accidental, almost forgivable, almost understandable.By refusing to call it terrorism, the media does not merely absolve the killers; it prevents any serious reckoning with the broader forces — cross-border jihad, radicalisation, Pakistan’s proxy wars — that enabled such brutality in the first place.Perhaps most insidiously, this linguistic laundering dehumanises the victims.If 26 Jews had been murdered in Paris, or 26 Christians had been slaughtered on Easter Sunday in Sri Lanka, or 26 LGBTQ club-goers had been gunned down in Orlando, there would have been no hesitation in calling it terrorism; the candles would have been lit, the headlines would have screamed, and the op-eds would have poured in, demanding justice, vengeance, and global soul-searching. The same West that bans Russian athletes from every tournament for invading Ukraine somehow finds it outrageous that Pakistani cricketers don’t get to play in the IPL — as though cross-border terrorism deserves a sporting exemption.But then again, for those of us who have followed the Western media for a long time, it’s evident that legacy media seldom departs from the party line. There are several petards that can be hoisted to expose the Western media’s explicit complicity in silencing voices that are different. Like the time they labelled everyone who suggested Covid was a lab leak a ‘racist’ . Or when they all followed a Chinese Omertà on Joe Biden’s diminishing mental acuity. Or how they eschewed any pretence of sticking to Merton’s principles when discussing gender ideology or trans people in women’s sports. It’s as if they have a set of guidelines they must follow, irrespective of what happens, or where.But when Hindus are massacred, they are quietly demoted to statistics; they are flattened into “tensions,” buried under euphemisms, and met with the kind of silence that speaks louder than any headline.It is not that the Western media does not know better; it is that they choose not to do better — because doing better would require confronting the uncomfortable truth that victims do not always conform to the neat narratives carved out for them, and that not all ideologies are equally safe, or politically convenient, to expose.And so the cycle continues, with gunmen and militants and rebels and incidents and tensions — but never terror, never jihad, and certainly never Hindus.Society is built on the mendacious edifice that all lives matter; the Western media’s coverage is a reminder that only some do — based on their religion, nationality, and ideology. From the Renaissance to the Enlightenment, the West once taught the world to value truth, reason, and human dignity. Today, in the quiet erasure of inconvenient victims, it betrays the very civilisation it once proudly built.","When hindus are killed, the story must always be reframed as religious persecution or ideological terror. The victims are quietly transformed into faceless statistics, stripped of religion, identity, and dignity. The perpetrators are softly described as ‘unknown assailants’ or ‘radicals with grievances’ when hindus are massacred, they are quietly demoted to statistics.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120618740,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-38288,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday rattled Pakistan amid strong signals of a buildup to a Pulwama-type retaliation, or even a stronger response, to avenge the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 innocent people.The stage was set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who echoed the anger of the nation when he declared that ""India will identify, track, and punish every terrorist and their backers"" and will ""pursue them to the ends of the Earth"" to punish them ""beyond their imagination.""The Prime Minister's strong message was followed by a slew of countermeasures to convey a clear message to Pakistan for its support of cross-border terrorism.These moves followed five key decisions that were announced a day earlier on Wednesday and included:In 2019, India had struck terrorist camp in Balakot with airstrikes deep inside Pakistan. This after at least 40 paramilitary personnel were killed in Pulwama. Earlier in 2016, India had carried out ""surgical strikes"" targeting terror launch pads after the Uri attack in which 19 Indian soldiers were killed.The brutality of the attack in Pahalgam left the country in shock and anger. Kashmir valley witnessed an unprecedented display of public sentiment with a widespread spontaneous protests against the killings.India's strong buildup to a possible retaliatory action left Pakistan rattled and it announced several face-saving measures.Islamabad has also said any attempt to divert the water meant for it under the Indus Waters Treaty will be considered an Act of War. But India is determined to punish the Pahalgam attackers and those backing them. The government has the backing of all opposition parties in its fight against terrorism and India's response is likely to be ""loud and clear"" as Union defence minister Rajnath Singh had said yesterday.","Visa services to pakistani nationals stopped with immediate effect.

He was cremated around noon.Sudeep, his family said, was shot immediately after he identified himself as a Hindu and had no time to explain that he was not from India. Butwal, a city in Lumbini province, sits just 25km north of the Indian border at Sunauli, close enough for shared economies and quiet daily crossings. It is not the kind of place where news arrives quickly, and yet by the time the ambulance reached Sudeep's home, the neighbours had already gathered.Sudeep had travelled to Kashmir with his mother Reema, sister Sushma, and brother-in-law Ujjwal Kafle on April 19. It was meant to be a brief trip, just long enough to give his divorced mother some respite. On the day of the shooting, the family was walking along the meadow when the terrorists approached. Witnesses said the attackers asked about their religion. Sudeep was walking slightly ahead of the others. He answered that he was Hindu. Before he could say anything else, he was shot.""He didn't get the chance to say he was a foreigner,"" said Tejulal Neupane, his uncle, who has since called for compensation from the Indian govt. ""He had nothing to do with anything.""His death triggered a series of logistical efforts across two countries.

'Razings a stern reminder of price to pay for terror'



In a stern message to local terrorists and their families, J&K administration on Friday demolished the houses of three terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack .The houses of Adil Hussain Thoker alias Adil Guree in Bijbehara of Anantnag; Asif Sheikh in Awantipora; and Ahsan Sheikh in Pulwama were quietly razed on Thursday and Friday night.The administration ensured that none of their family members was inside when the houses were destroyed. In fact, a source indicated they were aware of the impending demolition as they had vacated the houses beforehand with their important belongings.The detonation was controlled to ensure adjacent dwellings were not damaged; the precision meant to convey the message that the authorities had no malice towards the general public. There may be more demolitions, according to the source. ""The action is clearly aimed at disincentivising local terrorism or any kind of support to terror,"" a J&K govt functionary told TOI.It is a stern reminder to local youths that if they pick up the gun and join terror ranks, their families will have a heavy price to pay. Their families will also be denied govt benefits and facilities including passports, govt jobs, police clearances. This is all part of the Centre's and J&K administration's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism,"" the J&K govt functionary said.Adil, who legally travelled to Pakistan via Attari-Wagah border crossing in 2018, completed his terror training there and infiltrated back into Kashmir sometime last year, is said to have played guide to and arranged logistics for the attack team that comprised two hardcore Pakistani terrorists Hashim Musa and Ali Talha and a local terrorist from Awantipora, Asif Sheikh. Adil is said to have helped with reconnaissance of the attack site.Asif, one of the leading terrorists active in Tral, Pulwama and Kulgam, is said to have been roped in by the Pakistani terrorists since he was familiar with the terrain, hideouts and escape routes around Baisaran. Ahsan Sheikh, a LeT terrorist active in Pulwama, is said to have arranged logistics for Pahalgam attack.This is not the first time the home of a terrorist has been demolished by the J&K admin. A few months ago, the house of local terrorist Haroon Ganai from Anantnag, who was recruited by Pakistan's ISI, was demolished in a similar manner. An intelligence official said his family is believed to have contacted him after the demolition, cursing him for destroying their lives.","Houses of 3 pahalgam terrorists demolished on thursday and friday night.
