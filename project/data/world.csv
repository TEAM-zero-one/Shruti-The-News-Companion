The second family of the US will participate in engagements at cultural sites, and apart from New Delhi, visits to Jaipur and Agra are also on the cards.The visit will provide an opportunity for both sides to review the progress in bilateral relations and the implementation of the outcomes of the India-US joint statement issued on 13 February, the MEA release read.This trip marks Vance's second international visit as Vice President, following his earlier travels to France and Germany.

PM Modi arrived in Washington, DC, on February 12 and was hosted at Blair House, the official guest residence of the US President, situated opposite the White House.The visit focused on strengthening bilateral ties in trade, defence, energy, and technology. Key outcomes included India’s agreement to reduce tariffs on over half of $23 billion worth of US imports — a major step toward the goal of doubling bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.Modi and Trump also discussed a new defence partnership and regional security cooperation, with the US approving the extradition of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana.The PM also met with Elon Musk to explore collaboration in space and technology, including the potential entry of Starlink into India.","Us vice president jd vance will be visiting italy and india from april 18 and april 24.

"As US-China ties crash and burn, eyes turn towards India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-us-china-ties-crash-and-burn-eyes-turn-towards-india-tariff-trade-war/articleshow/120316772.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

US-China ties are headed for a devastating crash with attention in America now pivoting towards New Delhi to assess if India can -- or will -- step into the breach.More signs of the US-China flame-out emerged on Tuesday after Beijing directed its airlines to stop taking delivery of Boeing aircraft. China is Boeing's biggest customer with projections by the company of delivering nearly 9,000 planes to China — about 20% of the total — over the next two decades. By contrast, India is expected to order around 2400 Boeing aircraft till 2043.Also read: China plays rare earth card as US, India dig deep The Chinese directive also included halting orders of aircraft-related equipment and parts, indicating it is ready to suffer pain and disruption to crank up domestic aircraft manufacturing by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which has been ramping up to take on Boeing and Airbus, the two global aircraft majors.Beijing's blow to Boeing in response to President Trump's tariff gambit came amid growing apprehension in the American commentariat that the MAGA supremo may have overplayed his hand in trying to paint China into a corner -- without rallying support from the rest of the world. There is dismay that on the contrary he has alienated almost the entire world, including European allies.A viral meme showing Trump saying ""I hold the cards"" and Xi responding with ""The cards are made in China"" provided an apt metaphor for the tariff fallout, with many experts saying although both countries will feel the pain from the spat that has inflamed the world, Beijing appears to have more leverage than the Trump White House anticipated, not to speak of greater resilience and endurance to ride out the punishment.US analysts are increasingly looking at India as a potential winner in the trade war expecting New Delhi to take advantage of the tariff differential. ""Is India ready to step in for China?"" the NYT asked in a front page story that said while Trump’s trade war with Beijing could be good for New Delhi, the country's dreams of becoming a new factory to the world is beset with familiar problems -- lack of skilled workers, supply chain issues, infrastructure shortcomings and red tape.But MAGA hardliners, despite being mocked for expecting low-end, assembly-line manufacturing to return to the US, bristle at the idea of depending on India for items like pharmaceuticals after extricating itself from China's dominance. The argument has caused the US President to go back and forth on taxing pharma imports, first holding back on tariffs and later indicating he will review it.In fact, the MAGA Supremo's back-and-forth on the tariff issue on some sectors, including automobiles in the latest instances, has led to allegations of crony capitalism and insider trading as the United States appears to be in far greater turmoil than China and rest of the world after igniting a global trade conflagration.A defensive President Trump pushed back on Monday, asserting that he does not change his mind but he is a ""very flexible person."" Following signs that he's carve out another tariff exception to help the US auto sector, the country's $ 42 billion toy industry, which is heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and supplies, is also clamoring for a break arguing that toys are critical for child development.Many liberal pundits are now surmising that instead of running rings around China as the White House mandarins are suggesting the US President is doing, it is Trump who is running around in circles. Amid growing concerns about the Chinese President Xi's high-profile visits to Vietnam and Malaysia, US experts are wondering if Trump has unwittingly ceded global primacy to Beijing.""What if you get into a trade war with China and you lose? What if, after infuriating the rest of the world, putting tariffs on them, too, you make China look stronger, more reliable, more farsighted, more strategic in the eyes of all these other countries that are now looking for an exit from the unreliable consequences of US hegemony?"" the liberal podcaster Ezra Klein asked amid growing self-doubt across US business circles.But Trump made light of the Chinese leader's purported inroads in East Asia, saying he does not ""blame"" China or Vietnam for engaging while seeming to hold out an olive branch to Xi. ""I like him. He likes me. I mean, you know, who knows?” Trump said as Chinese interlocutors continued to taunt the US with a flood of memes, cartoons, and videos. One meme showed Xi holding a pair of aces and Trump holding a two and a seven, about the weakest hand in cards.The distrust engendered by Trump's trade, tariff assault, and geo-political assault on the world, including on allies, is so great that the European Commission is reported to have issued burner phones and basic laptops to some US-bound staff to avoid the risk of espionage in Washington, where they are headed to for the World Bank/IMF meetings, according to the Financial Times. The caution is traditionally reserved for trips to China.","Beijing directed its airlines to stop taking delivery of boeing aircraft.

AHEMEDABAD: The road to the American dream has hit a fresh speed-breaker - visa appointments have suddenly gone off the radar for thousands of students from Ahmedabad planning to fly to the US this summer. While the Jan intake went smoothly for students securing visa appointment slots well in time, the situation over the past 20-25 days is starkly different.According to travel industry experts, since mid-March the unavailability of visa interview appointments has left aspirants as well as visa consultants in a fix.""Students had received April slots when they booked appointments in Feb or early March. Now, appointment dates for May are not available at all. They've secured admissions and I-20 forms from universities but are under tremendous stress due to the uncertainty in scheduling visa interviews,"" said Maulin Joshi, a city-based visa consultant."" The post-election period late last year saw one of the smoothest visa cycles in recent memory. Students scheduled to join universities during the Jan intake got quick appointments. That ease is missing now, and it's worrying,"" he added.Industry sources say the recent crackdown by the US embassy in India also had an impact. ""The US embassy is upgrading its systems to plug loopholes being misused through illegal methods to grab visa appointment slots...,"" said Janak Nayak, an immigration consultant.""We've been checking the portal daily, but it's blank. No slots for student visas since March 10. If this continues, many students may miss their Fall 2025 intake timelines,"" said Bhavin Thaker, another foreign education consultant.Industry players suggest that last year, while appointments were available, refusal rates were fairly high, which left students anxious. ""With the new govt taking charge in the US, there are a number of changes in US immigration policies, which has further worried students.

Legal Trouble and Assault Allegations Surface



A Role in a Landmark Lawsuit



What Lies Ahead



Sedona Prince , once heralded as one of women’s college basketball’s most compelling voices and talents, was left undrafted in the 2025 WNBA Draft—despite projections that had her going in the late first or early second round.The 6-foot-7 center from Liberty Hill, Texas, just wrapped up her seventh and final year of NCAA eligibility at TCU . She led the Horned Frogs to their first-ever Elite Eight appearance, averaging 17.2 points per game and starting every game during her two seasons with the team. In total, she started 86 of 108 games over a five-year college career that began at Oregon in 2019.Her name wasn’t called during the 38-player draft and she wasn’t among the 16 players invited to attend the live event at The Shed. The only mention came from analysts speculating whether she might be picked.Prince, 24, rose to national attention in 2021 for posting a viral video from inside the NCAA tournament bubble, showing the stark differences between the men’s and women’s training facilities. The video forced the NCAA to launch an independent review and ultimately led to reforms, including the use of “March Madness” branding for women’s basketball and financial units for tournament appearances.Prince's undrafted status comes amid mounting legal troubles and multiple allegations of abuse and assault most of which surfaced publicly in the past year.In January 2025, TCU campus police were called to Prince’s off-campus residence following a domestic altercation between her and a former romantic partner. Both women filed reports alleging they were assaulted during the incident.According to the police report, both sustained “minimal injury.” Prince reportedly had a black eye, while her ex-girlfriend was noted to have bruises on her arms and legs. No charges were filed due to a lack of sufficient evidence. The other woman reportedly signed a nondisclosure agreement.“Campus police responded to a disturbance… after a call from Sedona. She has not been charged with a crime or found guilty of any wrongdoing.” Prince’s attorney, A. Boone Almanza, said at the time.Prince herself denied the accusations through her lawyer, stating that she has never “abused anyone in her life, whether mentally, emotionally or physically.”But this wasn’t the first time her personal relationships had drawn public attention. In 2024, a TikTok user named Olivia Stabile published a multi-part video series alleging emotional and physical abuse during their time together. Stabile claimed Prince had punched her in the chest, shoved her against a wall, and pushed her off the back of a moving ATV before driving away, all during a vacation in Mexico.The series racked up millions of views and spurred intense online backlash. Prince took to social media to defend herself, saying,“I have never abused anybody in my life. That’s not who I am, that’s not what I do, that’s not what I stand for.”Two more women have since come forward with accusations stretching back to earlier in Prince’s college career. According to The Washington Post, one woman, Alyssa Jimmie , accused Prince of sexually assaulting her in 2019 after a date, claiming the athlete locked her in a car and penetrated her with her fingers without consent. Jimmie alleged that Prince said, “I didn’t take [you] out for nothing.”Another woman, identified only as Jane Doe , accused Prince of forcibly kissing her and guiding her hand into sexual contact after a date in 2022, despite repeated resistance. A lawsuit tied to that claim was eventually withdrawn.Though none of the allegations have resulted in criminal charges, the controversy has affected Prince’s reputation. Over 200,000 people signed a petition urging TCU to remove her from the women’s basketball team.Parallel to her career and personal turmoil, Prince has also been a key figure in the fight for college athlete compensation .She is a lead plaintiff in the high-profile antitrust lawsuit known as House v. NCAA, which challenges the NCAA’s long-standing rules restricting athlete earnings. The case could result in a $2.8 billion settlement, reshaping how college athletes are compensated going forward.Prince attended an April 7, 2025, hearing in Oakland, California, where a federal judge heard arguments for final approval of the settlement. Her role in the case is a natural extension of her advocacy roots, particularly following her viral 2021 video that sparked national debate over equity in collegiate athletics.Despite the accolades, exposure, and experience, Prince now faces a deeply uncertain future in professional basketball. Undrafted and under public scrutiny, her next move is unclear.There’s still a possibility that a WNBA team could invite her to a training camp or tryout, though teams may be wary of the legal and PR complications surrounding her. Overseas leagues may offer another route, one often taken by American players who don’t initially make the WNBA cut.Her attorney remains adamant that the allegations against her are rooted in social media clout-chasing rather than fact.“Rather, she has been convicted on social media by people who have attempted to use their relationship with Sedona to attract followers and to build their influencer careers and settle grudges,” Almanza said.As the legal dust settles and public memory shifts, the question for Sedona Prince is whether she can find a court willing to let her play and whether the noise off the court will ever fully quiet down.","Sedona prince, 24, was left undrafted in the 2025 wnba draft.

Harvard stands its ground

US President Donald Trump threatened to strip Harvard University of its tax-exempt status , intensifying an ongoing battle between the White House and the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university.The move came after Harvard rejected a list of policy changes demanded by the Trump administration, including shifts in hiring, admissions, and curriculum.Just a day earlier, the administration froze over $2 billion in federal funding to the university. According to a person familiar with the president’s thinking, Trump was angered by media coverage of Harvard’s defiance and decided to escalate the pressure campaign, reported NYT.Trump took to Truth Social and posted, ""Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting 'Sickness?' … Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!""While White House officials noted that the IRS will decide independently on tax-exempt matters, Trump has privately indicated he’s committed to taking on Harvard. Losing its nonprofit status could cost the university billions of dollars over time.Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary and Harvard president, responded sharply, ""Selective persecution of your political adversaries through the tax system is the stuff of dictatorship… This is unconscionable and wrong.""Federal law prevents the president from directly ordering IRS investigations. The agency declined to comment, but experts cast doubt on any serious threat to Harvard’s status.Former IRS commissioner John Koskinen said, “The chances of getting the IRS to actually revoke the 501(c)(3) status of a major university are almost nonexistent… The problem is you're causing people to spend a lot of time and money responding and defending their actions.”Still, the mere prospect of litigation could be an intimidating burden, he noted.Though Trump’s 2017 tax bill already imposed a levy on large university endowments, Harvard’s broader tax-exempt status allows it to avoid major tax liabilities and attract massive charitable donations.Harvard’s $50 billion endowment is bolstered by tax-deductible gifts, often from wealthy donors like John Paulson and Ken Griffin.Summers warned that if Harvard’s tax status were revoked—however unlikely—“It would devastate progress in medical and scientific research, opportunity for the next generation of Americans, and an important magnet for the United States in the world.”Trump officials have accused elite universities of fostering antisemitism and suppressing speech. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “Why are the American taxpayers subsidizing a university that has billions of dollars in the bank already? … And we certainly should not be funding a place where such grave antisemitism exists.”The funding freeze followed Harvard’s refusal last week to comply with administration demands for policy changes and regular progress reports. University president Alan Garber said in a statement:“No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”Harvard receives about $9 billion in federal support, with most routed through affiliated hospitals and the remainder funding research in areas like cancer, space exploration, and Alzheimer’s.While the school is financially fortified, other institutions have opted to comply with Trump’s conditions—Columbia University reportedly settled with the administration after facing similar pressure.","President donald trump threatened to strip harvard university of its tax-exempt status.

Joe Alwyn’s post-breakup conduct earns industry-wide respect

Taylor Swift has also moved on—gracefully

In the high-stakes world of celebrity breakups, Joe Alwyn is emerging not just unscathed—but even more respected. Following his quiet split from global pop icon Taylor Swift in April 2023, Alwyn has kept a dignified silence, which insiders say has only helped his career and personal reputation flourish.The 34-year-old Brutalist actor, Joe Alwyn made headlines earlier this year for his poised presence while presenting at the Oscars, but according to industry insiders, that was only a glimpse of his rising profile. “Joe was very wise during their breakup. He kept his head down and his mouth closed and focused strictly on his work,” a source revealed to Life & Style. “He didn’t give interviews about Taylor or do any social media rants, he didn’t even hit the like button on snarky posts.”That kind of maturity, especially in the era of viral drama, hasn't gone unnoticed. Insiders describe Joe Alwyn as “uber professional and respectful,” a demeanor that’s only helped him earn more credibility within Hollywood. “He’s got proven talent and he’s proven he’s a class act, that goes a long way with the decision makers,” the source added.Taylor Swift, now in a very public relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce since late 2023, appears to harbor no ill feelings. “Taylor has no bones to pick with him, she’s happily moved on, and he’s kept it classy the whole time,” the insider noted. Even her friends and industry peers have taken notice of Joe’s graceful handling of the split.Swift and Alwyn’s six-year relationship was notably low-key. “For me, I just don’t feel it’s something I want to offer up to be picked apart by people who don’t know about it,” Alwyn said in a 2018 interview with Total Film. Swift echoed the sentiment in a 2019 Guardian interview: “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we'd be talking about it—but it's just that it goes out into the world.”Also Read: “Pathetic”: Travis Kelce faces backlash from Swifties over podcast survey, accused of clout-chasing Taylor Swift Since their breakup, Joe Alwyn has remained grounded. “I have tried just to focus on controlling what I can control,” he told The Guardian in January 2025.

Barack Obama's viral speech

A video has emerged of a speech by ex-US President Barack Obama , a Harvard University alumni, from a 1991 protest in support of a law professor, amid the current stand-off between US President Donald Trump and Harvard over the institute's refusal to implement the Trump administration's new federal directives to it.Trump retaliated by freezing Harvard's federal funding of over $2.2 billion. Obama came out in support of his alma mater, where he studied law, and called out the US President over his alleged ""ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom.""According to a 2022 report , Derrick Bell , an African American and a law professor at Harvard, and a pioneer of the so-called "" critical race theory ,"" had launched a hunger strike over the institute's denial of tenure to Regina Austin, a black woman professor. This came at a time when only three of the law school's professors were black and only five others were women.""...and one of the persons who spoke at that orientation was professor Bell. And I remember him sauntering up to the prop, and not giving us a lecture, but engaging us in a conversation. And speaking the truth,"" said Obama, Harvard's then president of the Law Review and the first African-American to hold that post.'How did one man do all this? How has he accomplished all this? He hasn't done it simply by his good looks and easy charm, although he has both in ample measures,"" he added, drawing laughter from the audience, including Bell himself.Obama, aged 30 at the time, further stated, ""This scholarship has opened up new visitors and new horizons...open up your hearts and minds to professor Derrick Bell.""","A young barack obama is seen delivering the speech in 1991.

Ever since he lost to Dustin Poirier at UFC 281, the fighter has spent most of his time preparing for his proposed fight against Conor McGregor . However, the fight never happened owing to a toe injury suffered by the Notorious. Chandler waited for a long time before he finally decided to move on with his fight with Oliveira.

While the announcement took the internet by storm, the bout never materialized despite having a scheduled date at UFC 303. Chandler did wait for a comeback announcement by McGregor before finally moving on with Charles Oliveira at UFC 309. It was a disappointing defeat for the Iron, as he lost the bout by a unanimous decision. On top of that, Chandler had another defeat handed to him at UFC 314 by Paddy Pimblett via a knockout in the third round.In a recent episode of Show Me the Money, Brazilian fighter Renato Moicano, while analysing the co-main event card at UFC 314 between Pimblett and Chandler, talked about how McGregor is the main reason behind the career downfall of the Iron.“In reality, McGregor destroyed his career, brother. I think that was f**king McGregor’s fault brother. You know two years without fighting. Waiting waiting waiting. Plus at his age. You know, yeah, I am like 35, soon to be 36, I cannot wait two years to fight, whoever, you know. I have to fight as soon as possible. And that was a huge mistake by Michael Chandler.

'I'm not Justin Trudeau,' Carney says after jab from Poilievre

The first French-language leaders’ debate of the 2025 Canadian election saw prime minister Mark Carney and conservative leader Pierre Poilievre face off over the pressing issue of how best to deal with US president Donald Trump Carney, who took over the Liberal party leadership in March, countered Poilievre’s claims about the need for change, by arguing that the central question of the upcoming election was who could best handle Trump, in the face of Trump’s aggressive tactics, including his trade war and his threats to make Canada the 51st state.Poilievre, in his criticism of Carney’s leadership, argued that the Liberals had been in power too long and that Carney, much like his predecessor Justin Trudeau, represented continuity rather than change.Responding to this, Carney said, ""Mr Poilievre is not Justin Trudeau. I’m not Justin Trudeau either. In this election the question is who is going to face Mr Trump.""When asked about Justin Trudeau during a news conference after the debate, Mark Carney said one key difference between them is his stronger focus on the economy. “There are many differences, but one of them is that I place much more emphasis on growing the economy,” he said.Trump’s threat has led to a rise in Canadian nationalism, which has given Carney’s Liberal party a boost in the polls ahead of the 28 April vote. The poll shift shows a clear change from earlier in the year, where the Conservatives held a significant lead. In January, a Nanos poll showed the Liberals trailing by 47% to 20%, but the most recent poll indicates that the Liberals now lead by 8 percentage points.The debate, held in Montreal—Canada’s second-largest city—was strategically important, as the French-speaking province of Quebec has 78 seats in the 343-seat House of Commons.The debate was moved up by two hours to avoid a scheduling conflict with a Montreal Canadiens hockey game, a sign of the cultural importance of the sport in Canada. The decision was reminiscent of the 2011 election when a similar request was made due to the same team’s playoff schedule.The English-language debate, scheduled for Thursday evening, will further clarify the stance of each leader as Canadians prepare to vote in one of the most consequential elections in recent years.","'i'm not justin trudeau,' carney says after jab from poilievre.

North Korea on Thursday threatened to respond after the US sent B-1B bombers over the Korean Peninsula earlier this week. This deployment happened during joint exercises with South Korean aircraft, which Pyongyang sees as a direct military threat.The long-range bombers took part in aerial exercises with South Korea on Tuesday to demonstrate deterrence against North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, according to Seoul’s defence ministry.South Korean F-35 and F-16 fighter jets, along with American F-16s, participated in the drill. The ministry stated that the allies would continue strengthening their operational readiness in response to North Korea’s advancing arsenal, according to CBS News.Responding to the flyover, an unnamed spokesperson from North Korea’s defence ministry, quoted by state media, called it “an open threat to the security of our state and a grave provocation that raises the military tension in the region to an extreme dangerous level.”The official warned that Pyongyang would “deter by dint of powerful force the US aggressive attempt to permanently fix the malignant instability element in the security environment of the region,” as per news agency AP.The flyover coincided with the 113th birth anniversary of North Korea’s founder, Kim Il Sung—a date known as the “Day of Sun” and one of the most sacred holidays in the country. The timing is likely to further provoke Pyongyang, which has reacted strongly in the past to similar displays by the US, including with missile launches and fiery rhetoric, as per CBS News.Later on Thursday, South Korea’s Air Force announced the start of its biannual “Freedom Flag” exercises with the US, featuring 90 aircraft and other assets. The drills will continue for two weeks and are expected to intensify North Korea’s anger.Tensions have already been running high on the peninsula. Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of Kim Jong Un, recently dismissed US-led efforts to denuclearise North Korea as a “daydream” and reaffirmed Pyongyang's refusal to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. Her remarks came after a meeting among US, South Korean and Japanese diplomats who pledged to push forward denuclearisation talks.This week’s B-1B deployment marks the second such exercise since US President Donald Trump began his second term.In February, North Korea denounced a similar flyover as evidence of growing US-led hostility and responded with cruise missile tests. Trump has maintained that he has a “great relationship” with Kim Jong Un and has repeatedly expressed willingness to resume diplomacy, though North Korea has yet to publicly respond to his outreach.","The us sent b-1b bombers over the korean peninsula earlier this week.

Her killer, Victor Martinez-Hernandez , a fugitive from El Salvador , was later convicted of the crime.Trump invited Morin to the White House as part of his push to defend strict deportation policies . Comforting her during the meeting, he told her, “Your daughter is looking down proud of you, you know that… she’s proud of you.”The appearance came just hours after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt slammed Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen for flying to El Salvador to visit Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. Garcia, a Maryland man and father of three, was deported in March — a move Van Hollen claims was mistaken. However, the Trump administration insists Garcia is tied to a violent gang.“Maryland Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen rushed to Dulles Airport this morning to fly to El Salvador, potentially using taxpayer dollars to demand the release of deported illegal alien, MS-13 terrorist,” Leavitt told reporters, calling the trip “appalling and sad.”Leavitt then brought out Patty Morin as a “special guest” to make her voice heard.Morin then criticised Van Hollen, saying that the Maryland senator ""barely acknowledged"" the death of her daughter.“The senator from Maryland who didn’t even acknowledge — or barely acknowledged — my daughter and the brutal death that she endured, leaving her five children without a mother, chose to use my tax money to fly to El Salvador to bring back a person who isn’t even an American citizen,” she said.Furthermore, Morin said that President Trump wants to remove criminals from the country, and as American citizens, it is their duty to do the same.“These are the kind of criminals President Trump wants to remove from our country. These are the kind of criminals that we need to remove from our country. We are American citizens.

‘Karma’: Letitia James facing potential prosecution over alleged mortgage fraud

Who is Letitia James?

Letitia James is a Democrat and has served as New York’s attorney general since 2019, according to PBS.

She is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in New York.

Known for her aggressive legal stance, James gained national attention after filing a civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump, the Trump Organisation, and several of its executives in 2022.

That case led to a $454 million judgment, which Trump is currently appealing. James has remained a visible figure in the courtroom and the media throughout the proceedings.

This year, she has launched at least five legal challenges against the Trump administration, including a coalition-led lawsuit opposing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s access to Treasury systems and a separate suit against federal funding cuts to universities.

The Trump administration has accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of mortgage fraud, escalating tensions between the two sides. The allegations were revealed in documents obtained by Fox News, showing that the FHFA has referred the matter to the department of justice for possible criminal investigation.The referral, signed by FHFA director William Pulte, highlights two key claims. First, that James falsely listed a Virginia property as her principal residence. Second, she misrepresented a New York property as a four-unit structure instead of five — which may have qualified her for different loan terms. There is also an allegation that she listed her father as her husband on past documents.","Letitia james is the first black woman elected to statewide office in new york.

Poll Do you agree with the Trump administration's decision to freeze funding for Harvard? No, it undermines academic independence. Yes, it's necessary for accountability.

What the Trump administration wanted from Harvard?

Harvard's response the demands

The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard after the university refused to comply with its policy demands concerning changes in its policies.The mandates, issued in an April 3 directive, required changes to university governance, hiring and admissions processes, the closure of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices, and cooperation with federal immigration screenings for international students.The Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism that suspended the fundings and grants cited concerns about elite universities’ commitment to civil rights and responsible use of taxpayer funds. ""Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges - that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws,"" it said.""The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable. The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable. It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support,"" it added to it statement.In a letter dated April 11 to Harvard President Alan Garber, US officials accused Harvard of failing to uphold federal civil rights laws and academic standards that justify continued federal investment. The letter outlined a set of strict reforms the university must implement by August 2025. ""The United States has invested in Harvard University’s operations because of the value to the country of scholarly discovery and academic excellence. But an investment is not an entitlement. It depends on Harvard upholding federal civil rights laws, and it only makes sense if Harvard fosters the kind of environment that produces intellectual creativity and scholarly rigor, both of which are antithetical to ideological capture."" it said.""Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment. But we appreciate your expression of commitment to repairing those failures and welcome your collaboration in restoring the University to its promise. We therefore present the below provisions as the basis for an agreement in principle that will maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government,"" it added while listing out the demands for the ivy league university which included governance and leadership demands, merit-based hiring reforms, international admissions reforms, discontinuation of DEI, whistleblower reporting and ensuring transparency.In its response, Harvard President Alan Garber declared the university would not “negotiate over its independence or its constitutional rights.” Garber claimed that while the university is committed to addressing discrimination, it rejects federal overreach into academic autonomy. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Garber wrote in a message to the community, as per the Harvard Gazette. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,"" he added.Garber's response came after the government issued a list of requirements prior to announcing the funding freeze. These included detailed assessments of academic divisions and departments, evaluations of perspectives from students, faculty, and staff, as well as proposed changes to Harvard's administrative structure and recruitment procedures.Following the order, Harvard Law School professor Nikolas Bowie gave a statement to CNN’s News Central saying, “What the President of the United States is demanding of universities is nothing short of authoritarian."" “He is violating the First Amendment rights of universities and faculty by demanding that if universities want to keep this money, they have to suppress our speech and change what we teach and how we study,” he added.This action follows heightened tensions on campuses nationwide, particularly after pro-Palestinian protests erupted in response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Some demonstrations led to confrontations with law enforcement and pro-Israel counter-protesters.Republican leaders, including President Donald Trump, have equated certain activist groups with Hamas—the US-designated terrorist organization whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the current conflict.In March, the US Department of Education launched investigations into 60 academic institutions over reports of anti-Semitic incidents.Despite revealing a £45 million operating surplus from £6.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year, Harvard firmly rejected demands it deemed excessive and outside federal authority. Garber reiterated that political interference in academic decisions is unacceptable, regardless of party affiliation.Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican known for her staunch support of Jewish and Israeli causes, has been a vocal critic of Harvard’s leadership. She praised the funding freeze, calling Harvard emblematic of higher education’s decline.Unlike Harvard, Columbia University chose to comply with similar White House mandates, forfeiting $400 million in federal grants after failing to adequately protect Jewish students during protests. Columbia has since implemented new disciplinary policies and increased security measures.Meanwhile, immigration authorities have pursued action against Columbia-based pro-Palestinian organizers. Mahmoud Khalil is undergoing deportation proceedings, and Mohsen Mahdawi was detained during his US citizenship interview.",The trump administration announced monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for harvard.
