'India A Priority, No Second Class Citizen': Jamaat Chief's Big Statement Before Key Bangladesh Vote





Bangladesh will vote Thursday in a Parliamentary election that will perhaps have more far-reaching consequences for India than any such exercise in the recent past in its neighbourhood. Ironically, with Sheikh Hasina ’s Awami League not in the fray, India’s best hopes of a realistic reset in ties with Dhaka rest on a majority for the frontrunner Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Hasina’s bête noire and a party with historically fraught ties with New Delhi.Wrongfooted by the 2024 July Uprising that ousted long-term ally Hasina, India intensified its outreach to the BNP realising the then Khaleda Zia-led party offered the optimum choice for future legitimacy and stability in the country. The renewed engagement with BNP leaders, PM Narendra Modi’s offer of help for Zia’s treatment just before her demise and his letter to her son and current leader Tarique Rahman, delivered through foreign minister S Jaishankar, firmed up the initiative, despite the restraining factor of Hasina’s presence in India.In the absence of the banned Awami League, the election is expected to see a tight bipolar contest between the BNP alliance and the other major bloc comprising 11 parties – including a curious mix of Islamists and Gen-Z revolutionaries - which is led by India’s traditional foe Jamaat-e-Islami.Jamaat is joined by the National Citizen Party (NCP), a new political outfit composed of student leaders who led mass protests that toppled Hasina.Apart from the election outcome, India will also closely follow the Constitutional “July Charter” referendum that will take place alongside the general election. With its emphasis on a two-term limit for the PM, introduction of an upper house to review legislation and on Bangladeshi, not Bengali, identity, the referendum seems designed not just to prevent the return of “authoritarianism” but also to minimise India’s deep-rooted cultural and linguistic bonds with the country.While India would not like to delay any outreach to the likely new government, given the significance it attaches to ties with Dhaka for its own security and also Bangladesh’s growing reputation as a “swing state” coveted by powers like the US and China, any such exercise will be mindful of several key concerns.First of course is security. Not allowing Indian insurgent groups in the northeast to use Bangladesh territory against India will top India’s agenda with the new government, given that the BNP-Jamaat government two decades ago was accused of providing safe havens to such groups. Robust security cooperation, including intelligence-sharing, can mitigate concerns.Equally important will be preventing Pakistani forces from using Bangladesh to target Indian interests. The interim government has already effected a dramatic turnaround in ties with Pakistan and efforts to step up defence and security ties with frequent visits to Dhaka by ISI officials will aggravate India’s security concerns. Pakistan pivot is also what the BNP-Jamaat government was accused of in the past. India will also watch closely Chinese ingress into Bangladesh’s defence sector, including a recent deal to manufacture drones not far from Indian territory.The safety and security of the 13-million strong Hindu community will also be on top of India’s agenda with the new government, as evident from the way Modi has himself raised this issue on several occasions. India will expect continued cooperation for transport of goods to the northeast through ports in Bangladesh under the existing frameworks.However, for any outreach to be meaningful, India might have to first address the Hasina factor. The BNP will press on with the demand to extradite Hasina, who has been sentenced to death for alleged crimes against humanity. According to a source in Dhaka, this is an issue that relates to the people’s sentiments and India will not be seen as a reliable ally till the time it is seen as shielding Hasina.While a likely BNP government is expected to aggressively pursue issues related to border killings, water sharing and even revival of SAARC, India might also face a challenge in the form of a resurgent Jamaat that is projected to win anywhere between 50 to 100 seats, more than ever in its history. If that happens, the party could trigger some serious anxiety in India about its role not just as a powerful opposition but also a potential ally of the BNP.","Bangladesh will vote thursday in a parliamentary election that will perhaps have more far-reaching consequences for india than any such exercise in the recent past.

Why stock market crashed today: Top 5 reasons

IT sector stocks crash

Weak global equity markets

Dollar strength, weak rupee

Weak technical set-up

Geopolitical tensions linger

Stock market crash today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the equity benchmarks, crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff. While Nifty50 went below 25,500, BSE Sensex closed down over 1,000 points. Nifty50 ended the day at 25,471.10, down 336 points or 1.30%. BSE Sensex closed at 82,626.76, down 1,048 points or 1.25%.The stock market slide was led by continued selloff in IT shares which weighed heavily on market sentiment amid rising concerns about disruption driven by artificial intelligence. Large-cap technology stocks such as Infosys, TCS, HCLTech and Wipro led the losses.Selling pressure in IT stocks intensified for a second straight session after the American depositary receipts of Infosys and Wipro dropped nearly 10 percent overnight. During Friday’s trading, the Nifty IT index fell more than 4 percent, taking its two-day decline close to 10 percent. Major sector players including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, HCLTech and Mphasis declined between 4 and 6 percent, indicating widespread weakness across the segment.Negative sentiment strengthened after US-based artificial intelligence startup Anthropic introduced a new enterprise-oriented tool designed for corporate legal teams.The company, known for its Claude chatbot, said that the platform can automate several tasks such as contract reviews, non-disclosure agreement sorting, compliance processes, preparation of legal briefs and standardised responses. This development has raised concerns about the long-term demand outlook for traditional IT services.“Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon,” warned V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. He added that Indian IT may continue to face pressure in the near term, while a rotation of capital toward stronger-performing sectors could support stocks outside the technology space.Global market sentiment remained fragile after sharp losses on Wall Street on Thursday, driven largely by heavy selling in technology stocks. Investors turned cautious amid growing concerns that artificial intelligence could disrupt earnings visibility and compress margins across the sector.The Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of technology companies, fell around 2 percent, while broader US indices also declined as market participants evaluated fresh labour market data and positioned themselves ahead of the closely monitored January inflation figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 669.42 points, or 1.34 percent, closing at 49,451.98. The S&P 500 slipped 108.71 points, or 1.57 percent, to 6,832.76, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 469.32 points, or 2.03 percent, ending at 22,597.15.Asian equities mirrored the weakness on Friday, pulling back from recent record levels as concerns over profitability pressures in the technology sector weighed on major stocks such as AppleA stronger US dollar, which extended gains for a third consecutive session to 96.93, along with a softer rupee, added to market pressure.The Nifty closed in negative territory on Thursday, slipping out of its recent consolidation range and forming a short-term pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The 26,000 level continues to act as a significant resistance zone, supported by strong call writing activity and multiple failed attempts to move higher.Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East has continued to weigh on investor sentiment after Donald Trump warned that the United States could consider action against Iran if negotiations over a nuclear agreement fail, even as diplomatic efforts remain underway. Adding to market unease, Trump indicated that deploying an additional aircraft carrier to the region is under consideration as Washington and Tehran prepare to restart discussions.","Nifty50 and bse sensex crashed in trade on friday amid weak global cues and the continued it stocks selloff.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy is gearing up to mark a defining moment in India's maritime story as Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25, placing the 'City of Destiny' once again at the heart of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.“The current edition of IFR and MILAN exercise will be larger in scope and deeper in meaning as navies of 72 countries, including US and Russia, will participate and the mega joint naval events will feature over 60 warships and naval aircraft of three countries,” said a Navy source.

NEW DELHI: Two journalist bodies on Saturday criticised Congress neta Rahul Gandhi for questioning the impartiality of mediapersons, saying political leaders must use respectful language while addressing the press, especially in public spaces like the Parliament.The reaction came after Gandhi, speaking to reporters outside the Parliament earlier in the week, asked journalists to be more objective in their coverage. Responding to queries on the treasury benches considering a privilege notice against him over his recent speech on the Budget, the LoP said media should not merely repeat what it is told.Condemning the remarks, National Union of Journalists and Delhi Journalists Association issued a joint statement calling Gandhi’s comments inappropriate. “The LoP targeting and insulting media personnel in such a manner is highly condemnable,” NUJ president Ras Bihar said. He added that such statements amount to an attack on press freedom and undermine the role of media in a democracy.DJA president Rakesh Thapliyal and general secretary Pramod Kumar Singh said journalism exists to question those in power and provide accurate information to the public.

CDS General Anil Chauhan Links History With Border Disputes With China, Recalls Nehru Knew About It

NEW DELHI: Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan on Saturday took a swipe at neighbouring Pakistan while referring to Operation Sindoor , saying “victory is not declared by mere rhetoric.” He made the remarks while reflecting on India’s defence preparedness and stressing the need to strengthen national security systems. He also said that a sense of victory cannot be built on “dysfunctional air defence systems.”Speaking at the opening session of the ‘JAI Se Vijay’ seminar in Pune, Gen Chauhan referred to India’s success in Operation Sindoor and emphasised that “actual vijay lies in demonstrated evidence.” He said India must carry out a “sober assessment” of its defence systems to prepare for present and future challenges.Without directly naming Pakistan, the CDS highlighted the damage it suffered during India’s counterterror operation in May, launched after Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025.“With respect to the defence forces, victory is not declared by mere rhetoric. As some entities in our neighbourhood have done so, but demonstrated through evidence, like what we showcased during Operation Sindoor. A sense of victory cannot be built on demolished terror infrastructure, damaged runways, crippled airfields, and dysfunctional air defence systems. Such kinds of victories or slogans do not endure.Actual Vijay lies in demonstrated evidence rather than verifiable outcomes...,” the CDS said.Highlighting future risks, General Chauhan said India’s defence posture over the next decade must be based on a realistic evaluation of emerging threats.“Why this is important is because currently, India's defence posture for the next decade is required to be shaped by a sober assessment of what lies ahead, what kind of challenges lie ahead. And I believe it's increasingly becoming very competitive, confrontational, combative, fragile, and technologically very disruptive,” he added.He also said that in today’s changing global environment, countries can no longer assume permanent friendships or rivalries, and India must be ready to act independently if needed.“Assumptions about permanent friends or adversaries are increasingly becoming unreliable. In today's world, it is difficult to define who your friends are, who your allies are, who your enemies are and who your adversaries are. India must therefore be prepared mentally, structurally and materially to act independently when required,” he said.The CDS said partnerships remain important but cannot replace India’s own capabilities or freedom to make independent decisions. He stressed the need to strengthen domestic defence capacity to ensure strategic autonomy.Explaining the theme ‘JAI Se Vijay,’ Gen Chauhan said that in modern warfare, victory cannot be based on rhetoric or symbolic claims but must rest on “demonstrated evidence and verifiable outcomes.” He warned that damaging infrastructure or airfields alone does not guarantee lasting victory.Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s idea of JAI -- which stands for Jointness, Aatmanirbharta and Innovation -- Gen Chauhan said it reflects freedom from foreign dependence and outdated thinking. “It is not just victory over an adversary, but equally victory over inertia, prejudices, and institutional comfort,” he said.",Chief of defence staff general anil chauhan took a swipe at neighbouring pakistan while referring to operation sindoor.

India aims to reset AI debate with 1st Global South summit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-aims-to-reset-ai-debate-with-1st-global-south-summit/articleshow/128368389.cms,"Nvidia CEO unable to attend AI Summit



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ,who was to be one of the biggest attractions at the India AI Impact Summit starting on Monday, will not be able to travel to India for the event. The company issued astatement Saturday, ascribing it to “unforeseen circumstances”. Huang was expected to play a prominent role at the summit — set to be inaugurated by PM Modi.



Nvidia is the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $4.4 trillion, thanks to its processors that have become indispensable to the training of AI models. Persons familiar with the development told TOI that Huang is under the weather. Nvidia said a senior delegation led by executive vice-president Jay Puri will attend the event to “celebrate India’s exceptional AI researchers, startups, developers, and partners building country’s AI infrastructure.” TNN





New Delhi : Unthinkable just a few years ago, when artificial intelligence was a shiny experiment — impressive demos, niche tools, and a buzzword that rarely touched daily life — today it sits at the heart of how jobs are created, services delivered, science conducted and societies governed. As the world grapples with both its promise and its risks, India is stepping into a new role, as not just a user of AI but also as a global agenda-setter, becoming the the first developing country and the first nation from the Global South to convene a global AI summit.Speaking exclusively to TOI , Abhishek Singh, CEO of India AI Mission and AI Impact Summit, believes that this is India’s attempt to pull the global AI debate away from elite labs and corporate boardrooms and anchor it in people, inclusion and real-world outcomes.“This is the first summit of its kind and scale being hosted in the Global South,” said Singh, adding, “AI today is largely controlled by a few countries and a few companies. India wants to bring the perspective of the Global South and ensure that AI is more inclusive and democratised.”India’s case for hosting the summit, Singh said, rests on experience rather than theory. Over the past decade, platforms such as Aadhaar, UPI, DigiLocker and telemedicine have shown how digital systems can operate at population scale, delivering services to hundreds of millions.“India has shown its ability to adopt technology for public services,” said Singh, “We want to showcase India’s strength in building AI applications at population scale and also be the voice of the Global South.”The summit comes at a time when govts worldwide are struggling to balance rapid AI innovation with growing concerns over deepfakes, misinformation, bias and misuse. While there is broad agreement that AI should drive economic growth and social good, Singh said translating principles into practice remains uneven.“Every country agrees on two things: AI must be used for larger social good; and harm from AI must be restricted,” he said. “But countries are at very different levels of technological development. That is where regulatory capacity and shared frameworks become important.” India’s approach, he explained, is based on what it calls a ‘techno-legal framework,’ combining legal safeguards with technological tools. Legal provisions require harmful content to be taken down within defined timelines and mandate labelling of AI-generated content, especially where it poses risks to individuals, public order or national security. Alongside this, India is developing tools to detect deepfakes, mitigate bias and create ethical AI certification systems.A major focus of the summit is human capital. As automation reshapes work and threatens traditional livelihoods, the summit aims to push global cooperation on reskilling and workforce transitions, particularly for developing economies facing resource constraints.“AI should not grow only in tech hubs,” Singh said. “We are setting up data labs across the country, centres of excellence in states and smaller cities, and running large-scale skilling and training programmes so that AI reaches tier-2 and tier-3 cities.” Inclusion is another central theme, with India highlighting the role of Indian-language and voicebased AI systems in expanding access. Platforms built on natural language processing and generative AI allow people to access services in their own languages, especially those uncomfortable with English.The summit’s agenda also spans AI-enabled scientific research in healthcare, agriculture and climate, while pushing for openness, reproducibility and shared standards.","N nvidia ceo unable to attend ai summit due to 'unforeseen circumstances' jensen huang was expected to play a prominent role at the summit.

Jaishankar on Russia ties: Firmly wedded to strategic autonomy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jaishankar-on-russia-ties-firmly-wedded-to-strategic-autonomy/articleshow/128368198.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said India remains firmly committed to strategic autonomy, even as the global energy markets evolve and partnerships shift. He was responding to a question at the Munich Security Conference whether a recent trade agreement with the US would affect New Delhi’s energy ties with Russia and if India was finding it difficult to exercise its strategic autonomy in the current circumstances.India maintains its energy policy is driven by national interests and the actual crude sourcing is done by oil companies taking into account pricing, reliability and other market conditions.“We are very much wedded to strategic autonomy because it’s a part of our history and our evolution. It’s something which is very deep, and something which cuts across the political spectrum as well,” he said.Addressing concerns over energy sourcing, the EAM described the global oil market as complex and dynamic, stressing that commercial considerations guide procurement decisions.“As for energy issues, this is a complex market today. Oil companies in India, as in Europe, as probably in other parts of the world, look at availability, look at costs, look at risks and take the decisions that they feel are in their best interest,” he noted.Jaishankar said that in a rapidly changing global environment, countries continuously reassess their calculations and partnerships.“So many things are changing, and so many of us are doing our calculations and recalculations,” he said, adding while India may not agree with all partners on every issue, dialogue and a willingness to find common ground remain important.“We would not necessarily agree on everything but I do believe that by doing that, and if there is an inclination to find common ground and overlaps, that would happen,” he said.Noting India’s independent decision-making, he said, “If the bottom line of your question is would I remain independent-minded and make my decisions? And would I make choices which sometimes may not agree with your thinking or somebody else’s thinking, yes, it can happen.”He met with G7 foreign ministers and their global counterparts at the Munich Security Conference 2026, reiterating India’s support for the UN80 agenda and underscoring New Delhi’s role in safeguarding global security.Jaishankar also stressed on India’s role in safeguarding sea lines of communication, acting as a first responder in crises, strengthening port security and contributing to resilient submarine cable infrastructure.","India maintains its energy policy is driven by national interests.

""Our 9 FTAs covering 38 developed countries have opened a potential textile market of Rs 45 lakh crore. India exports Rs 4 lakh crore worth textiles today. Imagine the growth potential, creating lakhs of jobs for young men and women!""

""Rahul is both attacking textile exporters and trying to scare our Indian farmers that their demand for cotton will fall. He does not know that the US production of cotton is very small, and after domestic consumption, USA exports of cotton and yarn are only $6 billion. He also doesn't know that Bangladesh imports $2.7 billion cotton from India, which they will have to continue doing because the US does not have any surplus cotton. Hence, with the huge potential for growth in our textile sector, demand for Indian cotton will continuously grow and increase the income of farmers.""

""And by the way, even when your family was running the Congress Government, the Foreign Trade Policy and SEZ Act [rule 27(1)] always allowed duty free import of raw material, including cotton, to be used for producing export goods. So when Rahul Gandhi attacks “zero-duty import for export,” he is attacking policies his own party started! What an ignorant Leader of Opposition. No wonder he fails in election after election.""

NEW DELHI: Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday continued his barrage of attacks on Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi over his concerns on the India-US trade deal, saying that “he is exposing himself with his own foolishness.” He once again put forward the Centre’s clarification on the trade pact, which followed nearly a year of negotiations, as the war of words over the issue continued.He also alleged that the Lok Sabha LoP is “trying to sabotage India's growth story with his politics of negativity.”Taking aim at Rahul Gandhi, Goyal claimed he had countered Rahul’s “fearmongering,” which he said was misleading farmers and exporters, by presenting what he described as “hard facts” on the India-US trade deal.He posted on X, writing in three points:Clarifying further on the deal, Goyal added, ""Rahul ji, both Indian farmers and textile workers stand to gain hugely by the US trade deal and other FTAs done by the NDA Govt… and the people of India trust PM Modi. Your bundle of lies will fail.""Earlier in the day, Rahul Gandhi also stepped up his attack on the recently finalised trade deal with Washington, claiming that the agreement would hurt India’s cotton farmers and textile exporters.In a post on X, he alleged that the government had walked into a “trap” that leaves millions of families staring into an “abyss of unemployment.”“18% Tariff versus 0% – Let me explain how the Prime Minister, a master at telling lies, and his Cabinet are spreading confusion on this. And how they’re deceiving the country’s cotton farmers and textile exporters through the India-US trade deal.”Rahul said that after Indian garments were subjected to an 18% tariff in the US market, he raised in Parliament the issue of a special concession being extended to Bangladesh.

Fear of failure in love

Fear of societal expectations tied to marriage

When love is easy, but forever is not

Not equal to inability to love

Why fear of commitment might be growing

A culture of choice and comparison

Individual identity over collectivism

Witnessing relationship breakdowns

Trauma and attachment styles

Changing gender roles and expectations

Gamophobia in India: Between tradition and modernity

Marriage as familial responsibility

Pressure to settle down early

Fear of “what will people say”

Arranged marriage traditions

Gendered expectations around roles

Not all fear is pathology

In a world where relationships have become both more visible and more complex, a curious psychological phenomenon has been quietly gaining attention — gamophobia, the fear of commitment or marriage.It is more than just the occasional cold feet, jitters before a proposal or hesitation about settling down. Gamophobia is a deeply rooted, lived experience that can colour every connection, shape life choices, and define what love looks like for many individuals. Increasingly, mental health professionals, writers and even everyday couples are referring to this concept not just as a quirky term, but as a genuine emotional resistance.Ankur Halder, 27-year-old IT professional, put it perfectly-The word “gamophobia” itself comes from the Greek gamos (marriage) and phobia (fear). At its core, it speaks about the fear of marrying or entering into long-term intimate commitment. Yet, in practice, it is far more nuanced. People who struggle with gamophobia are not necessarily afraid of love or companionship. Instead, they fear the permanence, vulnerability, expectations, and potential loss of autonomy that life-long attachment can entail.But why is this fear becoming more visible now? Why are more people open to calling themselves “afraid of commitment”? Is this simply a symptom of a generation spoiled for choice, or is it rooted in deeper psychological and social shifts? And importantly — what does this look like in a place like India, where marriage still carries cultural gravity unlike many parts of the world?To explore these questions, we must go beyond the label and into the lived realities that make gamophobia resonate in the twenty-first century.Gamophobia is not a clinical diagnosis in major psychiatric manuals like the DSM-V; it is a loosely defined term used in psychological, cultural and pop-psychology circles. Yet, its emergence reflects real emotional and relational patterns that therapists see every day.For some, it manifests as anxiety or panic when conversations about the future get serious. For others, it shows up as chronic relationship sabotage — starting strong, pulling away, or falling into self-fulfilling breakups before things get too real. Some experience sleeplessness, avoidance, or physical symptoms at the thought of tying their life to another.Importantly, gamophobia is not just about fear of marriage. It can express as:For a growing number of young Indians, this fear is not abstract. It surfaces at a very specific moment — when romance begins to gather weight.In this country, relationships rarely remain suspended in emotional possibility. They are expected to culminate. They must formalise. They must move toward marriage.And it is often at this threshold that something shifts.Aarav, 32, who works at an MNC in Mumbai said over the past decade, he has been in three serious relationships. Each followed a similar rhythm: an intense beginning, emotional intimacy, shared vacations. For months, sometimes years, everything felt certain.Then came the conversations about meeting parents. About timelines. About “where this is heading,"" and began to withdraw.“I don’t know what happens,” he says. “It’s like something switches off. I start imagining all the ways it could go wrong. What if I lose my freedom? What if I’m not ready? What if I choose wrong and can’t undo it?”Gamophobia often unfolds in exactly this way. Individuals form romantic bonds with ease. They are affectionate, attentive, emotionally engaged. But when a relationship approaches formal commitment — engagement, marriage, shared finances — anxiety spikes. The future stops feeling romantic and starts feeling irreversible.One of the most persistent myths about gamophobia is that it signals emotional immaturity or incapacity for deep feeling. This assumption could not be further from the truth.People who struggle with commitment anxiety often love intensely. They may be attentive partners, emotionally available in the present, and genuinely invested in their relationships. The difficulty does not lie in affection. It lies in anticipation.For some, the fear is rooted in childhood experiences. For others, it stems from witnessing marital dissatisfaction. And for many in contemporary India, it arises from the weight of making the “right” decision in a world that offers both endless choice and irreversible consequences.In that sense, gamophobia is less about rejecting love and more about fearing a mistake that cannot be undone.A 29-year-old woman (choosing to stay anonymous) grew up watching her parents argue behind closed doors while maintaining a composed public image. Divorce was never discussed. Silence was easier than separation.“When people talk about marriage,” she says, “I don’t picture romance. I picture staying even when you’re unhappy.”Children absorb more than they realise. When marriage is modeled as endurance rather than companionship, commitment can subconsciously begin to resemble confinement.We live in an age where options, especially romantic ones, feel infinite. Dating apps, social media, global mobility, and curated images of “the perfect relationship” create an illusion of endless possibility. When one believes that the next swipe might be better, committing to one person can paradoxically feel limiting rather than reassuring.This reflects deeper cognitive patterns of comparison, fear of missing out, and choice overload. Instead of narrowing options feeling comforting, it can trigger anxiety about losing potential alternatives forever.In recent decades, individualism has become central to people’s sense of self. Career goals, personal growth, and self-discovery are prioritized more than ever. While this is empowering, it also changes how relationships are viewed. Commitment starts to feel like a trade-off — balancing autonomy with attachment.Ankur Halder said, ""I believe a healthy relationship should consist of two independent individuals choosing to be together. Relationships today have evolved, unlike older generations like say my grandparents, where partners were often overly dependent on each other. I appreciate that relationships now allow more individuality.""We grow up surrounded by stories of failed marriages, divorces, and high-profile celebrity breakups. Seeing relationships fall apart shapes our ideas about commitment — making it feel risky rather than romantic.How we bond emotionally is influenced by early life experiences. People with avoidant attachment often fear losing independence in close relationships. Those with anxious attachment may fear being abandoned, even in healthy partnerships.Someone whose early friendships ended abruptly may struggle to fully commit to a partner, worrying that closeness will lead to inevitable loss.Traditional roles, like men as sole breadwinners and women as primary caregivers, have changed, but old expectations don’t disappear overnight. Women don’t want to be bound by household duties, and years of social conditioning have made many feel that, at some point, they’ll have to sacrifice their dreams to fulfill the expectations of a relationship.People everywhere often find themselves balancing new possibilities with inherited norms, creating tension in romantic relationships as they navigate who does what, how decisions are made, and what each partner “should” contribute.In India, marriage has long been treated as a central life milestone- expected, celebrated, and often orchestrated by family.Urbanisation, increased female workforce participation, and exposure to global culture have changed how young Indians think about partnership. Emotional compatibility and personal growth matter more than ever before.At the same time, entrenched expectations persist:In this environment, gamophobia can take on unique contours. For some, it becomes resistance against pressure, a boundary against societal coercion. For others, it reflects genuine uncertainty about whether traditional marital structures align with their evolving identities.Adding another layer of complexity, leaving a partner in India is often socially difficult. Relationships are not just between two individuals — they are entwined with family expectations, social judgment, and, in many cases, children.In India, many hesitate to end relationships even when they feel unfulfilled, fearing the stigma of separation or the impact on their children. This has created a common misconception: staying despite unhappiness is often interpreted as commitment or proof of love, when it may instead reflect social pressure and obligations.Intergenerational values also play a role. Many Indian families prize endurance and sacrifice in relationships. While admirable, these ideals can unintentionally silence emotional needs. Young adults may find themselves torn between honoring tradition and honoring their own readiness.Mental health awareness in India is still developing. Anxiety around commitment may be dismissed as stubbornness or irresponsibility rather than understood as emotional complexity. Without language for their fears, many individuals internalise guilt instead of seeking support.It is crucial to recognise that gamophobia is not always dysfunction. Fear can be protective, especially after painful or unstable relationships. It may signal the need for clarity, healing, or stronger identity formation.In a society that often equates marriage with success, choosing to pause or question is not necessarily avoidance. It may be discernment.Challenging conventional marriage norms, Ankur said, “I have a somewhat sceptical view of marriage. While I understand that it works well for many people, most marriages I’ve observed seem complicated and full of ongoing issues. That has made me question whether the institution itself is necessary, or whether commitment can exist in other forms.”Gamophobia is a mirror. It reflects personal insecurities and broader cultural change. It reminds us that commitment is not merely a social contract, but an emotional decision shaped by history, identity, and context.In India and beyond, the increasing visibility of commitment anxiety does not mean a generation is incapable of love. It suggests that people are thinking more deeply about what love demands.And perhaps, in asking those difficult questions, we are not drifting away from commitment but are learning to approach it with greater awareness.Love, after all, is not weakened by reflection.It is strengthened by choice.","Gamophobia is a deeply rooted, lived experience that can colour every connection, shape life choices, and define what love looks like for many individuals. People who struggle with gamophobia are not necessarily afraid of love or companionship.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128343268,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1504417,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

BNP's Tarique Rahman Set To Become Bangladesh PM After Sweeping Victory In Historic Comeback

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for acknowledging the party’s leadership in the national elections, saying “look forward to engaging constructively with India to advance our multifaceted relationship”The party’s official social media handle posted:""Thank you very much, Honourable @narendramodi. We greatly appreciate your kind acknowledgment of Mr. Tarique Rahman’s leadership in securing the BNP’s decisive win in the national elections.

In a post on X, PM Modi said:""Delighted to speak with Mr. Tarique Rahman. I congratulated him on the remarkable victory in the Bangladesh elections. I conveyed my best wishes and support in his endeavour to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh.""The BNP secured a two-thirds majority in the parliamentary elections, winning more than 200 seats and surpassing its 2001 tally of 193. The victory is being seen as a move toward political stability after months of unrest following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a youth-led uprising in July 2024.Tarique Rahman, son of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman , returned to Dhaka in December after spending 18 years in exile and is expected to be sworn in as prime minister.

New pills offer hope against gonorrhoea as drug resistance tightens grip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-pills-offer-hope-against-gonorrhoea-as-drug-resistance-tightens-grip/articleshow/128337443.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: After decades of losing ground to drug resistance, doctors finally have new weapons against gonorrhoea, a common sexually transmitted infection that has steadily outsmarted one antibiotic after another. The recent approval of two new oral medicines by the US Food and Drug Administration has reopened a narrowing treatment window for a disease edging dangerously close to becoming untreatable.The FDA cleared zoliflodacin (Nuzolvence) and gepotidacin (Blujepa) in December 2025 for treating uncomplicated gonorrhoea. Their arrival comes at a critical time, especially for countries like India, where ceftriaxone is the only effective antibiotic left in routine use.“Gonorrhoea is a major STD and resistance is rising fast,” said Dr Kabir Sardana, head of dermatology at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. He attributed the trend largely to antibiotic misuse by general practitioners and quacks. “Azithromycin, once a first-line drug, is now largely ineffective because it was prescribed indiscriminately for everything from minor infections to acne,” he said.Experts say the urgency is reflected in global surveillance.Dr Neirita Hazarika, professor and head of dermatology at AIIMS Guwahati, pointed out that the WHO’s 2025 Global Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Report has classified drug-resistant gonorrhoea as a high-priority pathogen. She said the approval of the two new oral drugs marks a significant milestone, as clinical trials have shown cure rates comparable to current standard therapy. “These drugs expand treatment options for uncomplicated gonorrhoea at a time when resistance to cephalosporins (Ceftriaxone) and macrolides (Azithromycin) is rising,” she said.Ceftriaxone, now the last dependable option in India, is itself under pressure. Widely used for several other infections, it faces a real risk of resistance if misuse continues. “If ceftriaxone fails, we will be left with virtually no antibiotics for gonorrhoea,” Dr Sardana warned.Gonorrhoea affects both men and women and commonly causes urethritis, but untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and increased HIV risk. With India already carrying a high burden of sexually transmitted infections, doctors warn that failure of existing drugs would have serious public health consequences.The infection has a long history of defeating antibiotics. Sulfa drugs, penicillin, tetracycline, quinolones and cefixime were all abandoned over time as resistance emerged. By 2007, quinolones were dropped entirely due to widespread failure.Experts say the new drugs are promising but require careful use. Prof Seema Sood of AIIMS New Delhi said zoliflodacin and gepotidacin have shown strong activity in studies for uncomplicated urogenital infection.India’s wider antimicrobial resistance crisis adds urgency. ICMR surveillance has flagged rising resistance linked to over-the-counter antibiotic use. Prof Bimal Kumar Das, HOD of microbiology at AIIMS New Delhi, said newer antibiotics are crucial to tackle AMR, while Dr Hitender Gautam noted that early access in India could help curb resistant infections, with gepotidacin showing potential beyond gonorrhoea.","The fda cleared zoliflodacin and gepotidacin in december 2025 for treating uncomplicated gonorrhoea.

Farmer Meet Video Sparks Row As Piyush Goyal, Shivraj Chouhan Counters Rahul Gandhi On US Trade Pact

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday escalated his attack on the finalised India-US trade deal, claiming that the agreement would harm India’s cotton farmers and textile exporters.In a post on X, Rahul alleged that the government has walked into a “trap” that leaves millions of families staring into an “abyss of unemployment.”“18% Tariff versus 0% – Let me explain how the Prime Minister, a master at telling lies, and his Cabinet are spreading confusion on this. And how they’re deceiving the country’s cotton farmers and textile exporters through the India-US trade deal.”Rahul said that after India’s garments were subjected to an 18% tariff in the US market, he raised in Parliament the issue of the special concession being given to Bangladesh. According to him, a minister responded, “If we want the same benefit, we’ll have to import cotton from the US.”The LoP in Lok Sabha claimed that Bangladesh was being given a 0% tariff on garment exports to the US on the condition that it imports American cotton. Bangladesh is signalling that it might reduce or even stop importing cotton from India, he said.Questioning the policy, Gandhi said, “Is it really any kind of option – or a trap designed to corner us in a ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’ situation? If we import American cotton, our own farmers will be ruined.If we don’t, our textile industry will fall behind and be destroyed.”Earlier as well, Rahul Gandhi had criticised the Centre over the agreement with Washington, alleging that the deal “betrays our food security and farmers,” and claiming that PM Modi opened India’s agricultural market because US President Donald Trump “has him by the throat.”The remarks come after Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Friday rejected Gandhi’s criticism and accused him of misleading farmers.In a video post on X, Goyal said, “Mr Rahul Gandhi has once again rolled out a stage-managed, most artificial and fake narrative. This time, he is shooting from the shoulders of a few Congress party activists, who are pretending to be farmer leaders - in a completely artificial, and baseless conversation.”Goyal on Saturday speaking to reporters said, ""They have no plan other than to create confusion... They don't even have any issue to criticise us, except lies and deceit. They confuse our farmers by telling lies every day. I am confident that discredited leaders like Rahul Gandhi and his alliance... no matter how hard they try, will not be able to stop the Prime Minister from serving the country with a spirit of service and dedication. ""Goyal said the government had fully protected farmers’ interests in the agreement and that he stood by that statement “on record and with full responsibility.”He added that the deal would benefit farmers, fishermen, youth, MSMEs, startups and artisans, and would not harm agricultural producers.",Congress leader rahul gandhi on saturday escalated his attack on the finalised india-us trade deal.

'Symbols Of British Empire': PM Modi On North & South Block In 1st Address From Seva Teerth

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday paid tributes to the soldiers, that were killed in the Pulwama attack 7 years ago calling them ""brave heroes"".""Remembering the brave heroes who laid down their lives in Pulwama on this day in 2019. Their devotion, resolve and service to the nation remain forever etched in our collective consciousness. Every Indian draws strength from their enduring courage,"" said PM Modi on X.Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi also remembered the soldiers saying, ""My heartfelt tribute to our brave soldiers who were killed in the audacious terrorist attack in Pulwama in 2019. The nation shall forever remain indebted to them for their supreme sacrifice in the defence of Mother India.""Vice President CP Radhakrishnan also paid his tributes on the seventh anniversary of the attack. ""I pay homage to the brave personnel who laid down their lives in the Pulwama terror attack . Their supreme sacrifice will forever remain etched in the nation's memory and continues to inspire us to build a strong and secure India,"" he said.A wreath-laying ceremony in Pulwama honoured the 40 CRPF personnel killed in the 2019 terror attack, as senior officers and officials gatahered to pay tribute.CRPF also paid tribute to the soldiers. ""On 14 Feb 2019, 40 bravehearts of CRPF India made the supreme sacrifice in Pulwama. Their valour remains etched in our hearts forever,"" it said.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath also paid tribute to the ""brave sons of Mother India who made the supreme sacrifice in the cowardly terrorist attack in Pulwama.""Mallikarjun Kharge joined in, writing ""we pay our deepest homage to the brave martyrs of Bharat Mata, who laid down their lives in Pulwama.""On February 14, 2019, the Pulwama district in Jammu and Kashmir witnessed one of the deadliest terror attacks in Indian history. A convoy of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) travelling along the Srinagar–Jammu National Highway was targeted in a suicide bombing, killing 40 personnel. The date has since been remembered as a “Black Day” in the country’s security narrative.The convoy consisted of 78 buses carrying nearly 2,500 CRPF personnel from Jammu to Srinagar when an explosives-laden vehicle rammed into one of the buses, causing massive casualties and destruction.The attack drew widespread international condemnation and led to an immediate tightening of security protocols across Jammu and Kashmir. The Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility, stating that a suicide bomber carried out the assault, according to local media reports.In response, India initiated a series of counter-terror measures, most notably conducting airstrikes on alleged terror training camps across the border in Pakistan. The military action marked a sharp escalation in tensions between the two countries.Beyond its immediate impact, the Pulwama attack reignited global debate over cross-border terrorism, militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, and the broader security dynamics between India and Pakistan.","Pm modi on saturday paid tributes to the soldiers, that were killed in the pulwama attack 7 years ago calling them ""brave heroes"" vice president cp radhakrishnan also paid his tributes on the seventh anniversary of the attack.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday congratulated Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman on his party’s ""decisive victory"" in the country’s parliamentary elections, and affirmed India’s continued support for a ""democratic, progressive and inclusive"" Bangladesh.“I convey my warm congratulations to Mr. Tarique Rahman on leading BNP to a decisive victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership,” PM Modi said in a post on X.“I look forward to working with you to strengthen our multifaceted relations and advance our common development goals,” he added.The BNP secured a commanding two-thirds majority in the general elections, winning more than 200 seats — one of its strongest performances, surpassing its 2001 tally of 193 seats. The outcome is widely seen as paving the way for political stability after months of unrest that followed the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-led uprising in August 2024.Rahman, son of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman, is expected to be sworn in as prime minister. He returned to Dhaka in December after spending 18 years abroad. His father ruled Bangladesh from 1977 until his assassination in 1981 and remains a prominent figure in the country’s independence-era politics.Soon after the results became clear, the BNP thanked voters and urged restraint among supporters.“Despite winning ... by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,” the party said in a statement, instead calling for nationwide prayers.The election marked the first since Hasina fled to neighbouring India. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, 85, had been serving as interim head of government following her departure. Hasina, now in exile in New Delhi, had dominated Bangladesh politics for years alongside Khaleda Zia, Rahman’s mother and a former prime minister.The Awami League, which governed for 15 years but was barred from contesting this election, had earlier recorded a larger mandate of 230 seats in 2008.Meanwhile, the head of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami conceded defeat, stating that his party would not engage in the “politics of opposition” merely for its own sake. The National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists who were instrumental in the movement against Hasina and part of a Jamaat-backed alliance, managed to win only five of the 30 seats it contested.","Bnp secured a commanding two-thirds majority in the general elections.

Bank strike today: Are banks shut amid nationwide Bharat bandh on February 12?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bank-strike-today-are-banks-shut-amid-nationwide-bharat-bandh-on-february-12/articleshow/128235136.cms,"Representative AI image

Will banks remain open today?

Which bank unions are participating — and why?

The nation is observing a Bharat Bandh on Thursday following a nationwide strike call by a joint forum of central trade unions against the Centre’s alleged anti-worker policies. The strike also involves banking unions.Thus, amid the strike, uncertainty looms over banking operations, with customers across cities unsure whether branches will function normally or face disruptions as several bank unions align with the strike call.While banks will remain open, services might face disruptions as major institutions like State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda , and UCO Bank have notified the BSE about potential service impacts during the Bharat Bandh.Bank of Baroda has informed customers through its BSE filing that while it is preparing for normal operations, branch services might be affected if the strike takes place. Similarly, SBI noted that although necessary arrangements have been made to ensure normal functioning, work in branches and offices may be impacted to a limited extent.UCO Bank made similar statements in its BSE filing, stating that steps are being taken for smooth operations but branch functioning could be affected if the strike materialises.For customers wondering about bank services on February 12, it is important to note that while banks are not officially closed, planning transactions in advance may help avoid inconvenience due to possible service limitations.Major bank unions including the All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers Association (AIBOA), and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) joined forces with 10 central trade unions for this protest. They have raised concerns over the new labour codes, alleging that the reforms are unfavourable to workers and could make trade union registration more restrictive.The protest also comes at a time when bank associations have been actively campaigning for improved working conditions, including the long-pending demand for a five-day work week to enhance work-life balance for employees.Over 10 central trade unions called for a nationwide Bharat Bandh to protest the government’s “anti-worker” policies. The strike was supported by farmer organisations and other groups across multiple sectors.The bandh was announced as a demonstration against what the unions described as “anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the central government.”Trade unions estimated that nearly 30 crore workers from various sectors were likely to take part in the agitation. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) urged farmers to join trade union workers to ensure the success of the all-India general strike.","The nation is observing a bharat bandh on thursday following a nationwide strike call by a joint forum of central trade unions against the centre’s alleged anti-worker policies.
