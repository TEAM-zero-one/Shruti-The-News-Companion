Donald Trump, US Lied About India-Pak Ceasefire Role, Trade Deal During Op Sindoor: Ex-US Official

Pakistan's Strategic Bitcoin reserve plans

Pakistan’s scramble to please US President Donald Trump by establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve seems to have landed it in a soup! According to a report in the Dawn, senior officials in Islamabad have said that cryptocurrency remains banned in Pakistan. The State Bank of Pakistan and the Ministry of Finance both clarified that cryptocurrency transactions remain prohibited in Pakistan, with all such dealings considered unlawful under existing regulations.At a session of the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal explained that despite the recent establishment of a Crypto Council by the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif through executive order to explore digital asset policies, the prohibition on cryptocurrency remains enforced under SBP and SECP guidelines.According to the Dawn report, Bosal said, ""There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan."" He emphasised that formal legislation would be necessary to alter the current status.Also Read | Donald Trump’s trade policy thrown into turmoil!

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday targeted the Modi government following the remarks made by Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Operation Sindoor in an interview in Singapore. Kharge claimed that the nation had been misled and demanded a special session of Parliament to address the issue.“In the wake of the remarks made by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) in Singapore in an interview, there are some very important questions which need to be asked. These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened. The Modi Govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing,” Kharge said in a post on X.Kharge referenced CDS Chauhan who had earlier today, firmly dismissed Pakistan's claims that it had downed six Indian warplanes during Operation Sindoor, describing the statement as ""absolutely incorrect"". Speaking toduring the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, he said, ""What is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being downed."" He explained that the Indian Armed Forces identified tactical errors, corrected them, and resumed operations within two days.Also read: What CDS Anil Chauhan said on Pakistan's claim of downing India jets during Operation Sindoor Kharge lauded the bravery of IAF pilots, saying: “Our IAF pilots were risking their lives fighting the enemy. We have suffered some losses, but our pilots were safe. We salute their resolute courage and bravery.” However, he stressed that a “comprehensive strategic review is the need of the hour.”“The Congress party demands a Comprehensive Review of our Defence Preparedness by an independent expert committee, on the lines of the Kargil Review Committee,” he added.Kharge also raised concerns over US President Donald Trump’s repeated claim that he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. “This is a direct affront to the Shimla Agreement,” he said, questioning why the Modi government had not provided clarity on Trump’s assertions or the affidavit filed by the US Secretary of Commerce in a United States court.“Instead of clarifying Mr. Trump's repeated assertions, and the affidavit filed by US Secretary of Commerce in the United States Court of International Trade, PM Modi is on an election blitz, taking PERSONAL CREDIT for the valour of our Armed Forces, hiding behind their bravery and dodging the contours of the agreed CEASEFIRE, which the Foreign Secretary announced on 10th, after Mr. Trump's tweet,” Kharge said. “Is India and Pakistan now again hyphenated? What are the conditions of the CEASEFIRE agreement? Rs 140 Cr Patriotic Indians deserve to know this. ”Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh echoed Kharge’s concerns, criticising the lack of transparency from the government. “It is an extraordinary and telling commentary on Undeclared Emergency that the PM will not chair all-party meetings and will not take Parliament into confidence but the nation gets to know of the first phase of Operation Sindoor through the CDS’s interview in Singapore,” Ramesh posted on X. “Couldn't opposition leaders have been taken into confidence by the PM earlier?”General Chauhan, while speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, rejected the idea that India and Pakistan had approached nuclear confrontation, calling such claims “far-fetched.” He also dismissed Pakistan’s claims about the success of Chinese-supplied weapons, saying they “didn’t work,” and asserted that India had conducted precision strikes 300 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory.",Congress president mallikarjun kharge targeted the modi government following the remarks made by chief of defence staff (cds) general anil chauhan on operation sindoor.

""I personally feel that there is a lot of space between conduct of conventional operations and the nuclear threshold,"" General Chauhan said.Channels of communication with Pakistan ""were always open"" to control the situation, he added, noting that on the escalation ladder, there were ""more sub-ladders which can be exploited for settling out our issues"" without needing to resort to nuclear weapons.General Chauhan also played down Pakistan's claims about the effectiveness of weaponry deployed from China and other countries, saying they ""didn't work"".""We were able to do precision strikes on heavily air-defended airfields of Pakistan deep 300 kilometres inside, with the precision of a meter,"" the CDS added.General Chauhan also said the cessation of hostilities is holding, and will depend on Pakistan's actions in the future.

However, after a long struggle, Colombia is now a peaceful country. We have come here with a message of peace. We have clearly stated that we will give a fitting response to every terrorist attack, and when it is over, we want nothing but peace.""Tharoor voiced disappointment during a press conference in Bogotá on Thursday over Colombia’s stance. He noted that India was disheartened by the Colombian government’s decision to offer condolences for the casualties in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, instead of expressing solidarity with the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.""We were a little disappointed in the reaction of the Colombian government, which apparently expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of lives in Pakistan after the Indian strikes, rather than sympathising with the victims of terrorism,"" said Tharoor.""We will say to our friends in Colombia, there can be no equivalence between those who dispatch terrorists and those who resist them.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is currently carrying out extensive Capacity Development Demonstrations at multiple key locations across India, including Pokhran Field Firing Ranges, Babina Field Firing Ranges, and Joshimath. Separate air defence demonstrations are scheduled at Agra and Gopalpur. These trials are being conducted under simulated operational conditions, with integrated electronic warfare (EW) environments to rigorously evaluate the performance of advanced defence systems.Earlier this week, Chief of the Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi visited the Babina Field Firing Ranges, where he reviewed the ongoing trials and engaged with all stakeholders, including defence industry partners and Army officials.The demonstrations are part of the Indian Army’s larger roadmap for a “Decade of Transformation” and aim to fast-track the absorption of emerging technologies, particularly those developed under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative. A wide range of platforms is undergoing trials, showcasing the synergy between the Indian Army and indigenous defence manufacturers.Key systems being evaluated include:These demonstrations are designed to assess combat viability and ensure that the Indian Army remains technologically superior and operationally prepared for future conflicts.The trials underscore the Army’s commitment to strengthening national defence through indigenous innovation and self-reliance.The latest trials come days after India launched Operation Sindoor, retaliatory strikes deep into Pakistani territory and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir following the Pahalgam terror attack, which killed 26 people, including civilians.Speaking at rallies in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Operation Sindoor as a powerful demonstration of India's indigenous defence capabilities, asserting that the operation was ""just an arrow in the quiver"" and not over yet.The PM issued a stern warning to terror outfits, saying that if terrorism “tries to raise its hood again, it will be dragged out of its hole and trampled.”The Prime Minister said the armed forces used domestically developed weapons, including BrahMos missiles, to destroy terror hideouts and military installations, compelling Pakistan to “plead to stop the war.”By showcasing advanced indigenous technologies during the Army’s ongoing trials, the military is reaffirming India’s commitment to self-reliance in defence. The synergy between the Army’s field evaluations and the government's Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative underlines a broader strategic vision to deter future threats with homegrown firepower.","The indian army is carrying out capacity development demonstrations across india.

NEW DELHI: The all-party delegations visiting various countries to expose Pakistan post the Pahalgam attack seem to be becoming a headache for the Congress with senior party leader and former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid's recent remarks backing nullification of Article 370 in 2019 by the Modi government likely to discomfit the Congress. This comes after another delegation member, Shashi Tharoor, faced strong criticism from within the party for his statement that India crossed the line of control (LoC) to conduct surgical strikes ""for the first time"" under the Modi government.While addressing think tanks and academia in Indonesia on Friday, Khurshid said it was unfortunate that Pakistan wants to undo the prosperity that has come to Jammu & Kashmir following the abrogation. Khurshid is part of one of the seven- all party delegations currently touring various countries. The Congress had initially opposed the move to scrap Article 370. The party later nuanced its position and has since been ambivalent on the issue of restoration of the Article which granted J&K special status.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country.But Article 370 was abrogated, it was finally put to an end, because so much time had passed.,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think tanks and academia.""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation. There's an elected government in Kashmir today, and therefore, for people to want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir, it is very unfortunate. It will give a setback to anybody,"" Khurshid further said.While the senior leadership made no comment on Khurshid's remarks, unease within the party has been brewing ever since the government announced the names for the 51 members of the all-party delegations. The Congress had accused the Modi government of ""complete insincerity"" and for playing ""cheap political games"" while highlighting that ""regrettably"" only one of the four names suggested by the Congress leadership has been included. However, the opposition party relented, allowing ""eminent"" party members selected by the government to go with the delegations and make their contribution.The Congress had submitted the names of Anand Sharma, Gaurav Gogoi, Syed Naseer Hussain, and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring.

But as it appears very clearly Rafale fighter aircraft were downed in the four day operations. And when Rahul Gandhiji first pointed it out just as a question to the external affairs minister it was very bizarre and strange that the ruling party functionists at all level accused him of not being patriotic,"" Reddy said.""Now, today, an hour back, the Chief of Defense (CDS), General Anil Chauhan, has confirmed that Rafale aircraft were brought down in the four-day operation. I must also quote here what exactly Air Marshal Bharti, the DG Air Operation, said in the DGMO briefing. He said that losses are normal in a combat. The objectives of the whole operation have been achieved, but all the pilots have come home. We are very happy about that — that the objectives have been achieved and all the pilots have come home.But the fact that the fighter aircraft were down is something that needs to be told. The Government of India should stop denying that, now that the CDS himself has mentioned it and, indirectly, Air Marshal Bharti had mentioned it in his briefing along with the DGMO,"" he added.Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera demanded ""strong answers"" from the Centre on ""strong questions.""""Congress is continuously asking questions like when will the terrorists of Pahalgam attack get caught, who bought RDX in Pulwama, and what were the conditions for ceasefire with Pakistan?... We want strong answers to the strong questions being asked,"" Khera said.""Under whose pressure was the ceasefire done? Whether justice was served to the woman who lost their husbands in Pahalgam...What were the lessons learnt from this (Operation Sindoor), and the CDS also said that it is important to learn lessons from this. Now, at least the BJP will not be able to call those who ask questions anti-national,"" he added.Speaking to Bloomberg on losses during Operation Sindoor, CDS Chahuan rejected Pakistan's claim that 6 jets were shot down but said that during the course of the operation the Indian forces had ""rectified"" some ""tactical mistakes.""“The good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and flew all our jets again, targeting at long range,” Chauhan said.Earlier, Rahul Gandhi and Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy asked the government on how many Rafale aircraft were shot down.""The soldiers of this (Secunderabad ) Cantonment participated in the war. The war planes being manufactured in Telangana upheld respect for our country. Rafale aircraft brought by Narendra Modi were shot down by Pakistan. Narendra Modi should answer how many Rafale aircraft were shot down by Pakistan during the recent war. You give us the account, "" Reddy had said.Rahul had also questioned external affairs minister S Jaishankar on how many Indian aircraft were lost during the operation.""EAM Jaishankar’s silence isn’t just telling — it’s damning. So I’ll ask again: How many Indian aircraft did we lose because Pakistan knew?"" Gandhi posted on X while resharing an earlier post of himself.He added, ""This wasn’t a lapse. It was a crime. And the nation deserves the truth.""On May 17, Rahul had shared an undated video of Jaishankar where the minister is heard saying that India had warned Pakistan before launching strikes on terror infrastructure.""Informing Pakistan at the start of our attack was a crime. EAM has publicly admitted that GOI did it."" He also asked, ""Who authorised it? How many aircraft did our air force lose as a result?"" Gandhi wrote.The ministry of external affairs refuted Rahul's claim, calling it a ""misrepresentation of facts.""The MEA said the government had warned Pakistan in the ""early phase after Operation Sindoor’s commencement"" and not before it began. It clarified that Jaishankar had said, ""We had warned Pakistan at the start, which is clearly the early phase after Op Sindoor’s commencement.""""This is being falsely represented as being before the commencement. This utter misrepresentation of facts is being called out,"" the ministry added.Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7, targeting terror bases in Pakistan in retaliation for the deadly Pahalgam terror attack on April 22.",Congress latches on to chief of defence staff general anil chauhan's remarks in a bid to corner the centre over alleged loss of fighter jets.

NEW DELHI: Colombia is learnt to have withdrawn a statement expressing solidarity with Pakistan over the loss of lives in India's Operation Sindoor that targeted Pakistani terrorists and their training camps on May 7.This was apparently after an intervention by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who led an all-party delegation to the South American country to expose Pakistan's support to cross-border terrorism and its links with the Pahalgam terrorist attack on April 22.Tharoor confirmed the development after a meeting with vice foreign minister Rosa Yolanda Villavicencio. The Indian delegation conveyed a strong message of zero-tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.""I expressed India's view of recent events and voiced disappointment at Colombia's statement on 8 May conveying 'heartfelt condolences' to Pakistan.

India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the UK, France, and Japan to co-develop fighter jet engines, broadening its defense ties beyond the US as it faces mounting security challenges and looks to shore up its indigenous aerospace capabilities, a Bloomberg report said. Senior officials told Bloomberg that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will evaluate these proposals, with the aim to start the project swiftly.The countries in talks-UK’s Rolls-Royce, France’s Safran, and an undisclosed Japanese partner-are all offering technology transfers and potential co-production arrangements, according to people familiar with the matter. Rolls-Royce offered to jointly produce and transfer technology to India during a visit by senior defense ministry officials to the UK in April, while Safran is reportedly open to sharing intellectual property rights, the Bloomberg report said.India’s push to diversify its fighter jet engine partnerships signals a strategic rebalancing in its defense policy. For decades, India’s defense ties leaned heavily on Russian suppliers, with growing partnerships with the US in the past decade. However, India’s decision to explore new partners highlights a shift: an urgent focus on reliability, supply chain security, and technological self-sufficiency amid global uncertainties.Air Chief Marshal A P Singh warned at an industry event on Thursday that delays in acquiring critical weapons “pose a serious challenge to national defense readiness,” adding bluntly, “Not for a single project that I can think of that has been completed on time.” His remarks underscore why India is moving beyond a single-source approach, especially after penalties were imposed on General Electric for delivery delays on engines that power India’s locally-made Tejas light combat jets.India’s military modernization push has been a long time coming, with delays plaguing every step of the way. Singh’s remarks-“once a timeline is given… not a single project that I can think of has been completed on time”-reflect growing impatience within India’s defense establishment.State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) has faced flak for delays in delivering Tejas Mark-1A jets, forcing the government to pivot to private sector involvement to speed things up. The new execution model for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) is a radical shift, designed to harness private innovation and global expertise while ending HAL’s monopoly on fighter production.India’s ambition is to power its twin-engine fifth-generation fighter jets-currently under the AMCA project-with engines co-developed or built domestically in collaboration with global partners. The AMCA program is part of India’s larger vision to modernize its aging, largely Russian-made air force fleet and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers.Defense minister Rajnath Singh has approved a new “execution model” for the AMCA, which for the first time allows private sector firms to bid for the project alongside the HAL. Officials say the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), which is leading the project, will soon issue an expression of interest to domestic and international players.The project’s significance is clear: China’s rapidly advancing J-20 and rumored sixth-generation jets have raised alarm bells in Delhi. Meanwhile, Pakistan is set to acquire at least 40 Chinese J-35A fifth-generation fighters. With only 30 active fighter squadrons against an authorized strength of 42, India needs to catch up-and quickly.Michael Rubin, a South Asia analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, described India’s drive as part of a “broader effort to secure the supply chain for critical defense equipment.” He noted that the “military lesson from Ukraine’s war has been clear: self-sufficiency and reliable partnerships are paramount.”Meanwhile, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh emphasized in his CII Business Summit remarks, “We need to quickly get our act together… while design in India continues to produce results in the near future or maybe later, what is required today is required today.”India’s defense collaborations are moving from traditional vendor relationships to true joint development. Rolls-Royce, for example, offered to share cutting-edge engine technology, while Safran has expressed willingness to co-create intellectual property within India-key for India’s ambitions to be more than just an assembly hub.Japan, too, has signaled openness to deeper defense industrial ties, aligning with India’s vision of a broader Indo-Pacific security network. Defence minister Rajnath Singh held talks in May with his Japanese counterpart, exploring potential collaborations in tank and aero engine development.These moves do not indicate a cooling of India-US ties-joint manufacturing of GE’s F414 engines is still a cornerstone of Indo-US defense cooperation. But delays in that deal have prompted India to cast a wider net, underscoring that while Washington remains a top partner, India wants alternatives to hedge against risks.Indeed, India’s engagement with the UK, France, and Japan is about more than just hardware-it’s about building strategic resilience in the defense sector. A senior official involved in the negotiations said the goal is not to sideline US defense ties but “to ensure we have multiple options, as this is about national security.”India aims to finalise the AMCA’s prototype phase by developing five aircraft before moving to series production.For the first two AMCA squadrons, India will rely on the US-made GE F414 engines. But for the remaining five squadrons-over 100 jets-it wants more powerful 110-kilonewton engines built with technology partners outside the US, according to the officials.India’s broader defense transformation, its AMCA program, and its engagement with multiple global players highlight a fundamental truth: for New Delhi, defense self-reliance and resilient supply chains are no longer optional-they are non-negotiable in a rapidly changing world.","India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the uk, france, and japan to co-develop fighter jet engines.

NEW DELHI: Almost 15% of the operational time during Operation Sindoor was spent countering fake narratives and disinformation, CDS Gen Anil Chauhan said Saturday, describing the four-day hostilities with Pakistan as a ""non-contact and multi-domain"" conflict involving both kinetic and non-kinetic elements that ""exemplifies the future of war"".""During the crisis, India retained full operational clarity and autonomy, regardless of broader geopolitical currents,"" the CDS said during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore as well as in interviews on its sidelines.India did not detect ""any unusual activity"" on the ""operational or tactical depth"" along the 3,488km Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China during this time, although Islamabad is closely allied with Beijing, he added.Moreover, while Pakistan may have leveraged Chinese commercial satellite imagery, the CDS said there is ""no proof of real-time targeting support"" provided by Beijing during Operation Sindoor.This came in the backdrop of there being no signs of de-escalation and de-induction of troops between the Indian and Chinese armies along the LAC as yet after disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last Oct.Noting that almost 80% of the equipment procured by Pakistan over the last few years has been from China, the CDS said some kind of support and maintenance from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) would certainly have been provided during the conflict.""India, by contrast, relied on indigenous systems like Akash, achieving success through effective system networking, integrating both domestic and foreign radars into a cohesive defence structure,"" Gen Chauhan said.Politically, the CDS said, India has drawn a new redline against terrorism and proxy war emanating from Pakistan, and ""hopefully our adversary will learn lessons"" from Operation Sindoor.While cross-border hostilities have ceased with effect from 5 pm on May 10, the Indian government had made it clear it would respond ""precisely and decisively"" should there be any further terror attacks with a Pakistani imprint. ""So that has its own dynamics as far as the armed forces are concerned. It will require us to be prepared 24/7,"" he said.On the massive disinformation campaign, the CDS underlined the need for a dedicated information warfare vertical. India's strategy laid stress on fact-based communication, even at the cost of slower responses. Initially, two women officers served as spokespersons, while the senior military leadership was engaged in operations. Only after May 10, Army, IAF and Navy DGMOs briefed the media, he said.Gen Chauhan also said that cyber operations played a limited role during the conflict. While there were some denial-of-service attacks, India's air-gapped military systems remained secure. While public platforms faced minor disruptions, operational systems were unaffected, he said.","India did not detect ""any unusual activity"" on the 3,488km line of actual control (lac) with china during this time.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan violated the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) through ""unrelenting cross-border terrorism"", India said at an international forum in Tajikistan and justified its action of putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam terrorist attack.The remarks, articulated by junior environment and external affairs minister Kirti Vardhan Singh at the Glaciers' Preservation conference in Dushanbe, came on Friday after Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, at the UN-led global forum, accused India of weaponising water.Strongly condemning Pakistan's attempt to misuse the forum by raising IWT issues, Singh said the treaty's preamble stated that it was concluded in the spirit of goodwill and friendship, and that honouring the treaty in good faith was essential, but the cross-border terrorism from Pakistan interfered with its implementation.""We are appalled at the attempt by Pakistan to misuse the forum and to bring in unwarranted references to issues which do not fall within the purview of the forum. We strongly condemned such an attempt,"" said Singh, addressing the plenary session of the conference.The minister said it was an undeniable fact that there had been fundamental changes in circumstances - technological advancements, demographic changes, climate change and the ongoing threat of cross-border terrorism - since the treaty was signed, which now required a reassessment of its obligations.His remark is in sync with a clear understanding within government quarters about the need to revise the terms of the treaty, which has long been considered loaded against the interests of India.""Pakistan, which itself is in violation of the treaty, should desist from putting the blame of the breach of the treaty on India,"" said Singh.Sharif on Friday said his country would not allow India to cross the red line by holding IWT in abeyance, accusing it of endangering millions.Referring to the theme of the conference, Singh also gave details of what signified the change in circumstances as far as the impact of climate change was concerned and emphasised that the retreat of glaciers represented not only a warning but an immediate reality with far-reaching implications for water security, biodiversity and the livelihoods of billions of people. The minister underscored that the phenomenon was accelerating, with disproportionate impacts on mountain regions such as the Himalayas.","Pakistan violated indus waters treaty (iwt) through ""unrelenting cross-border terrorism"", india said.

'Kamalesan's behaviour was against secular norms of Army'

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has upheld the 2017 termination of an Army officer who refused to participate in regimental weekly religious parades on the grounds that he belonged to the Christian faith.Samuel Kamalesan had challenged his dismissal without pension and gratuity, and sought reinstatement in service. In a May 30 order, a division bench of Justice Navin Chawla and Justice Shalinder Kaur said: ""Our armed forces comprise personnel of all religions, castes, creeds, regions and faiths, whose sole motto is to safeguard the country from external aggressions... They are united by their uniform rather than divided by their religion, caste or region. ""Kamalesan was commissioned in Army in March 2017 as a lieutenant in the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, which comprises three squadrons of Sikh, Jat and Rajput personnel. He was made the troop leader of Squadron B, which comprises Sikh personnel.In his plea, Kamalesan stated that his regiment maintained only a mandir and a gurdwara for its religious needs and parades, and not a sarv dharm sthal, which would serve persons of all faiths.He noted that there was no church on the premises.The bench observed that while regiments in the armed forces may historically bear names associated with religion or region, it does not undermine the secular ethos of the institution or of personnel posted in these regiments.""There are also war cries which, to an outsider, may sound religious in nature; however, they serve a purely motivational function, intended to foster solidarity and unity among the troops. At the same time, the armed forces also give due respect to the religious beliefs of their personnel,"" the bench noted.HC observed that Kamalesan kept his religion above a lawful command from his superior, which was clearly an act of indiscipline. ""While, to a civilian, it may appear harsh and even sound far-fetched, the standard of discipline required for the armed forces is different,"" it said.The bench stated the termination order specifically noted that Kamalesan's undisciplined behaviour was against all secular norms of Indian Army and adversely affected the traditional camaraderie between officers and troops of the regiment.Noting that Army organised several counselling sessions for Kamalesan, the court concluded that the decision of termination was taken after careful consideration of the specific circumstances of the case and potential consequences of different courses of action.",Delhi high court has upheld the 2017 termination of an army officer.

Poll Do you believe India's initial losses in fighter jets during Operation Sindoor were significant? Yes, they were significant No, they were not significant

India-Pak conflict came nowhere close to N-faceoff: CDS

NEW DELHI: India did lose some fighter jets during the strikes on nine terror hubs in Pakistan and POK and the consequent retaliation on May 7, but then changed tactics to inflict major damage on airbases deep across the border before the ceasefire three days later, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan said on Saturday.The CDS did not specify the exact number of jets India lost but asserted that Pakistan's claim of having shot down six IAF aircraft, including three French-origin Rafales, was ""absolutely incorrect"" in separate interviews to Reuters TV and Bloomberg TV on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.Gen Chauhan's admission of India's initial setbacks during Operation Sindoor is the most direct since director -general of air operations Air Marshal A K Bharti on May 11 said losses were part of any combat situation but ""all our pilots are back home"", implying that they had ejected safely after their jets were hit by enemy fire.""What I can say is on May 7, in the initial stages, there were losses,"" Gen Chauhan said.Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan said the conflict with Pakistan from May 7 to May 10, which saw reciprocal air, missile, drone and artillery strikes, never came anywhere close to the point of nuclear conflagration, with both sides “displaying a lot of rationality in their thoughts as well as actions”.In another interview on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, the CDS further said, “The good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and flew all our jets again, targeting at long range.”Gen Chauhan was also dismissive of the effectiveness of Pakistan’s air defence systems of Chinese-origin like HQ-9 missile batteries and radars as well as the use of Turkish-origin Byker Yiha kamikaze drones and Asisguard Songar drones. “They didn’t work. We were able to do precision strikes on heavily air-defended airfields of Pakistan 300km deep inside, with the precision of a metre,” he said.Pakistan was obviously prepared for the initial Indian strikes on May 7, which saw the IAF and Army hit four terror hubs in Pakistan and five in PoK, with fighter-launched missiles and ‘smart’ bombs as well as Kamikaze drones and extended range artillery shells between 1.05 am and 1.30 am.India immediately made it clear that the aim was to hit only terror infrastructure, and no military bases were targeted. Pakistan, however, chose to escalate the situation, which included launching waves of drones and some missiles to target Indian airbases, military assets and civilian areas.The IAF then struck nine Pakistani airbases and at least three radar sites, a few of them close to nuclear facilities as well as command and control structures, with Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 fighters using BrahMos, Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles, among other precision munitions, for the calibrated pinpoint strikes, as was reported by TOI.Gen Chauhan, on his part, declined to comment on President Donald Trump’s claim that the US brokered the ceasefire to help avert a nuclear war but said it was “far-fetched” to suggest either side was close to using nuclear weapons. Pakistan’s chairman of joint chiefs of staff Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza had made the same point a day ago, also on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, but had stressed that a “strategic miscalculation” cannot be ruled out in the future.Gen Chauhan, however, said “people in uniform” were actually the “most rational” since they understand the consequences. “In every step that happened during Operation Sindoor, I found both sides displaying a lot of rationality in their thoughts as well as actions. So, why should we assume that in the nuclear domain, there will be irrationality on someone else’s part,” he said.There is “a lot of space” between the conduct of conventional operations and the nuclear threshold, the CDS said, adding that channels of communication with Pakistan “were always open” to control the situation and there were “more sub-ladders” on the escalation ladder that “can be exploited to settle our issues”.",India did lose some fighter jets during the strikes on nine terror hubs in pakistan and pok and the consequent retaliation on may 7.

She also questioned the IMF's decision to provide loans to Pakistan, suggesting the funds were being misused for anti-India activities.""As we were coming here, we saw some flags, and you all would know what those flags are.

Or is Tharoor being punished simply for daring to challenge the Gandhi camp’s chosen candidate for Congress President?"" he asked.Former external affairs minister Khurshid, who is in one of the 7 all-party delegations to expose Pakistan post Pahalgam terror attack, said that prosperity and normalcy have returned to Jammu and Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called Article 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country. But Article 370 was abrogated and it was finally put to an end,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think tanks and academia.""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation in the election. There's an elected government in Kashmir today, and therefore, for people who want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir,"" he added.This comes after Tharoor faced criticism from party colleagues over his recent remarks on surgical strikes.Tharoor, currently leading a multi-party delegation to countries including Panama and the US, had said that India conducted its first cross-border surgical strike in 2016, a claim seen by many in the party as undermining similar operations during the UPA era.Facing flak from Congress leaders such as Pawan Khera and Udit Raj, Tharoor defended himself in a strongly worded post on X from Panama City, clarifying that his remarks specifically referred to responses to terrorist attacks, not to prior wars or conflicts.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.Tharoor's ""India breached the LoC for the first time during the 2016 surgical strike"" remark prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of denigrating Congress's legacy. ""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed the LoC and the International border?"" Raj questioned.He went so far as to suggest Tharoor be made a ""super spokesperson of the BJP.""Pawan Khera also weighed in, posting a screenshot from Tharoor’s book, where the MP had previously criticised the Modi government for politicising the 2016 strikes while acknowledging that the Congress had authorised several such operations in the past without publicising them.","Bjp it cell chief amit malviya, in a post on x, pointed to khurshid’s remarks during the ongoing multi-party mps delegation tour.

The Chinese military on Thursday declined to comment on the effectiveness of Chinese-made weapons used by Pakistan during its recent military confrontation with India, including the recovery of an unexploded PL-15E missile, China's advanced beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile.The missile you mentioned is an export equipment and has been shown at defence exhibitions at home and abroad many times, Chinese defence ministry spokesperson Sr Col Zhang Xiaogang said in his media briefing responding to media queries.""India and Pakistan are neighbours that cannot be moved away. We hope both sides remain calm and restrained and avoid actions that could escalate tensions,"" Zhang said during the ministry's monthly press briefing. He reiterated China’s position of promoting regional peace and expressed readiness to play a “constructive role” in achieving a lasting ceasefire.The comments come in the wake of India's retaliatory strikes under ""Operation Sindoor"" conducted from May 7 to 10, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The strikes followed the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that left 26 civilians, mostly tourists dead.During Pakistan’s attempted counterattacks on May 8, 9, and 10, remnants of Chinese-made weapon systems were recovered, raising questions over their effectiveness.While the Chinese government has avoided directly addressing these reports, state-run media have shown heightened interest in the India-Pakistan clash, reflecting the depth of military ties between Beijing and Islamabad.According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China supplied 81 per cent of Pakistan’s total arms imports between 2020 and 2024. These included advanced fighter jets, naval vessels, submarines, and missile systems. China and Pakistan also co-produce the JF-17 fighter jet, the backbone of the Pakistan air force.","China declines to comment on effectiveness of chinese-made weapons used by pakistan during its recent military confrontation with india. Comments come in the wake of india's retaliatory strikes under ""operation sindoor"" conducted from may 7 to 10, targeting terror infrastructure in pakistan and pakistan-occupied kashmir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121493824,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1516095,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"'Trying to deflect attention': India refutes Mohammad Yunus’s ‘India destabilising Bangladesh’ claim, says blame-shifting won’t solve problems",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trying-to-deflect-attention-india-refutes-mohammad-yunuss-india-destabilising-bangladesh-claim-says-blame-shifting-wont-solve-problems/articleshow/121490632.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Thursday refuted Bangladesh's chief adviser Mohammad Yunus's claims that New Delhi is “destabilising” his country.In a weekly presser, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that Bangladesh's accusations were an attempt to deflect attention from real issues.""As far as the government there is concerned, the responsibility for law and order and governance issues lies entirely with that government,"" Jaiswal said.""In such a situation, if someone says that external factors or someone else is to blame for the disturbances, it appears that they are trying to deflect attention from the real issue and shift the blame onto others. Such statements do not solve the problem; they seem like an attempt to avoid accountability,"" he added.This comes days after Yunus hinted that India may be behind efforts to “destabilise” Bangladesh.His press secretary quoted him as saying that there were “relentless efforts to destabilise Bangladesh,”both “internally and externally,” thereby leading to a “war-like situation.”Yunus reportedly told Mahmudur Rahman Manna leader of the Bangladeshi political party Nagorik Oikya, that Bangladesh was now in a major crisis due to Indian hegemony.“The Chief Adviser stated that the country is in a major crisis due to Indian hegemony… He started the discussion by saying that we are in a deep crisis. By crisis, he meant a conspiracy by India. He said India does not want to accept this change in our country at all. If they could, they would destroy us in a single day, and they are doing everything necessary to that end. That’s what he said… He believes the entire nation needs to remain united in response,”Manna said.Meanwhile, Jaiswal also said, ""Bangladesh needs to ascertain the will and mandate of the people by holding an inclusive, free, and fair election at an early date.""Earlier, Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam, quoted Yunus saying, ""With the banning of the Awami League, a new war-like situation has emerged — both inside and outside the country. The goal is to prevent our progress, to push the nation toward total collapse, and to drag us back into subjugation. Since the Awami League’s activities were banned, there have been relentless efforts to destabilise the situation. We must protect ourselves from this.”Yunus has claimed he plans to hold the elections between December 2025 and June 30, 2026.“Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus will not stay in power even a day after 30 June 2026,” said Mr Shafiqul Alam.He said Yunus urged everyone at the meeting to be confident that he would not do anything that would put the country in danger.“I felt confident as we all sat together. If I fail to hold a fair election, I will feel guilty,” Yunus was quoted as saying.Alam claimed that various party leaders heard Mr Yunus and reaffirmed their support for the interim government. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), currently the most powerful traditional political force in the country, however, wants the polls to be held by December this year and is uneasy over the continuation of the interim government, which has so far shown no urgency to conduct elections.Political tensions in Bangladesh are rising following Chief Adviser Mohammed Yunus’s veiled criticism of the BNP during his visit to Japan. Yunus remarked that only one political party, not all—is insisting on holding national elections by December. His comment appears to target the BNP, which has been at odds with him over its push for elections within that timeframe.","Mea spokesperson randhir jaiswal said that bangladesh's accusations were an attempt to deflect attention from real issues.
