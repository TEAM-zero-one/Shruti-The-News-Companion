NEW DELIH: Delhi airport on Saturday said that the operations are returning back to normal a day after a glitch in Air Traffic Control flight planning process caused over 300 flight delays.While issuing a advisory, Indira Gandhi International Airport asked the passengers to stay in touch with their airlines for the latest flight update.""The technical issue which affected the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS), that supports the Air Traffic Control flight planning process, is gradually improving,"" the advisory read.""Airline operations at Delhi Airport are returning to normal, and all concerned authorities are working diligently to minimise any inconvenience caused. Passengers are advised to stay in touch with their airlines for the latest flight update,"" it added.The glitch occurred in the AMSS system that prompted the ATC to abandon automation and switch to manual procedures. The slowdown began showing network-wide effects from Thursday afternoon.Air traffic control (ATC) refers to a ground-based service in which controllers manage and guide the movement of aircraft both on the ground and within controlled airspace.As India’s busiest hub, IGIA typically manages about 1,500 aircraft movements a day with peak rates near 60–70 per hour in normal conditions, leaving little slack when automation falters.The problem started at the Automatic Message Switching System, a system responsible for transferring the flight plan data to the air traffic controllers' screens, which crashed. This caused the controllers to process each data manually, significantly delaying the arrival and departure process.The disruption that began to impact the operations since Thursday 3pm, had been occurring since Wednesday evening.","The glitch occurred in the amss system that prompted the atc to abandon automation and switch to manual procedures.

United States President Donald Trump on Thursday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he may travel to India next year as the two countries continue discussions on trade.Speaking to reporters at the White House after announcing a move to reduce the prices of weight loss drugs, Trump said his conversations with PM Modi were progressing smoothly. He also reiterated his personal rapport with the prime minister.""He (PM Modi) largely stopped buying from Russia. And he is a friend of mine, and we speak. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a great man. He is a friend of mine, and we speak and he wants me to go there. We will figure that out, I will go...

India inks $1 billion deal for 113 Tejas engines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-inks-1-billion-deal-for-113-tejas-engines/articleshow/125171071.cms,"HAL Celebrates Maiden Flight of the First Tejas Mk1A Fighter Jet Manufactured at its Nashik Facility

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: India on Friday inked an over $1 billion (Rs 8,900 crore) deal with US major General Electric (GE) for another 113 jet engines to power the much-delayed indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which may to some extent assuage the Trump administration amid the still raging tariff tensions between the two countries.The delivery of the 113 new GE-F404 engines to defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) will take place in the 2027-2032 timeframe, which will add to the ongoing but also delayed supply of 99 such engines ordered under a Rs 5,375 crore deal inked in Aug 2021.With the new engine deal being inked in Bengaluru, HAL chief D K Sunil exuded confidence about the delivery of single-engine Tejas Mark-1A fighters finally beginning to the IAF. “We have 11 Tejas aircraft ready, including four fitted with the new GE engines. We are moving towards certification, and the aim is to deliver the first 10 jets to IAF by the end of March next year,” he told TOI.While the delay in the supply of the initial 99 engines was one of major reasons that hit the Tejas Mark-1A production, the jets have also been hobbled by pending trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles (ASRAAM) and laser-guided bombs as well as their integration with the Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system.The IAF is keeping its fingers crossed. Down to just 29 fighter squadrons (each with 18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised, the force is banking upon the 180 `improved’ fourth-generation Tejas Mark-1A fighters to shore up its depleting numbers.Pakistan already has 25 fighter squadrons and is slated to get at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation Chinese stealth jets in the near future. China, in turn, has more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India.The first contract for 83 Tejas Mark-1A fighters was inked in Feb 2021 for Rs 46,898 crore, while another 97 were ordered for Rs 66,500 crore on Sept 25 this year. Deliveries of the initial 83 jets, however, are yet to begin.“Engines have the most lead time. Keeping that in mind this time, we started negotiations for the 113 new engines with GE even before we inked the 97 Tejas contract with IAF. So, we were able to close this deal so early,” Sunil said.As for the Tejas weapon trials, the HAL chief said, “Results of the data from the trials involving Astra and ASRAAMs are being analysed. Next, during Nov and Dec, we plan to begin the bombing trials. If GE delivers 10 engines in time, we don’t see any reason for delay in handing over 10 aircraft to the IAF by the end of this fiscal.”At present, HAL has four of the initial 99 engines, with the fifth slated to come later this month. As the supply stabilises, GE has promised to deliver 20 engines every year.HAL, in turn, has stated it will scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24-30 per year, with the third production line now fully functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru, apart from private sector supply chains.Parallelly, HAL is negotiating the co-production of the more powerful GE-F414 engines in the 98 Kilonewton thrust class in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion, for the Tejas Mark-2 fighter.“Six rounds of talks on the technical terms and conditions with GE have taken place till now, which will be followed by the commercial negotiations. HAL hopes to conclude all negotiations by March 2026,” a defence ministry official said.","The delivery of 113 new ge-f404 engines to defence psu hindustan aeronautics will take place in the 2027-2032 timeframe.

PM Modi Calls Vande Mataram A ‘Mantra Of Unity And Courage’ As The Song Completes 150 Years

Tagore himself wanted it, hits back Congress, demands apology





‘Anthem of Independence’, mantra for Tagore, Gandhi, Savarkar: PM





NEW DELHI: PM Modi alleged Friday that in 1937 ""significant verses"" of ' Vande Mataram ' were dropped, ""sowing the seeds of the country's Partition"", in what was seen as an attack on Congress in the midst of the Bihar elections and months before Bengal goes to the polls.Launching year-long celebrations to mark 150 years of the national song, where he recited all six stanzas, PM Modi warned that the ""same divisive mindset"" remained a challenge to the nation. ""The spirit of 'Vande Mataram' illuminated the entire nation during the freedom struggle. But unfortunately, in 1937, crucial verses of 'Vande Mataram', a part of its soul, were severed. 'Vande Mataram' was broken, torn into pieces,"" the PM said without naming anyone.""Why was this great mantra of nation-building treated with such injustice? This is crucial for today's generation to understand, because that same divisive thinking remains a challenge for the country even today,"" PM Modi said.Citing a letter from Rabindranath Tagore to Jawaharlal Nehru, Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh claimed ""Gurudev"" had himself sought adoption of two stanzas of 'Vande Mataram' as the national song, and said PM Modi should apologise to the nation for calling the act a ""divisive ideology"".""It is a shameful statement from a man whose lies and distortions have no limits,"" he said.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said his party was the ""proud flagbearer"" of the song, which became the rallying cry for the freedom struggle. He alleged RSS never accepted the song and has stuck to its ""Namaste Sada Vatsale"". He added, ""Sangh Parivar supported the British against Indians, abused the Constitution, burned effigies of Bapu and Babasaheb Ambedkar.""Ramesh said Sabyasachi Bhattacharya's biography of 'Vande Mataram' gives the background to the CWC resolution of Oct 29, 1937, which adopted the song.PM Modi said the ""anthem of Independence"" was the mantra for Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, Savarkar and Aurobindo, and the national flag designed by Bhikaji Cama had 'Vande Mataram' written on it.""In 1896, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore sang 'Vande Mataram' at the (Congress) Calcutta session. The partition of Bengal took place in 1905. This was a dangerous experiment by the British to divide the country. However, 'Vande Mataram' stood as a rock against those plans. There was only one voice on the streets protesting against the partition of Bengal: 'Vande Mataram',"" PM Modi saidReflecting on the relevance of the national song as a guiding force even today and the message it holds, the PM said, ""When the enemy dared to attack India's security and honour through terrorism, the entire world saw that India also knows how to become Durga to destroy terror"". The comments were seen as a reference to Operation Sindoor.Noting that Nov 7 also marked 11 years since the implementation of 'one rank one pension' for defence personnel, PM Modi said, ""When our armed forces crush the nefarious designs of the enemy, when terrorism, Naxalism, and Maoist insurgency are decisively defeated, our security forces are inspired by a single mantra - 'Vande Mataram'.""""For those who consider the nation as a geopolitical entity, the idea of considering the nation as a mother may be surprising. However, India is different. In India, a mother is both a mother and a nurturer. If a child faces a crisis, she is also a destroyer,"" PM said and pointed out how 'Vande Mataram' highlighted the immense power of 'Bharat Ma'.PM Modi said during the colonial era, the British sought to justify their rule by portraying India as inferior and backward. He emphasised that the very first line of 'Vande Mataram' powerfully dismantled this propaganda.Therefore, 'Vande Mataram' was not merely a song of freedom - it also presented to millions of Indians a vision of what a free India could be: the dream of a 'Sujalam Sufalam Bharat', he said.","Pm modi alleges that in 1937 ""significant verses"" of'vande mataram'were dropped, ""sowing the seeds of the country's partition"" congress spokesman jairam ramesh claimed ""gurudev"" had himself sought adoption of two stanzas of 'vande mataram' as the national song.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125174055,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-868889,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday said that no one can blame the pilot-in-command of the Air India Boeing Dreamliner that crashed moments after taking off in Ahmedabad and killing 260 people. The apex court told the 91-year-old father that his son, Sumeet Sabharwal, is not to be blamed and ""you should not carry the burden on yourself. ""The bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, told the 91-year-old father, ""You should not carry burden on yourself. The pilot is not to be blamed for the plane crash. It was an accident. There is no insinuation against him even in the preliminary report.""It also issued a notice to Centre and directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) on the plea of the father of pilot Sumeet Sabharwal.The statement from SC came as it was hearing a petition by Pushkaraj Sabharwal, whose son Sumeet Sabharwal was the pilot-in-command of the Air India flight.The petitions were filed after aircraft accident investigation bureau (AAIB) in its preliminary report mentioned that the fuel supply to both engines was cut off shortly after takeoff.Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who appeared for the pilot's father, highlighted a news article published in Wall Street Journal on Captain Sumeet Sabharwal.""It was nasty reporting only to blame India,"" the bench responded.The apex court read out a paragraph from the article that included the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board's July 12 preliminary report and asserted nowhere it is said that the pilot is to be blamed for the accident. It only refers to the conversation between the two pilots of the plane, the top court said.""The scope of the AAIB investigation is not to blame but to suggest preventive measures to avoid future tragedies. If necessary, we will clarify that the pilot cannot be blamed,"" the bench said.The Supreme Court listed the matter for further hearing on November 10.Last month, the father of Pushkaraj Sabharwal Federation of Indian Pilots filed a petition demanding for a court-monitored inquiry headed by a former apex court judge.The 91-year-old demanded a ""fair, transparent and technically robust"" investigation into the incident.""An incomplete and prejudiced inquiry, without identification of the exact cause of the accident, endangers the lives of future passengers and undermines aviation safety at large, causing a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution,"" his plea said.","Supreme court says no one can blame the pilot-in-command of the air india boeing dreamliner that crashed moments after taking off in ahmedabad.

Donald Trump Calls PM Modi A 'Great Friend', Says India Visit 'Could Be' Next Year Amid Talks

Trade talks with India have progressed, says Trump





NEW YORK/WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has said he may travel to India next year, adding that PM Modi ""wants"" him to visit.""He's a friend of mine, and we speak... He wants me to go there. We will figure that out. I will go. I will have a great trip there with Prime Minister Modi, he's a great man. And I'll be going,"" Trump said Thursday in response to a question. Asked if the visit could happen next year, Trump said, ""It could be, yeah.""India is due to host the next Quad summit with leaders from Australia, Japan, and US, after the 2024 meeting in Delaware. However, dates are yet to be announced. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in New Delhi declined to comment on the visit. ""I will let you know when I have (information),"" Jaiswal said.On trade, Donald Trump claimed progress in talks with India and repeated his assertion that India had reduced oil imports from Russia. ""It's great, going good. He (PM Modi) stopped... Largely, he stopped buying oil from Russia,"" he said.Trump had imposed 25% reciprocal tariffs on India and an additional 25% levy on purchases of Russian oil, taking total levy to 50%.India had called the measures ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable"".Trump also revisited an oft-repeated claim: that he stopped a war between India and Pakistan using tariffs. ""Of the eight wars I ended, five or six were ended because of tariffs,"" he said. ""If you take a look at India and Pakistan, they started to fight - they are two nuclear nations... And I said, 'Listen, if you guys are going to fight, I'm gonna put tariffs on you.' Within 24 hours, I settled the war. If I didn't have tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to settle that war. "" Trump called tariffs a ""great national defence.""On May 10, he announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington. He has since repeated that claim more than 60 times.","Us president donald trump says he may travel to india next year. Pm modi ""wants"" him to visit, says trump.

Klay Thompson apologizes to Megan Thee Stallion after airport mishap



Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson



Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions. Their recent viral moment only serves to extend a genuine connection between two stars from different worlds.Also Read: NBA’s highly anticipated Europe-based league’s potential release date revealed","Klay thompson arrived late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper megan thee stallion, from the airport.

"Gisele Bündchen implied that prioritizing Tom Brady for years took a personal toll: “When you love someone, you don’t put them in jail”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-implied-that-prioritizing-tom-brady-for-years-took-a-personal-toll-when-you-love-someone-you-dont-put-them-in-jail/articleshow/125033119.cms,"Supermodel Gisele Bündchen, in a candid interview, shared insights into her marriage with Tom Brady, describing their split as a 'death and rebirth.' She detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success. Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter.

The shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”She underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed.Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining what a chapter ends and a new one begins.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?",Supermodel gisele bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former nfl quarterback tom brady.

I always told her, ‘I’m going to the NFL,’ and I made it.”Drafted in the second round of the 2024 NFL Draft, Kneeland was praised for his energy, focus, and resilience. His final social media post in January referenced the anime Cyberpunk, symbolizing his desire to live out his late mother’s dream.In fact, just days before his death, on November 3, the 24-year-old defensive end had scored his first NFL touchdown by recovering a blocked punt in a game vs the Arizona Cardinals, that had teammates celebrating his breakout moment.",Dallas cowboys star marshawn kneeland has died. The 24-year-old rookie was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His death came shortly after a brief police pursuit that ended when officers found his vehicle crashed.

Why is Donald Trump choosing this Lions vs Commanders game to step back into the NFL spotlight?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-is-donald-trump-choosing-this-lions-vs-commanders-game-to-step-back-into-the-nfl-spotlight/articleshow/125176426.cms,"Former President Donald Trump's attendance at the Lions vs. Commanders game injects significant political weight into the NFL's Salute to Service weekend. His presence, especially during a government shutdown affecting military participation, amplifies the game's narrative. Trump, who has previously criticized the league, will be a focal point, reminding everyone how sports and politics intertwine, even in a stadium setting.

Donald Trump attending Lions vs Commanders comes during a politically charged salute to service weekend

More coverage on NFL:

Donald Trump attending an NFL game, in person, is something that instantly changes the storylines around a regular season matchup. And whether people approve, dislike, or simply want to ignore the political overlap, it’s impossible to pretend this is a routine Sunday headline. Trump isn’t just another celebrity showing up for a suite photo-op.He’s the US president who once went toe-to-toe with the NFL’s most powerful executives, called the league “weak,” fought against ownership decisions, and even tried to buy a team. Now, he is returning in a moment where the league is celebrating service and the nation is in the middle of a shutdown that has directly affected military involvement.Pat McAfee broke the headline on his show, claiming: “sources are telling me President Donald Trump will be in attendance for the Washington Commanders game this Sunday afternoon.” The expectation is he will sit in Josh Harris’ suite during the halftime Veterans Celebration. The entire Salute to Service week carries a different tone. With the government shutdown restricting Pentagon participation, fans are stepping into a Sunday that feels heavier and now undeniably more political.Earlier this year, Donald Trump attacked the new kickoff rule, saying: “Sissy football is bad for America, and bad for the NFL!” This weekend is his chance to see that rule at eye-level, as Detroit (5-3) faces Washington (3-6) in a game that could swing NFC wild card math.For Washington, it’s a season identity check. For Donald Trump, it’s an optimistic moment. And the NFL knows, whether he offers commentary or stays silent, every camera in that stadium will know where he is sitting.This isn’t simply a president watching football. It is a reminder that, no matter how much fans try to keep sports separate, politics finds its way into the stadium, into the optics, and into every camera shot that follows.","Former president donald trump will attend the lions vs. Commanders game.

Eight Jets, Not Seven, Shot Down: Donald Trump Adds Fresh Twist to His India-Pak Ceasefire Claims





NEW DELHI: Pakistan's duplicity on terrorism was laid bare once again after a minister in prime minister Shehbaz Sharif's government paid a visit to the political wing of Hafiz Saeed ’s banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), the outfit responsible for the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.Talal Chaudhry, minister of state for interior and a close aide of Shehbaz Sharif, visited the Faisalabad office of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML), widely recognised as the political front of Hafiz Saeed's JuD, and held meetings with its leaders on Thursday, news agency PTI reported. The visit, described locally as an attempt to ""build political consensus,"" has sparked outrage for what appears to be official patronage of a proscribed terror-linked organisation.Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, is currently serving time in Lahore jail after multiple convictions in terror-financing cases.In a statement released after the visit, the PMML said Chaudhry and party leaders discussed ""national unity"" and ""political stability,"" underscoring the importance of ""continuity of democratic processes."" The meeting, held under the guise of promoting harmony, effectively showcased how Pakistan’s political establishment continues to normalise banned extremist outfits.This marks the first visit by a federal minister to the PMML office in recent years, further blurring the line between Pakistan's political class and its radical organisations. Earlier, Punjab assembly speaker Malik Ahmad Khan had attended a PMML rally in Kasur, where he openly praised Saeed, another indication of how terror-linked figures are courted by the ruling elite.Observers say the timing is significant. The PMML’s resurgence has coincided with renewed tensions with India, especially after the Pahalgam terror attack, with the group reportedly operating freely ""under government umbrella.""","Talal chaudhry, minister of state for interior, visited the office of the pakistan markazi muslim league (pmml) the pmml is widely recognised as the political front of hafiz saeed's banned jamaat-ud-dawah.

'Vivek must lose': MAGA wants Ramaswamy to lose Ohio election after Mamdani's NYC win; 'Not a race between...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-must-lose-maga-wants-ramaswamy-to-lose-ohio-election-after-mamdanis-nyc-win-not-a-race-between-/articleshow/125163208.cms,"MAGA is now pitching for Vivek Ramaswamy's loss in Ohio election in 2026 out of their spite for India.

Is Acton really ahead of Vivek Ramaswamy now?



MAGA puts India hate ahead of party interest







Based on an outlier poll that claimed that Democrat candidate Amy Acton is ahead of Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy in the Ohio Governor election that will be held in November 2026, a clamour against Ramaswamy rose inside MAGA circles. MAGA supporters demanded a replacement for Vivek and claimed that he must lose, as this is not a Republican vs Democrat battle anymore.The fresh attack on Ramaswamy unfolded in the aftermath of the GOP's crushing defeat in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia polls. Ramaswamy, in his analysis, said that the GOP must shun identity politics if they don't want to lose voters. An Indian-origin politician schooling MAGA on what they should do did not go down well, and now Vivek is the target.""Vivek must lose. If Republicans don't want to lose, they should run someone else right now. This race is not Republican vs Democrat, but a referendum on whether being an American is just a piece of paper. It's a line in the sand,"" one wrote.""I have nothing in common with this guy,"" another wrote out of pure spite for Ramaswamy, reacting to a video of Ramaswamy speaking on Charlie Kirk. ""He dishonestly revises my country’s history and claims that its Founding Fathers would’ve embraced a Hindu Indian that made all his money scamming people in America.It’s an insult to me and my ancestry every time he does it. I don’t want to share anything with “Vivek Ramaswamy,” but I especially don’t want to share a country with him,"" the hate comment read.""On Christmas Eve, 2024, Vivek made a generational fumble with his now infamous X post. Every time he posts, it gets worse for him too. While you couldn't get me to vote for a Democrat, there is absolutely no chance I would ever cast my vote for him. I'd just stay home,"" another wrote, asking Vivek Ramaswamy to drop out of the race.One polling surveying 800 likely voters claimed that they found that Dr Amy Acton is ahead in favorability. These likely voters are teachers, school support workers, library workers, higher education faculty, social workers etc. The polling is a year away but Dr Acton reacted positively to the recent finding. ""Get in, we're winning in '26,"" Acton wrote.All other polls so far said Vivek is ahead and he has won major endorsements as well.In wishing for Vivek Ramaswamy's loss, MAGA is placing its hatred for India ahead of the Republican Party's interest. Unlike New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani who was born in Uganda and became a naturalized citizen of the US, Vivek Ramaswamy is a US citizen by birth as he was born in Ohio.","Maga is pitching for vivek ramaswamy's loss in ohio election in 2026 out of their spite for india.

‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED





WASHINGTON: From the MAGA perspective, millionaires are fleeing Manhattan, cops are quitting NYPD en masse, and the Big Apple is rotting faster than strawberries on a summer day because New York City has fallen…to Communists, Islamists and immigrants. Memes show the Statue of Liberty under a burka or niqab, hammer and sickle projected on the Empire State Building, and public transport overcrowded with immigrants in native grab among other bleak outcomes of Zohran Mamdani victory in the mayoral election. “Imagine North Korea… with a dash of Sharia,” goes one rightwing parody of Frank Sinatra’s song New York, New York.Liberals and progressives meanwhile are cockahoop with delight at the resurgence of the left, reflected in a raft of jokes, some of them self-deprecating, on late-night shows. ""Today Democrats are walking around with a spring in their step like a divorced mom in her 40s whose new haircut just got her carded at two different bars,” riffed Seth Meyers, whose late-night gig on NBC beams from the Rockefeller Center in NYC. Trump’s bete-nore Jimmy Kimmel, whose late-night show on ABC broadcasts from across the country in Hollywood, Los Angeles, joked that President’s social media post after the rout (“...ANDSO IT BEGINS!) “was either a response to Mamdani winning the mayoral race, or he just sat down on the toilet.”Toilet humor aside, the more serious commentariat agreed on one thing: Mamdani’s rise from an obscure local legislator who polled less than 1 percent when he began his campaign to a monumental victory with over 50 percent vote has electrified American politics. Although he is not eligible to run for the White House (he is not born in the U.S., a Constitutional requirement to run for President), many are already seeing him, or at least his policy prescriptions, as a challenge, and perhaps even an opportunity, for MAGA supreme Donald Trump to define him in fearful terms.“His smile is disarming, but his ideas are armed to the teeth,” the Wall Street Journal said of Mamdani’s policies, suggesting that his victory could inspire more leftist candidates to challenge moderate Democrats, allowing President Trump to drive home his message of radical left lunatics taking over America. Trump himself is said to have acknowledged that Mamdani is a “talented politician” and “slick talker,” according to one report.So despite railing against the “communist lunatic,” Trump is now showing signs of learning something from the electoral setback. Pilloried for his tone-deaf bragging about his new White House ballroom and his hosting a Gatsby-themed party at his Mar-o-Lago estate at a time of government shutdown, the President briefly embraced the term “affordability” – which Mamdani flogged during his campaign – while discussing a deal to reduce the price of certain drugs like anti-obesity medications at a White House event on Thursday. Taunted from the left that “Affordability is Trump's word of the week,” the President shrank from the word later, saying “I don’t want to hear about affordability” and insisting that inflation is under control and prices are coming down under him. “My cost are lower than the Democrats on everything, especially oil and gas! So the Democrats “affordability” issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!” he posted on Truth Social.But even hard-core MAGA lawmakers previously seen as rabid race-baiters are starting to put affordability issues ahead of immigrant demonisation that has been their go-to issue. “Grocery prices remain high. Energy prices are high. My electricity bills are higher…So, affordability is a problem,” Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has sounded increasingly critical of Trump, in recent weeks, said in a TV interview on Thursday, adding that she is worried about her children’s generation because “they’re having a very hard time. ”Even millionaires and billionaires, said to be decamping NYC in the face of the ""socialist surge"" seemed to acknowledge Mamdani has raised important issues. ""Congrats on the win. Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do,"" Bill Ackman, billionaire hedge fund manager and NewYorker who contributed $ 1 million to Mamdani's opponent Andrew Cuomo, posted soon after Mamdani's win.","Zohran mamdani won the nyc mayoral election with over 50 percent of the vote. He is not eligible to run for the white house (he is not born in the u.s.) but many see him as a challenge, and perhaps even an opportunity, for maga supreme donald trump to define him.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125167007,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-891801,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Pakistan Fires Into Afghanistan, Breaks Ceasefire Amid Turkey Peace Talks: Taliban Confirms





Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said the dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan has effectively collapsed, noting that the process has “entered an indefinite phase” after negotiators failed to narrow key differences, reported Dawn News.Officials and security sources earlier confirmed there was no breakthrough.“The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” a senior security source told the Pakistani daily, indicating the discussions had reached an impasse.Asif said the government had concluded that ""the talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan are over,"" signalling the end of the latest round of diplomatic engagement aimed at easing cross-border tensions.The collapse in talks follows weeks of fighting along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border that has resulted in civilian and military casualties on both sides, marking the deadliest escalation in years.The violence began after an October 9 explosion in Kabul and another in Paktika the same day which Afghan government blamed on Pakistan. Pakistani officials have neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the blasts, and neither side issued details on casualties from the initial incidents.Since October 9, repeated shelling and exchanges of fire have killed dozens, though casualty figures differ widely. Earlier this week, Pakistan's military spokesman Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif said more than 200 Afghan soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed when Pakistani forces targeted militant hideouts and army positions in Afghanistan after coming under attack.Afghan government spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid rejected that assessment, saying only nine Afghan soldiers had been killed and 22 wounded, while claiming that up to 45 civilians had been killed and 102 wounded in the strikes. Mujahid also claimed 58 Pakistani soldiers had been killed, a figure Pakistan disputed, stating that 23 of its soldiers had died in the fighting.The worsening violence prompted Qatar to mediate, bringing the two sides to Doha for talks that led to a ceasefire on October19.Two additional rounds were later held in Istanbul. While both sides say the ceasefire technically remains in place, sporadic attacks have continued.An Afghan official told news agency AP on Friday that overnight clashes in the border region killed four Afghan civilians and wounded five others.The two countries share a 2,611-kilometre border known as the Durand Line. Established in 1893, the line cuts through the traditional homeland of the Pashtun people, Afghanistan’s largest ethnic group and the core base of the Afghan Taliban.Although the frontier is internationally recognised as Pakistan’s border, Afghanistan has long refused to accept it.",Pakistani defence minister khawaja asif said the dialogue between pakistan and afghanistan has effectively collapsed.
