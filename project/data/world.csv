NEW DELHI: “When I reached International Space Station for the first time, the first thing I did was to locate India (on Earth), from where my father belonged to, and Slovenia, from where my mother belonged,” said Indian American astronaut Sunita Williams in Delhi on Tuesday — the only female astronaut who has set the world record for most cumulative spacewalking time by a woman with a total of 62 hours and 6 minutes. During her lifetime, Williams went to space three times as a Nasa astronaut, totalling 608 days in space.Williams’s father, Deepak Pandya, is from Jhulasan village in Gujarat’s Mehsana district, where he was born before migrating to the US. Her mother, Ursuline Bonnie Pandya, is of Slovenian-American descent. Nicknamed ‘Suni’ or ‘Soncka’ in Slovenia, Williams was born in the US state of Ohio and has an elder brother, Jay Thomas, and a sister, Dina Ann.“Though I spent nine months in space during my latest trip to the ISS, I missed meeting Group Captain Subhanshu Shukla who reached the station just after I left,” Williams said during an interactive session, 'Eyes on the Stars, Feet on the Ground' at American Center here.During her last trip to space before hanging her astronaut suit, Williams went to ISS in 2024 for a scheduled 8-day space trip but had to spend 9 months on ISS as the Boeing Starliner that took her to ISS malfunctioned and had to return empty-handed.Later, SpaceX's Dragon brought Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore back to Earth on March 18, 2025, with the duo ending up spending 286 days in space. India’s Group Capt Shukla went to space as part of the Axiom mission on June 25, 2025.Williams faced several health issues after returning to Earth after remaining in zero gravity for a long time. However, the 60-year-old was seen in high spirits in Delhi on Tuesday, guiding and inspiring Indian students to join the space sector. To cheer her at the Delhi event was the mother of another Indian-American astronaut, Kalpana Chawla, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia crash in 2003. Williams, wearing a trademark deep blue space overalls and sporting a pair of space-themed canvas shoes, stepped off the dais and reached out to Chawla’s mother, Sanyogita Chawla, 90, who was sitting in the front row, and gave her a warm hug.When asked about the renewed global interest in the Moon, Williams acknowledged the existence of a modern “space race”. “I think there is a space race going on. We want to get back to the moon sustainably and start the conversation about rules of engagement— how we actually work together with other countries. We want to do this in a productive, democratic way, much like Antarctica,” she said.Williams asserted that the horizon of space exploration is rapidly expanding beyond traditional boundaries, stating that the commercialisation of space is creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation. “Commercialisation of space is great. It means there are opportunities for people to work in so many different companies— not only rockets and spacecraft, but parts of space, experiments, satellites, and 3D printing of metals,” she said.“In my childhood, I never dreamt of becoming an astronaut. We used to watch Star Trek on black & white TV. After I did my schooling and graduated, my brother pushed me to join the military and, thereafter, I became a Navy officer,” she said. Williams had logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 types of aircraft during her career in the US Navy before donning the astronaut suit. While flying aircraft as a Navy commander, I then wished that I should go to the Moon. From then on, I pursued the career of an astronaut,” Williams recalled.“When I reached the ISS, I was craving for Indian food. I was delighted to see that somebody sent me an Indian dish (in the food cargo) though others were making faces. I was glad to also receive 3D printed models of my dogs on ISS.” In Nasa circles, Williams was called the ‘samosa astronaut’, as she liked carrying samosas to space.An athlete since childhood, Williams wanted to participate in a marathon. “So, my sister told me, ‘I will run on your behalf on the ground and you run in space. So that is how I decided to run a marathon in space,” she revealed. Williams ran the Boston Marathon in space in 2007 after qualifying by running the Houston Marathon in 2006, marking the first time a marathon was completed in orbit. She ran on a treadmill aboard the ISS, finishing in 4 hours and 24 minutes while her sister and others ran on Earth.Recalling her most difficult space job, Williams said she went for a spacewalk after the Starliner faced a technical issue and returned to Earth and the Dragon spacecraft was docking at ISS. “While I was replacing a defected reflector, I had ensured that the Dragon capsule was not damaged with my steel helmet. So, I did the job of replacing the reflector by bending my head on one side for over 1.5 hours. After I returned to my space cabin, I faced neck cramps the whole time. ”Williams, during her extended 9-month stay on ISS, conducted along with her crew over 150 scientific experiments and technological demonstrations, accumulating more than 900 hours of research across various fields like space gardening, microgravity biology, and water recovery systems.The Nasa astronaut said the perception about life on Earth changes when people go to space. “I am married and I argue with my husband like other couples do. But after reaching space (seeing the vast expanse of universe), I used to wonder why we argue (on minor issues) at all,” she said, adding, “The first thing I ate after returning to Earth was the bread my husband baked for me.”","Indian american astronaut sunita williams spoke in delhi on tuesday.

NEW DELHI: US ambassador Sergio Gor said Tuesday he would ensure that senior US officials regularly travel to India, as both sides work to take the partnership to the next level in cooperation.

According to the US embassy, while in India, Daines pursued interests of Trump administration as well as the people of Montana, including urging favourable pulse crop provisions in any future trade agreements between the US and India.“Montana is the top producer of pulse crops in the US, and India is the top consumer in the world. Senator Daines sought acceleration of the active and ongoing talks towards concluding a fair and reciprocal bilateral trade deal,” said the embassy in a statement.“I came to India to reaffirm our countries’ shared values and strategic ties and to advocate on behalf of Montana’s pulse crop farmers.

The Shanti Act (Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India) was cleared last month to repeal Atomic Energy Act, 1962 and Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010.Kwatra pointed out that the act opened up the Indian nuclear sector energy to private and foreign investment. It also aligns India’s liability regime with international norms while protecting its non-proliferation commitments, regulatory autonomy and sovereign oversight. “With maturity, India is joining the widely adopted template of global operative norms in the civil nuclear energy sector,’’ Kwatra wrote.According to him, India’s energy demand will grow faster than any major economy’s over the next decade. Its nuclear capacity now is around nine gigawatts, with a target of 100 gigawatts by 2047.Kwatra listed many potential collaborations that are now viable.

New Delhi: The Election Commission Tuesday told Supreme Court the Constitution empowers it to devise means, methods and procedure for preparation of voter lists for a free and fair election and asserted that its order for a pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls has a legislative character.Continuing with the debate over the constitutional validity of SIR, proceedings for which began in Nov last year, EC counsel senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi SC had ruled that Article 324 of the Constitution enables the commission to devise ways and means where the statute, rules and regulations are silent on SIR. ""The nature of the revisional exercise is left to the discretion of the commission and would depend upon the prevalent circumstances.

""Both were colonists who were averse to giving rights to Indians even though Britain was a democracy,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: Amid recent criticism that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has not been doing enough on the ground, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday said that working in national interest is a collective responsibility of society and not of any one individual or organisation, stressing that the Sangh is playing its role alongside others committed to nation-building.Interacting with prominent citizens from the Saurashtra–Kutch region at Seva Bharati Bhavan as part of the RSS centenary year outreach, Bhagwat said the Sangh stands with everyone engaged in selfless national service, irrespective of formal association with the organisation.Reflecting on the RSS’s journey, Bhagwat said the organisation’s growth despite decades of opposition, neglect and restrictions was rooted in the support of Hindu society. Anyone working honestly in the national interest, he said, is regarded by the Sangh as its own volunteer.Addressing perceptions about the organisation’s functioning, Bhagwat rejected the idea that the RSS operates through “remote control”. He said its work is driven by values, affection and mutual trust. Volunteers are shaped through shakhas to think independently and take decisions guided by conscience in the larger social interest.Explaining Hindutva, Bhagwat described it as a way of life rather than a narrow identity, adding that India’s constitutional philosophy reflects the same civilisational ethos. India’s inclusive character, he said, is why people of all faiths and traditions find space here.On globalisation, Bhagwat said India’s idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam offers a moral alternative to market-driven models. “While some see the world as a marketplace, India views it as one family,” he said.During an interaction, he described Gen Z as sincere and open-minded, calling for better engagement with young people. He also cautioned against allowing social media to dominate thinking, stressing that it must remain a tool used responsibly in national interest.The programme was attended by RSS functionaries and professionals from industry, healthcare, law and academia.","Rss chief mohan bhagwat calls for hindu unity, says india will lead world in 20–30 years.

You announce the president first and then say there will be an election, and then there is no election,” Pawan Khera, head of the Congress’ media and publicity department, said at a press conference.Attacking the CEC, Khera added with a quip, “Gyanesh Kumar wants to resign in protest; he has no role, he can’t even influence, he can’t even manipulate anything.”Commenting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remark that Nitin Nabin is his “boss” in party matters, Khera remarked, “They can keep playing games among themselves. Sometimes Mohan Bhagwat becomes someone’s boss, sometimes Modi becomes someone’s boss. We don’t care about the tears of seers and are playing boss-boss.”“Is Bigg Boss game being played here? What is this? The biggest boss of Hindu dharma is shedding tears and they are busy playing Bigg Boss,” he added.Khera’s comments referred to the controversy over authorities allegedly preventing Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati from taking a holy dip in the Ganga at Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. Mohan Bhagwat is the head of the RSS, the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Another Congress leader, Lok Sabha MP Manickam Tagore, pointed out that the grand old party conducted a leadership contest between Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor in 2022, in which Kharge won and succeeded Sonia Gandhi as the Congress’ national president.“We hold elections in the Congress. Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor were candidates, and voting took place. This is called democracy. PM Modi and [Union Home Minister] Amit Shah want to take over the role of all the workers… BJP is an authoritative party and moving towards dictatorship… Even the RSS is stunned to see this,” Tagore said.Congress ally Rashtriya Janata Dal also criticised the BJP, with RJD MP Manoj Jha saying, ""Don’t call it an election... an election is only called when there are two or more choices. Nevertheless, he has become the national president, and I extend my best wishes to him.""Nitin Nabin, born in the same year (1980) as the saffron party, is the youngest and 12th president of the saffron party. Hailing from Bihar, he was appointed the national working president in December last year, signaling his eventual elevation to the top post.He succeeds Union health minister JP Nadda, who had been the BJP chief since January 2020, following Amit Shah.","Nitin nabin formally took charge as the bjp's new national president on tuesday.

PM Modi Says Parties Shielding Illegal Immigrants Must Be Exposed, Calls It a National Threat

'

Urban Naxalism

a major challenge'

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday doubled down on his government's ambition to detect and deport illegal immigrants in the country, while strongly criticising the political parties ""protecting or covering up for illegal immigrants for the sake of vote bank politics"".Addressing the party workers after the new BJP chief Nitin Nabin took charge, PM Modi said: ""Illegal immigrants pose a great threat to the country's security. Identifying them and sending them back to their countries is absolutely essential.""""No country in the world accepts illegal immigrants. India, too, cannot allow illegal immigrants to steal the rights of our poor and our youth. Illegal immigrants pose a great threat to the country's security. Identifying them and sending them back to their countries is absolutely essential,"" PM Modi said during an address at the BJP headquarters.Without naming any political party, but in an apparent attack on Trinamool Congress (TMC), which rules the poll-bound West Bengal, PM Modi lashed out at parties ""covering up for illegal immigrants"" and said: ""We must expose them to the public"".PM Modi also said the world doesn't question the ""wealthiest and most powerful countries"" when they crack down on illegal immigrants.""Even the world's wealthiest and most powerful countries are investigating and apprehending illegal immigrants within their borders and deporting them. And the world doesn't question them, asking, ""Why are you deporting these illegal immigrants? You were waving the flag of democracy. You were acting like the rulers of the world, so why are you doing this?"" PM Modi said.Stepping up his offensive against the BJP's nemesis, PM Modi said another major challenge is ""urban Naxalism"", the scope of which he said has become ""international"".The Prime Minister said that the ""urban Naxals isolated the BJP"" and treated the party like ""untouchables throughout the country,"" adding he said urban Naxals are ""continuously working to harm India"".""Another major challenge is urban Naxalism. The scope of urban Naxalism is becoming international. If they tweet something positive about Modi even once or twice a year, or say something positive on TV, or write something positive in a newspaper, some journalists humiliate them so much that they are hounded and made untouchable. They are silenced so that they can never speak again. This is the method of urban Naxalism,"" PM Modi said.The PM further said: ""For years, they isolated the BJP and treated us like untouchables throughout the country. Now the country is understanding the actions of these urban Naxals. Urban Naxals are continuously working to harm India.""","Prime minister narendra modi says illegal immigrants pose a great threat to the country's security.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” aimed at overseeing post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza. The initiative forms a key pillar of Trump’s broader Gaza ceasefire plan and is now beginning to take shape, with the White House confirming the involvement of several global figures.In a letter, shared by US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, Trump framed the initiative as part of a sweeping 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” to end the Gaza conflict, first announced in September last year. He said the plan had since received wide backing from global leaders across the Arab world, Israel and Europe, and was formally endorsed by the United Nations Security Council through Resolution 2803 in November.Trump wrote that the moment had come to “turn dreams into reality”, with the centrepiece of the initiative being the creation of an international “Board of Peace”. The body, Trump said, would be established as a new international organisation and transitional governing administration, tasked with delivering what he called “lasting peace” through governance reform, reconstruction and economic investment.""Now it is time to turn all of these Dreams into reality. At the heart of the Plan is The Board of Peace, the most impressive and consequential Board ever assembled, which will be established as a new International Organization and Transitional Governing Administration,"" the letter read.The invitation places India among a growing list of countries and global figures being courted by Washington as Trump seeks to operationalise a 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” aimed at ending the Gaza conflict and managing the transition to long-term stability.According to the White House, the Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition. Chaired by Trump himself, it is expected to focus on governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment mobilisation and large-scale funding.Confirmed members include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special negotiator Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, billionaire financier Marc Rowan, World Bank president Ajay Banga and senior National Security Council aide Robert Gabriel. More appointments are expected in the coming weeks.Alongside the main board, two additional structures have been announced. The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), led by Palestinian technocrat Dr Ali Sha’ath, will oversee the restoration of public services, rebuilding of civil institutions and stabilisation of daily life in Gaza. The White House has described this as a key step in implementing Phase Two of Trump’s plan.A separate Gaza Executive Board will support governance delivery on the ground and includes international diplomats and regional figures from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the UAE, as well as UN humanitarian coordinator Sigrid Kaag.Apart from India several countries including Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Albania and Cyprus have been invited. Pakistan has also been invited to join the Board of Peace. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the prime minister received the invitation, adding that Pakistan will continue supporting international efforts for peace and security in Gaza.As per a report by Bloomberg, a draft charter proposes of the Trump-led “Board of Peace,” allegedly requires nations to contribute $1 billion to secure long-term membership. The draft gives Trump authority over membership, renewals, and final approval of decisions.",Us president donald trump has invited india to be part of a proposed international “board of peace” the board of peace is aimed at overseeing post-war governance and reconstruction in gaza.

Silver prices surged to a record high on Monday, crossing the Rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time. Gold also rebounded sharply, recovering from last week’s losses.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures jumped Rs 13,553, or 4.71%, to a record Rs 3,01,315 per kg. Gold futures rose nearly Rs 3,000, or over 2%, to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 1,45,500 per 10 grams.The rally in precious metals followed renewed geopolitical concerns after US President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on several European countries over Greenland.In response, the European Union is preparing retaliatory tariffs worth €93 billion, as reported by ET, citing a Financial Times report. The renewed tensions revived demand for safe-haven assets after easing US-Iran frictions last week had briefly reduced investor interest in gold and silver.Global prices also touched record levels. Spot gold rose 1.7% to $4,673 an ounce, while silver climbed around 3% to about $94 per troy ounce, marking fresh highs in international markets. Silver futures in the overseas market jumped more than 6% to a record $94.35 per ounce.Analysts said that silver has been outperforming gold in recent sessions, supported by strong industrial demand and favourable global trends. Some also pointed to currency movements as an additional factor. The dollar index rose for a third straight week, ending at 99.20, while the USD-INR January 28 futures contract closed higher at 90.8325 on the NSE.Gold, which does not offer interest income, typically benefits when interest rates are low. However, expectations that rate cuts may be delayed have raised the opportunity cost of holding the metal. Despite this, heightened geopolitical risks have continued to support prices.Market participants said precious metals could remain volatile in the near term, with prices driven by developments on the geopolitical front, currency movements and shifts in investor risk appetite.","Silver prices surged to a record high on monday, crossing the rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs, as intensifying geopolitical risks and shifting US monetary expectations fuelled strong safe-haven demand through the week. Escalating unrest in Iran, where over 500 people were reportedly killed, renewed US threats of military action and tariffs on countries trading with Iran, and the arrest of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro injected both short- and long-term uncertainty into global markets, supporting central bank buying and investor inflows into precious metals. With this President Trump has also levied tariffs on major EU nations with a threat to increase the same after June 1st if the deal to buy Greenland does not go through.Gold prices marked a low of around ₹141,000 and reversed sharply from there, as mentioned previously till prices are sustaining above ₹138,000 momentum for prices will remain on higher side. On lower end, immediate support remains at ₹143,000 and ₹140,000.Bollinger bands which were flat have expanded with prices on the higher side showcasing a positive run through expectations. This surge is more convincing as prices are rising along with a surge in volumes showing the buyers strength. The target of ₹145,000 is achieved, however any closing above the same could take the prices higher towards ₹148,000 and ₹152,000 from a medium to long term perspective.Despite a relatively firm dollar, Gold and Silver continued to mark record highs as geopolitical tensions, weak economic data, policy uncertainty, and easing inflation sustained safe-haven appeal. Focus this week will be on US inflation, GDP and speech from President Trump which could keep the volatility along with updates on uncertainties mentioned above.","Gold and silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs.

John Harbaugh's New York Giants era puts family and future in focus



John Harbaugh's New York Giants era has officially begun, and the first signs point to a cultural reset inside one of football’s most scrutinized franchises. The moment the deal became final on January 17, the Giants signaled that stability and experience now sit at the center of their long-term vision. After years of inconsistency, New York turned to a coach known for structure, accountability, and sustained relevance in the NFL.John Harbaugh arrives with context that matters. His exit from Baltimore followed an 8–9 finish in 2025, the Ravens’ first missed postseason since 2021. Injuries to Lamar Jackson shaped that outcome, but after 18 seasons, both sides understood change was inevitable. For the Giants, it was not about chasing trends. It was about leadership, credibility, and setting a tone that can last beyond one season.The hiring did more than reshape the Giants’ coaching staff. It pushed the Harbaugh family into a new spotlight. Fans quickly turned their attention to his inner circle, including his daughter Alison, a former Notre Dame lacrosse player who later continued her academic and athletic journey at the University of South Florida.Just as visible is Ingrid Harbaugh, whose steady presence has followed John through every chapter of his coaching life.Their story began years ago at Western Michigan. John was working as a graduate assistant under his father Jack, while Ingrid held a role in the baseball office as a student. What started on campus became a lifelong partnership that has now landed in New York. That connection felt front and center when the Giants shared a video of the couple together, welcoming them with the caption, ""Coach Harbaugh has arrived"".Beyond the emotion lies real football intrigue. John Harbaugh steps into a roster filled with young talent and unfinished promise. Jaxson Dart represents a quarterback project with upside. Malik Nabers, if healthy, gives the offense a dynamic edge. The appeal of this move rests in Harbaugh’s ability to develop players while demanding discipline from day one.Expectations will rise quickly. The Giants are not asking for miracles. They are asking for direction. With Harbaugh, they finally believe they have it.",John harbaugh's new york giants era has officially begun.

Trump’s Greenland 'Military Takeover’ Ignites MAGA? Johnson Says 'Not Appropriate' As NATO Panics





Has MAGA found a new meaning? Protesters in Denmark have taken to the streets to oppose US President Donald Trump ’s rigid push to acquire the Arctic island -- Greenland, wearing red baseball caps spoofing his iconic MAGA hats -- this time emblazoned with the slogan “Make America Go Away.”MAGA hats have become symbolic of Danish and Greenlandic defiance against the US president’s threat to seize the Arctic territory.The caps reading “Make America Go Away,” a parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, have gained popularity on social media and at public protests, including a weekend demonstration in freezing weather in the Danish capital.Several European countries have also joined Denmark and Greenland in pushing back against Donald Trump, stressing the need to defend the Arctic and warning that threats to Greenland undermine Western security.Protesters, however, have been far more blunt.“I want to show my support to Greenland and also show that I don’t like the president of the United States,” ABC news quoted a 76-year-old Copenhagen resident Lars Hermansen, who wore one of the red caps at a protest on Saturday.The mock hats were created by Jesper Rabe Tonnesen, a vintage clothing store owner in Copenhagen. At first, the idea failed, with early batches last year drawing little interest.That changed after the Trump administration recently stepped up its rhetoric over Greenland. Since then, the caps have appeared widely at protests and online.“When a delegation from America went up to Greenland, we started to realize this probably wasn’t a joke -- it’s not reality TV, it’s actually reality,” said Tonnesen, 58. “So I said, OK, what can I do? Can I communicate in a funny way with a good message and unite the Danes to show that Danish people support the people of Greenland?”Demand quickly jumped from almost nothing to selling out within a single weekend. Tonnesen said he has now ordered “several thousand” more.The first version of the cap designed by Tonnesen carried a wordplay slogan, “Nu det NUUK!” a twist on the Danish phrase “Nu det nok,” meaning “Now it’s enough,” replacing the word with Nuuk, Greenland’s small capital.At Saturday’s rally, protesters waved red-and-white Danish and Greenlandic flags and held handmade signs mocking US claims over the territory, which is slightly larger than Saudi Arabia","Protesters in denmark have taken to the streets to oppose us president donald trump’s push to acquire greenland.

The dip came due to strong dollar demand from metal importers and continuous foreign fund outflows.The currency was dragged down by strong dollar demand from metal importers and continued foreign fund outflows weighed on investor sentiment. Forex traders said that rising geopolitical uncertainty, along with renewed US expansionary signals, has increased risk aversion and kept emerging market currencies under pressure. They also pointed to a sluggish domestic stock market, further dampened by the ongoing exit of foreign capital.Rupee has remained close to historic lows in recent weeks. Last year on December 16, it touched an all-time intra-day low of 91.14 and recorded its weakest closing level of 90.93. Last Friday, the rupee had plunged 44 paise to 90.78 after losing 17 paise over the preceding two sessions.Global cues also remained mixed as the dollar weakened and crude prices edged lower.
