HYDERABAD: The bus accident early on Monday in Saudi Arabia left 45 people dead, with only one passenger - Shoeb - surviving the crash.""I spoke to Shoeb.

Pakistani Rapper Talha Anjum sparked a social media storm this weekend after he waved, and draped himself in the Indian flag during a performance in Nepal.According to The Dawn, Anjum was performing Kaun Talha, his diss track aimed at Indian rapper Naezy, when someone from the crowd threw the Indian tricolour towards him.The video shared widely on social media shows him grabbing the tricolour, waving it before wrapping it around himself.After facing criticism on social media, Anjum responded, saying, “My heart has no place for hate. My art has no borders. If my raising an Indian flag sparks controversy, so be it. I’ll do it again. I will never care about the media, the war-mongering governments, and their propaganda. Urdu rap is and will always be borderless.”As the video went viral, Anjum faced a wave of criticism on social media. One Pakistani user wrote, “Talha Anjum waving the Indian flag at a Nepal concert while India blocks his Spotify and likely his YouTube is a sad reminder of our own national decay. No pride, no dignity… just performers desperate for applause from those who shut them out.”Indian users, on the other hand, praised the gesture.

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

High votes, low wins: The big contradiction



Contest more seats



NDA's math clicked, MGB's math cracked



JD(U)'s comeback flipped the story



BJP grows bigger than ever



MGB slipped because allies didn't deliver



Jan Suraaj and AIMIM changed the margins



So, what really happened?



NEW DELHI: Bihar's 2025 election results threw up a story full of surprises. Tejashwi Yadav 's RJD turned out to be the party with highest vote share in the state, yet it ended up with one of its lowest seat tallies ever. On the other hand, the NDA kept the power with landslide victory, clinching over 200 seats in 243-member assembly, keeping the Mahagathbandhan far from the seat of government.RJD recorded a vote share of around 23 per cent, just few decimals down from 2020, when it got 23.11 and emerged as the largest party with 75 seats. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats. So the striking question is: how can a party get the most votes, yet finish with so few seats?The answer lies in how votes were spread. RJD seems to have polled a large number of second-position votes. It remained popular, but not with enough concentrated support in winning zones.In simple terms, RJD got votes but not victories. This is no surprise in India's electoral mechanism of 'First Past the Post System.'RJD contested 143 seats this time, the highest among all parties across both the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan. In the 2020 assembly elections, the Lalu-led party had fielded one more candidate, contesting 144 seats.Contesting widely helped the party accumulate more total votes, contributing to the highest vote share. But losing candidates also add to vote share totals.Meanwhile, BJP and JD(U) fought on 101 seats each. They contested fewer seats but converted their votes efficiently into victories. That is why their seat count shot up, even with a lower vote share than RJD.A major turning point this election was the return of Chirag Paswan's LJP (Ram Vilas) to the NDA camp. In 2020, the LJP had hurt the NDA's chances by cutting into its votes, but this time its support helped strengthen the alliance instead of splitting it.In the previous election, LJP (RV) was unhappy with the NDA's seat-sharing formula in Bihar. Even though it was part of the alliance at the Centre, Chirag Paswan chose to go solo in the state and contested 134 seats, which ended up damaging NDA numbers—especially Nitish Kumar 's JD(U).Similarly, Upendra Kushwaha's party contested 104 seats independently in 2020, further cutting into votes that could have benefitted the NDA.This time, with both LJP (RV) and Kushwaha’s RLM back in the NDA fold, the alliance appeared far more united, organised, and prepared. The result: NDA outperformed the Mahagathbandhan by a wide margin.One of the biggest turnarounds happened in seats where RJD and JD(U) were in direct fight.In 2020, RJD dominated these contests. But in 2025, JD(U) turned the tables and won 50 out of 59, almost wiping out RJD in head-to-head battles. JD(U)'s vote share also jumped from 15.39 percent in 2020 to 19.25 percent this time, helping it win 85 seats from the tally of 43 last time.RJD simply failed to see this drastic reversal coming.The BJP crossed 89 seats, its highest tally ever in Bihar, marking a historic leap for a party that once had almost no grassroots base or ideological legacy in the state. By staying aligned for years with ""sushasan babu"" and steadily expanding its footprint, the saffron party has now grown into Bihar's biggest political force.With this mandate, the BJP has effectively redrawn the political map of Bihar. It now sits at the centre of power, holding the strongest bargaining position in the alliance. For years, Nitish Kumar played the ""big brother"" to the BJP, but for the second election in a row, the BJP has outperformed the JD(U), this time doing so with its best-ever numbers.The shift isn't just about arithmetic -- it's psychological. For decades, Bihar's political story revolved around the Lalu–Nitish axis. Today, it revolves around the BJP’s weight, influence and negotiating power.Unlike NDA, the Mahagathbandhan struggled with coordination and clarity.Congress contested on 61 seats as compared to last time's 70, but won only six. The Left parties, which surprised everyone in 2020, could not repeat their performance either. Seat-sharing disagreements and confusing ""friendly fights"" meant votes did not transfer smoothly within the alliance.The opposition was visible but not united -- and unity decides tight contests.Prashant Kishor's much-talked about startup -- Jan Suraaj did not open its account, but it made a strategic dent, in at least 35 seats, its vote share was higher than the winning margin, influencing outcomes for both alliances.Meanwhile, AIMIM repeated its strong Seemanchal performance, winning five seats with 1.85 percent of votes and signalling a shift in political thinking among Muslim voters.The traditional Muslim–Yadav (MY) vote base of the RJD showed signs of fragmentation, with Muslim voters exploring alternative platforms in multiple constituencies, leading to a near wipeout of the Mahagathbandhan in Seemanchal, barring one Congress candidate who scraped through.Mayawati's BSP also registered a presence, securing 1.62% of the total vote share with one seat in the west.RJD did not lose popularity, but lost positional advantage. It remained a strong choice for many voters but could not cross the finishing line often enough. High vote share created the impression of strength, but seats reflect actual power -- and that is where NDA towered above everyone.","Rjd recorded a vote share of around 23 per cent, just few decimals down from 2020, when it got 23.11 and emerged as the largest party with 75 seats.

Shashi Tharoor Praises PM Modi Again, Sparks Fresh Congress Rift After Attending Goenka Lecture

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday praised PM Narendra Modi’s Ramnath Goenka Lecture, saying it combined economic themes with a cultural message and encouraged the country to stay “restless for progress”. He further expressed gratitude to be a part of the audience.Tharoor said that he attended the lecture at the Indian Express event on Monday, noting that the Prime Minister spoke of India’s “constructive impatience” for development and made a strong case for adopting a post-colonial mindset.“The PM emphasised that India is no longer just an ‘emerging market’ but an ‘emerging model’ for the world”, pointing to the economy’s resilience.He added that PM Modi addressed criticism of being constantly in “election mode”, saying he was instead in “emotional mode” to address people’s problems.Tharoor also highlighted the Prime Minister’s focus on dismantling what he called Macaulay’s 200-year legacy of “slave mentality”, saying a significant portion of the speech revolved around that theme. “PM Modi appealed for a 10-year national mission to restore pride in India’s heritage, languages, and knowledge systems.I wish he had also acknowledged how Ramnath Goenka had used English to raise a voice for Indian nationalism!” he said.He reiterated that “on the whole, the PM's address served as both an economic outlook and a cultural call to action, urging the nation to be restless for progress”, adding that he was “glad to have been in the audience despite battling a bad cold and cough!”Tharoor’s comments come against the backdrop of recent controversies surrounding his own statements. Days earlier, he stirred debate by arguing that reducing senior BJP leader LK Advani’s decades of service to a single episode, “however significant”, was unfair, remarks that invited internal discomfort within the Congress.The party later clarified that Tharoor speaks for himself, saying his continued presence in the CWC reflects the organisation’s democratic character.He had also recently remarked that dynastic politics across parties poses a “grave threat” to Indian democracy and suggested it was time for India to trade “dynasty for meritocracy”. The BJP seized on those comments, calling them a “very insightful piece” on the state of political culture in the country.",Senior congress leader shashi tharoor praised pm narendra modi’s ramnath goenka lecture.

New Delhi: India’s celebrated astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla said with a smile on Tuesday that the “homework given by PM Narendra Modi 'pura hua hai, chal raha hai, aur badta hi ja raha hai' (has been completed, yet it is still going on as the scope of the homework is increasing by the day)”. On a serious note, Shux said that results of the seven Isro-devised microgravity experiments conducted by him on ISS during his 18-day stay there are being analysed after samples of his work have come back to Earth in batches, and that learnings from his ISS mission are being used for Gaganyaan planning.Speaking on the sidelines of India International Space Conclave organised by Indian Space Association (ISpA) here, Shukla told TOI, “For me, bigger learning from the seven experiments has been how to conduct these tests in space because it is easy to conduct such experiments on Earth, but difficult to do them there. Whatever experience I gained on ISS, we have made a template of that. We are now comparing what we were doing earlier (in Gaganyaan programme) with what is happening now, to identify the gaps. ”On progress on India’s spaceflight mission, Shux said, “Gaganyaan is a developmental programme — training and development are happening together. As per my knowledge, Gaganyaan-G1 (uncrewed mission) will be conducted early next year and Gaganyaan-G2 (uncrewed mission with humanoid Vyommitra) will be in early 2027.”Shux said he has shared his ISS experiences with three other Indian astronaut-candidates — Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair, Ajit Krishnan and Angad Pratap — as they have been training together. Shux, who is also a seasoned IAF test pilot, said, “As part of our training, I have to go back to flying fighter jets, which I will do in December.”He said, “When you cross the boundary of space (Karman line), you are given a number, and I was No. 634, which is not a top number to remember”. But when I came back, kids told me: “We didn't know that there was an ISS in space before you went. We cared because you were there.”Urging the youth to dream big, he added, “We are in the golden age as far as space exploration is concerned. I want all youngsters to be focused and contribute to the space sector actively. Every boy or girl of India who dreams of becoming an astronaut can realise their dream in today's India. We have established extremely ambitious goals — Bharatiya Antariksh Station by 2035, human landing on Moon by 2040 and Viksit Bharat by 2047 — but for us to achieve that, all of us have to be active participants. Sky was never the limit. Not for me, not for you and not for Bharat.”Space minister Jitendra Singh, who was the chief guest at the conference, said, “Space reforms in the last five years have been a turning point. Earlier, our space economy was dispersed and was not even considered a part of the economy. Today, the Indian space economy is worth $8 billion and the pace at which it is moving, the projection is that in the next 10 years, it will go up to $44-45 billion. In times to come, space is going to be an important contributor to the growth of India's economy as we move up the ranks. ”",Shubhanshu shukla said results of the seven microgravity experiments conducted by him on iss during his 18-day stay are being analysed.

NEW DELHI: India slipped 13 ranks to figure at the 23rd position in the latest Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), which was released by environmental think tank Germanwatch on the sidelines of the ongoing UN climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil on Tuesday.It’s the biggest fall of India on the CCPI ranking in the recent past even as it remained in the top 10 high-performing countries for six years in a row till 2024. India, which ranked 31st in 2014, entered the top 10 list for the first time in 2019.The annual CCPI uses a standardised framework to compare the climate performance of 63 countries and the EU, which put together, account for over 90% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The performance of countries is assessed in four categories — GHG emission, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy.India, in fact, is one of the biggest fallers in this year’s ranking despite performing well above global average in terms of increasing its renewable energy footprints. The country has, for instance, made substantial progress, achieving nearly 14% share of renewables in its total energy mix from 2015 to 2023.Besides, its non-fossil sources of energy now account for more than half of the country’s total electric power installed capacity (currently around 256 GW).What’s the reason behind India’s fall in the ranking? One of the authors of CCPI, Jan Burck of Germanwatch, attributed the decline to a combination of factors, including the steadily rising trend of the country’s GHG emissions in recent years. India, in fact, ranked last in terms of emission trends.“At the same time, energy consumption is increasing. India has also lost many places in climate policy rankings mainly due to its lack of a plan to phase out coal or even a concrete phase-out date. If India will reduce the building of new coal power plants and continue the promising trend for renewables, the country can achieve a much better ranking again next year,” said Burck.Denmark, the UK and Morocco took the lead in this year’s CCPI as fourth, fifth and sixth rankers in the list with the top three ranks remaining vacant like the previous years in absence of a perfect score to any country.China (54th), Russia (64th), the US (65th) and Saudi Arabia (67th) are the G20’s worst-performing countries, receiving an overall very low score. With Iran at 66th rank, Russia, the US and Saudi Arabia are the four last-placed countries in CCPI.Published annually by the Germanwatch, the NewClimate Institute and the Climate Action Network since 2005, the CCPI tracks countries’ efforts to combat climate change. It serves as an independent tool that tracks the climate mitigation performance of 63 countries and the EU. “It aims to enhance transparency in international climate politics and enables comparison of climate mitigation efforts and progress made by individual countries,” said the CCPI 2026 report.","India slipped 13 ranks to figure at the 23rd position in the latest climate change performance index.

So far, more than 100 countries, including the US, China and the EU, have already submitted their NDCs with many stakeholders, asking India to deliver an ambitious mitigation target.“Developed countries must reach ‘net zero’ far earlier than current target dates, fulfil their obligations under Article 9.1 (providing climate finance by developed countries to assist developing ones) of the Paris Agreement, and deliver new, additional, and concessional climate finance estimated to be in trillions of dollars,” said environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday while delivering India’s national statement at the ongoing UN climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil.Yadav articulated India’s consistent position where it wants wealthy nations to be ambitious in their climate action as they, being the historical emitters, are responsible for climate change whereas the countries in the Global South suffer more.His remarks on “trillions of dollars” reflect the Global South’s demand to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 by rich nations to assist developing countries instead of what was agreed ($300 billion annually by 2035) amid serious concerns during COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, last year.Asking rich nations to deliver, the minister, on the occasion, flagged how India has already demonstrated successfully that development and environmental stewardship can advance in tandem, and fulfilled all its climate action promises much in advance.“India’s emission intensity has declined by over 36% since 2005. India’s non-fossil fuel based energy capacity, currently around 256 GW, accounts for more than half of its total electric installed capacity — an NDC target achieved five years ahead of the schedule,” said Yadav.He also noted that the country’s newly launched Nuclear Mission and Green Hydrogen Mission further accelerate its journey towards ‘net zero’ by 2070.The Brazilian Presidency, meanwhile, on Tuesday released a new set of draft texts — Mutirao Mobilization/Belem Package — incorporating all suggestions on the negotiation table on contentious issues, including finance, mitigation and unilateral trade measures, and an overall COP30 decision mechanism. Negotiators will try to thrash out their differences over the next three days to come out with a final decision of COP30.","India will submit its new climate action pledges to the un body next month.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that genuine emotional commitment to public welfare is what helps in winning elections.Speaking at the sixth Ramnath Goenka Lecture in New Delhi, he said that leaders must work with genuine emotion rather than remain in a permanent political campaign. PM Modi dismissed claims that he and the BJP operate in a “24×7 election mode”, saying the party wins because it is driven by an emotional commitment to public welfare. “After winning the Bihar election, some people, including some Modi admirers in the media, have once again started saying that the BJP and Modi always remain in a 24×7 election mode. I believe that to win elections, being in election mode is not necessary; what is necessary is to remain in an emotional mode 24×7,” he said.He added that governance must be rooted in empathy and urgency. “When there is restlessness within the heart then not even a single minute should be wasted and one must keep working to reduce the hardships of the poor, to provide employment to the poor, to give healthcare to the poor, to fulfil the aspirations of the middle class. One should work tirelessly.” According to him, such emotion ensures that “the results become visible on the day of the elections,” a lesson he said was evident in the Bihar mandate.PM Modi said that the Bihar results underline the public’s rising expectations. “The results of the Bihar elections have once again taught a lesson on the high aspirations and ambitions of the people of India. The people of India today trust those political parties who have good intentions and fulfil the aspirations of the people and prioritise development,” he said.He urged states to treat development as their primary responsibility and engage in healthy competition. “I strongly encourage state governments to foster a spirit of healthy competition by attracting investments and promoting growth. Organising competitions to improve the ease of doing business could be a great step in this direction,” PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also framed India’s economic resilience as a source of global optimism. “Our GDP is growing at nearly seven per cent despite global instabilities; India is not just an emerging market but an emerging model too,” he said, adding that “India is restless to become a developed nation”.",Pm modi says leaders must work with genuine emotion rather than remain in a permanent political campaign.

President Donald Trump has confirmed that the United States will sell advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, marking a major policy shift that has raised alarm among Israeli and Indian officials over regional security implications.“I will say that we will be doing that, we’ll be selling F-35s,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on November 17, one day before hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House. The announcement came despite concerns from Pentagon intelligence officials and key regional allies about the potential consequences of the sale.Saudi Arabia has requested to purchase as many as 48 F-35 fighters in what would be a multibillion-dollar deal with Lockheed Martin, making it the first Arab military to acquire the fifth-generation stealth aircraft.Until now, Israel has been the only country in the Middle East operating F-35s.The Israeli Defense Forces delivered a formal position paper to political leadership on November 17 objecting to the sale, warning it could undermine Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region. The document stated that Israel’s air superiority depends on maintaining exclusive access to fifth-generation stealth aircraft, with long-range covert operations relying on that exclusivity.“Israel’s air superiority in the Middle East depends on maintaining exclusive access to fifth-generation stealth aircraft,” according to the IDF assessment obtained by Ynet. The military also warned that Saudi F-35 purchases could occupy production lines and delay Israeli orders for additional squadrons.Under US law, Israel is guaranteed weapons needed to maintain its qualitative military edge over Arab nations, though Trump administration officials have indicated they can provide assurances without specifying what additional capabilities would be offered to Israel.A Defense Intelligence Agency report warned that China could acquire the F-35's advanced technology if the sale proceeds, citing Beijing's defense ties with Riyadh. China is now Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner, and the two countries conducted joint naval exercises in recent years.India has also expressed concern about the potential transfer, particularly given a recent defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan stipulating that an attack on either nation would be considered an attack on both. Analysts warn the deal could enable Pakistan to gain indirect access to advanced US military equipment through Saudi Arabia.One Indian defense analyst told media outlets, “A Saudi F-35 fleet would strengthen Saudi Arabia’s air dominance, compelling regional rivals and other near-neighbors, including India, to reassess air and missile defense postures”.

Gisele Bündchen's shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that the marriage was “like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was, “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before, “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.”Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Gisele Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it, “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams..”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Gisele Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining when a chapter ends, a new one begins..Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?","Supermodel gisele bündchen, in an old candid interview, shared insights into her marriage with tom brady, describing their split as a 'death and rebirth' she detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125033119,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60856,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Operation Mocking-Plane: The Charlie Kirk Plot Thickens. | Candace Ep 266

Candace Owens says flight signals, rental cars, and timing raise new questions





Candace Owens says she has many serious questions about the killing of Charlie Kirk. She talked about this again in her podcast on November 17. She said she found new details that made her even more worried. Candace Owens said two Egyptian planes showed up many times near Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s wife. She said these planes showed up at places where Erika Kirk was 73 times from 2022 to September 2025. She said she found these numbers after checking the work of a woman online, whom she called a “pregnant mommy sleuth.”She said the woman was right. Candace Owens said 29 of those overlaps also had Charlie Kirk in the same place. She said both planes were also at the Provo airport on September 10, the day Charlie Kirk was shot near Utah Valley University. She said one plane took off, and the other stayed on the ground with its power on.Candace Owens said the two planes were the yellow SU-BTT and the blue SU-BND. She said these flights mostly matched Erika Kirk’s movements inside five U.S. states but also matched her travel overseas. She said one plane at the Provo airport sent out a signal from 9:05 a.m.until 10:34 a.m. on September 10. She said its signal turned on again 17 minutes after Charlie Kirk was shot at 12:40 p.m., and stayed on until 1:29 p.m.Candace Owens said she believed this signal came from data on ADS-B Exchange. She also said the flight was “transponding” at Duncan Aviation. She said she saw claims online from MJTruthUltra that Duncan Aviation gave rental cars to people linked to the Egyptian planes. She even read out car details and asked if anyone had seen them.Candace Owens said the plane could have been doing normal maintenance. She also said the plane might have tools to make private satellite calls. She said these ideas were only guesses.Also Read: Candace Owens sparks chaos with new Britney Spears trafficking claim as Lou Taylor link trends after Kim Kardashian video Candace Owens said Turning Point USA knew about these flights and should explain why the planes were there.

Swifties think Taylor Swift’s ‘The Fate of Ophelia’ is aimed directly at Joe Alwyn

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift’s latest track, “The Fate of Ophelia,” is sparking a fresh wave of online theories and Swifties are convinced she’s weaving real-life heartbreak into a Shakespeare-inspired narrative. The song, featured on The Life of a Showgirl, flips the tragic Ophelia storyline into one of revival, and fans immediately tie the imagery to Taylor’s emotional journey after her six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn.With lyrics that feel pointed, timing that feels deliberate, and symbolism that leans heavily into themes of rescue, rebirth, and choosing a new path, this track has become the latest cultural flashpoint as listeners dissect what Taylor may be saying between the lines.Swifties didn’t waste time pulling receipts. The lyric “dug me out of my grave” is being hailed as a symbolic nod to Travis, the man fans believe helped lift Taylor from the emotional stagnation she experienced during her long romance with Joe. And the shade? It’s there in sharpened form.When Taylor Swift sings, “All that time, I sat alone in my tower / You were just honing your powers,” listeners immediately connected it to Joe’s famously private lifestyle and his recent role in a new Hamlet film.The overlap between Ophelia, Hamlet, and Taylor’s real-life history is simply too on-the-nose for fans to ignore.What makes the moment hit even harder is how openly Swift seems to be reclaiming her narrative. Rather than turning her breakup into bitterness, she’s framing it as the final chapter of a darker era, one that allowed her to rise stronger and choose a love that fits her world rather than hides from it. Joe Alwyn, for his part, has subtly signaled he’s over the conversation, reportedly saying he’s moved on and suggesting fans do the same. But Swifties aren’t budging.For Swift, this track feels like a mic-drop: a poetic goodbye to the past, a wink at the present, and a reminder that she’ll always turn heartbreak into art, even if some people would prefer not to be name-checked in her mythology..","Taylor swift's new song, 'the fate of ophelia,' is fueling fan theories linking it to her breakup with joe alwyn.

Teammates who joined Kris Boyd during the night out

Investigation developments and reactions from the Jets

New York Jets cornerback Kris Boyd, 29, is still in the hospital after being shot early Sunday in Manhattan. He had received a gunshot wound after an evening out with some teammates and was taken to Bellevue Hospital.Boyd had been at a hotspot restaurant and lounge on West 38th Street overnight, where he had been mingling with two fellow Jets players, before clashes inside the venue turned into an open-air beat-down, officials said.Boyd was out that night with Jamien Sherwood, a rookie linebacker, and Irvin Charles, a wide receiver on the practice squad, sources said. The trio had been wining and dining at a high-end Asian-fusion hot spot popular with athletes and celebrities. But the mood soured when another group within the venue began ""deriding the players' outfits and appearance,"" investigators said, and the Jets crowd walked out.When they went outside about 2 a.m., there was a fight involving the two groups. In the minutes before the first blow, two shots, one of which hit Boyd in the stomach, were captured on surveillance video, reportedly tens of minutes before Boyd was shot. Neither Sherwood nor Charles suffered injuries, and investigators say there's no indication either student was armed or firing a weapon.Also Read: 'Unemployed' Tyreek Hill’s ACL tear led to a shocking decision no one anticipated Detectives are still reviewing video, and an arrest is yet to be made in this case, according to the New York Police Department.

Investigators believe the firearm assailant might have been within one of them.The restaurant stated that the incident occurred after closing time and outside its premises, adding that it is fully cooperating with the ongoing investigation. The Jets organisation issued a brief statement acknowledging the situation and declining further comment. Several players offered public messages of support, urging fans to keep Boyd in their thoughts as he recovers.Boyd, who has been on injured reserve this season due to a shoulder issue, joined the Jets in March 2025 following stops with the Minnesota Vikings, Arizona Cardinals and Houston Texans. Police continue to interview witnesses as they work to identify the shooter and piece together the events leading to the confrontation.","Kris boyd, 29, is still in the hospital after being shot early sunday in manhattan.

A rebel with leverage





The Republican Party once tried to wash Donald Trump off like tear gas. In the days after 6 January 2021, senior Republicans queued up to say the quiet thing out loud. Kevin McCarthy, then House Minority Leader, admitted that the president “bears responsibility” for the mob that stormed Congress. Mitch McConnell went further and said there was “no question, none” that Trump was “practically and morally responsible” for provoking the events of that day and guilty of a “disgraceful dereliction of duty.” For a brief, trembling moment, it looked as if the party had decided to choose constitutional memory over cult loyalty. There was talk of a post-Trump Republican reboot, the donor class flirted with other names, and the commentariat rehearsed phrases like “turning the page” and “moving on.”Three years, one impeachment, and two Trump primary victories later, that righteous fury has mostly evaporated. Trump retook control of the party, the never-Trump Republicans either retired, lost primaries, or fell silent, and a long line of senators and governors who once hinted that “it is time for new leadership” found themselves back on stage, red cap in hand, mumbling that the base had spoken. Whatever the leadership might have wished on 7 January, rank-and-file Republican voters never actually left him.Inside that carefully reconstructed amnesia, Thomas Massie stands out as an oddity.He is not Liz Cheney, who converted resistance to Trump into a full-time vocation. He is not Mitt Romney, who gave a valedictory speech and left Washington shaking his head. Massie is something more awkward and therefore more interesting: a Republican who will accept Trump’s endorsement and still publicly defy him; a man who will pose for a Christmas card with his family holding assault rifles and then, in the next breath, launch a bureaucratic insurgency to force the president into a corner on one of the darkest scandals of the age.This is the story of how a solar-powered engineer from rural Kentucky became the Republican who took on Donald Trump from the right.Thomas Massie arrived in Congress in 2012 on the libertarian edge of the Tea Party wave. An MIT-trained engineer, he had made money on a tech invention, moved back home, and built the kind of off-grid, solar-powered house that makes lifestyle influencers on YouTube sound less committed than they think they are.From the start, Massie was a problem for leadership. He hated omnibus bills, continuing resolutions, and anything that looked like a blank cheque for the executive branch. He voted against foreign wars, against warrantless surveillance, against the steady fattening of the national security state. If there was a red button marked “no,” he pressed it so often that colleagues joked it must have an impression of his thumb.The defining early clash with Trump came in March 2020. As Covid ripped through the United States, Congress rushed through a two-trillion-dollar rescue package. Everyone wanted plausible deniability. The quickest way to get it was to wave the bill through on a voice vote, which would allow members to say they “supported relief” without ever having to defend a specific line item.Massie refused to play along. He insisted that a bill of that size should not pass without a recorded vote. He drove back to Washington, forced members to show up during a pandemic, and demanded that everyone either own their support or go on record as opposing it.Trump reacted like a man whose cinematic finale had been interrupted by an electrician switching the lights on. On social media, he called Massie a “third rate Grandstander,” urged Republicans to “throw Massie out of the Republican Party,” and accused him of risking lives “for publicity.” He wanted him primaried, shamed, erased.Massie survived. His deeply conservative district in northern Kentucky sent him back anyway. The attempted excommunication failed, and something important crystallised around his persona. He was now, in the eyes of both admirers and critics, the man who would walk into the chamber, ignore the party mood and the television cameras, and press the red button if he thought the state was spending money it did not have or grabbing power it did not deserve.That stubbornness would later bring him back into Trump’s orbit. After initially backing Ron DeSantis in the 2024 primaries, Massie eventually endorsed Trump, lured in part by Trump’s public promise to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the imprisoned creator of the Silk Road marketplace.For Massie, who sees criminal-justice overreach and the drug war as core civil liberties questions, this was not just a favour to the base, it was a test of principle: if you are serious about reform, prove it on a case that actually offends the security establishment.To MAGA world, that reconciliation looked like a neat narrative arc. The rebel had been brought back into the fold. To Massie, it was something more transactional: he had not converted to Trumpism so much as found a specific, leverageable overlap between his libertarian priorities and Trump’s appetite for spectacle.Part of what makes Massie such an awkward fit in Trump’s Republican Party is that his weirdness pre-dates Trump.He is an engineer who treats politics like a badly designed machine. He sees institutions as systems with inputs and outputs, failure modes and unintended consequences. He is as likely to talk about load-bearing debt and feedback loops as he is to mention Ronald Reagan.Culturally, he is steeped in gun rights and rural identity. He pushes out family Christmas photos where everyone is holding a firearm, and he is an enthusiastic supporter of the Second Amendment. Ideologically, he is far closer to the old Ron Paul libertarians than to the television-friendly culture warriors who now dominate the House Republican conference. He hates surveillance programmes, opposes foreign interventions, and rants about the Federal Reserve.That combination makes him simultaneously a mascot and a migraine for leadership. He cannot be easily bribed with a subcommittee gavel and cannot be easily threatened by taking one away. His brand with his voters is precisely that he is willing to be the awkward “no” in a sea of party discipline.Which is why, when the Epstein story curved back into Washington in 2025, it was almost inevitable that Massie would end up at the centre of the storm.By late 2025, the Epstein saga was less a story and more a pressure cooker. Years after Jeffrey Epstein died in a jail cell, thousands of pages of material from his estate were slowly being prised open by courts and congressional committees. Newly released emails and records pulled in an ever growing cast of presidents, bankers, academics and celebrities.For Trump’s base, Epstein had become the symbol that held together half a decade of suspicion about “the elites.” If there was ever going to be proof that the global establishment operated by a different set of rules, it would be here, in the flight logs, correspondence and investigative files surrounding a convicted sex offender with a Rolodex that ran from Palm Beach to Buckingham Palace.The expectation was simple: if anyone was going to blow the whole thing open, it would be Trump. He had campaigned on draining the swamp, promised to take on the “deep state,” and spent years hinting that he knew things about Epstein and his friends that would shock the world.In office, the tune changed. Trump’s Justice Department did not throw open the files. His allies began warning that there were sensitive national-security considerations. What had been sold as a crusade for transparency began to look more like a negotiated truce among people who frequented the same elite social circles.Massie decided to test how serious anyone really was about full disclosure.He co-sponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a bill that would require the Justice Department to make public virtually all files, communications and investigative materials related to Epstein and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell within a fixed deadline. The bill allowed redactions to protect victims and ongoing investigations, but explicitly ruled out the usual bureaucratic escape hatches of “embarrassment” or “reputational harm” as reasons to keep things hidden.Under normal circumstances, such a bill would never see daylight. House leadership, sensitive to both Trump and the donor class, would simply keep it bottled up in committee. No messy floor debate, no awkward roll call.Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna decided to bypass that blockade. They reached for one of the dustiest tools in the House rulebook: the discharge petition. If you can persuade 218 members of the House to sign a petition demanding a vote on a bill that leadership has buried, you can drag it, kicking and screaming, onto the floor.For weeks, the petition crawled. Members liked the sound of transparency in theory, but they could see the minefield ahead. Signing meant risking the wrath of the White House, the Speaker, and whichever powerful people might find their names or emails in the files.The turning point came when a newly sworn-in Democrat from Arizona walked off the ceremonial platform, added her name, and took the tally to 218. At that moment, the mechanism locked. No one could withdraw their signature. The bill was now guaranteed a vote, no matter how loudly leadership complained.In the background, the pressure campaign went into overdrive. Republican signatories were leaned on by party leaders and White House officials. One was summoned to the Situation Room to hear about the supposed security implications of forcing disclosure.Massie did not blink.Publicly, Trump railed against what he portrayed as a partisan effort. Privately, he and his team urged Republican members to avoid the bill. For all his talk about Epstein and Democrats, he clearly did not want a law on the books that would yank open the government’s entire Epstein archive on a fixed timetable.Massie’s explanation for that gap was blunt. He has repeatedly said he does not believe the files contain a hidden smoking gun implicating Trump in Epstein’s crimes. He insists his effort is not about incriminating the president. What he does believe is that Trump is running cover for his own social world, for friends and donors in Palm Beach and New York who crossed paths with Epstein and would rather not see every email and calendar entry held up for inspection.In other words, the issue is not criminal liability, it is embarrassment.This is what makes Massie’s challenge so dangerous for Trump. He is not attacking from the centre, like Cheney, or from an institutional altar, like Romney. He is attacking from inside the original promise of Trumpism.If the whole point of sending Trump to Washington was to end the two-tiered justice system, then refusing to release the Epstein files looks less like strategic caution and more like outright betrayal. The people who most care about Epstein are the same people who still wear “drain the swamp” T-shirts to rallies. Telling them that the files must remain secret to protect unnamed interests is not going to land well.Massie has leaned into that contradiction. He points out that many Trump voters genuinely believed they were dispatching him to the capital to smash exactly this kind of elite omertà. Watching the White House try to kill a transparency bill on Epstein, he suggests, feels to them like discovering that the avenger in your favourite thriller has quietly joined the board of the villain’s company.The remarkable thing is that Massie has done all of this without doing the usual break-up ritual. He has not branded himself a “Never Trumper.” He has not gone on an endless cable-news tour. He still shares parts of Trump’s agenda, still cares about immigration, trade, and the culture war, still wants Ross Ulbricht freed.What he refuses to do is treat Trump as someone whose instincts automatically trump his own principles.In the short term, the Epstein Files Transparency Act remains a long shot. Even if it passes the House, it has to survive the Senate. Even if it clears both chambers, the president would be under enormous pressure to veto it. Yet, as with so many fights in Washington, the immediate legislative outcome is only part of the story. The other part is the signal it sends.Massie has just demonstrated that there is still a narrow procedural route to force uncomfortable issues onto the floor, even when both the Speaker and the President are opposed. He has shown that a Republican can survive the combined glare of leadership, the White House and the party media ecosystem, so long as he is willing to endure the noise and trusts his own voters more than the donor WhatsApp groups.He openly says that if he can get something done with the Speaker against him, the President against him, the Vice President against him and the FBI director against him, then he can use that same leverage on his older obsessions: cutting spending, shrinking the deficit, dragging the national debt back onto the agenda.In a party that has spent the past four years painstakingly teaching itself to forget what it said on 7 January 2021, Thomas Massie has chosen a different vocation. He is not particularly interested in rewriting the Trump chapter. He is interested in enforcing the terms that were written on the cover. If you promised to drain the swamp, he will hold you to that. If you swore there would be one law for everyone, he will send your allies a discharge petition and dare them to sign.In an age of very loud Republicans who ultimately fold at the hint of presidential disapproval, Massie has become something rarer and more unsettling: a quiet rebel who does his best work when the cameras are not looking, and who treats Donald Trump not as a king, but as one more politician to be brought to heel by the rules he once claimed to love.","Thomas massie arrived in congress in 2012 on the libertarian edge of the tea party wave.

'Painful': MBS on Khashoggi



Trump says Saudi crown prince 'incredible in terms of human rights'







US President Donald Trump snapped at a reporter in the Oval Office after being pressed on his family’s business interests and the Saudi Crown Prince’s alleged role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, sharply retorting, “You don’t have to embarrass our guest. ”The exchange came as Trump rolled out one of the most lavish welcomes of his presidency for the de facto Saudi ruler, who is making his first trip to Washington since Khashoggi’s killing in 2018.The confrontation unfolded in the Oval Office after a reporter pressed Trump on whether it was “appropriate… for your family to be doing business in Saudi Arabia while you're President,” adding that “US Intelligence concluded that you orchestrated the brutal murder of a journalist,” in a question to the Crown Prince.The 47th POTUS immediately cut in, asking, “Now, who are you with?” When the journalist replied he was from ABC News, Trump shot back, “One of the worst. One of the worst in the business.”Trump then insisted he had stepped away from his private empire. “I have nothing to do with the family business… I’ve devoted 100% of my energy,” he said, adding that his family had “done very little with Saudi Arabia” and that anything they had pursued was “very good.”He went on to praise the Crown Prince directly. “He’s done a phenomenal job… He knew nothing about” the Khashoggi murder, Trump said. “You don’t have to embarrass our guests by asking a question like that.”MBS, however, opted to answer. “I feel painful about, you know, families of 911 in America,” he said, but argued critics were “helping Osama bin Laden's purpose of destroying this relation.”On Khashoggi, the Crown Prince said the killing was “painful,” a “huge mistake.""""It's really painful to hear, you know, anyone that been losing his life for, you know, no real purpose or not in a legal way. And it's been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,"" he said.""We've did all the right steps of investigation, et cetera, in Saudi Arabia. And we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. And it's painful, and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that this doesn't happen again,"" he added.Trump also hailed Saudi Arabia's human rights record calling the Crown Prince's work 'incredible'. “I’m very proud of the job he’s done. What he’s accomplished is incredible — in human rights and in other areas,” Trump added.The flashpoint came on a day of extraordinary pageantry. Trump greeted the Crown Prince with a military flyover, cannon fire, a horse parade and celebrations on the South Lawn, presenting the visit as a reset after years of tension. “We appreciate it very much,” Trump said as he touted Saudi investment, insisting Riyadh would put “$600bn” into the US economy. “That number could go up a little bit higher… We have a lot of jobs. ”The red-carpet reception highlighted Trump’s determination to deepen ties with the Kingdom despite accusations from US intelligence that the Crown Prince approved the operation that killed Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. For MBS, the trip marks an attempt to re-establish himself on the global stage, as he pushes ahead with efforts to diversify the Saudi economy and build strategic partnerships in technology, defence and nuclear cooperation.Alongside meetings in the Oval Office and a gala dinner hosted by First Lady Melania Trump, the two governments are preparing to announce major defence and commercial agreements, including F-35 fighter jets and a “multi-billion dollar investment” in US AI infrastructure.",Trump says saudi crown prince 'incredible in terms of human rights' crown prince mbs says killing of jamal khashoggi was 'painful' and a 'huge mistake' u.s. will sell f-35 fighter jets to riyadh despite israeli concerns.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125417868,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1128245,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
