Nepal Burns: Gen Z Protest Turns Deadly, 9 Killed as Police Open Fire in Kathmandu, Curfew Impsosed

Poll Do you believe that the restoration of social media will help ease tensions in Nepal? Yes, it will calm the situation No, deeper issues remain





Nepal revoked the ban on social media it had imposed after violent protests by youths rocked the country on Monday, with police's use of force leaving at least 19 people dead and over 300 others injured, and home minister Ramesh Lekhak resigning over the situation.Swati Thapa, central committee member of the opposition Rastriya Prajatantra Party, told TOI, ""All 26 social media platforms have been restored - but lifting the ban alone is not sufficient. What matters is accountability. The state has brutally murdered unarmed and peaceful young people - some of them in school uniform. Though the home minister has resigned, that does not settle matters. The govt must face the court of law and be held responsible for this mass murder of innocents. And we will not be silent - Gen Z will return to the streets on Tuesday to protest these atrocities and RPP will stand with them.""The army was deployed in the capital after the situation deteriorated. Army personnel have taken control of the roads surrounding the parliament complex. Earlier, thousands of youths, including school students, under the banner of Gen Z, staged a massive protest in front of Parliament in the heart of Kathmandu and shouted anti-govt slogans demanding immediate revocation of the ban.The protests, which also broke out in other parts of Nepal, were the most extensive in a single day in the country's recent history. The violent response by security forces added to pressure on the govt of PM K P Sharma Oli, as both the opposition and a few members of the governing coalition called for his resignation.The demonstration turned violent when some protesters entered the parliament complex, prompting police to use water cannon, tear gas, and live rounds to disperse crowds, eyewitnesses said.Pratibha Rawal, joint spokesperson of Rastriya Swatantra Party, another opposition party, said Tuesday's Gen Z protests would go ahead as planned despite the partial rollback of restrictions. ""This was not a law-and-order response - it was a massacre. These were young people holding placards, not weapons. Their voices were met with bullets. A resignation is not justice. This generation will not be silenced - we will return to the streets, not just to reclaim our rights but to demand accountability for state violence. ""Outrage has been growing in Nepal over a perceived lack of effective prosecution of high-profile corruption cases, as well as economic inequality. Demonstrators were also angered by the ban on dozens of social media platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and WeChat. Officials implemented the ban Thursday after saying the platforms had failed to comply with new requirements to register with the govt.Nepal police spokesperson Binod Ghimire said 17 people were killed in clashes in various parts of Kathmandu, and two protesters died in Sunsari district of eastern Nepal in police firing. The protests spread to Pokhara, Butwal, Bhairahawa, Bharatpur, Itahari and Damak. Lekhak, who represented Nepali Congress in coalition govt, quit on moral grounds.Following the violence, the administration imposed a curfew in parts of the capital. Besides Kathmandu, curfew orders were issued in Lalitpur district, Pokhara, Butwal and Itahari of Sunsarai district.Oli said on Sunday that his govt would ""always oppose anomalies, and would never accept any act that undermines the nation"". The PM said the party is not against social media, ""but what cannot be accepted is those doing business in Nepal, making money, and yet not complying with the law"".","Nepal lifts social media ban imposed after violent protests by youths on monday. At least 19 people dead and over 300 others injured. Home minister ramesh lekhak resigns over the situation.

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports. The move covers offering exemptions covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to a Reuters report.Since assuming power in January, Trump has unleashed a global trade war, announcing reciprocal tariffs on most major countries around the world. After announcing high tariffs on most countries in April, the Trump administration later used these as tools to negotiate trade deals which it says are favourable to the US. While some trade deals have been announced, exact details of many are yet to emerge.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","Us president donald trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports.

Screams, Chains, Panic: Inside ICE’s Biggest Worksite Raid; Hyundai Georgia Plant Turns 'War Zone'

South Korean companies jittery about US

The US work visa problems





US President Donald Trump ’s ambitious ‘Made-in-USA’ dream is facing hurdles created by his own administration’s actions. The recent immigration raid on a Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery facility in Georgia is an example of how Trump’s crackdown on immigrants and move to create jobs in the US, may actually face big hurdles, for now.Law enforcement officials have taken 475 individuals into custody at the complex, and according to reports, LG Energy Solution has postponed the commencement of operations at the facility to the first half of 2026. As reported by Yonhap on Monday, immigration authorities have presented the detained individuals with two alternatives: accept deportation with a five-year ban on re-entry, or remain in detention pending trial.According to a Bloomberg report, industry analysts note that these large-scale manufacturing initiatives, which Trump highlights as achievements in domestic job creation, are encountering difficulties due to immigration enforcement targeting their essential workforce.""Your Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people, with great technical talent, to build World Class products, and we will make it quickly and legally possible for you to do so,"" Trump said on Truth Social on Sunday, emphasising that whilst the US welcomes foreign investment and skilled workers, proper legal procedures must be followed.Trump has expressed his desire to facilitate the training of US workers by bringing in battery plant specialists.Over the weekend, Korean authorities endeavoured to facilitate the release of 300 detained nationals at a Hyundai Motor Co.-LG Energy Solution Ltd. joint venture construction site, according to Lee's chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik during a high-level meeting between government officials and the ruling Democratic Party.The visa status of the workers and their legal authorisation to work at the site remains uncertain.The enforcement action, despite being unusual in its magnitude and the type of workers affected, is creating anxiety among Hyundai's industry counterparts, including Samsung Electronics Co. and SK On Co., who have also pledged substantial investments in the United States.The timing is also sensitive, following the meeting between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Trump that highlighted their partnership and cemented a fresh trade agreement. The arrangement incorporated a $350 billion fund to assist South Korean companies growing their presence in the US, allocating $150 billion specifically for shipbuilding ventures. Additionally, private sector organisations committed $150 billion for direct investment in the US.South Korean conglomerates are working to manage the aftermath, raising apprehension about planned investments worth billions of dollars.The extensive operation caused distress amongst South Koreans when footage emerged showing workers in shackles at the waist, ankles and wrists. This action, part of a larger US initiative against undocumented workers, occurred shortly after a summit between Lee Jae Myung and Donald Trump that highlighted their partnership.""The Georgia episode demonstrates that managing this hurdle with higher tariffs and tighter labor supply will not be an easy task,"" said Homin Lee, a senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier Singapore Ltd., discussing the blanket 15% import duty from the Asian nation. ""We expect South Korea to push for pragmatic tweaks in US visa rules to keep the economic viability of many marquee capex projects,” Homin Lee was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.The presence of South Korean specialists, engineers and sub-contractors is essential for these projects' success. Any restrictions on their movement could potentially disrupt manufacturing schedules, increase expenses and diminish the intended industrial growth. This situation could also affect Hyundai's production expansion plans in Georgia.""Mass production in the first half of 2026 is virtually impossible due to the departure of key personnel during the installation and commissioning phase,"" said Anna Lee, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea in Seoul.This enforcement action has introduced uncertainty regarding South Korea's extensive US investment plans. The incident involving workers at a major Korean investment project might signal to other companies that US operations carry heightened political and regulatory challenges.These multibillion-dollar facilities require substantial numbers of international engineers and contractors, yet organisations like Hyundai and LG face considerable obstacles in securing appropriate visas for their specialist personnel.Under Trump's administration, Korean companies in the US have faced difficulties securing work visas, sources told Bloomberg. Particularly, subcontractors have experienced significant visa processing delays, hampering on-site technical discussions and coordination of visits.These staff members, particularly engineers with production line design knowledge, are considered indispensable, according to a battery sector representative. However, local recruitment remains viable for electrical work and basic technical support roles.Immigration enforcement actions draw attention to an ongoing challenge in US-South Korean relations: the significant gap between trade and immigration regulations.South Korea, despite maintaining a free trade agreement with the US since 2012, lacks a dedicated visa allocation, unlike other FTA nations. Whilst Australia, Singapore and Chile enjoy specific visa quotas, and Canada and Mexico operate without limitations under the Treaty National visa scheme, as legal practitioners note. This disparity creates considerable tension for Seoul, revealing a substantial flaw in the economic partnership between the nations.The core challenge stems from US work permit regulations.The H-1B visa category, which maintains an annual limit of 85,000 permits and operates via a random selection process, presents significant obstacles. South Korean organisations struggle to obtain necessary authorisations, typically securing merely 2,000 visas yearly. This limitation has led some Korean enterprises and their associated contractors to utilise B-1 business visas or ESTA for employment activities, according to immigration specialists. These particular visas, however, are exclusively designated for business gatherings or leisure travel, explicitly forbidding any form of employment.According to Monday's Korean media coverage, citing anonymous industry insiders, approximately 30% of B-1 visa applicants succeed, with deployment taking four to five months post-approval. The extensive application process includes corporate invitation letters, contractual documents, CVs and interviews. This has led workers to adopt a pattern of 70-80 day ESTA-based work periods followed by departures and returns, as reported by Chosun Ilbo.""The incident is likely to exacerbate the shortages of legally qualified skilled workers and increase labor cost pressures, which in turn would result in project delays and cost increases across major US construction projects,"" Eugene Investment & Securities Co. analyst Ryu Tae-hwan said. ""Companies' ability to procure and manage labor in America may emerge as a key factor for project execution.""","The recent immigration raid on a hyundai-lg energy solution battery facility in georgia is an example of how trump’s crackdown on immigrants and move to create jobs in the us, may actually face big hurdles. The enforcement action, despite being unusual in its magnitude and the type of workers affected, is creating anxiety among hyundai's industry counterparts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123769853,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-53672,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Cross-voting in VP election? Radhakrishnan's victory margin puts question mark on opposition's unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cross-voting-in-vp-election-radhakrishnans-victory-margin-puts-question-mark-on-oppositions-unity/articleshow/123769754.cms,"NEW DELHI: NDA candidate C P Radhakrishnan was on Tuesday elected as the 15th Vice-President of India bagging 452 votes against the opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy's 300. Announcing the result, Rajya Sabha Secretary General and Returning Officer P C Mody said 767 MPs had cast their votes out of the total valid electors of 781. He said 752 ballots were valid and 15 were invalid, bringing down the required majority of first preference votes to 377.That Radhakrishnan would win the VP race was perhaps never in doubt given the numbers advantage that he had over Reddy. But there was still a lot of interest in the final results. The fact that VP polls are held without any party whip thereby leaving a window open for cross voting had instilled some hope in the opposition camp. If not an outright win, they could at least bank on ""conscience vote"" to attract some NDA MPs to their side and embarrass the ruling camp. The Telugu card was a thought out strategy to achieve this objective.Unfortunately, as the final results show, the strategy boomeranged.Instead of NDA MPs ditching their camp, it appears the INDIA bloc members responded to their ""conscience"". The vote tally suggests some cross-voting in favour of Radhakrishnan.The BJP, which had silently ensured that all leaders associated with the ruling alliance voted in favour of NDA candidate, was quick to take digs at opposition's pre-voting claims of unity within their ranks.Union minister Kiren Rijiju claimed ""Many opposition parties have also voted for our NDA candidate. This is also a very good sign."" In fact, BJP claims that at least 15 opposition members voted for the NDA nominee.Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh had earlier asserted that all 315 INDIA bloc MPs were in attendance for the vote.""The Opposition has stood united. ALL of its 315 MPs have turned up for voting. This is an unprecedented 100% turnout,"" he said on X.Since this was a secret ballot, so who all cast conscience vote may perhaps be not known. But the opposition did admit that it suffered a dent, though not a significant one.""There has been a 14% increase in votes secured by this candidate (Opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy) as compared to the last candidate. This candidate received 40% of the total votes, compared to 26% secured by the previous candidate. So the Opposition is only gaining; there will be a change...They (NDA) could not cause a significant dent ... ,"" Congress MP Imran Masood said.However, with Reddy managing only 300, the deficit of 15 votes raised questions. BJP leader Amit Malviya was quick to take pot shots at this claim. Soon after the results were out, he responded to Jairam's post and wrote:""All 315 voted… but for whom is the real question! 🤔 Despite all the noise and bravado, the INDI Alliance candidate managed only 300 votes, 15 short of what they had confidently claimed. So much for tall claims and unity!""However, Jairam Ramesh put up a brave defence and claimed opposition performance had improved compared to last elections.""Opposition performance has undeniably been most respectable. Its joint candidate Justice (retd) B Sudershan Reddy secured 40% of the vote. In 2022, the Opposition had received 26% of the vote in the vice presidential elections,"" Ramesh said.""The BJP's arithmetical victory is really both a moral and political defeat. The ideological battle continues undiminished,"" the Congress leader added.These claims notwithstanding, the fact remains that the opposition once again put up a poor show. Yes, 15 votes were declared invalid. But this does not explain the dip in INDIA bloc's overall numbers. Moreover, there is still no clarity on how the AAP members, who had promised support to Reddy, have voted.So, while the results are not a surprise, the more than expected victory margin of C P Radhakrishnan is surely is a matter of concern for the opposition. Clearly, they still are far away from their claims of unity.(With inputs from agencies)",Nda candidate c p radhakrishnan was on tuesday elected as the 15th vice-president of india bagging 452 votes against the opposition candidate b sudershan reddy's 300.

'Nepotism, Corruption And...': Ex-Envoys Decode What Fuelled Nepal’s Violent Gen Z Protests

NEW DELHI: India has advised its citizens to “defer travel (to Nepal) until the situation has stabilised. Airlines including Indian carriers, have suspended flights as Kathmandu Airport (KTM) was closed on Tuesday afternoon when Gen Z protestors set fire nearby. A few flights between Indian cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru were able to operate Tuesday morning. But as the day progressed and the situation worsened, multiple Kathmandu-bound flights hovered near the city before diverting or returning to India. Subsequently airlines suspended flights.In its advisory, the Indian foreign ministry said: “In view of the developing situation in Nepal, Indian citizens are advised to defer travel there until the situation has stabilised. Indian citizens presently in Nepal are advised to shelter in their current places of residence, avoid going out onto the streets and exercise all due caution. They are also advised to follow local safety advisories from Nepal authorities as well as the embassy of India in Kathmandu…”IndiGo said on X Tuesday afternoon: “In view of the prevailing situation in Kathmandu, the airport has been closed for operations.

Poll Would you support initiatives to improve rescue operations in avalanche-prone areas? Yes, definitely. Maybe, but it depends on the cost.

NEW DELHI: Three army personnel lost their lives after an avalanche hit a base camp in the Siachen sector of Ladakh, officials told news agency PTI, on Tuesday.The avalanche struck the Siachen base camp area, located at an altitude of 12,000 feet, on Sunday. Three soldiers, including two Agniveers, were trapped under the snow. A rescue operation was swiftly launched, and the bodies of all three personnel were recovered, they added.The location remains one of the world’s highest and most challenging military deployments. Located on high atitude, the Siachen Glacier is known for extreme weather conditions and frequent snow-related incidents. The army has suffered several casualties over the years due to avalanches and frostbite.The army maintains a continuous presence in the region to secure strategic positions near the line of control. Troops posted at these altitudes undergo specialised high-altitude warfare training and are equipped for survival in sub-zero temperatures.","The avalanche struck the siachen base camp area, located at an altitude of 12,000 feet.

'Nepotism, Corruption And...': Ex-Envoys Decode What Fuelled Nepal’s Violent Gen Z Protests

As Nepal plunged into a crisis, PM Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) to discuss the developments in the country, saying the violence witnessed there was heart-rending.Modi said he was anguished that many young people had lost their lives and appealed to all “brothers and sisters” in Nepal to support peace. “The stability, peace and prosperity of Nepal are of utmost importance to us,” he said.Earlier in the day, India’s response to the Gen Z uprising in Nepal, which devoured PM K P Sharma Oli, was restrained expectedly as the government - in a statement Tuesday morning - said it was closely monitoring the situation and urged all concerned to exercise restraint and resolve issues through peaceful means. After news of Oli’s resignation, the government issued an advisory asking Indian nationals in Nepal to shelter in their homes, follow local safety advisories and Indians here to defer travel to Nepal.In its morning statement, the first official response to developments in Nepal, the Indian government also said it was deeply saddened by the loss of many young lives and expressed condolences to the families of the victims.Unlike the statement jointly issued by several European countries, India stopped short of seeking protection of fundamental rights but its response was still an acknowledgement of the organic nature of the protests on Monday in which 19 lives were lost. Oli had claimed that “certain elements” had infiltrated the protests.India will have few tears to shed for Oli, not least because of his continued courtship of China. In July last year, Oli junked alliance with fellow Communist leader P K Dahal Prachanda to enter into a power-sharing agreement with pro-India party Nepali Congress (NC), himself taking oath as PM for the 4th time. In a break from the past, however, Oli chose China for his first bilateral visit.This meant the Indian government had to take a rain check on Oli’s proposed visit to India. Oli was finally scheduled to come mid-September but even this was derailed by Nepal’s public outburst on the border issue which was provoked by India’s decision to reopen trade with China through the Lipulekh pass that is claimed by Nepal. India did not want Oli’s visit hijacked by Nepal’s border claims, which it sees as not based on historical facts and evidence.However, India might have to contend with a different type of instability in Nepal as it’s not just Oli but all mainstream leaders and parties that are under attack. The protests were triggered by a ban on social media but quickly turned into an insurrection, fuelled not just by anger against Oli or his government but also deep-seated resentment among the Gen Z about the recurring political game of musical chairs, which has seen the same leaders take turns to rule the country, rent-seeking politicians and rampant corruption.Former Indian ambassador to Nepal Manjeev Puri says that while the present crisis was precipitated by the mishandling of protests by local authorities for which the buck had to stop at the top, the increasingly aspirational Nepal youth has genuine reasons to feel disgruntled about the political situation in Nepal. He also says the ban on social media was avoidable at a time of increasing Nepal exposure to globalisation.Unlike in the case of Bangladesh, where it fell victim to its ties with the leader, India can perhaps hope to safely allow the churn to play out in Nepal while remaining focused on the cooperative ties across diverse sectors that have yielded benefits for the people of both the countries. Oli was not India’s man, after all. In the meantime, as Puri says, India can counsel the leaders about the need for political sagacity and for being empathetic towards the people of Nepal.",Pm narendra modi chaired a meeting of the cabinet committee on security (ccs) to discuss the developments in the country.

I humbly appeal to all my brothers and sisters in Nepal to maintain peace and order,” he said.Nepal has witnessed unprecedented turmoil since Monday, as protests led largely by young demonstrators escalated into widespread arson and clashes. The unrest began over a government ban on social media platforms and demands for stronger action against corruption.Nepal’s prime minister KP Sharma Oli, 72, resigned on Tuesday, a day after the protests turned violent, leaving 21 people dead and compelling the government to reverse the measure.The demonstrations have since evolved into a broader anti-corruption movement, challenging the country’s political establishment and testing its fragile democracy.By Tuesday, protesters torched the parliament building, Prime Minister Oli’s Balkot residence, and the homes of senior leaders.The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu has released emergency helpline numbers for Indian nationals in Nepal, amid the escalating unrest.India has also urged its citizens to “defer travel (to Nepal) until the situation has stabilised.” Several airlines, including Indian carriers, suspended services after Kathmandu airport was shut on Tuesday afternoon.

PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he looks forward to speak with his ""very good friend"" Prime Minister Modi in the coming weeks and confirmed that his administration will continue negotiations with India to resolve trade barriers between the two countries.Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations.

The vote tally seemed to indicate that at least 15 opposition members voted for the NDA nominee, despite Congress claiming all 315 opposition MPs stood united in the vice-presidential polls.Interestingly, the shortfall in the opposition's count - 15 - was the same as the number of votes declared ""invalid"". Sources said it was not possible to assert with surety if the invalid votes were all from the opposition, or some MPs had cross-voted.The poll recorded a 98.2% turnout with 767 MPs voting. There were 752 valid votes and 15 deemed invalid. One postal ballot was cancelled as the MP declined to vote.""I declare CP Radhakrishnan has been elected to the post of Vice-President of India, and the results will be communicated to the Election Commission,"" the RS secretary-general announced.Radhakrishnan's margin turned the focus on opposition's possible failure to stick together, that too, at a time when it is on the warpath with allegations of ""vote theft"".The opposition fell 15 votes short of its estimated tally in the VP election, with candidate B Sudershan Reddy securing 300 votes, while the expected tally was 315 based on support of like-minded INDIA-plus parties.Congress put up a brave face, with opposition's counting agents Shaktisinh Gohil and Manickam Tagore saying that Reddy secured 40% of the votes cast as against the opposition tally of 26% in the 2022 VP election. But it came just after Jairam Ramesh announced at the end of voting, ""The opposition has stood united. All of its 315 MPs have turned up for voting. This is an unprecedented 100% turnout.""The full turnout of 315 votes made it difficult for the anti-BJP bloc to pinpoint the MPs who may not have voted for Reddy, with the post-result calculations complicated by the fact that exactly 15 votes were found invalid too.Gohil drew a link between 15 invalid ballots and the 15 votes by which the opposition fell short. Sources said it was not possible to assert with su-rety if the invalid votes were all opposition MPs, or some had cross-voted. However, doubts were trained on MPs from a couple of regional parties that have a hostile govt in their home state. Sources said MPs of a party no longer in INDIA bloc cast many invalid votes, likely on purpose.""The fact that all 315 members turned up to vote and the voteshare grew from 26% in 2022 to 40% in 2025 means the opposition bloc is growing and is united.

""They chose expediency over ideology,"" he said.Ramesh called BJP's victory ""arithmetical"" and tantamount to ""both a moral and political defeat"".

Why Taylor Swift might formally step away from her godmother role

How Travis Kelce’s relationship might play into Taylor Swift’s public positioning

The drama surrounding Taylor Swift ’s personal life is showing no signs of slowing down. The pop superstar, currently in the spotlight for her high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce , is now reportedly planning a formal move to sever ties with actress Blake Lively . The alleged decision comes amid growing tension following the ongoing legal battle over the Colleen Hoover adaptation It Ends With Us...According to Radar Online, an insider revealed that pop sensation Taylor Swift feels compelled to “draw a line” in her fractured friendship with Lively. The source explained, “Taylor feels she has no choice but to draw a line. Their friendship collapsed months ago and she doesn't want blurred obligations lingering. That includes her godmother role.”The report claims that Swift is seriously considering delivering a formal notice, possibly through a mutual friend or lawyer, to clarify her intention of stepping back from the role..For years, Swift was closely connected with Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ family, even mentioning their children—James, Inez, and Betty—in her critically acclaimed folklore album. Their public appearances together had always made headlines, signaling a tight bond.However, that camaraderie seems to have unraveled amid the complicated legal war involving Lively and Justin Baldoni, during which Swift was unexpectedly dragged into the controversy.There were earlier reports that Swift would be subpoenaed, though that has since been dropped, and conflicting claims arose that Lively had threatened to expose private texts, which her legal team denied as “categorically false. ”Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce has already generated massive media buzz, and distancing herself from the Blake Lively-Ryan Reynolds drama may also be part of a broader strategy to focus on her own narrative. The insider noted, “This goes beyond the question of a wedding invite. It's about setting limits. Taylor doesn’t want the godmother role hanging over her or being used against her.”Also Read: “Deeply wounded”: As Taylor Swift plans her wedding to Travis Kelce, Blake Lively faces exclusion after legal feud As this situation continues to develop, it remains a rumor.

Jon Gruden, the former Las Vegas Raiders head coach, got a big legal win on August 11, 2025, when the Nevada Supreme Court ruled 5–2 that his lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell can move ahead in public court. The court agreed that the NFL’s arbitration clause isand does not apply to Gruden now that he’s not an employee. This means the case won’t be hidden behind closed doors unless the NFL persuades the court to hold a rehearing.Claiming the league released prior emails to force his resignation, Jon Gruden first sued the NFL and Roger Goodell in November 2021.

At first, a state judge in Las Vegas sided with Gruden, rejecting the NFL’s attempts to dismiss the case or push it into private arbitration.

On August 12, 2025, the league said it would ask the Nevada Supreme Court for a rehearing, claiming that the ruling threatens arbitration agreements in many industries and overlooked previous cases where arbitration continued after a contract ended.The NFL’s lawyers argued that changing arbitration rules without warning and granting unlimited power to the commissioner is unfair.Jon Gruden, through his lawyer Adam Hosmer-Henner, commented on how happy he was about the ruling, saying itand supports employees who face forced arbitration.Gruden added,",Nfl accused of silencing jon gruden as shocking court ruling flips case.

Nepal is witnessing its most turbulent political crisis in years after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned on Tuesday, a day after violent student-led protests left 19 people dead and forced the government to revoke a controversial social media ban.The unrest has now turned into a wider movement against corruption and political elites, shaking the foundations of the Himalayan nation’s fragile democracy.Oli, 72, announced his resignation on Tuesday afternoon, saying he was “deeply saddened” by the loss of lives but blamed “vested interest groups” for infiltrating peaceful demonstrations. His statement offered compensation to victims’ families and free treatment for the injured, but it failed to stem public anger.Also read: Nepal violence; Ex-PM Khanal’s wife dies after protesters torch house - president urges calm, dialogue Home minister Ramesh Lekhak and agriculture minister Ramnath Adhikari resigned earlier, taking “moral responsibility” for Monday’s bloodshed.By Tuesday, protesters had stormed and set fire to the parliament building, Oli’s residence in Balkot, and homes of several senior leaders including President Ram Chandra Poudel, former PM Sher Bahadur Deuba, Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, and foreign minister Arzu Rana Deuba.Even party headquarters of the ruling CPN-UML and Nepali Congress were attacked.Oli’s exit leaves Nepal in political flux.

His popularity has energised the RSP and independent candidates, raising speculation he could be pushed forward as a prime ministerial candidate.“Balen symbolises change,” said political analyst Dipak Gautam. “But running a city is very different from leading a fractured nation in crisis.”Nepal may see a caretaker government until parliament decides on a new coalition.With curfews in Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, and the army deployed around parliament, instability threatens to deepen.Despite curfews, demonstrations continued Tuesday in Baneshwor, Kalanki and Lalitpur, with students chanting “Punish the murderers in government.”India’s embassy in Kathmandu has issued emergency contact numbers for Indian nationals in Nepal, reflecting growing regional concern. Both India and China, which vie for influence in Nepal, are watching closely as the crisis unfolds.The immediate trigger was the government’s decision last week to block Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp and X, demanding the platforms register and submit to local oversight. Authorities argued it was needed to curb “misuse” of social media, but activists saw it as an attack on free expression.On Monday, tens of thousands of mostly young demonstrators, many in school uniforms, flooded Kathmandu’s streets, chanting “Stop corruption, not social media!” The rallies soon turned violent after police opened fire, killing 19 and injuring over 300. Witnesses reported protesters shot in the head and chest, overwhelming hospitals in the capital.While the social media ban was the spark, underlying anger has been building for years. Many young Nepalis feel betrayed by politicians they see as corrupt, dynastic, and disconnected. The viral hashtag #NepoKids, targeting children of politicians flaunting luxury lifestyles online, has become a rallying cry.“This government killed our friends. We will not stop until they are punished,” said student protester Narayan Acharya. Another demonstrator, Durganah Dahal, said, “As long as these corrupt leaders are in power, the people will continue to suffer.”","Nepal is witnessing its most turbulent political crisis in years. Pm kp sharma oli resigned on tuesday, a day after violent student-led protests left 19 people dead and forced the government to revoke a controversial social media ban. The unrest has now turned into a wider movement against corruption and political elites.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123785372,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-118312,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
