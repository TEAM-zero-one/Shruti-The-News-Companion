Trump announces extradition of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana: What it means for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-announces-extradition-of-26/11-accused-tahawwur-rana-what-it-means-for-india/articleshow/118250603.cms,"26/11 attacks accused Tahawwur Hussain (File photo)

Who is Tahawwur Rana?



'Every 3rd fugitive, terrorist wanted by India hiding in US'



Trump message on Khalistani elements in US



NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana , a key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks . After meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a joint press conference at the White House, Trump confirmed the decision and hinted at more extraditions in the future.“We are giving a very violent man (Tahawwur Rana) back to India immediately. There are more to follow because we have quite a few requests. We work with India on crime, and we want to make things better for India,” Trump said.This decision comes after the US Supreme Court rejected Rana’s final appeal on January 21, removing the last legal hurdle for his extradition.On the timeframe of Rana's extradited, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said: ""We are working on the logistics of his surrender and extradition to India. There are a few final steps to be completed. The two sides are in touch on this particular issue.”The India-US joint statement notes that PM Modi and Trump reaffirmed that the global scourge of terrorism must be fought and terrorist safe havens eliminated from every corner of the world.“They committed to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from groups, including Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Jaish-e Mohammad, and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in order to prevent heinous acts like the attacks in Mumbai on 26/11 and the Abbey Gate bombing in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021,"" the joint statement said.“Recognising a shared desire to bring to justice those who would harm our citizens, the US announced that the extradition to India of Tahawwur Rana has been approved,"" it said.Rana, a Pakistani-origin Canadian citizen, was convicted in the US for supporting the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and is wanted in India for his alleged role in facilitating the Mumbai attacks that killed over 174 people. His extradition had been a long-pending demand from India.Rana’s role in the 26/11 attack involves helping his friend David Coleman Headley alias Daood Gilani, a US citizen who was born to an American mother and a Pakistani father. Headley was arrested by the US authorities in October 2009.Rana was allegedly not only aware of Headley’s links to the Pakistan-based banned terror organisation LeT, he also actively helped Headley. Rana provided Headley with a fake identity that helped the latter visit India and identify targets for LeT’s 2008 attack.MoS Nityanand Rai had informed Lok Sabha in December that 65 of the 178 pending extradition requests by Indian investigative agencies were currently under US government consideration. Despite a treaty signed between the two nations in 1997, only 11 requests were honored between 2002 and 2018.Among the unfulfilled requests is the extradition of David Coleman Headley, the Lashkar operative and key accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.Citing data from the Ministry of External Affairs, Rai stated that in the past five years, India sought the extradition of several fugitive criminals from the US, with only 23 requests approved.Anmol Bishnoi, Lawrence Bishnoi’s younger brother, was arrested in the US last year in November. He is suspected of planning terror attacks and targeted assassinations in film and business sectors. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had listed him as one of its most wanted fugitives and announced a Rs 10 lakh reward for his capture.During the joint press conference, Trump was asked about Khalistanis in the US. While the US president did not give a direct reply, he said India and the US worked together on crime.On a question related to Washington's recent accusations of India's involvement in a foiled assassination plot against Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, Trump said India didn’t have a good relationship with the Biden administration. ""Very inappropriate things happened between them,"" Trump said before moving on to the announcement of Tahawwur Rana's extradition.On January 15, a high-powered Indian inquiry committee had also submitted its report on the activities of organised criminal groups and terrorist organizations impacting both India and the US. The probe was initiated following US allegations regarding the attempted killing of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who faces 104 cases across India.In an official statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs had confirmed that the committee, which worked in full cooperation with US authorities, recommended legal action against an individual with known criminal ties. While the ministry did not disclose the person’s identity, it assured that swift action would follow.",Tahawwur rana was convicted in the us for supporting the banned lashkar-e-taiba (let) he is wanted in india for his alleged role in facilitating the mumbai attacks that killed over 174 people.

Concerns over Constitutional interpretation



NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday questioned the involvement of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in executive appointments , such as that of the CBI director, stating that it was time to ""revisit"" such norms. Speaking at the National Judicial Academy in Bhopal, he also raised concerns over the jurisprudential basis of the ‘doctrine of basic structure.’“To stir your minds, how can in a country like ours or in any democracy, by statutory prescription, the Chief Justice of India participate in the selection of the CBI director?” Dhankhar said, according to PTI reported. “Can there be any legal rationale for it? I can appreciate that the statutory prescription took shape because the Executive of the day has yielded to a judicial verdict. But time has come to revisit. This surely does not merge with democracy. How can we involve the Chief Justice of India with any executive appointment!"" he added.The Vice President criticised what he termed as ""executive governance by judicial decree,"" calling it a ""constitutional paradox that the largest democracy on the planet cannot afford any longer."" Dhankhar emphasised that all institutions must function within their constitutional boundaries.“Governments are accountable to the legislature and periodically to the electorate. But if executive governance is arrogated or outsourced, enforceability of accountability will not be there,” he said. He added that any interference in governance by the legislature or judiciary was “antithetical to constitutionalism.”Dhankhar acknowledged the importance of judicial review, stating, “Judicial review is a good thing as it ensures that laws conform to the Constitution.” However, he stressed that the ultimate authority to amend the Constitution rests with Parliament.“The judiciary’s public presence must be primarily through judgments. Judgments speak for themselves… Any other mode of expression… undermines institutional dignity,” he remarked.On the basic structure doctrine , which restricts Parliament from altering certain fundamental features of the Constitution, Dhankhar said its jurisprudential basis was “very debatable.” Citing a book by former Solicitor General Andhyarujina on the Kesavananda Bharati case, he noted, “Having read the book, my view is that the doctrine of the basic structure of the Constitution has a debatable, very debatable, jurisprudential basis.”Recalling his tenure as Parliamentary Affairs Minister in 1990, Dhankhar pointed out that the Supreme Court had only eight judges at the time, yet constitutional interpretation required a five-judge bench. “Please note, when this strength was eight, it (size of constitutional bench) was five. And the Constitution allows the highest court of the land to interpret the Constitution,” he said.However, he warned against the misuse of constitutional interpretation. “Under the guise of interpretation, there can be no arrogation of authority, and the essence and spirit which the founding fathers had in mind under Article 145(3) must be respected,” he asserted.Referring to the expansion of the Supreme Court, he stated, “If I analyze arithmetically, they were very sure the interpretation will be by a majority of judges, because the (total) strength then was eight. That five stands as it is. And the number (of total judges) is more than fourfold.”Dhankhar also underscored the importance of free expression in a democracy. “If the right to express oneself is throttled or diluted, democracy gets thinner and thinner and thinner,” he remarked.","Vice president jagdeep dhankhar questioned the involvement of the chief justice of india in executive appointments.

India needs to weigh pros & cons of F-35 pitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-needs-to-weigh-pros-cons-of-f-35-pitch/articleshow/118258672.cms,"F - 35

NEW DELHI: India will have to very carefully evaluate US President Donald Trump’s offer of the fifth-generation F-35 fighter, even though the IAF would love to grab it with both hands given the China factor, while the two countries take forward the procurement of six more P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft as well as joint production of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles and Javelin anti-tank guided missiles this year.The expansive India-US defence relationship will get a further boost with PM Modi and Trump “pledging to elevate” military cooperation across air, land, sea, space and cyberspace, institute the ‘Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA)’, streamline defence trade and technology exchange, and sign a 10-year major defence partnership framework to renew the one inked in 2015.The sales pitch for the F-35, which is sold only to Nato countries and close allies, however, was the key takeaway. It might just be “a proposal” at this stage with the long-drawn formal process yet to even begin, as foreign secretary Vikram Misri said, but India will have to increasingly contend with a pushy Trump, whose deal-oriented transactional approach to geopolitics is well-known.“Starting this year, we will be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We are also paving the way to ultimately provide F-35 stealth fighters,” said Trump. The joint statement also noted the US’s “review of its policy on releasing fifth-generation fighters and undersea systems” to India.The pros and cons will have to be weighed. “India will inexorably be drawn into the US’s sphere of influence with the F-35 acquisition, impinging on its strategic autonomy. Why do you think successive Indian govts over the years have acquired Russian, French and other fighters but never American ones?” a senior official said.If India indeed pursues the F-35 offer, it will also have to factor in several things like the off-the-shelf price, the technologies being given, life-cycle costs, maintenance and the like, apart from the strategic benefits it can reap.Utmost care will have to be taken that India’s own 5th-Gen fighter project of the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), the development of which for over Rs 15,000 crore was cleared by the cabinet committee on security last March, is not adversely impacted.The operational 5th-Gen jets currently are the American F-35 Lightning-II and F/A-22 Raptor, the Chinese Chengdu J-20 and Russian Sukhoi-57. China has deployed J-20s at its airfields facing India and is even going to soon supply a variant to Pakistan, while it also conducted maiden flights of two new 6th-Gen prototypes in Dec.With the IAF grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when it is authorized 42.5, and Hindustan Aeronautics struggling to produce even a 4th-Gen Tejas, Indian national security planners are obviously concerned. “With AMCA still at least 10-12 years away from production, IAF will obviously be deeply interested in getting two to three squadrons (36 or 54 jets) of F-35s in the interim. If you need deterrence to prevent wars, you obviously need capabilities,” another official said.The F-35 could now even fly its way into IAF’s long-delayed project for 114 new multi-role fighter aircraft to be produced in India with foreign collaboration at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore. The defence ministry is working to break the logjam over this project, where French Rafale, Russian Sukhoi-57, Swedish Gripen-E, Eurofighter Typhoon and American F-15EX are the contenders.There is also the lingering question of the Russian S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems being inducted under the $5.43 billion contract in Oct 2018. The US is wary of any country operating F-35s and S-400s together since the latter’s powerful radars can “map or record” data of the former’s stealth characteristics, electronic warfare and other capabilities. This, too, will need to be resolved.","The sales pitch for the f-35, which is sold only to nato countries and close allies, was the key takeaway. India will have to increasingly contend with a pushy trump, whose deal-oriented transactional approach to geopolitics is well-known. “india will inexorably be drawn into the us’s sphere of influence, impinging on its strategic autonomy,” a senior official said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118258692,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35708,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Two more United States flights carrying more illegal Indian immigrants are scheduled to land in Punjab's Amritsar on February 15-16 .A United States flight carrying second batch of 119 illegal Indian immigrants is scheduled to land on February 15.According to PTI official sources, the plane is expected to land at the airport around 10 pm on Saturday.Among the 119 illegal Indian immigrants, 67 hail from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, three from Uttar Pradesh, two each from Goa, Maharashtra and Rajasthan and one each from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, the report said.Another US plane carrying deportees is also expected to land on February 16.The development comes hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met United States President Donald Trump and asserted the need to fight against the “ecosystem” of human trafficking that lures people from ordinary families with big dreams and promises and brought to other countries as illegal immigrants.This is not a question about India only but is a global issue, PM Modi said on the issue of illegal immigration during a joint press conference with Trump in the White House on Thursday.“We are of the opinion that anybody who enters and lives in another country illegally, they have absolutely no legal right or authority to live in that country,” PM Modi said.Earlier, a US military aircraft carrying 104 illegal Indian immigrants landed at the Shri Guru Ramdas Ji International Airport in Amritsar on February 5.While 30 of the deportees were from Punjab, 33 each were from Haryana and Gujarat, three each from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, and two from Chandigarh.","A united states flight carrying second batch of 119 illegal indian immigrants is scheduled to land on february 15.

Poll How Do You Feel About the Changes in the US Visa Renewal Process? It Could Make the Process More Organized in the Long Run It Makes the Process More Difficult for Applicants

NEW DELHI: Renewing the same class of US visa could now mean a long wait for many applicants in India. Uncle Sam has returned to its pre-Covid policy of allowing travellers to renew their visa without appearing at the embassy/consulate for an interview if their previous same-class visa is still valid or expired within the last 12 months.In Nov 2022, when the wait time for B1/B2 (business and tourism visa ) interview had crossed 999 days (touching almost three years) in India, the US increased the eligibility for same class drop box visa renewal — which does not require interview — from 12 months to 48 months. Since then the waiting period for B1/B2 interview has less than halved, it is currently over 440 days in Delhi & Mumbai; 436 in Chennai; 429 in Hyderabad and 415 in Kolkata.With such a long waiting, the reduction of drop box eligibility for renewal will mean more people again seeking appointments for same class visa renewal and further prolonging the queue. Asked in this backdrop if it planned to take any step in India to reduce the waiting, the US embassy said it had “anything additional”.Anil Kalsi, Travel Agents Federation of India VP, said: “This makes travel difficult for people who were banking on renewal. Since it’s announced and is already in effect, a lot of people have been caught unawares. There are anyway no interview dates available (in India) without a long waiting period. Some time should have been provided before the change took effect.”Repeat travellers to the US may, under some circumstances, renew their visas without appearing at the embassy or consulate for an interview. The visa waiver checklist for applicants, except those 14 years of age and 80 & above includes: “(is) a citizen of India/Bhutan or a lawful resident of India/Bhutan.(Has) a previous U.S. visa in the same class as the visa for which wish to apply and (the) prior visa in the same visa class is still valid or expired within the last 12 months. Most recent visa was issued on or after my 14th birthday,” according to a US Govt website.While India-US travel is reaching new highs post Covid, the travel industry says it remains way below potential due to two factors — long visa interview wait times and few direct flights due to US airlines not using Russian airspace. A record number of Indians travelled to the US last calendar year, more than CY 2023’s figure of 17.6 lakh which had overtaken the pre-Covid 2019 high of 14.7 lakh. India has now emerged as the second largest overseas source market of international visitors to the US, after the UK.",Uncle sam has returned to its pre-covid policy of allowing travellers to renew their visa without appearing at the embassy/consulate for an interview.

Hugs, handshakes and gifts



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday concluded his two-day visit to the US where he held bilateral talks with President Donald Trump. The two leaders discussed key issues including trades, tariffs, extradition of 26/11 accused, Russia-Ukraine war, purchase of F-35 fighter jets and India's border dispute with China.Setting the tone of the ""MEGA partnership"", PM Modi highlighted India and US's shared commitment to economic growth and global leadership.""President Trump often talks about MAGA. In India, we are working towards a Viksit Bharat, which in American context translates into MIGA. And together, the India-USA have a MEGA partnership for prosperity!"" he said.India and the US set a bilateral trade target of $500 billion by 2030 in a effort to ensure joint development, joint production and transfer of technology. The terms of the agreement would be decided soon, said PM Modi.""The people of America are well aware of President Trump's motto 'MAGA - Make America Great Again.' The people of India too are focusing on heritage and development as they move forward at a fast pace and with a firm resolve towards the goal of Viksit Bharat 2047,"" PM Modi said.""In the language of America, it's Make India Great Again - MIGA. When America and India work together, this MAGA plus MIGA becomes a 'mega partnership for prosperity' and it is this mega spirit that gives new scale and scope to our objectives. Today, we have also set a target to increase our bilateral trade to more than double, reaching $500 billion by 2030. Our teams will work on finalising very soon a mutually beneficial trade agreement,"" he addedMarking a significant boost to defense cooperation, Donald Trump said that the US would sell F-35 stealth fighter jets to India, placing the country among an elite group operating the advanced aircraft.""Starting this year, we'll be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters,"" Trump said.The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, the most extensively deployed fifth-generation fighter jet, participated in the 15th edition of Aero India, Asia's largest aerospace and defense expo earlier this month.In a significant boost to the energy sector, India is set to buy US energy of almost $25 billion in the near future.""Last year, we purchased about $15 billion in US Energy output. There is a good chance that this figure will go up to as much as 25 billion dollars in the near future,"" ministry of external affairs said in a presser.The talks between the two leaders focused also on increasing energy purchases, which could play a key role in balancing the trade deficit between India and the United States. Officials indicated that expanded energy trade is a strong possibility and could contribute to narrowing the gap in bilateral trade.The US president has offered to mediate in the India-China border dispute and has called for a de-escalation.""I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious, and I guess they continue to go on. If I could be of help, I'd love to help, because that should be stopped,"" Trump said.PM Modi talked about the issue of illegal immigration and expressed India's readiness to take back those citizens living unlawfully in the US. However, he emphasized that the issue extended beyond deportation, highlighting the role of human traffickers who mislead individuals with false promises.There were no comments on the ""inhuman treatment"" given to the recent deportees when they were restrained and sent back to the country.""Those who stay in other countries illegally do not have any legal right to be there. As far as India and the US are concerned, we have always said that those who are verified and are truly the citizens of India - if they live in the US illegally, India is ready to take them back,"" PM Modi said.US approved the extradition of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana to India, marking another key takeaway from the visit.""Today I am pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters and very evil people of the world, and having to do with the horrific Mumbai terrorist attack, to face justice in India. So, he is going back to India to face justice,"" Trump said.In January, the US Supreme Court had approved Rana's extradition by dismissing his review petition in the case.PM Modi's visit to the US did not have a significant impact on Donald Trump's recent move to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from India.Rather, Trump said that the States would prefer a ""reciprocal approach"" on tariffs. ""We are, right now, a reciprocal nation. We are going to, if it's India or if it's somebody else with low tariffs, we're going to have the same. We're going to have whatever India charges, we're charging them. Whatever another country charges, we're charging them,"" Trump said.He also reiterated his ""100% tariffs"" on Brics nations threat if they tried to replace the US dollar with any other currency.""I don't care, but Brics was put there for a bad purpose and most of those people don't want it. They don't even want to talk about it now. They're afraid to talk about it because I told them if they want to play games with the dollar, then they're going to be hit with a 100 per cent tariff. The day they mention that they want to do it and they will come back and say we beg you, we beg you not to do this. Brics is dead since I mentioned that. Brics died the minute I mentioned that and I know I remember when Obama and Biden, in particular, I guess he said that oh, they have us over a barrel,"" he said.PM Modi reiterated India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war and said that the country was in favour of establishing peace.""I have always been in close contact with Russia and Ukraine. I have met the leaders of both countries. Many people are in a misconception that India is neutral, but I want to reiterate that India is not neutral; we are on a side, and that is peace,"" he said.He lauded Trump's efforts to resolve the conflict through dialogue, and said that negotiations were the key to ending the crisis.""I have said that 'this is not a time of war' in front of the media when President Putin was with me. Even today, my conviction is that the solutions to war cannot be found on the battlefield, and ultimately, we have to be at the table,"" he said.PM Modi and US President Trump shared a warm moment with hugs and handshakes at the White House.Trump also gifted PM Modi a book titled 'Our Journey together' which featured images from key events like 'Howdy Modi' and 'Namaste Trump'.The book signed by Trump said, ""Mr Prime Minister, you are great.""","Prime minister narendra modi concluded his two-day visit to the us where he held bilateral talks with president donald trump.

NEW DELHI: Amid pressure from the United States, govt has slashed the import duty on bourbon whiskey from 150% to 100% and lowered tariffs on several varieties of wines.Duty on wines made of fresh grapes, and vermouth, as well as some other fermented beverages and unadulterated ethyl alcohol with 80% alcohol strength have been cut to 100%. The import of these products together added up to around $1 billion during the last financial year.In case of bourbon, the basic customs duty has been fixed at 50%, while agricultural cess of 50% has also been imposed. Last year, the imports of the two tariff lines related to bourbon were estimated at $2.6 million, while those from the US were pegged at $0.8 million.The duty cuts were notified on Thursday, hours before PM Narendra Modi's meeting with US president Donald Trump, where tariffs were at the centerstage of the discussions. Trump reiterated his promise to impose what he called reciprocal tariffs to keep American industry competitive. Just before meeting Modi, he had also said that India had among the highest tariffs in the world.India's duty on whisky and other alcoholic beverages have been an area of concern for most - from Australia to the UK, the European Union, Switzerland and the US. While India has slashed duties on Australian wine as part of the trade agreement, the UK has been putting pressure to lower the levy for Scotch as part of the trade negotiations. Similarly, EU has been demanding a cut for wine produced in the trading bloc.In the Budget presented on February 1, government had slashed import duty on a range of products, including high-end bikes, such as the iconic Harley Davidson, in a move seen to be focused on escaping the heat on tariffs. But that has not stopped Trump from raising concerns over duties in India as he cited Harley Davidson as an example during an interaction with the media.","Duty on wines made of fresh grapes, and vermouth, as well as some other fermented beverages have been cut to 100%.

Amid the launch of new initiatives, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump reaffirmed in a joint statement that the India-US partnership is central to a free and open Indo-Pacific. However, as Trump takes upon himself to resolve conflicts and in his own way, a glaring omission from the statement was any mention of the Russia-Ukraine war, or any stock reference to the UN Charter or territorial integrity on that issue, that had featured prominently in such bilateral and even multilateral documents with the Biden administration.According to the joint statement, the leaders also committed to strengthening law enforcement cooperation to take decisive action against illegal immigration networks, organized crime syndicates, including narco-terrorists human and arms traffickers, as well as other elements who threaten public and diplomatic safety and security, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both nations. India sees this as important for putting a check on the activities of Khalistan separatists on US soil. “There's a commitment to strengthening law enforcement cooperation in this regard and this is especially significant from our perspective given some events that have taken place,’’ said foreign secretary Vikram Misri. The leaders also publicly called upon Pakistan to stop cross-border terrorism.According to government sources, Modi had detailed discussions with Trump about concerns on both sides regarding market access and the problems arising out of Chinese industrial overcapacity, while asking officials to conclude a mutually beneficial trade deal by fall this year. “They discussed concerns arising from other territories with over capacities that take advantage of consumption in countries like India and the US. They discussed ways and means to address these issues in an overall context,’’ said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The joint statement was also shorn of any focus on climate or global health, issues that made the cut with the previous administration.The Trump administration strongly backed initiatives like IMEEC and iCET although the latter seemed to have been rechristened TRUST (transforming the relationship utilising strategic technology). TRUST, according to the joint statement, will catalyse government-to-government, academia and private sector collaboration to promote application of critical and emerging technologies in areas like defence, AI, semiconductors and quantum computing, while ensuring protection for sensitive technologies. They agreed to finalise a US-India roadmap on accelerating AI infrastructure.While there was no direct mention of the conflict in West Asia, the leaders agreed to increase cooperation, enhance diplomatic consultations, and increase tangible collaboration with partners in the region. They highlighted the importance of investing in critical infrastructure and economic corridors to advance peace and security in the region, pledging new announcements this year to take forward IMEEC and I2U2 – comprising India, Israel, UAE and US – initiatives.On cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, as Quad partners, the leaders reiterated that this partnership is underpinned by the recognition of ASEAN centrality, adherence to international law, support for safety and freedom of navigation, overflight and other lawful uses of the seas, and unimpeded lawful commerce.“PM Modi looks forward to hosting President Trump in New Delhi for the Quad leaders’ Summit, ahead of which the leaders will activate new Quad initiatives on shared airlift capacity to support civilian response to natural disasters and maritime patrols to improve interoperability,’’ said the joint statement. The 2 sides also launched the Indian Ocean Strategic Venture, a new bilateral forum to advance coordinated investments in economic connectivity and commerce.The leaders welcomed the proposed Indian amendments of the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) for nuclear reactors, saying this path forward will unlock plans to build large US-designed reactors and enable collaboration to develop, deploy and scale up nuclear power generation with advanced small modular reactors.As expected, there was a strong condemnation of terrorism with Trump and Modi backing action against groups like LeT, JeM, ISIS and al Qaeda. As the US formally announced the extradition of Mumbai attacks accused Tahawwur Rana, the leaders called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai, and Pathankot attacks and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.","Pm modi meets donald trump at white house.

Former US President Donald Trump shared a video on X highlighting his meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House, calling their partnership a symbol of the “special bond” between the world’s oldest and largest democracies.The 3-minute-45-second video showcased key moments from Modi’s Washington visit, where he met Trump, top US officials, and business leaders.

Modi, in turn, adapted Trump’s famous slogan, saying he was committed to “Make India Great Again.”During his two-day visit, Modi held talks with National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

NEW DELHI: India has reasons to get excited about Donald Trump's 'Drill, Baby, Drill' slogan, which has become the leitmotif of the 47th US president's policy to make America rich again by producing, consuming and exporting more oil and gas.More oil and gas in the market means lower prices, something India needs to maintain the growth momentum as it is heavily dependent on imports. India meets more than 80% of oil and 50% of gas requirement through import.""What is President Trump saying. Let the era of high prices be over. Let's control economic inflation. Let's bring more energy on the market. Let's have more economic growth so that everybody can win. Now, I'm the energy minister of the world's third largest consuming and importing country. We have the fourth largest refining capacity. Frankly, these are music to my ears,"" Union Petroleum minister Hardeep Puri said at India Energy Week in Delhi.The US is the world's biggest oil producer at over 13 million barrels per day. It produces oil in 32 states and coastal waters. Trump's choice of fracking services executive Chris Wright as energy secretary is, therefore, being seen as a signal that the president may be banking on an encore to reach his policy goal.Recent analyst notes from major brokerages, however, have been muted in their outlook on production increase as Wall Street focus on reducing costs for value creation. Oil production is a long game. Given the low oil prices, the fracking scene is not likely to see a rush of investors.That said, more US supplies are likely to reset global energy flows, in addition to keeping prices in check. Rising US oil exports will naturally tend to replace Gulf supplies to Europe. This will be an advantage for Indian refiners at a time when they are looking for alternatives to make up for loss of discounted Russian crude due to the latest US curbs on Russian oil sector.India does import crude from the US, which had made it to the list of top five suppliers. But it is not always the first choice due to high shipping costs and long travel time. Future prospects will depend on the available arbitrage, where India has an advantage with a diversified basket of 38 or so countries.But Russia is the elephant in the room. Given Trump's recent overture to Russian president Vladimir Putin, the war could be headed for an end. If, and when, that happens, India can say cheers with more oil in the market.",The us is the world's biggest oil producer at over 13 million barrels per day.

Prime Minister, the US is giving a lot of push to curb

illegal immigration

, and India has been cooperating on this issue. How does India see this issue in the larger context?

I wanted to ask you, did you discuss any possible business deals with Elon Musk during your meetings today, Mr Prime Minister?

Mr President. Can I ask whether you discussed at all today the case of Gautam Adani who is one of the wealthiest men in Asia and perceived as an ally of Prime Minister Modi. Prime Minister Modi, have you asked the President to take action on that case?

Mr Prime Minister, how do you see India's role? You have had discussions with President Trump about de-escalating the conflict in Russia and Ukraine.

Modi: I don't think this is a question that is about India only, but even globally, you can talk about this issue. And we are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they have absolutely no right to be in that country. And as far as India and the US is concerned, we have always been of the same opinion, and that is any verified Indian who is in the US illegally, we are fully prepared to take them back to India.However, it doesn't stop there. These are children of very ordinary families, and they are lured by big dreams and big promises. A lot of them are brought in without them knowing about why they are going to a country. And in fact, they are connected with a human trafficking system, and we have to make sure that we fight against this system. As far as the US and India are concerned, I think what we should do is make efforts to make sure that we uproot these from within the system so that we can reduce or remove human trafficking.And basically, the young, vulnerable, poor people of India are fooled into coming over as illegal immigrants. And our bigger fight actually is against this ecosystem or this system that encourages such gangs to thrive. And I can tell you that India will completely support your endeavour in achieving this.Modi: I have known him for a very long time. I was not even the prime minister at the time when I first met him. I was chief minister and today he came to meet me along with all his family with his children and so we had a nice discussion.As far as EVs are concerned, the word EV has a copyright and that is one person who has a copyright to the word EV and that is Trump.Modi: Firstly, India is a democratic country, and our culture and our thought philosophy is Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam , which basically means that the entire world is a family. Every Indian is my own family member. And when it comes to such personal matters, two leaders of two countries will not get together on that topic and discuss anything on an individual matter.Modi: As you know, I have been in constant contact with both Russia and Ukraine. I have also visited both countries. And many people are mistaken, and they feel that India is neutral. I would like to clarify, India is not neutral. We have taken a side, and we have taken the side of peace. And it is based on this principle of ours that in the presence of President Putin, I clearly said in front of the media that this is not the era of war and even today it is my conviction that solutions cannot be found on the battlefield.Ultimately, you have to come to the negotiating table and India has constantly made efforts that there are talks that take place where both parties are present. It is only then that we will find a solution. The efforts being made by President Trump, I support them, I welcome them and I would like that President Trump is successful as soon as possible so that the world is on the path to peace once again.","Modi: we are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they have absolutely no right to be in that country.

However, Rana repeatedly challenged the decision in American courts.His appeals against extradition were rejected by lower courts, and in August 2023, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the India-US Extradition Treaty allowed for his extradition. Rana then filed a petition with the US Supreme Court to block the decision. The US Solicitor General urged the court to reject his plea, reinforcing the US government's stance in favor of India's extradition request.On January 25, the US Supreme Court denied Rana’s final petition, effectively clearing the way for his extradition to India.

We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters ,” he said.Trump also highlighted his strong rapport with PM Modi, calling him a “much tougher negotiator” and noting the “special bond” between their nations.The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening trade and defence relations, even as Trump maintained his hard stance on economic issues with much of the world.If the F-35 stealth fighter deal goes through, India will join an exclusive group of countries—including NATO allies, Israel, and Japan—that operate the cutting-edge aircraft.Beyond military agreements, trade discussions took centre stage. Trump, who has long criticised India’s tariffs, reiterated his concerns, calling them “unfair” and “very strong.” Earlier in the day, he announced new reciprocal tariffs on all countries, including India, raising uncertainty over future trade ties. However, PM Modi struck a more optimistic tone, saying both sides would work towards a “mutually beneficial trade agreement” focusing on oil and gas. Trump also highlighted broader economic collaboration, stating that the two countries planned to invest in infrastructure projects, including ports, railways, and undersea cables, as part of a trade route linking India to Israel and Europe.Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk also joined Trump’s discussions with PM Modi. The newly appointed DOGE head, who has taken on an influential role in the administration, also held a private meeting with the Indian leader, raising questions about whether he was acting in an official or business capacity. Modi later shared photos of their meeting, showing a Musk alongside Indian officials.The visit also touched on immigration policies. India recently accepted a US military flight carrying 100 shackled migrants as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown, sparking criticism from Indian opposition leaders. However, PM Modi defended the decision, stating that undocumented Indians in the US were being exploited by human traffickers. “Any verified Indian who is in the US illegally, we are fully prepared to take them back to India,” he said.In return, Trump announced that the US would extradite Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a suspect linked to the deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks.
