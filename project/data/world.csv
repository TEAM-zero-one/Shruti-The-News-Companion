Silver market crisis 2025: Panic in London! How the market broke – Is demand in India the cause?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-market-crisis-2025-panic-in-london-how-the-market-broke-is-india-to-blame/articleshow/124693366.cms,"Silver market crisis 2025:

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

Is India leading the buying frenzy?

London in panic!





The perfect storm





Is India to blame?









The global silver market is facing its most severe crisis in decades, and for once, the epicenter of the turmoil isn’t just Wall Street or London— Is India to blame?As the country celebrated Diwali, millions of people flocked to buy silver, turning a seasonal ritual into a market-breaking frenzy. For Vipin Raina, head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, the scale of demand was unprecedented.Raina had been preparing for months for a surge in silver purchases by Indian customers ahead of Diwali, the festival honouring the goddess of wealth. But when it came, it blew everything away. His company, India’s largest precious metals refinery, ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.“Most people who are dealing silver and silver coins, they’re literally out of stock because silver is not there,” Raina, who is head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, told Bloomberg.“This kind of crazy market — where people are buying at these levels — I have not seen in my 27-year career,” Raina added.While India’s Diwali demand is usually gold-heavy, this year saw silver take the spotlight. Social media and market hype fueled the shift. According to the Bloomberg report, investment banker and content creator Sarthak Ahuja, with nearly 3 million followers, promoted silver as the “next big buy” after gold’s historic rally.“It’s never been like this before. The demand this time for silver has been humongous,” Amit Mittal, GM at M.D. Overseas Bullion told Bloomberg.Premiums for silver in India surged above $5 an ounce, far exceeding the usual few cents above international prices. Dealers in Mumbai reported bidding wars, with buyers prioritizing availability over cost.But the frenzy for silver wasn’t confined to India. Global investors and hedge funds joined the surge, betting on a weaker US dollar or simply following the unstoppable rally. By early October, JPMorgan Chase, a key supplier to the Indian market, warned clients that it had no silver to deliver for October, with the next availability only in November.The buying spree hit London, the global hub for silver trading. Traders described a market “all but broken” as banks struggled to quote prices amid repeated client calls and thin liquidity. Robin Kolvenbach, co-CEO of Argor-Heraeus, said, “There is more or less little to no liquidity actually available in terms of leases in London. We have basically stopped all silver intake that is not committed contractually.”The spike in silver prices reached $54 an ounce, before tumbling 6.7%, reflecting extreme stress across the market. Analysts compared it to historical crises, including the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market in 1980, underscoring the severity of the situation.The 2025 silver crisis was not triggered by a single factor but by a convergence of events that drained global inventories and pushed the market to the brink. India’s Diwali demand played a key role, as millions of buyers turned to silver instead of gold, creating unprecedented pressure on domestic and international supplies.Over the past five years, silver demand has consistently exceeded supply from mines and recycled sources, driven largely by a solar industry boom using silver in photovoltaic cells.Since 2021, demand has outstripped supply by 678 million ounces, while London’s total inventories stood at around 1.1 billion ounces at the start of 2021, according to the Silver Institute.Market stress intensified this year as traders rushed to front-run potential U.S. tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, moving over 200 million ounces of silver into New York warehouses.Adding to the pressure, more than 100 million ounces flowed into global silver ETFs through September, as heightened investor demand for precious metals fueled a rally that also propelled gold past $4,000 an ounce for the first time in history. This coincided with a surge in investment demand through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), part of the so-called “debasement trade,” as investors sought a hedge against a weakening US dollar.The combined effect of these forces left London’s free-floating silver reserves, metal not tied up in ETFs—dropping to less than 150 million ounces, far below the daily trading volume of roughly 250 million ounces.Even in ideal circumstances, moving silver from Comex to London can take four days, but delays at customs and complex supply chains left traders exposed to high costs when contracts couldn’t be fulfilled on time. Comex inventories fell by more than 20 million ounces in two weeks, the largest drop in 25 years, benefiting logistics firms but stressing the market further.According to the Bloomberg report, some traders hesitated due to the risk of new tariffs on critical minerals, while TD Securities analyst Daniel Ghali noted that the London market had been primed for a squeeze for over a year.After the frenzy peaked, silver prices plunged more than 5% following signs of improving US-China relations, with Ghali suggesting further pressure may ease as silver flows in from New York and China.“The logistics were a little more complex than we initially assumed,” Ghali said. “We certainly did not expect the scale of the retail-buying bonanza across the globe that ensued while the London market was getting squeezed.”At the same time, China, a key supplier of silver, was on a week-long holiday, reducing the flow of metal into global markets.In essence, a perfect storm had formed: festive demand, industrial growth, investment mania, and trade-related hoarding converged, creating a market under extreme stress and unprecedented volatility, reported Bloomberg.While India’s Diwali buying played a major role, the crisis also reflects structural supply-demand imbalances built over years. Since 2021, silver demand has outpaced supply by 678 million ounces, largely due to industrial demand and ETF accumulation.Yet, the timing and scale of India’s purchases acted as the catalyst, turning an already tight market into a full-blown global squeeze, the Bloomberg report said. Analysts like Satish Dondapati, fund manager at Kotak Asset Management, point to the FOMO factor. “Analysts, bullion dealers were all giving bullish calls on silver in Indian media in a way that has not happened in the last 14 years. The FOMO factor has worked,"" Dondapati stated.The silver market remains under stress as the world waits for sufficient deliveries to ease the crunch. While regulators like the London Bullion Market Association have not intervened, citing genuine supply shortages rather than logistics issues, the current situation underscores the fragility of global metals markets in a hyper-connected world.","India's largest precious metals refinery ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.

Upgrading strike capability: India tests 800-km BrahMos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/upgrading-strike-capability-india-tests-800-km-brahmos/articleshow/124694864.cms,"‘Pinpoint Accuracy’ Rajnath Singh Praises BrahMos Precision During Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: In what will be a major boost for its precision strike capabilities, India plans to begin inducting the new 800-km extended range BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles in a little over two years, while over 200km Astra air-to-air missiles are also slated for production in 2026-27.Tests are underway for the 800-km BrahMos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades, to ensure the conventional (non-nuclear) missile is fully ready by end-2027, top defence sources told TOI.The existing 450-km range BrahMos missiles, which fly at almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, were launched from Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets for the targeted strikes deep into Pakistan under Operation Sindoor in May. “The 800-km BrahMos is more or less developed in terms of the modifications to its ramjet engine. A few more tests are required to test the efficacy of its combination of internal INS (inertial navigation system) and external global navigation satellite systems to ensure high accuracy, resilience and resistance to jamming,” a source said.Navy, for instance, can then begin upgrading the existing 450-km BrahMos missiles on its frontline warships to the 800-km variant, with just some tweaking of the software, the ‘graphical user interface’ of the fire control system and the like.“With the basic missile and launcher remaining the same, Navy and Army will first begin inducting the 800-km missile. The air-launched version will take slightly longer,” the source said.Parallelly, DRDO is increasing the beyond visual range (BVR) of Astra Mark-2 missiles to over 200km from the earlier 160km, while IAF is inducting over 280 Astra Mark-1 missiles with 100km range.“Along with trajectory shaping, the propulsion system is being upgraded to generate more thrust and burn for a longer time. If the trials are successful, Astra Mark-2 production can begin in six months. Otherwise, it will take a longer,” another source said.IAF has already finalised the plan to induct an initial 700 Astra Mark-2 missiles for its Sukhoi-30MKI and Tejas jets. There is also an Astra Mark-3 on the way, with solid-fuel ducted ramjet (SFDR) propulsion to increase the range to 350kmm but it will take three years to become operational. The all-weather day and night capable Astra series of missiles are crucial because they will eventually replace the expensive Russian, French and Israeli BVR air-to-air missiles (BVRAAMs) that are imported to arm IAF fighters.During its strikes on the nine terror hubs on May 7, IAF was initially caught off-guard by Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 BVRAAMs with ranges over 200km, as was reported by TOI earlier.The BrahMos air-to-ground missiles launched from stand-off distances were, however, an unqualified success. The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.In March last year, for instance, defence ministry had inked the largest-ever Rs 19,519 crore deal for procurement of over 220 BrahMos missiles for Navy. Around 20 warships, including the latest destroyers and frigates, are already armed with the vertical-launched BrahMos missiles.After Sindoor, the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council in Aug had also given the preliminary nod for IAF to get another 110 air-launched BrahMos missiles for around Rs 10,800 crore.The land variant of the 800-km BrahMos missiles will also eventually be part of the proposed Integrated Rocket Force (IRF), along with the Pralay ballistic missiles (400-km range) and long-range land-attack cruise missiles (derivatives of the original Nirbhay missiles with 1,000-km range), among others.","Tests are underway for the 800-km brahmos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades.

Narendra Modi has once again compromised the country’s dignity. According to Trump, bowing to his anger and threats, Modi assured that India would stop buying oil from Russia. One thing is clear – Narendra Modi is a weak Prime Minister, and his actions have unsettled the nation’s foreign policy.Russia has always been a close ally of India. Don’t damage the country’s relationships just to improve personal ‘friendly ties',"" Congress posted on X.Trump claimed on Wednesday that PM Modi has assured him that India will stop buying Russian oil, months after he imposed punitive tariffs over the purchases.""He's assured me there will be no oil purchased from Russia,"" Trump said. ""You know, you can't do it immediately. It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia.

India’s overall crude imports in October have broadly remained in line with expectations at 1.6 million bpd.However, Russian crude shipments have seen a drop of 180,000 from the average volumes imported during the first eight months of 2025, says the report.The drop in the imports is purely driven by market dynamics and not because of US tariff threat and European criticism against India’s continued purchase of those barrels.","Lok sabha leader of opposition rahul gandhi on thursday lashed out at prime minister narendra modi.

How a social media rumor spiraled out of control

Super Bowl SHOCK: Turning Point USA Plots Its OWN Halftime Show Amid Bad Bunny Drama

Adam Sandler remains focused on comedy and film, not politics

A bizarre viral rumor suggesting that Adam Sandler was set to perform at Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show has officially been debunked. The claim, which spread rapidly across Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), alleged that the comedian would headline a rival event to the Super Bowl halftime show, but fact-checkers and sources close to Sandler have confirmed that the story is entirely fabricated.The rumor began earlier this week after a series of misleading Facebook posts claimed that “Adam Sandler will join Lara Trump at the Turning Point USA halftime show.” The posts racked up thousands of shares within hours, with users debating whether Adam Sandler had shifted toward political performances. However, no reputable news outlet, nor Turning Point USA itself, ever announced his involvement.According to media watchdog Primetimer, the rumor stemmed from a manipulated headline that mixed genuine coverage of Lara Trump’s recent offer to perform at the event with false claims about Sandler’s participation.

Waqf Golden Visa: The UAE eyeing for strategic significance

GDRFA Smart Services – for Golden Visa application

Nearest Amer Centre in Dubai – for in-person support and document submission.





In a landmark initiative that underscores the UAE’s growing emphasis on humanitarianism and social sustainability, the country has announced that donors to Islamic endowments known as Waqf will now be eligible for the coveted UAE Golden Visa.The decision was unveiled following a strategic agreement signed between the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs – Dubai (GDRFA-Dubai) and the Endowments and Minors Affairs Foundation (Awqaf Dubai). The announcement came during GITEX GLOBAL 2025, one of the region’s largest technology and innovation exhibitions, held at the Dubai World Trade Centre.The initiative now enables both UAE residents and international donors to obtain a 10-year renewable Golden Visa under the specific category of “Financial Supporters of Humanitarian Work”, as clearly laid out in Cabinet Resolution No. 65 of 2022. The move is specifically aimed at encouraging high-impact charitable giving, positioning Dubai as a global hub of generosity, tolerance, and community-driven innovation.Officials say the Golden Visa will not just serve as a token of appreciation for philanthropists, but also as a strategic tool to attract global supporters of sustainable humanitarian work worldwide.“This agreement represents a pioneering model of government integration that empowers endowers to play a vital role in community development,” said Lt.Gen. Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of GDRFA-Dubai.Waqf, in Islamic tradition, refers to a perpetual charitable endowment. This could be in the form of land, buildings, cash, or other valuable assets set aside for public benefit—such as supporting education, healthcare, or religious institutions. The key feature of Waqf is that once donated, the asset cannot be sold or inherited. Instead, it is managed sustainably, with its revenue used for community development.In the UAE, Waqf is regulated and promoted by Awqaf Dubai, which ensures all endowments are Sharia-compliant, transparent, and channelled into meaningful causes.To qualify for the Golden Visa under this new category, donors must fulfil several conditions:According to officials, the scheme is expected to boost charitable contributions while offering donors several tangible benefits:Awqaf Dubai Secretary-General Ali Mohammed Al Mutawa called the initiative a “natural extension of Dubai’s vision to position endowment work as a key partner in sustainable development.”The Golden Visa scheme for Waqf donors is being seen as a forward-thinking policy that not only aligns with Islamic charitable values but also resonates with the UAE’s long-term vision of sustainable, human-centered growth.It also broadens the appeal of the Golden Visa, which is already available to investors, scientists, entrepreneurs, and outstanding professionals in fields like medicine and engineering.Officials believe the latest addition will attract global philanthropists, foster cross-border partnerships in social development, and further establish the UAE as a beacon of generosity and inclusive progress.With this strategic move, the UAE is strongly reinforcing its long-term commitment to becoming a leading global humanitarian capital. The innovative partnership between GDRFA-Dubai and Awqaf Dubai is also expected to usher in a new era of digitally-enabled, impactful social initiatives, wherein charitable giving is not just encouraged but actively integrated into national development policy.Those interested can begin by visiting:","The united arab emirates announced new golden visa for waqf donors.

Nationwide demonstration

Trump mocks movement





Large crowds of protesters gathered across all 50 states of the US on Saturday against President Donald Trump as the government shutdown stretched into its third week amid a legislative deadlock.While the protesters called the demonstration the “No Kings” movement, Republicans ridiculed it as “Hate America” rallies.Demonstrators picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states including Washington, Los Angeles, Montana, and several other places.More than 2,500 events are planned across all 50 states — from major cities such as Washington D.C. and New York to small towns across the Midwest.In San Francisco, hundreds of people spelled out “No King!” and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she had never attended a protest before. Only recently, she began to view Trump as a “dictator.”“This is what democracy looks like!” chanted thousands in Washington near the US Capitol, where the federal government remained shut for a third week amid a legislative deadlock.Demonstrators slammed what they called the Republican billionaire’s strong-arm tactics, including attacks on the media, political opponents, and undocumented immigrants.It was the third mass mobilization since Trump’s return to the White House and came against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only closed federal programs and services but also tested the core balance of power, as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways protest organizers warn are a slide toward authoritarianism.The dissidents were also protesting several specific policies and actions of the Trump administration, including the deployment of federal forces and National Guard troops into US cities — viewed as an overreach of federal power and militarization of communities — sweeping immigration enforcement raids and policies leading to deportations and alleged injustices, and the government shutdown’s impact on the federal workforce and essential services.Meanwhile, Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.“They say they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” the president said in a Fox News interview that aired early Friday, before departing for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club.Trump’s campaign social media account also mocked the protests by posting a computer-generated video of the president dressed like a monarch, wearing a crown and waving from a balcony.Republican leaders called the protesters “communists” and “Marxists.” They said Democratic leaders, including Senator Chuck Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut down to appease those liberal forces.“I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana.“Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson added, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism,” and “Marxists in full display.”","Demonstrators picketed outside capitols in several republican-led states including washington, los angeles, montana, and several other places.

A cargo plane arriving from Dubai skidded off the runway and plunged into the sea at Hong Kong International Airport early Monday, colliding with a ground-service vehicle and killing two workers.The accident took place at approximately 3.53 am when Emirates SkyCargo flight EK9788, operated by Turkish carrier Air ACT, touched down on the north runway 07R after departing from Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC) in Dubai, Hong Kong standard reported.The aircraft, a Boeing 747-481 (BDSF) registered TC-ACF, reportedly swerved left during its landing roll before partially submerging into the sea adjacent to the runway.According to sources, the freighter collided with a ground-service vehicle during landing, tearing off one of its wheels and causing substantial damage.Two male staff members in the vehicle were ejected into the sea. Firefighters recovered both men around 5am—the driver was transported unconscious to North Lantau Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, while the passenger died at the scene.The four crew members aboard the freighter were unharmed. Rescue operations continued throughout the morning, with the fire department and marine police deploying vessels and a Flying Service helicopter to search the area.The airport’s north runway remains closed as the investigation is ongoing.

Significance





As India readies for Diwali celebrations, the country’s stock markets are set for one of their most symbolic annual rituals — Muhurat Trading. The one-hour special session, marking the beginning of Samvat 2082, ushering in a new Hindu financial year marked by prosperity and optimism.The NSE and BSE will open their floors exclusively for this ceremonial trading window, while remaining closed for regular trade on October 21 for Diwali Laxmi Pujan. Markets will also stay shut on October 22 for Balipratipada. Regular trading will happen on Monday, October 20.This year’s Muhurat session will be held from 1:45 pm to 2:45 pm, breaking from recent tradition where trading took place in the evening. Trade modifications will be allowed until 2:55 pm, with transactions permitted across equities, futures and options, commodity derivatives, currency derivatives, and securities lending and borrowing (SLB) segments.Also read: Are NSE, BSE open October 20-22? Check details Derived from the Sanskrit word meaning “auspicious hour”, Muhurat Trading marks a symbolic new beginning for investors and businesses. The tradition, observed for decades, blends faith with finance — reflecting optimism, prosperity, and the belief that investments made during this hour bring good fortune in the year ahead.Historically, Dalal Street has celebrated the occasion with gains: the BSE Sensex has closed higher in 14 of the last 18 Muhurat sessions, including a 5.86 per cent rise in 2008 amid the global financial crisis. In 2024, it extended its winning run, gaining 335 points (0.42 per cent).Though the trading window lasts just an hour and often sees high volatility due to thin volumes, investors view the session as a ritual of renewal rather than a profit-making opportunity.","Muhurat trading marks the beginning of samvat 2082, ushering in a new hindu financial year marked by prosperity and optimism.

Poll Do you agree with Shahid Afridi's view on Afghanistan forgetting Pakistan's support? Yes, completely agree No, I disagree Not sure

Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi expressed disappointment with Afghanistan, saying it is regrettable that the country seems to have “forgotten Pakistan’s support.”“I did not expect it to be like this. For the past 50–60 years, we have been taking care of them. I personally look after nearly 350 Afghan families in Karachi,” Afridi told Pakistani media.He also highlighted Pakistan’s decades-long assistance, including hosting millions of refugees and providing direct help to families in need.“I believe that both are neighboring countries, and our message has always been to the people of Afghanistan that both sides should cooperate because we are Muslim countries,” he said.Without mentioning India directly, Afridi urged Afghan leaders to preserve the fraternal relationship and prevent outsiders from exploiting their land against Pakistan.“It is regrettable that instead of sitting down and discussing things directly, you went and shook hands with those who have been involved in terrorism inside Pakistan for a long time. We have always welcomed you, provided you a place, and people have lived, worked, and done business here.It is unfortunate that you went and shook hands with those who are carrying out terrorism inside our country.”The controversy comes after the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) pulled its team from a tri-series in Pakistan next month, following the deaths of three local cricketers in a Pakistani military strike. In a post on X, the ACB said that after the airstrikes, it decided not to send its team to Lahore and Rawalpindi for the November T20 tri-series, which also involved Sri Lanka. Zimbabwe has replaced Afghanistan.The deceased players — Kabeer, Sibghatullah, and Haroon — were returning home after a friendly match in Sharana, the capital of Paktika province.Earlier this month, Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited India for a week of talks — a previously unimaginable move.

FULL: Trump’s Shocking U-turn On Tomahawks After Putin’s Call | Watch Big Russia Announcement





US President Donald Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, a day after he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting came amid renewed efforts to end the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.“It’s an honour to be with a very strong leader, a man who has been through a lot,” Trump said as he welcomed Zelenskyy. “We’ve gotten along really very well.” He added that his recent call with Putin had been “productive” and that he believed “something can get done” to bring peace between the two countries.Trump said both leaders Putin and Zelenskyy “don’t like each other,” calling the hostility “tremendous bad blood.” “These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everyone,” he said. “So one way or another, we’ll be involved in talks, but it might need to be in separate settings.”Asked about military aid, Trump expressed hesitation over supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. “One of the reasons we want to get this war over is that it’s not easy for us to give massive numbers of very powerful weapons,” he said.“Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”He added, “We’d much rather have them not need Tomahawks. We’re in it to get the war over. We’re not in it to sell weapons.” Trump’s comments came after Putin reportedly warned that supplying long-range missiles could escalate the conflict and make peace talks harder.The meeting, their third in the Oval Office and sixth this year, also included discussions on Ukraine’s proposal to store US liquefied natural gas in its facilities.Before the lunch, Trump briefly joked about Zelenskyy’s “very stylish jacket,” referring to their earlier tense February meeting where the two had clashed on live television.Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his Middle East ceasefire efforts and urged him to use that to help end the war in Ukraine. “With your support, we can stop the war,” Zelenskyy said. “Their army and economy are weakened, and this is a crucial moment.” He also noted that he had met with American energy and defence companies “ready to assist after the attacks on our infrastructure.”Trump, who has frequently described himself as a peacemaker, said, “I solved eight wars. I’ve saved millions and millions of lives.” Referring to India and Pakistan, he added, “That would have been a bad one. But we solved it.” He said he hoped to make Ukraine “number nine.”After meeting Zelenskyy, Trump took to Truth Social to call for an immediate end to the war in Ukraine. Trump said it is time to let each side “claim victory” and allow history to judge. He added that the war would never have started under his leadership and urged leaders to bring troops home so families can live in peace.He wrote: ""The meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine was very interesting, and cordial, but I told him, as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin, that it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide! No more shooting, no more Death, no more vast and unsustainable sums of money spent. This is a War that would have never started if I were President. Thousands of people being slaughtered each and every week — NO MORE, GO HOME TO YOUR FAMILIES IN PEACE!""Speaking to journalists outside the White House after meeting President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said, “I think that Russia is afraid about Tomahawks, really afraid, because it’s a strong weapon.”",Us president donald trump met ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy at the white house on friday.
