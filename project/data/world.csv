Along Andhra Pradesh’s sweeping 974km coastline, the waves wash more than picturesque beaches and bustling fishing harbours. Beneath the dark, heavy sands — from Srikakulam in the north to Nellore in the south — lies one of India’s most valuable and underexploited geological assets: rare earth mineral reserves that could define the nation’s cleanenergy, defence and semiconductor future.These beach sands contain vast quantities of monazite, the primary source of rare earth elements (REEs) and thorium, along with ilmenite, rutile, zircon, garnet and sillimanite, making the state a rich natural repository of strategic minerals.What distinguishes Andhra’s reserves is not only their abundance, but also their grade. Monazite extracted along this coast carries 55-60% rare earth oxides — among the highest in global benchmarks — and 8-10% thorium, considered a potential fuel for India’s next-generation nuclear reactors.The ore houses a complete suite of light REEs such as lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium and gadolinium, elements that power permanent magnets essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, missile guidance, satellite systems, fibreoptics, superconductors and advanced medical diagnostics.The mineral-rich belt stretches like a continuous corridor. Geological surveys identify promising deposits at Bhimunipatnam, Kalingapatnam, Kakinada, Narsapur, Machilipatnam, Chirala, Vodarevu, Ramayapatnam and Dugarajapatnam, forming an uninterrupted chain of strategic material potential.Estimates by the Atomic Minerals Directorate and Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL) place India’s total deposits at over 300 million tonnes of heavy mineral sands (sand deposits rich in dense, valuable minerals like ilmenite, rutile and zircon), with 12-15 million tonnes of monazite, enough to support 40-50% of domestic rare earth requirements for decades.Andhra is estimated to hold 3035% of India’s monazite reserves.For long, these beaches have remained underutilised, overshadowed by concerns around atomic regulation, limited processing capacity and policy restrictions. Now, with global supply chains tightening and countries scrambling to diversify away from China — which controls nearly 85% of global REE processing capacity — the state has quietly moved into strategic focus.Recognising the opportunity, the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) has stepped up exploration and monetisation efforts with renewed urgency. The Centre has granted 16,000 hectares of beach sand-mining leases to the corporation, marking one of the largest allocations for any state. Of this, operational clearance has been issued for 1,000 hectares, recently allotted to a private developer through open tender. Encouraged by potential revenue prospects, the state has sought approval to open another 4,000 hectares, after which the corporation plans to scale out activities across the remaining 11,000 hectares on a fast-track basis.APMDC’s shift is not confined to mining. The focus now is on value addition within India — crucial because exporting raw ore leads to importing high-value end products at a steep cost. “We are concentrating on downstream processing facilities to make the country self-reliant,” APMDC managing director and senior IAS officer Pravin Kumar told TOI, underlining the state’s aggressive roadmap. “Exporting raw minerals forces us to import finished rare earth magnets, chips and components at a high premium. The Centre’s PLI (production-linked incentive) will be a game changer.”At present, monazite processing remains the exclusive domain of IREL, a Central PSU operating under atomic mineral regulations. Private players can mine associated minerals such as garnet, ilmenite and zircon but must hand over monazite to IREL after separation. To increase domestic refining capacity, IREL is establishing a 10,000-tonne-perannum monazite processing plant at Gudur, Nellore, scheduled for commissioning in 2026. Once operational, it is expected to become a central pillar of India’s REE value chain.In a major policy intervention aimed at cutting import dependence and accelerating green-tech manufacturing, the ministry of mines has rolled out guidelines for pilot projects to recover critical minerals — including REEs — from mining waste, red mud, fly ash and industrial tailings. The programme, approved under the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM), earmarks funding of up to Rs 100 crore from the National Mineral Exploration and Development Trust (NMEDT) for recovery-oriented R&D and commercial pilots.The mission targets securing domestic supply of 24 strategic minerals such as neodymium, dysprosium, yttrium and cobalt, vital for EV batteries, solar wafers, turbines and missiles. “These guidelines mark a pivotal step towards converting waste into wealth,” said Geetika Sharma, director (projects), NMEDT. Pilot studies may receive 90% central funding, enabling partnerships across PSUs, academia, startups and private mining companies.This policy push is particularly advantageous for Andhra Pradesh. Though placer deposits have for decades supported India’s titanium and zircon industries, enormous quantities of tailings with recoverable REEs, thorium and uranium have remained unprocessed due to lack of technology and regulatory clarity.Andhra Pradesh already possesses early-stage infrastructure that could scale with the new policy. A private REE-processing plant in Anantapur is operational and handles thousands of tonnes annually. IREL runs a beach sand separation plant in Visakhapatnam, generating tailings suited for rare earth extraction using hydrometallurgical and solvent-extraction techniques. Officials estimate that reprocessing alone could unlock a Rs 5,000-crore annual opportunity through circular extraction.“Our monazite reserves can yield dysprosium for EV magnets and terbium for high-performance turbines,” a senior mines and geology department official toldTo ensure accountability, proposals will be screened by an inter-ministerial project sanctioning committee, while technical validation will come from experts at IITBombay, IIT-ISM Dhanbad and CSIR-IMMT Bhubaneswar. Implementation pathways will be led by Jawaharlal Nehru Aluminium Research Development and Design Centre, Nagpur for mining waste recovery projects and Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), under the Centre’s department of science and technology, for tech-driven pilots.The Andhra government is preparing applications to recover REEs from thermal plant fly ash in Nellore and Krishnapatnam, known to contain trace rare earths. Collaboration possibilities with IIT-Hyderabad, National Mineral Processing Laboratory (Jamshedpur) and geologists are being explored, especially around bio-leaching and electrochemical extraction.Scientists say tailings (ore residues) at Andhra Pradesh and comparable IREL operations in Kerala suggest that over 80% REE extraction is achievable with modern technology.DAR Subramanyam, a retired economics professor from Acharya Nagarjuna University, noted that rapid scale-ups can reduce India’s import dependence from 95% to nearly 50% within five years, provided commercial plants are deployed under the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) framework.With global REE demand expected to grow tenfold by 2030, Andhra stands positioned to emerge as the country’s critical-mineral capital.The first call for proposals under the PLI window is expected shortly, signalling what experts describe as the beginning of a mineral renaissance on the state’s shoreline.From being a silent geological marvel, Andhra’s beaches are on the cusp of powering India’s transition to clean mobility, renewable energy and advanced electronics. The sands are no longer just a coastal landscape — they are India’s next strategic frontier.","Andhra pradesh holds 3035% of india’s monazite reserves.

MEA: Reasons are ‘personal’, diaspora an asset





No dual citizenship a key factor





Post-Covid surge, not just backlog





Who is leaving - and why





Remittances high, but concerns persist





NEW DELHI: Close to one million Indians have renounced their citizenship over the last five years, with annual numbers crossing the two-lakh mark consistently since 2022, according to data presented by the government in Parliament.The trend has reignited a crucial question why a growing number of Indians - particularly the wealthy and highly skilled - are choosing to give up their Indian passports.Responding to questions raised by Congress MP KC Venugopal in the Lok Sabha, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that 2.06 lakh Indians gave up citizenship in 2024, following 2.16 lakh in 2023 and 2.25 lakh in 2022. Earlier, 1.63 lakh renunciations were recorded in 2021, while the figure stood at 85,256 in 2020, the lowest in a decade due to Covid-related disruptions.Between 2011 and 2024, a total of over 20.6 lakh Indians renounced citizenship, with nearly half of them doing so in just the last five years, the government presented data during the ongoing winter session showed.Venugopal sought details on whether the government had studied the reasons behind the rising trend and what steps were being taken to curb citizenship renunciation, particularly among younger Indians.The issue has also been raised by other opposition leaders in recent years, who have flagged what they describe as a growing “exit of the successful” from India.Leading opposition members including TMC MP Mahua Moitra have previously as well questioned the government as to why people are renouncing Indian passports. During a debate on the economy she had asked whether this indicated a ""healthy economic environment"" or a ""healthy tax environment"". Moitra alleged that an ""atmosphere of terror"" created by the enforcement directorate (ED), with investigations primarily targeting opposition leaders and businessmen, was a contributing factor.Sanjaya Baru, media adviser to former PM Manmohan Singh, in his book ‘Secession of the Successful’, argued that India is witnessing a fourth wave of emigration, marked by the departure of high net worth individuals (HNIs), their families, and elite professionals. Citing Morgan Stanley data, Baru noted that around 23,000 Indian millionaires left the country between 2014 and 2023.Opposition leaders have repeatedly questioned whether rising wealth migration reflects concerns over quality of life, governance, education, taxation and long-term security, especially when compared to developed economies.In its written reply, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said the reasons for renunciation are personal and known only to the individuals concerned.“The Government recognises the potential of the global workplace in an era of knowledge economy,” the MEA said, adding that a successful and influential Indian diaspora is an asset. It added that the government’s focus was on engaging the diaspora and leveraging its expertise and soft power, rather than discouraging overseas citizenship.The MEA also placed on record a list of 135 countries whose citizenship Indians have acquired, underlining the global spread of the trend.One of the most cited reasons for Indians giving up citizenship is India’s lack of dual citizenship. Under Section 9 of the Citizenship Act, 1955, any Indian who voluntarily acquires foreign citizenship automatically loses Indian citizenship.For Indians abroad, citizenship often decides access to voting rights, social security, permanent residence, public-sector employment and legal protections. While Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status allows visa-free travel and limited economic rights, it does not give much of political rights.As a result, many long-term migrants - especially those with families - are left with little choice but to formally renounce Indian citizenship.While the sharp jump in 2022 was partly attributed to pandemic-era backlogs, the continuation of high numbers in 2023 and 2024 suggests a new baseline, analysts say.Before the pandemic, annual renunciations largely remained within a range of 1.2 lakh to 1.45 lakh for nearly a decade.Though occupation-wise data is not available, global studies show that Indians form one of the world’s largest skilled migrant populations. According to the UN, India has remained the largest source country of international migrants, with a diaspora of 17.5 million as of 2019.In the US alone, 81 per cent of Indian immigrants aged 25 and above hold at least a bachelor’s degree, significantly higher than both native-born and other immigrant groups, according to the Migration Policy Institute.Migrants often cite better pay, cleaner environments, reliable infrastructure, stronger civic services, education systems and clearer pathways to residency and citizenship abroad. For many, citizenship becomes the final step in a long migration journey that begins with education and employment.India remains the world’s top recipient of remittances, receiving an estimated $125 billion in 2023, according to the World Bank. However, opposition leaders argue that the steady outflow of citizens/ brain drain - especially among the affluent and skilled - calls for the need for reforms in urban living conditions, public health, education, social security and income parity.As renunciation numbers moves upwards of two lakh annually, the issue is likely to remain a political and policy flashpoint, particularly amid concerns over talent retention and long-term economic competitiveness.","Government: 2.06 lakh indians gave up citizenship in 2024, following 2.16 lakh in 2023 and 2.25 lakh in 2022.

India Flags Pakistan Role In Bangladesh Protests, Backs Awami League Demand For Free & Fair Polls

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary standing committee on external affairs has warned that India is facing its most significant strategic challenge since the 1971 war, due to the evolving political and security situation in Bangladesh, pointing to the resurgence of Islamist forces, weakening domestic political structures and growing influence of China and Pakistan in Dhaka.The committee on Thursday tabled its 9th report titled ‘Future of India-Bangladesh Relationship’ in the Lok Sabha. The panel, chaired by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , said that while the situation does not pose an immediate existential threat to India, it represents a deeper, long-term strategic test with implications for regional stability and India’s neighbourhood policy.“India faces its greatest strategic challenge in Bangladesh since the Liberation war of 1971. While the challenge in 1971 was existential, a humanitarian and a birth of a new nation, the latter was of a graver, a generational discontinuity, a shift of political order, and a potential strategic realignment away from India,” the report said quoting an expert.The committee took into account multiple testimonies from government officials and non-governmental experts, the panel also noted that Bangladesh’s ongoing political transition and shifting external alignments could reshape India’s security and foreign policy environment over time.According to the panel, a key source of uncertainty is the declining political dominance of the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League. While the party secured 224 of 300 seats in the January 2024 elections, the panel flagged an estimated voter turnout of around 40 per cent, which raises concerns over popular participation, political legitimacy, institutional control and public confidence.On the stay of former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina in India the panel said, ""The Committee note that the stay of former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, in the country and India's approach in this regard is guided by its civilisational ethos and humanitarian tradition of offering refuge to individuals facing circumstances of grave distress or existential threat,"" the report said.”The panel recommended that the government should ""continue to uphold its principled and humanitarian approach"", consistent with India's values and international responsibilities, while ensuring that such situations are ""managed with due sensitivity"".The committee also pointed towards the emergence of youth-led nationalist sentiment alongside a renewed presence of Islamist groups, warning that the combination could act as a destabilising force with implications for both Bangladesh’s internal security and the wider region.Another major concern flagged by the panel is the expanding footprint of China and Pakistan in Bangladesh. It said these developments could dilute India’s traditional influence in Dhaka and complicate New Delhi’s strategic calculus in its immediate neighbourhood.“...The event was marked by collapse of Awami League dominance, the surge of youth-led nationalism, the re-entry of Islamists and intensifying Chinese and Pakistani influence collectively..if India fails to recalibrate at this moment, it risks losing strategic space in Dhaka not to war, but to irrelevance,” report added.The ministry of external affairs told the committee that India has made concerted efforts to insulate bilateral ties from recent political developments and to continue engagement with Bangladesh’s interim government, while supporting the wishes of the Bangladeshi people.On the question of collaboration between both nations, the route through SAARC and BIMSTEC also came up to which the foreign secretary told the panel, until Pakistan changes its state policy of cross border terrorism there can be no conversation around reviving SAARC.“We have made it very clear to anybody and everybody in SAARC who is coming up to us with proposals for reviving it that we cannot have dialogue and terrorism go on at the same time. Until Pakistan changes its policy of crossborder terrorism as an instrument of State policy, there is no possibility of going forward with SAARC. I did make the point also that BIMSTEC does pretty much everything that SAARC does and then some other things and since the organisation is headquartered in Dhaka, it would be useful if Bangladesh takes it forward. I must say that there was no pushback against it….” the report quoted foreign secretaryThe panel, however, questioned why Indian authorities failed to anticipate the political crisis despite what it described as warning signals and extensive media reporting ahead of the developments. In response, the government said the situation in Bangladesh is being monitored on a priority basis with continuous assessments underway.Concluding its report, the committee stressed that Bangladesh’s evolving political trajectory and external alignments would require sustained attention from India, given the country’s central role in regional stability.In its suggestions the committee said, “The Committee urge the Government to continue advocating a democratic, stable, peaceful, people-centric, forward-looking and inclusive Bangladesh, firmly anchored in the spirit of 1971 and mutual respect. The Committee further recommend that the Government should maintain sustained diplomatic engagement with all political, social, and civil society stakeholders in Bangladesh to foster an environment of trust and dialogue. Such engagement should be complemented by Track II and Track 1.5 diplomacy, involving Parliamentary exchanges, think tanks, academia, media, and cultural organizations, to strengthen people-to-people connections and counter misperceptions.”",A parliamentary standing committee on external affairs has warned that india is facing its most significant strategic challenge since the 1971 war.

Dhaka assures foreign missions of 'robust security'

NEW DELHI: India resumed operations at its visa application centre in Bangladesh's Dhaka on Thursday, a day after the facility was temporarily shut following a march by a large group of anti-India protesters towards the Indian High Commission, which was stopped by police.“The Indian Visa Application Centre (IVAC) in Dhaka is now operational and functioning normally,” an IVAC official told news agency PTI.However, the visa facilities in Khulna and Rajshahi were closed due to ""security concerns."" In a notice on its website, the IVAC said, “In view of the ongoing security situation, IVAC Rajshahi and Khulna will remain closed today. All applicants with appointments scheduled for today will be allotted fresh slots at a later date.”Bangladesh has five visa centres for those applying to travel to India. While the Dhaka centre - located at Jamuna Future Park in the country's capital and largest city - and the IVAC in Chattogram - the second-largest city - are currently operational, the facilities in Khulna and Rajshahi are closed. The fifth one is in Sylhet.Earlier on Wednesday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) summoned Bangladesh's high commissioner to India, Riaz Hamidullah, and conveyed its “strong concern” over announcements by certain extremist elements to create a security situation around the Indian mission in Dhaka.“We expect the interim government to ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations,” the MEA said, adding that the envoy was apprised of India’s “strong concerns about the deteriorating security environment in Bangladesh.”Hamidullah was also told that New Delhi expects the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government to ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations.In Dhaka, hundreds of protesters under the banner of “July Oikya” (July Unity) began a march towards the Indian High Commission on Wednesday afternoon, raising anti-India slogans and pressing several demands, including an end to what they described as “anti-Bangladesh conspiracies” and the return of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.Hasina fled Bangladesh last year following the student-led “July Uprising” against her government. After resigning and leaving the country on August 5, she has since been living in New Delhi.Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s foreign secretary, Asad Alam Siam, met foreign diplomats on Thursday, assuring them of the security of their missions and the maintenance of law and order ahead of the national election scheduled for February 12 next year, the Daily Star reported Foreign diplomats were also informed that the Election Commission would ""welcome"" election observers from abroad.Around 40 diplomats from the embassies located in Dhaka were present at the briefing.","India resumed operations at its visa application centre in bangladesh's dhaka on thursday.

India Speeds Up Visas For Chinese Businesses Amid Thaw In Ties; Beijing Calls It 'Positive Move'

China is reportedly pressing ahead with a massive hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, a move that experts and officials warn could seriously endanger water security, ecology and livelihoods downstream in India. As the river enters India as the Brahmaputra, any large-scale intervention upstream is seen as a direct risk to millions who depend on its natural flow.According to CNN, the proposed $168bn hydropower system will harness a steep 2,000 metre drop in altitude through an intricate network of dams, reservoirs, tunnels and underground power stations.For India, the concern is not just environmental.Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu had warned that the project could be used as a “ticking water bomb”, with China potentially controlling the timing and volume of water released into the Brahmaputra. Sudden discharges could trigger floods, while withholding water could dry out large stretches of the river during critical periods.Minister of state for external affairs, Kirti Vardhan Singh in August had issued a statement on the project stating that they are consistently monitoring the developments related to the Brahmaputra river.""The Government of India has taken note of reports about the commencement of construction of the mega dam project by China on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo (upper reaches of the Brahmaputra) River in Tibet.This project was first made public as far back as 1986 and since then, preparations have been underway in China,"" the MEA had stated in response to an unstarred question in the Rajya Sabha.The MEA said that the government remained committed to safeguarding Indian interests in the region.""Government carefully monitors all developments relating to the Brahmaputra river, including plans by China to develop hydropower projects, and takes necessary measures to protect our interests, including preventive and corrective measures to safeguard life and livelihood of Indian citizens residing in downstream areas,"" the statement said.Much of the Brahmaputra’s water comes from monsoon rains and tributaries within India. However, CNN reports expert's claim that upstream manipulation can still disturb the river’s natural rhythm. Even limited changes could affect fertile floodplains, fisheries and groundwater recharge across Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, regions already vulnerable to climate stress.China has dismissed these concerns, as the Chinese foreign ministry has insisted that downstream countries will not be adversely affected.The technical scale of the project has also heightened fears. CNN quotes Brian Eyler, director of the Energy, Water and Sustainability Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, has described it as the most sophisticated hydropower system ever attempted, but also one of the riskiest.Any failure or miscalculation in such a seismically sensitive and ecologically fragile region could have cascading consequences downstream.Beijing’s management of the Mekong River has drawn repeated criticism from downstream nations, which accuse Chinese dam operators of worsening droughts by regulating water flow to suit power generation needs.The upstream developments have prompted India’s largest state-run hydropower company to push ahead with its own 11,200-megawatt project on the Brahmaputra, a move driven partly by fears of losing strategic and water security ground.Experts warn that competing mega projects on the same river system could worsen risks for both countries. Without cooperation and transparency, analysts caution, a dam-building race between India and China could undermine regional stability and place the future of the Brahmaputra and the millions who rely on it in jeopardy.","China is reportedly pressing ahead with a massive hydropower project on the yarlung tsangpo river in tibet.

From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday gave its nod to the the nuclear energy bill called the ""Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill (SHANTI), 2025"". The bill was passed as opposition staged a walkout, during the ongoing Winter Session.The amended bill was tabled in the lower house, with introduction by MoS for department of atomic energy Jitendra Singh in the House on Monday, signifying a policy shift in the atomic sector operations. The bill allows entry of private players into the industry, something that was reserved for government enterprises till now. Singh said that it provides for “a pragmatic civil liability regime for nuclear damage and to confer statutory status to Atomic Energy Regulatory Board. ""The proposed legislation further aims to facilitate significant growth in nuclear energy and its applications across multiple sectors. This aligns with country's target to establish 100GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. The law introduces fresh regulatory provisions encompassing updated safety protocols, a specialised nuclear tribunal for resolving disputes, and modifications to the nuclear liability framework to limit risks and encourage investments.The proposed legislation permits private enterprises and their collaborative ventures to seek authorisation for establishing and running nuclear facilities, as well as transporting nuclear fuel. However, crucial operations including uranium enrichment, spent fuel handling and heavy water manufacturing shall continue to be exclusively managed by the Central government. The Centre will maintain oversight of radioactive materials and radiation-producing apparatus to ensure proper safety standards.","The bill was passed as opposition staged a walkout, during the ongoing winter session.

Why Ashy Bines’ Bondi post made followers angry





Australian influencer Ashy Bines, 37, is under fire after a social media post linked the deadly Bondi Beach terror attack to promotion of her paid wellbeing program. The attack shocked the nation and left families grieving after 15 people were killed and 40 others were sent to hospital during a Hanukkah gathering at Bondi Beach on December 14.Soon after the attack, Bines shared a post on Instagram talking about how hard the day felt for Australians. She wrote, “I feel everyone in Australia is waking up feeling sick just thinking about everyone impacted by Bondi. May we support one another and never forget the power of kindness in times like these.”However, the post also directed her one million followers to sign up for her Rise Inside podcast and wellbeing program, which costs $50 a month, if they were feeling “wobbly.” This is where the backlash began.Ashy Bines added another message saying, “If I’m ever feeling anxious feelings and wanting to feel more calm, it’s nice to know in less than five minutes that can all change with stopping, breath, connection.” She then promoted four short calming meditations from her paid program.Many followers felt the influencer crossed a line by promoting a paid service while talking about a national tragedy. The comments section quickly filled with anger. One person wrote, “Does anyone else find it really bad taste and just gross that Ashy Bines is using the awful terrorist attack in Bondi to advertise her Rise Inside subscription?”Another added, “Any influencer using this tragedy to pivot or push a business or product should go straight in the bin.Absolutely foul.” Others said using the word “wobbly” to describe the feelings of victims and families was upsetting.After the strong backlash, the post was deleted. Bines has not made a public statement responding to the criticism.The Bondi Beach terror attack was described as Australia’s worst mass shooting in three decades. It targeted Jewish families celebrating Hanukkah. Among the victims was 10-year-old Matilda, remembered by her teacher as “bright, joyful, and spirited.” Her parents spoke for the first time at a candlelight vigil, calling her “the most kindest person, child ever.”Rabbi Eli Schlanger lost his cousin in the attack. His cousin was described as “vivacious, optimistic and full of energy and life.” Hundreds gathered to mourn the victims, including at Matilda’s funeral on December 18.As the country continues to grieve, many online say this moment called for silence and respect, not promotion.Also Read: Who is influencer Ash Trevino?

Why it's a concern for India





Sharif Osman Hadi, youth leader of Bangladesh’s 2024 uprising has died in Singapore after succumbing to injuries sustained in an assassination attempt, officials said on Thursday.Hadi, who was the spokesperson of political platform Inqilab Mancho, was critically wounded after being shot by unidentified assailants in Dhaka on December 12. He was first taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and later shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition deteriorated.He was airlifted to Singapore last week for advanced medical treatment and admitted to the Singapore General Hospital’s Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit.Confirming his death, Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement: “Despite the best efforts of the doctors, Mr (Sharif Osman) Hadi succumbed to his injuries.” Medical teams from the Singapore General Hospital and the National Neuroscience Institute treated him but were unable to save his life.The Singapore foreign ministry said it is assisting the Bangladesh High Commission in the country with arrangements to repatriate Hadi’s body to Bangladesh.Inqilab Mancho announced Hadi’s death in a social media post late Thursday night, saying he passed away after fighting for his life for six days, as reported by Bangladesh news channel Daily Star.Hadi was an aspiring independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency and emerged as a prominent figure following the 2024 “July uprising” that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The shooting triggered strong political reactions in Bangladesh, coming days after the parliamentary election schedule was announced on February 12.Bangladesh’s chief adviser Muhammad Yunus condemned the attack, calling election-related violence “completely unacceptable.”“No form of violence intended to disrupt the election will be tolerated. The incident is a worrying development for the country’s political landscape,” Yunus had said.Investigations into the attack are ongoing, with several suspects detained for questioning by Bangladeshi authorities.Bangladesh had summoned India's high commissioner last week to demand cooperation in the attempted assassination case of Hadi.Dhaka specifically raised concerns regarding the ""attempted assassination"" and sought India's cooperation to prevent suspects involved in the attack from escaping into Indian territory and requested that if they manage to cross the border, India should ensure their ""immediate apprehension and extradition"".Days after the attack, the Muhammad Yunus administration in Dhaka sought India's help to arrest and hand over the shooters.New Delhi has, however, strongly rejected the allegations that the attackers had any connection with India.The MEA, in a statement, had stated that India categorically rejects the assertions made by the interim government of Bangladesh in its press note dated December 14 about the attack on radical leader Sharif Osman Hadi, the spokesperson of the Anti-Sheikh Hasina Inqilab Manch.""We have consistently reiterated our position in favour of free, fair, inclusive and credible elections being held in Bangladesh in a peaceful atmosphere,"" the MEA statement said.""India has never allowed its territory to be used for activities inimical to the interests of the friendly people of Bangladesh,"" the statement added.""We expect that the interim government of Bangladesh will take all necessary measures for ensuring internal law and order, including for the purpose of holding peaceful elections,"" the statement said.","Sharif osman hadi, youth leader of bangladesh’s 2024 uprising has died in singapore.

Sharif Osman Hadi's death fuel outrage







Bangladesh descended into widespread unrest overnight after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader of the country’s 2024 pro-democracy uprising.Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Dhaka late Thursday and early Friday, demanding justice for Hadi, who died in a Singapore hospital after succumbing to gunshot injuries sustained in an assassination attempt last week.Demonstrations spread from Dhaka to other parts of the country, with protesters attempting to march toward Indian diplomatic premises and attacking properties linked to the former ruling Awami League.Protesters in the southwestern city of Rajshahi tried to march toward the office of a regional Indian diplomat, but police stopped the procession. Several videos on social media showed incident of stone pelting near Indian assistant High Commission office.In Dhaka on Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators attempted to gather outside Indian diplomatic premises, including the residence of India’s deputy high commissioner, prompting police to use tear gas to disperse the crowd.Members of the National Citizen Party (NCP), a major offshoot of Students Against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year’s protests, joined the demonstrations, chanting anti-India slogans and alleging that Hadi’s assailants had fled to India after the killing.Protest leaders called on the interim government to shut the Indian High Commission until the suspects were returned.“The interim government, until India returns assassins of Hadi Bhai, the Indian High Commission to Bangladesh will remain closed. Now or Never. We are in a war!,” PTI quoted Sarjis Alm, a key leader of NCP, as saying.The protests came hours after a parliamentary committee on external affairs called the current situation in the neighbouring nation ""complex and evolving"".""The committee has been informed that the current situation in Bangladesh is complex and evolving. There is uncertainty regarding the schedule of democratic elections. The political events of August 2024 have created significant instability and uncertainty with incidents of violence, attacks and intimidation of minorities, tribal communities, media groups, intellectuals, journalists, academicians, etc. , becoming the norm,"" it said in its report titled 'Future of India-Bangladesh Relationship'.Several buildings in the capital were set ablaze as the protests escalated, including offices housing the country’s two largest newspapers, Prothom Alo and The Daily Star.Fire officials confirmed at least three incidents of arson, with journalists and staff trapped inside the buildings as firefighters battled the flames, according to media reports.""Several hundred demonstrators reached the Prothom Alo office around 11 pm and later surrounded the building,” PTI quoted a witness saying, who added that the protesters then set the Daily Star office on fire.The violence quickly spread beyond the capital. Protesters torched an Awami League office in Rajshahi and vandalised properties linked to former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India after being ousted in last year’s uprising.Demonstrators also blocked a key highway connecting Dhaka with Mymensingh and attacked the residence of a former minister in the southeastern city of Chittagong, according to local media footage.Hadi, 32, was a senior leader of the student-led platform Inqilab Mancha and a vocal critic of both Hasina. He was shot by masked assailants on December 12 while leaving a mosque in central Dhaka and was later airlifted to Singapore for advanced medical treatment, where he succumbed to his injuries on Thursday.Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus described Hadi’s death as an “irreparable loss for the nation,” announced a day of mourning, and ordered special prayers nationwide.Police have launched a nationwide manhunt for the attackers, releasing photographs of two suspects and offering a reward of five million taka for information leading to their arrest, as authorities warned that the violence risked destabilising the fragile political transition.","Bangladesh descended into widespread unrest overnight after the death of sharif osman hadi, a prominent youth leader of the country’s 2024 pro-democracy uprising.

Viral claim about Patrick Mahomes political speech falls apart under scrutiny

A controversial rumor involving Patrick Mahomes went viral on social media this week, pulling NFL fans into a political story that felt bigger than football. The claim suggested the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback had delivered a fiery speech attacking Us President Donald Trump at a charity fundraiser, just hours after the Chiefs were knocked out of the playoff race. Given Mahomes’ public image and his history of avoiding political statements, the post immediately raised eyebrows among fans.The post went viral on X, with its strong language and emotional quotes grabbing all the attention. Thousands shared it before stopping to ask whether it was actually true or not. Where was the video? Who witnessed the speech? And why hadn’t any credible outlet reported it?The claim originated from a single X post that framed the moment as breaking news. It alleged that Mahomes spoke at a charity fundraiser for Bondi Beach attack victims and publicly slammed Trump’s priorities. The post opened with this line: “BREAKING: Patrick Mahomes BLASTS Trump for Building a Gaudy Ballroom While Americans Go Hungry and Lose Healthcare — ‘If You Can’t See a Doctor, Don’t Worry, He will Save You a Dance in His Ballroom. ’”The thread went further, painting a picture of Mahomes at a microphone in an emotional setting.Several quotes were attributed to him, including: “While families are choosing between food and medicine, he’s busy choosing chandeliers,” and again, “If you can’t see a doctor, don’t worry — he will save you a dance in his ballroom.” It ended with a final alleged statement: “America doesn’t need another ballroom. We need a backbone. ”Despite how detailed the post looked, there is no proof any of it actually did happen. No video or audio has surfaced. There is no transcript. No eyewitness accounts exist. Event organizers have not confirmed such a fundraiser, and no major sports or political outlet has reported Mahomes making these remarks.That absence matters. Mahomes is one of the most visible athletes in the world. Any real political speech from him would almost certainly be recorded, shared, and covered widely within minutes. Instead, the entire story relies on a single social media account and dramatic quotes with no independent verification.There are also timeline problems. The post claims the speech happened shortly after the Chiefs’ playoff elimination, yet there is no record of Mahomes attending or speaking at any event during that window.With no evidence, no confirmation, and no credible reporting, the viral post is now being treated as false.","Viral tweet claims patrick mahomes blasted donald trump.

Why Natalia Bryant filed for a civil harassment restraining order

Natalia Bryant points to public event as proof of continued fixation

Natalia Bryant’s restraining order against an alleged stalker has been extended, keeping long-standing court protections firmly in place. The ruling comes after Bryant asked the court to reassess the situation as the original order approached its end. First granted in 2022, the order was designed to block all contact and maintain distance from her home, school, and daily activities.In her recent filing, Bryant pointed to new events that she says show the issue has not faded with time. The court’s decision to extend the order reflects continued concern over compliance and personal safety. Rather than closing the case, the extension underscores that the legal system still views the risk as unresolved.Natalia's‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ mess with Dwayne Kemp originated in December 2020 at a time when she was only 17 years old and a senior at the Sage Hill School in Newport Coast, California. The information available at the court reveals that Kemp, who was 32 years old and lived in Sun Valley, California at the time, started sending her a ridiculous number of unwanted messages via social media, behaving ""as if we had a romantic relationship,or as if he wanted to pursue one,"" Natalia said in her first ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌petition.Kemp was messaging Natalia over and over, wanting to meet face-to-face and visit her at school. There was even a time when he showed up uninvited at her high school during her senior year, and school officials had to step in and escort him away.Natalia's lawyers labeled his actions as harassment, mentioning that he kept trying to reach her even after she blocked him on social media.By November 2022, at the age of 19 and enrolled at the University of Southern California (USC), Natalia found herself in a really tough spot. She decided to file for a civil harassment restraining order in Los Angeles County Superior Court, aiming to ensure that Kemp stayed at least 200 yards away from her home, workplace, school, vehicle, sorority house, and the USC campus.In her declaration, Natalia recounted Kemp's ""unsettling"" actions from the previous months, which included two attempts to visit her at USC.Court documents from that filing revealed some troubling details about Kemp's past. Natalia claimed he was a ""gun enthusiast,"" sharing screenshots of his social media where he was seen with guns.Kemp's‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ behavior returned to the center of attention, highlighting his violations of the order in a bold, public way, just as the order was expiring. A court document states that on August 24, 2025, he wildly and publicly defied the court order by crashing an event of Natalia's, targeted at her employer believed to be the one glad her modeling career, for the sole purpose of getting to her with the goal of contacting ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌her. ""Kemp arrived with flowers he planned to give directly to Natalia. When he couldn't spot her at the event, he opted to search for her mom, Vanessa Bryant, hoping to pass the bouquet along with some instructions for it to reach Natalia.In her filing from November 2025 to extend the order, Natalia described this act as ""demonstrating his continued fixation and complete disregard"" for the restraining order.Security staff stepped in before Kemp could pull it off, and he then confessed that what he was doing would break the rules.But he argued that it was okay now because he ""believed (mistakenly) that the order had expired,"" according to the court records. This event, outlined in papers acquired by TMZ Sports, triggered Natalia's renewal request, which she submitted just a few weeks later in November 2025.The event not only broke the rules about space and contact but also brought to light Kemp's ongoing fantasy of a romantic relationship, a theme that's been there since his first interactions five years ago.Also Read: Surprised Caitlin Clark gave 5 word reaction to Stephen Curry’s insane pregame shot",Natalia bryant's restraining order against an alleged stalker has been extended.

"'Lolita', Bill Gates and passports: New Epstein photos released — what they reveal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lolita-bill-gates-and-passports-new-epstein-photos-released-what-they-reveal/articleshow/126067829.cms,"



After Donald Trump , several other celebrities have now become the new target of the House Oversight Committee as Democrats released new photos from Jeffrey Epstein ’s estate on Thursday, on the eve of the Department of Justice’s deadline to release all of its files on his case.The Committee released around 70 photographs, drawn from Epstein’s computer and email accounts, there were among 95,000 handed over by Epstein’s estate last week and were provided to the committee without context. They shed further light on his lifestyle and social circles.One image shows former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. Another features Noam Chomsky seated beside Epstein on a plane.Several photographs depict a social gathering over a meal and include faces of powerful or public figures, among them Epstein. A separate image, apparently from the same room, shows Google co-founder Sergey Brin beside New York Times columnist David Brooks.A New York Times spokesperson said in a statement, “As a journalist, David Brooks regularly attends events to speak with noted and important business leaders to inform his columns, which is exactly what happened at this 2011 event.Mr. Brooks had no contact with him before or after this single attendance at a widely-attended dinner.”Several images in the new release show Epstein with women whose faces have been redacted. One photograph appears to show three women with Epstein beside an open computer, one of the women with her arm around his shoulder. Another shows Epstein seated on a plane, pointing out a window while a woman sits closely beside him; her face has also been obscured.Some photos in this batch offer close-ups of a foot and a neck, both inscribed in black pen with quotes from the book Lolita.Additional items include identification cards or passports of several unidentified people from countries such as Russia and the Czech Republic, a hand holding open Epstein’s own passport, and what appears to be a screenshot of text messages saying ""I will send u girls now"",” with another one showing an unknown sender writing, “Maybe someone would be good for J?” and including the age and body measurements for an unidentified person. There is also a hand holding a drug bottle labelled for phenazopyridine, a generic analgesia used to relieve urinary tract pain and burning.The latest cache of photographs comes a day before the Justice Department’s deadline to release the Epstein files, after Congress mandated the information be made public.Rep. Robert Garcia, Democratic ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement Thursday, “Oversight Democrats will continue to release photographs and documents from the Epstein estate to provide transparency for the American people.” He added, “As we approach the deadline for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, these new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession. We must end this White House cover-up, and the DOJ must release the Epstein files now.”",The house oversight committee released around 70 photographs drawn from epstein’s computer and email accounts.

TikTok row: US joint venture deal signed to avert Chinese ownership ban; ByteDance's stake capped at 19.9%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tiktok-row-us-joint-venture-deal-signed-to-avert-chinese-ownership-ban-bytedances-stake-capped-at-19-9/articleshow/126068476.cms,"Representative image

TikTok has signed a joint venture agreement with major investors to keep its platform running in the United States and avoid a potential ban linked to its Chinese ownership, according to an internal memo seen by news agency AFP.TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew told employees that the company and its parent ByteDance have agreed to form a new US-based entity, backed by Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investor MGX.The deal is aimed at meeting the requirements of a 2024 US law that mandates the sale of TikTok’s American operations or a shutdown of the app.Under the arrangement, American and global investors will hold just over 80 per cent of the new joint venture, while ByteDance will retain a 19.9 per cent stake — the maximum ownership allowed for a Chinese company under the law, reported Reuters.Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX will each own 15 per cent, while affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will hold around 30 per cent.Chew said the US joint venture would operate as an independent entity with authority over “US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance”.He added that the venture would have “the exclusive right and authority to provide assurances that content, software and data for American users is secure”, as per AFP.Oracle will serve as TikTok’s “trusted security partner”, responsible for auditing compliance and safeguarding sensitive US user data, which will be stored on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure in the United States, Reuters reported.The new entity will also oversee certain commercial operations, including advertising, marketing and e-commerce, while TikTok’s US entities will manage global product interoperability.The agreement is set to close on January 22, 2026, though Chew told staff that more work remains before completion.The memo marks the first confirmation that TikTok has formally signed on to a deal framework unveiled by the White House in September, AFP noted.The move follows years of pressure from US lawmakers, who have argued that TikTok could be used by Beijing to access Americans’ data or influence public opinion through its algorithm.US President Donald Trump, who initially pushed for a ban during his first term, repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law through executive orders since his return to the White House.He has credited TikTok, which has over 170 million US users, with helping him win re-election.Trump has publicly backed the new arrangement, previously naming Oracle founder Larry Ellison — a longtime ally — as a key figure in the deal.Ellison has recently re-emerged in the spotlight through major media and technology investments, AFP reported.The deal has drawn criticism from some US politicians. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said there were still unanswered questions, accusing Trump of allowing a “billionaire takeover” of TikTok, as reported by Reuters.Despite the concerns, analysts quoted by Reuters said the agreement is likely to clear regulatory hurdles, given the level of involvement by the White House in shaping the transaction.",Tiktok has signed a joint venture agreement with major investors to keep its platform running in the united states.

Australia will observe a national day of reflection on Sunday (December 21), one week after the deadly Bondi Beach mass shooting that killed 15 people, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Friday, as he urged the country to reject “hatred and violence”.Albanese called on Australians to light candles at 6:47 pm local time, marking the exact moment the attack unfolded.“It is a moment to pause, reflect, and affirm that hatred and violence will never define who we are as Australians,” he said.Flags on New South Wales and Australian government buildings will be flown at half-staff, reported CNN.The attack, described as Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly three decades, took place on Sunday evening during a beachside Hanukkah celebration.Authorities have said the assault was antisemitic in nature. Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed, 24, are accused of carrying out the shooting. Sajid was killed in a gunfight with police, while Naveed survived and has been charged with 15 counts of murder, an act of terrorism, and multiple other offences, according to news agency AFP.Albanese said there was “something wrong with the licensing laws” that allowed Sajid Akram to legally own six long-barrelled, high-powered rifles.He announced a sweeping national gun buy-back scheme aimed at removing newly banned and illegal firearms from private ownership, reported CNN.Calling it the biggest gun buy-back since 1996, Albanese said hundreds of thousands of weapons were expected to be collected and destroyed. States and territories will handle collection and payments, while federal police will destroy the firearms.The prime minister also pledged tougher measures to combat antisemitism, including new powers to target extremist preachers and to cancel or refuse visas for people who spread hate and division. “It is clear we need to do more to combat this evil scourge,” Albanese said.Emotional scenes played out at Bondi Beach on Friday as hundreds of locals swam into the ocean in a show of solidarity. “They slaughtered innocent victims… and being part of my community again brings back the light,” security consultant Jason Carr said, as per AFP.Others described the gathering as carrying a “beautiful energy” amid grief and anger.Meanwhile, Sydney remains on high alert. Police said they detained two carloads of men following a tip-off about a possible “violent act”, though no direct link to the Bondi attack has been established.Authorities are also investigating whether the accused were inspired by the Islamic State group, with Albanese saying intelligence agencies had identified online ISIS-linked material reinforcing that assessment.",Australia will observe a national day of reflection on sunday (december 21) one week after the deadly bondi beach mass shooting that killed 15 people. Prime minister anthony albanese called on australians to light candles at 6:47 pm local time. Flags on new south wales and australian government buildings will be flown at half-staff.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126067866,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-861263,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Brown University shooting: Who is Claudio Manuel Neves-Valente? Suspected gunman from Portugal found dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brown-university-shooting-who-is-claudio-manuel-neves-valente-suspected-gunman-from-portugal-found-dead/articleshow/126068081.cms,"



The suspected shooter in the Brown University shooting was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to Fox News.According to the officers, the suspect was identified as Claudio Manuel Neves-Valente, a 48-year-old Brown University student and Portuguese national from Miami, Florida.The authorities have released the photo of the suspect.On Thursday, authorities told CBS sources they were probing connections between the Brown University shooting and the death of Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, from Portugal, who was shot “multiple times” on Monday at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, about 80 km from Providence. Police have obtained an arrest warrant for a suspect, sources said. They added that a rental car matching the same description was seen at both crime scenes.It is notable to notice that Portugal is the same country where the MIT professor was from, allegedly committed by Valente.On Wednesday, investigators released a photo of an individual believed to have been in close proximity to their primary person of interest. Providence police chief Oscar Perez said they wanted to speak with the person, “who may have information relevant to the investigation”. He added that the killer “could be anywhere” and “we don’t know where the person is or who he is”.A day earlier, police showed footage of a person of interest in a black mask walking around the university campus, possibly “casing” the area before the crime, Perez said.Members of the public have expressed frustration over the investigation’s slow progress. In response, Rhode Island attorney general Peter Neronha said he believed the killer would be caught “and it is just a matter of time before we catch him”.The FBI has offered a Rs 41.5 lakh reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the attack.The shooting occurred at Brown University’s Barus & Holley engineering building during final exams. Authorities identified the two students killed as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an Uzbek-American freshman.","Suspect identified as claudio manuel neves-valente, a 48-year-old brown university student and portuguese national from miami, florida.

Wedding bells soon? FBI director Kash Patel’s girlfriend Alexis Wilkins fuels engagement buzz online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wedding-bells-soon-fbi-director-kash-patels-girlfriend-alexis-wilkins-fuels-engagement-buzz-online/articleshow/125994978.cms,"Kash Patel Justifies Using FBI Aircraft To Visit Girlfriend Alexis Wilkins





It’s not every day that an FBI director finds himself at the centre of a social-media nudge toward matrimony — but Kash Patel ’s love life is suddenly trending almost as much as his job.Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins , appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign, amplifying hints, reposts and playful prods that suggest she’s ready for an engagement ring sooner rather than later.The online cheerleading comes at an awkward moment for the 45-year-old FBI chief, whose relationship with the 27-year-old aspiring musician has already drawn scrutiny over his alleged use of bureau perks to visit and protect her. Still, Patel has stood firmly by Wilkins — and she seems more than happy to stand right beside him, preferably with a ring involved.On Monday Wilkins shared an X post by right-wing activist Xaviaer DuRousseau praising Patel after news of foiled New Year’s Eve bomb plots in Los Angeles.DuRousseau wrote, “God bless you @FBIDirectorKash 🙏🏾 And please propose to my friend soon 😌” Wilkins responded, “Xaviaer over here with facts 😉” She later reposted his Instagram story, adding, “Ride or D1e KING over here 🫶 @xaviaer.”Katie Miller, wife of former Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, teased Patel and Wilkins’ appearance on her podcast, asking, “Where’s her ring?” with both Patel and Wilkins laughing in the clip.Patel defended their relationship in an X post, calling Wilkins “the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life,” and “a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes.”Insiders told MS Now that Patel twice ordered Wilkins’s security detail to drive a friend home and in one instance shouted at the team leader to comply. News of Patel’s use of $60 million in private jet services and the assignment of SWAT agents prompted national outcry.Rumours that Patel’s position is at risk have circulated, following criticism of his handling of cases including the Brown University mass shooting. White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed speculation that Patel would be dismissed, posting a photograph of Patel with President Donald Trump from November.","Kash patel’s country-singer girlfriend, alexis wilkins, appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign.
