LIVE: Trump FIRES At Europe, India, China; Announces SHOCK Reciprocal Tariffs On 'Liberation Day'

United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday called Prime Minister Modi his 'great friend' while imposing his ambitious retaliatory tariff on India.Trump said Washington would impose ""discounted reciprocal tariffs "" of 26 per cent on New Delhi.""India, very, very tough. Very, very tough. The Prime Minister just left. He's a great friend of mine, but I said, 'You're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right.' They charge us 52 per cent. You have to understand, we charge them almost nothing, for years and years and decades, and it was only seven years ago, when I came in, we started with China and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China in tariffs,"" Trump said holding the chart that mentioned list of countries and tariff charges.Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington, D.C., in February, less than a month after President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term in the White House.Trump has previously referred to India as the "" tariff king "" and a ""big abuser"" in global trade . During a joint press conference with Modi at the White House on February 13, Trump remarked that India had ""been very strong on tariffs,"" adding, ""I don't blame them, necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs.""Highlighting the US trade deficit with India, which he estimated at nearly $100 billion, Trump stated that he and Modi had agreed to begin negotiations to correct ""long-running disparities that should have been taken care of over the last four years – but they didn't do that."" The goal, he said, was to ""sign an agreement"" that would create ""a level playing field, which we really think we're entitled to, and he does also, in fairness, so we're going to work on that very hard.""While announcing the new tariffs, Trump defended the move by saying the US had been ""very kind"" to trading partners and would now charge them ""approximately half of the levies they impose on US goods.""","Us president donald trump announced a retaliatory tariff of 26 per cent on india.

MPEI is one of the flagship institutions under Russian Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom 's core and partner university network.Hemangi chose to specialise in illumination engineering and sources of light, an area she describes as the “perfect blend of science and art”. “It’s not directly related to nuclear science but is highly affected by nuclear energy. The cheaper and easier the access is to electricity in a country, the more illuminated its streets are,” Hemangi said.Speaking about her main motivation for applying to the MSCF programme, she said in 2023, she attended World Youth Festival in Sirius, Russia, organised by Rosatom, where “a very inspiring female Turkish professor explained how nuclear energy is in everything, a part of everything, even in light”.The MSCF programme, supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was launched in 2020 to encourage more women to enter and thrive in the nuclear sector. The programme supports talented students pursuing nuclear-related studies at the master's level year; one hundred and more young women scientists from all over the world become its fellows. Since the programme was launched, 560 students from 121 countries have been selected from over 2,200 applications.Rosatom, which is the largest producer of low-carbon electricity in Russia and generating approximately 20% of the nation's power, has been a key partner of IAEA's MSCF programme, supporting around 40 female students from 17 countries over the past four years. This academic year, 12 students from their flagship universities across 10 countries, including Armenia, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Rwanda, Tanzania, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe, received the scholarship, which covers tuition, internships, a monthly stipend and additional financial support from Rosatom.“We attach great importance to the fact that our values coincide with those of IAEA, and we can work together to ensure that there are more bright and talented women in the nuclear sector who contribute to the development of nuclear technologies and increase trust to green nuclear energy,” Vera Upirova, senior manager of Project Office for Education Development and International Cooperation of Rosatom, said.","Hemangi shrivastava, an indian student pursuing her master’s degree in electronics and nano electronics, has been awarded the marie sklodowska-curie fellowship programme.

Trump’s Use of Reciprocal Tariffs

Poll Do you support the use of reciprocal tariffs as a trade strategy? No, it escalates trade tensions. Yes, it's a necessary approach.

Key Objectives

Reduce the U.S. trade deficit by discouraging imports and boosting domestic production.

Protect American industries from unfair competition.

Pressure trading partners to lower their own tariffs or renegotiate trade agreements with more favorable terms for the US.

Challenges and Criticisms

Higher Consumer Costs: Reciprocal tariffs could lead to increased prices for imported goods in the U.S., affecting consumers and businesses reliant on foreign products.

Global Trade Tensions : Countries targeted by the policy may retaliate with their own tariffs, escalating into broader trade disputes or even a trade war.

: Countries targeted by the policy may retaliate with their own tariffs, escalating into broader trade disputes or even a trade war. Implementation Complexity: Matching tariffs on a product-by-product basis is administratively challenging due to the vast number of goods traded globally.

Global Reaction

Reciprocal tariffs are a trade policy mechanism where a country imposes tariffs on imports that match the tariffs its exports face in foreign markets. The concept is rooted in the idea of fairness: if one country charges high tariffs on imported goods, the affected country responds with equivalent tariffs on goods coming from the first country. This approach aims to create a balanced trading environment by ensuring that no nation disproportionately benefits from lower trade barriers.For example, if Country A imposes a 25% tariff on steel imports from Country B, Country B would respond by imposing a 25% tariff on steel imports from Country A. The goal is to discourage protectionist policies and encourage countries to lower their tariffs through negotiation.President Donald Trump has made reciprocal tariffs a cornerstone of his trade policy, framing them as part of his broader “America First” agenda. On April 2, 2025, Trump officially unveiled his reciprocal tariff plan, calling it a necessary step to combat what he describes as decades of unfair trade practices by foreign nations. He declared the day “Liberation Day for American Trade,” signaling his administration’s commitment to leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses.Trump’s plan targets countries that impose higher tariffs on American exports than the U.S. imposes on their goods. For instance, India charges a 100% tariff on American motorcycles, while the U.S. imposes only a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles. Under Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy, the U.S. would raise its tariff on Indian motorcycles to match India’s rate.Trump argues that reciprocal tariffs will:The policy is particularly focused on countries with significant trade surpluses with the United States, such as China, India, and members of the European Union. These nations often maintain higher average tariff rates compared to the U.S., which Trump claims puts American exporters at a disadvantage.While Trump’s supporters hail the policy as a bold step toward trade fairness, critics warn of potential downsides:Economists also question whether reciprocal tariffs will effectively reduce trade imbalances. Many argue that factors like currency valuation and domestic consumption patterns play a larger role in creating trade deficits than tariff disparities.The announcement has already drawn criticism from major trading partners. China and the European Union have labeled the policy as protectionist, while developing nations like India fear economic repercussions if subjected to equivalent U.S. tariffs.","Reciprocal tariffs are a trade policy mechanism where a country imposes tariffs on imports that match the tariffs its exports face in foreign markets.

DOGE, Tesla Takedown and silent exit?



Musk is likely to retain an informal role



130-day special government employee status



President Donald Trump has told his inner circle that Elon Musk will be stepping back from his current role though Trump is very happy with whatever Elon Musk is doing, according to reports. A Politico report said that the decision is not his unilateral and both Trump and Musk discussed it in recent days and it will soon be time for Musk to return to his businesses. ""He's got a big company to run ... At some point he's going to be going back,"" Trump reportedly said about Elon Musk. ""He wants to. I'd keep him as long as I could keep him.""Trump said that the heads of agencies who worked with DOGE learned a lot and there will be a point at which the secretaries will be able to do this work, Axios reported.""Musk’s looming retreat comes as some Trump administration insiders and many outside allies have become frustrated with his unpredictability and increasingly view the billionaire as a political liability, a dynamic that was thrown into stark relief Tuesday when a conservative judge Musk vocally supported lost his bid for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat by 10 points,"" the Politico report said.Elon Musk's entry into Donald Trump's inner circle happened before the election when he endorsed Trump unequivocally. His promotion was rapid as he became the co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency, and then the sole head. With a mandate to cut down the expenses of the government, he freely wielded his chainsaw with the approval of the President and suggested shutting down several departments, curtailing the function of some others. As his DOGE is still at their one-year mandate, Elon Musk attempted to play a bigger role in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election but fell flat as Brad Schimel, the candidate he was backing lost to Susan Crawford.Meanwhile, Elon Musk's business took a major hit with Tesla shares plunging amid a global call to 'Takedown Tesla' by protesters who do not want Elon Musk's interference in the government.The Politico report quoted one senior administration official who said Elon Musk is likely to retain an informal role as an adviser. But another said Musk is not going anywhere and those who think Musk is going to disappear entirely from Trump's orbit are fooling themselves.Elon Musk was made a special government employee -- who join the government for a short period of time -- by the Trump administration.

Money Can’t Buy Everything



In a closely watched and historically expensive election, liberal Judge Susan Crawford defeated conservative Brad Schimel to secure a 10-year term on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, preserving the court’s narrow liberal majority. This outcome not only represents a significant victory for Democrats but also a deeply personal and strategic defeat for billionaire Elon Musk , who invested millions into the race in an attempt to sway its outcome.The Wisconsin Supreme Court race shattered records as the most expensive judicial election in US history, with Musk pouring over $21 million into Schimel’s campaign. Much of this funding came through Musk’s America PAC, a political action committee he established to support President Donald Trump . Musk’s contributions included direct financial backing for Schimel and controversial cash incentives for voters—offering $100 for signing petitions and $1 million checks to select individuals. Despite these efforts, Crawford emerged victorious, securing the liberal majority on the court with national implications for issues such as abortion rights, labour laws, and electoral redistricting.Elon Musk’s involvement in this race was far from incidental. As a key figure in President Donald Trump’s administration and leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has become increasingly active in shaping political outcomes. DOGE has drawn significant attention for its aggressive cost-cutting measures across federal agencies, making Musk a polarizing figure in American politics.By supporting Schimel, Musk aimed to bolster conservative judicial influence in Wisconsin—a critical swing state—and indirectly advance Trump’s agenda. The Wisconsin Supreme Court holds significant sway over issues like voting rights and redistricting, which are pivotal ahead of the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election . Losing this race undermines Musk’s ability to influence these broader political dynamics.Throughout the campaign, Democrats strategically positioned Musk as the primary antagonist, framing his substantial financial contributions as an attempt to “buy” the election. Judge Crawford and her supporters emphasized this narrative in their messaging, portraying Musk’s involvement as an unprecedented assault on democracy.In her victory speech, Crawford declared, “Today, Wisconsinites defended against an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our equitable elections, and our Supreme Court. Wisconsin has firmly declared that justice cannot be bought; our courts are not for sale.” This rhetoric resonated with voters who were wary of corporate interference in judicial matters and galvanized Democratic turnout.The race quickly became a proxy battle between Trump-aligned conservatives and Democrats at both state and national levels. While officially nonpartisan, the ideological stakes were clear: Republicans rallied behind Schimel with endorsements from Trump and Musk, while Democrats—including former President Barack Obama—supported Crawford.The election served as the first major test of public sentiment during Trump’s second term and highlighted Musk’s growing role as a political influencer. However, the loss signals resistance to both Trump’s policies and Musk’s controversial leadership at DOGE.Musk’s financial tactics drew widespread criticism from Democrats and progressive organizations. His decision to offer cash incentives—such as handing out $1 million checks to voters—was seen by many as an attempt to undermine democratic principles. These strategies ultimately backfired by energizing opposition among Democratic voters who viewed them as emblematic of corporate overreach.Despite the unprecedented spending from Musk-affiliated groups, Schimel conceded defeat on election night. During his concession speech, one voter shouted “Cheater!”—a reflection of the contentious nature of the race.The loss carries broader implications for Musk beyond politics. DOGE has faced mounting criticism over its cost-cutting initiatives, which have led to staffing reductions and decreased federal services. Crawford’s win signals growing resistance to these policies at both state and national levels.Additionally, Tesla—Musk’s flagship company—has been embroiled in legal disputes with Wisconsin over dealership rights. A conservative-leaning court could have been more favourable to Tesla’s interests, making this loss a setback for Musk’s business ambitions as well.Wisconsin holds outsized importance in American politics as a key battleground state. By investing so heavily in this race, Musk hoped to shape not just its judiciary but also broader electoral trends ahead of future contests like the 2028 presidential election.However, Crawford’s victory suggests that even vast financial resources cannot guarantee success—especially when voters perceive those resources as undermining democratic norms.Following the loss, Elon Musk took to his X platform (formerly Twitter) to express his frustration. He criticized “the long con of the left” but shifted focus to a concurrent voter ID amendment passed during the election—a small consolation amid his larger defeat. While Musk emphasized that voter ID laws were “the most important thing,” his comments underscored how sorely he felt Schimel's loss.Elon Musk’s involvement in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race was not merely about supporting Brad Schimel; it was part of a larger strategy to cement his political influence and advance conservative priorities. The loss represents a rejection of these ambitions by Wisconsin voters—a costly lesson about the limits of money and power in American democracy. As Democrats celebrate their victory and liberals retain control of the court, questions remain about how this defeat will shape Musk’s future political endeavours. Will he recalibrate his approach or double down on similar contests? Regardless of his next move, one thing is clear: Wisconsin has sent a loud message that justice cannot be bought.","In a closely watched and historically expensive election, liberal judge susan crawford defeated conservative brad schimel to secure a 10-year term on the wisconsin supreme court.

‘Pathetic European Union…’: Trump Tears Into ‘Foes-Like Friends’; Announces Reciprocal Measures

What Donald Trump announced:

Trump's reciprocal tariffs

This is the full list of reciprocal tariffs that Trump announced:

The risks for India

It's important to note that the exact impact of Trump's reciprocal tariffs on various sectors in India will be easier to analyse as more details emerge.

Ahead of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs announcement, a few days ago a Citi Research report warned that the move could mean possible annual losses up to $7 billion.

Citi analysts have identified chemicals, metal products and jewellery as sectors facing the highest vulnerability, whilst automobiles, pharmaceuticals and food products remain substantially exposed.

India's merchandise exports to the United States totalled around $74 billion in 2024, with pearls, gems and jewellery accounting for $8.5 billion, pharmaceuticals contributing $8 billion, and petrochemicals amounting to approximately $4 billion.

According to Morgan Stanley, India faces potential risks to its pharmaceutical exports, which make up 2.8% of total exports and 0.3% of GDP, as these items have been identified as possible targets for tariffs.

Although a trade deal between India and the US could be reached by autumn 2025, the negotiations are expected to be intricate and lengthy, owing to various trade-related complexities between the two nations, Morgan Stanley has said.

Products from various industries such as agriculture, precious stones, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, electrical components and machinery could face adverse effects if the United States implements retaliatory tariffs on items originating from India, industry specialists have indicated.

Based on GTRI's analysis, fish, meat and processed seafood exports, valued at $2.58 billion in 2024, would be most severely affected, facing a substantial 27.83 per cent tariff difference. The introduction of US tariffs will notably reduce the competitiveness of shrimp exports to America.

Additionally, India's exports of processed food, sugar and cocoa products, which reached $1.03 billion last year, are likely to be impacted due to a significant tariff disparity of 24.99 per cent.

How is India preparing for US tariffs?

India is developing a comprehensive strategy to strengthen economic ties with the United States. India is evaluating several scenarios to understand the potential impact of reciprocal tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump on April 2, according to officials.

The governments of India and the United States have established a timeline to finalise the initial phase of their agreement by September-October 2025. Additionally, both nations have set an ambitious objective to escalate their two-way trade from the current $190 billion to $500 billion by 2030, which is a substantial increase of more than twofold.

The commerce and industry ministry has developed various models considering tariff differences and duties that Trump has implemented across different nations and industries to safeguard American manufacturing.

Officials from the ministry have engaged with local manufacturers to understand the non-tariff obstacles their products encounter in the US market.

Additionally, the ministry is collecting input from Indian businesses regarding non-tariff restrictions encountered during US exports. A dedicated online platform for documenting such export barriers is scheduled to launch within the next two months.

The Nomura report indicates that India is prepared to negotiate a broad trade and investment agreement, offering reduced tariffs on specific products including pork, premium medical devices and luxury motorcycles, whilst providing production-linked incentives for shipping and support for logistics firms.

India also plans to increase its procurement of US products across multiple sectors, encompassing defence equipment, aircraft, oil and gas, technology and medical diagnostic equipment.

To establish itself as a credible alternative to Chinese manufacturing, India is offering enhanced incentives, including tax benefits and simplified land access in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. These benefits target sectors like semiconductors, electronics, aircraft components and renewable energy.

India aims to integrate into US supply chains by extending concessions to US firms that establish production facilities in India for fundamental and intermediate products, including basic semiconductors, solar panels, machinery and pharmaceutical items, the Nomura report said.

US President Donald Trump has unveiled extensive reciprocal tariff proposals, declaring ""our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered"" by foreign nations. During his speech on ‘Liberation Day’,""My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day, waiting for a long time. April 2nd, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to Make America Wealthy Again...Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,"" Trump declared during his White House address. ""But it is not going to happen anymore.""As per the board held up by Trump, the tariffs charged by India to the US are 52% and the ‘discounted’ reciprocal tariffs by US will be 26%.Also Check | Donald Trump tariff announcements live According to Trump, the US imposes a modest 2.4 per cent tariff on imported motorcycles, whilst other nations implement substantially higher rates. “The United States charges other countries only a 2.4 per cent tariff on motorcycles. Meanwhile, Thailand and others are charging much higher rates, like 60 per cent. India charges 70 per cent, Vietnam charges 75 per cent, and others charge even higher rates,” he said.""Likewise, until today, the United States has, for decades, charged a 2.5 per cent tariff. Think of that 2.5 per cent on foreign-made automobiles. The European Union charges us more than 10 per cent tariffs, and they have a 20 per cent VAT much, much higher. India charges 70 per cent and perhaps worst of all are the non-monetary restrictions imposed by South Korea, Japan, and many other nations as a result of these colossal trade barriers.""""India, very, very tough. Very, very tough. The Prime Minister just left. He's a great friend of mine, but I said, 'You're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right. They charge us 52%. You have to understand, we charge them almost nothing for years and years and decades, and it was only seven years ago, when I came in, that we started with China,"" Trump added.1. China: 34%2.

Sri Lanka: 44%25. Colombia: 10%A recent SBI Research report said that the impact of Trump’s tariffs is likely to be limited. This sentiment is echoed by several global research and ratings firms and banks such as Goldman Sachs, Nomura, Morgan Stanley and Fitch.According to the SBI analysis, the potential impact of US tariff reciprocity on Indian exports would be modest. It projected a reduction of approximately 3 to 3.5 per cent, with an assumption of tariffs ranging between 15 and 20 per cent.The report indicates that India's strategic approach to export diversification, emphasis on value addition, exploration of alternative markets, and development of new trade routes from Europe to USA through the Middle-East would offset the effects of US tariffs.Goldman Sachs notes that India’s gross exports to the US is one of the lowest among its Emerging Market peers. Fitch says India’s low reliance on external demand makes it ‘somewhat insulated’.Based on Nomura's recent findings, India stands as one of Asia's most resilient economies in the ongoing trade conflict.The country's exposure remains limited, with exports to the US constituting only 2.2% of its GDP, whilst Vietnam shows significantly higher exposure at 25.1%.Nomura's study on Asian contribution to US-bound global exports identifies Vietnam as having the highest risk exposure (8.9% of GDP), with other nations following: Taiwan (6.3%), Thailand (5.6%), Malaysia (4.6%), Singapore (4.5%) and South Korea (4.5%). The electronics and computing sector faces substantial risks from tariff-induced supply chain disruptions.Across industries, Asian economies show highest susceptibility to automotive tariffs, followed by semiconductors and steel sectors as the next most exposed areas.Morgan Stanley says, “While India is exposed to direct tariff risks, we have consistently highlighted that the bigger effect on growth from tariffs likely comes via the indirect transmission channel of weaker corporate confidence from heightened policy uncertainty and the spillovers to capex and trade cycle. From this perspective, India's low goods trade orientation and ability to generate domestic demand offset mean it is among the least exposed economies within the region from an indirect effect standpoint.”Despite the looming impact from Trump’s tariff moves, global economists believe India will continue to be the fastest growing economy in the world. According to the IMF's January World Economic Outlook, India will become the world’s third largest economy in the coming years.A Financial Times report citing Aston University's econometric research says that severe global retaliation against Trump's proposed 25% tariffs could result in a $1.4 trillion reduction in global income and significantly impact international trade.Initial analysis suggests India could potentially benefit alongside the UK, Japan, and South Korea. These nations might experience increased export opportunities in areas where US buyers seek alternatives to suppliers affected by tariff barriers. The trade diversion could particularly favour India.India's prospects appear promising in electronics, pharmaceuticals, and textiles sectors, which align with the ""Make in India"" programme. The country's emerging status as a manufacturing alternative to China, combined with its independence from major trade groups like the EU, could make it an attractive supplier during uncertain times.However, these advantages are limited and temporary. As noted by a senior economist at a New Delhi-based think tank: ""India might benefit from a few supply chain shifts, but if the global trade environment turns volatile, capital flows will become unstable, inflation will rise, and the ripple effects will catch up.""Additionally, India's reliance on imported energy, machinery, and sophisticated components poses risks. A widespread trade conflict would increase import costs, potentially leading to higher inflation and reduced government fiscal flexibility. The Reserve Bank of India, already concerned about food prices, might need to implement stricter monetary policies, potentially affecting economic growth.Ultimately, whilst India might experience initial advantages, it remains vulnerable to the broader negative consequences of global trade disruption.","Experts are of the view that the impact of trump’s tariffs on india is likely to be limited.

Earlier this year, Elon Musk along with a coalition of deep-pocketed investors made a bid to acquire ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The offer, he said, is aimed to block OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit business. Altman spurned the buyout offer, saying that OpenAI is ""not for sale,"" and called the overture by Musk, who owns rival startup xAI, an attempt to ""slow us down.""In response to Altman's filing, Tesla's CEO told the court he would drop his bid for OpenAI if the startup halts its restructuring.

Elon, we asked you to confirm paternity through a test before our child (who you named) was even born. You refused.

And you weren’t sending *me* money, you were sending support for your child that you thought was necessary… until you withdrew most of it to maintain control and punish me for “disobedience.” But you’re really only punishing your son

It’s ironic that your last effort in court was to try to gag me while you use a social media channel you literally own to distribute derogatory messages about me and our child to the entire world. It’s all about control with you, and everyone can see it.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has publicly addressed claims made by conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair that he fathered her child. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk stated that he is open to taking a paternity test to confirm whether he is the father of St. Clair's six-month-old son. This marks the first time Musk has directly responded to the allegations.Elon Musk revealed that he has provided St. Clair with $2.5 million in financial support and continues to send $500,000 annually for the child's care, despite not being certain of his paternity. ""I don’t know if the child is mine or not, but am not against finding out. No court order is needed,"" Musk wrote in his post.St. Clair, however, refuted Musk's claims, stating that he had previously refused to take a paternity test before the child was born.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Thursday imposed broad new tariffs, introducing a universal 10% tax on all imports, with additional levies ranging from 10% to 50% depending on trade imbalances.The measures, enacted under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, aim to counter trade deficits and strengthen domestic manufacturing. While Trump defends the move as essential for protecting American industries, critics warn of potential economic instability and a looming trade war.Also read: Trump’s 26% 'discounted' tariff: Is Indian economy relatively insulated? Nations with significant trade surpluses with the US have been hit with the steepest tariffs. Some of the hardest-hit countries include:Many of these countries, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, are major exporters of textiles, footwear, and electronics to the US. The tariffs are expected to disrupt their industries, impacting global supply chains and potentially leading to price hikes for American consumers.Some nations have been spared from the heaviest levies, facing only the baseline 10% tariff. These include:The relatively lower tariffs suggest these countries are seen as fairer trading partners by the Trump administration. However, businesses in these nations remain concerned about the broader implications of escalating trade tensions.Also read: 'Going to fight': How world leaders reacted to Trump's tariff move The announcement of the tariffs has rattled global markets, with S&P 500 futures dropping nearly 2% and Asian and European stock indices experiencing similar declines. Analysts warn that these measures could push global trade towards its most protectionist era since the Great Depression, as affected nations prepare retaliatory actions.Critics argue that tariffs, which function as a tax on imports, will raise costs for American consumers and businesses. Economists predict inflationary pressures, with some forecasting a 1% contraction in the US economy in the second quarter due to rising prices and disrupted supply chains.In response, countries like Israel and Vietnam have lowered their own tariffs on US imports, possibly to avoid further punitive measures.
