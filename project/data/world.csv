NEW DELHI: Former Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani was onboard the Air India flight that crashed shortly after takeoff from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad on Thursday afternoon.The web check-in document obtained by TOI stated that, Rupani had completed his check-in in business class.The details indicate his boarding time was at 12.10pm from Zone 1, with seat number 2D. The booking reference for his ticket is 6FK2M2, and the e-ticket number is 0982865207073.Authorities have not yet confirmed his status following the crash.Also Read: Ahmedabad plane crash: Eyewitness says heard a loud noise; 'dead bodies and debris scattered all over' The Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner, operating as flight AI171 to London Gatwick, crashed in the Meghani area just minutes after takeoff, sending up a massive plume of black smoke and triggering large-scale rescue efforts. The aircraft, heavily fueled for the long-haul journey, caught fire upon impact, complicating rescue operations.According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the aircraft was carrying 242 people — 230 passengers, 2 pilots, and 10 cabin crew members. It was being flown by Capt Sumeet Sabharwal and First Officer Clive Kundar.Fire engines, ambulances, police, and NDRF teams rushed to the site. Three teams (90 personnel) from the NDRF’s Gandhinagar unit were deployed immediately, with three more on their way from Vadodara.There is no official confirmation yet on the number of casualties or survivors.Officials said the fire was intensified by the jet’s full fuel load for the international route. “The heavy fuel load worsened the post-crash fire, making rescue efforts even more difficult,” a DGCA official said.Union home minister Amit Shah spoke with Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel, state home minister Harsh Sanghavi, and Ahmedabad Police Commissioner regarding the tragedy. CM Patel expressed deep grief over the incident and directed authorities to expedite rescue and relief operations.Taking to X, Patel said, “I have instructed officials to carry out rescue and relief work on a war footing and ensure immediate medical treatment for injured passengers. A green corridor has also been set up for quick transportation of the injured to hospitals.”He added that Shah had assured him of full central support in handling the aftermath.Air India, in its initial statement, said: “Flight AI171, operating Ahmedabad–London Gatwick, was involved in an incident today, 12 June 2025. We are currently ascertaining the details.”Also Read: Ahmedabad plane crash: Flight was heading to London with 240 onboard - what we know so far Later in the evening, Air India Chairman N Chandrasekaran issued a statement: “With profound sorrow I confirm that flight AI171 was involved in a tragic accident.

NEW DELHI: Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , who is also the Rajya Sabha leader of opposition, wrote to PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday, urging him to hold the election of the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker.Highlighting the vacant status of the position for the two consecutive Lok Sabha terms, Kharge said this ""does not augur well for India's democratic polity and is also in violation of well-laid-out provisions of the Constitution"".""From the First to the Sixteenth Lok Sabha, every House has had a Deputy Speaker. By and large, it has been a well-established convention to appoint the Deputy Speaker from among the members of the principal opposition party,"" Kharge wrote on X with a letter he wrote to the PM.He further wrote: ""No Deputy Speaker was elected during the Seventeenth Lok Sabha, and this concerning precedent continues in the ongoing Eighteenth Lok Sabha.""The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha is a key constitutional position in India’s lower house of Parliament.The Deputy Speaker is elected by the members of the Lok Sabha, usually from among themselves, soon after the Speaker is elected. The primary role of the Deputy Speaker is to preside over the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in the absence of the Speaker and to ensure the smooth conduct of the House. The Deputy Speaker has the same powers as the Speaker when presiding, including maintaining order, deciding on points of order, and managing debates.Importantly, the Deputy Speaker is expected to function in a non-partisan manner, similar to the Speaker, despite being elected from a political party. Traditionally, this post is often offered to a member of the opposition or another party to maintain a balance, although this is not mandated by the Constitution.The position is significant for upholding the parliamentary process and ensuring continuity in the functioning of the Lok Sabha when the Speaker is unavailable.The last Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha in India was M. Thambi Durai from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). He served as the Deputy Speaker during the 16th Lok Sabha (2014–2019).","Mallikarjun kharge wrote to pm narendra modi on tuesday, urging him to hold the election of the lok sabha deputy speaker.

NEW DELHI: Amid apparent differences with the Trump administration over critical issues like Pakistan's support to cross border terrorism, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said that India's aim is to advance the relationship with the US as it serves India's interests.

The ‘gaps’ Boeing couldn’t ignore



In contact with Air India, ready to support them: Boeing Airplanes



NEW DELHI: The tragic crash of Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, has put spotlight on a whistleblower's warnings made in 2024 over the aircraft.The ill-fated aircraft, carrying 242 people including 10 crew members, plunged into a residential complex minutes after takeoff from Ahmedabad on Thursday. It was meant to fly to London’s Gatwick Airport — but lasted just around 30 seconds in the air.As rescue teams continue recovery efforts, aviation experts are turning their focus to the aircraft itself, the 787 Dreamliner, hailed as a technological marvel, yet shadowed by safety concerns.In 2024, New York Times reported about Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour's formal whistleblower complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which alleged serious structural flaws in the manufacturing of the 787 Dreamliner and its cousin, the 777. His claims suggested shortcuts were taken on the factory floor that could dramatically shorten the aircraft’s lifespan and potentially lead to ""catastrophic"" failure over time.“I’m not doing this to bring Boeing down,” Salehpour had said in a press briefing adding: “I’m doing this because I want to prevent a crash.”According to Salehpour, improperly filled gaps in the aircraft fuselage — where different parts of the plane are joined — could increase stress and wear during flights, potentially compromising the structural integrity of the aircraft over years.Also read: Police finds one survivor in seat 11A; 242 were onboard His allegations were not isolated. Back in 2021, the FAA and Boeing paused delivery of Dreamliners for nearly two years to investigate precisely the same issue: improperly filled microscopic gaps. Boeing claimed it corrected the process, resumed deliveries, and maintained that all active aircraft were safe.But Salehpour had alleged that the problem persisted. He described shocking assembly practices — including workers “jumping on aircraft parts” to force them into alignment. “That’s not how you build an airplane,” he said.Boeing had, however, pushed back hard against the allegations. “These claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure long-term safety,” the company had said in a statement.Boeing Airplanes said that it is in contact with Air India regarding the AI-171 flight with 230 passengers and 12 crew bound for London's Gatwick airport crashed shortly after it took off in Meghaninagar area in Ahmedabad.The official X handle of US planemaker Boeing Commercial Airplanes said, ""We are in contact with Air India regarding Flight 171 and stand ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.""Meanwhile, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it is in contact with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) regarding Air India flight AI171.""When an international incident occurs, that government leads the investigation,"" the FAA said in a statement. ""In the event assistance is requested, the NTSB is the official US representative and the FAA provides technical support.""""We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB,"" it said.","Whistleblower’s chilling warnings about 787 dreamliner in 2024 were ignored by boeing.

On Cam: How Boeing 787 Whistleblower's Disaster Warning Was Ignored | Ahmedabad Crash | Air India

DGCA statement hints at dual engine failure |

MUMBAI: Two short videos surfaced after AI 171 crashed outside Ahmedabad airport - many questions followed, from those who have flown commercial airliners. On social media, pilots were asking:1. Why was the aircraft landing gear not retracted?2. Did the aircraft suffer a dual engine failure?3. Did the engines die because of possible fuel contamination or blockage?4. Were the flaps on the wings lowered for take-off?5. Could a bird hit have contributed to the crash?The final investigation report into the AI-171 accident, set to be released before June 12 next year, will have a detailed analysis of probable causes and contributory factors. But for aviation professionals, the two videos offered many clues.Also read: Air India Ahmedabad-London flight crashes near airport shortly after takeoff; 241 dead ""Within 5 secs of lift off, pilots normally put the landing gear up,"" said Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert. Capt Manoj Hathi, ex-Air India official who has held posts of director (ops) and director (air-safety) said: ""As soon as a positive rate of climb is reached, the landing gear is retracted.""A lowered landing gear increases drag and fuel consumption, while reducing aircraft speed. Retracting the landing gear allows for a smooth aerodynamic flow helping the aircraft climb up. But the clips showed the landing gear extended even as the plane climbed to over 400 feet above ground.Also read: Ahmedabad air crash: Why accidents are common during take-offs, landings What could be the reason why AI-171 had not retracted its landing gear although it had climbed to a height of around 400 feet?""In case there is a distraction the pilots could forget to put the gear up.The distraction could be dual engine failure, bird hit or combination of both. The plume of dust as the aircraft crosses the runway end shows it was low on power and possibly a dual engine problem,"" said air safety expert Capt Amit Singh.Capt Manoj Hathi, a former AI official, said, ""It's possible that a dual engine flame-out was the reason the landing gear could not be retracted. Dual engine failure could occur due to bird ingestion or fuel contamination. Looking at the trajectory and body angle of the aircraft, it appears as if the aircraft has stalled because of loss of speed.""Other pilots, who requested anonymity, too, spoke about dual engine failure and possible fuel contamination. The possibility of a dual engine failure is a rare event with about seven documented accidents in the past seven decades.DGCA in its statement said the pilots gave a MAYDAY call seconds after take-off, further supporting the theory that a dual engine failure occurred probably after the aircraft crossed the speed beyond which a take-off cannot be safely aborted.Video clips show the aircraft gliding and descending over a congested area chock-a-block with buildings. Seconds later, the aircraft nose is raised - AI-171's pilots were probably trying to keep the aircraft from crashing in a congested locality. But raising the nose results in loss of airspeed.The clip shows the aircraft disappear from view and crash. But even if the pilots had not pulled up the nose it would have continued to glide, descend and eventually crash, said Capt Singh. The other point was the flaps - aerodynamic devices that are lowered to increase lift on the wing. While some pilots said the flaps were not lowered as is the norm during take-off, others said the pictures show they were lowered.Investigation into aircraft accidents carried out by civil aviation authorities such as the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) follow norms laid down in the International Civil Aviation Organisation's Annex 13. It states that the primary objective of an investigation should not be to assign blame, but to identify and prevent future similar incidents.Under Annex 13, a preliminary report should be ready within 30 days of the event. But ICAO leaves it to the state (India, in this case) to decide whether to make it public or keep it private. The final report, though, which should be published within a year of the accident, is made public.","Two short videos surfaced after ai 171 crashed outside ahmedabad airport.

NEW DELHI: What began as a routine takeoff for Air India flight AI-171 turned into a nightmare, captured in chilling clarity by an airport CCTV camera in Ahmedabad.At 1.39 pm, the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner accelerated down runway 23 of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport. The CCTV footage showed the aircraft lifting off smoothly, carrying 242 passengers onboard — 169 Indians, 53 British, 7 Portuguese, and 1 Canadian national.But what followed was a scene of unimaginable horror.Seconds after liftoff, the Dreamliner failed to climb as expected. Instead of soaring, it skimmed forward - too low, too slow. For a moment, it held its course, flying level just above the cityscape. Then came the inevitable descent.Also See: Ahmedabad London Flight Crash In 30 seconds, the aircraft slammed into a doctors’ hostel of a medical college, located just beyond the airport perimeter in Meghaninagar locality.

Israel launched a ""preemptive strike"" on Iran, targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites. The Iranian state-run news agency acknowledged the explosions. Air-raid sirens preventatively rang out in Israel.The strikes occurred amid heightened tensions regarding Iran's nuclear programme. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors issued its first censure against Iran in 20 years on Thursday. Iran responded by announcing plans for a third enrichment facility and upgrading its centrifuges.Israel maintains its stance against Iran developing nuclear weapons, while Tehran denies such intentions despite issuing contradictory statements.According to the AFP, Iran Revolutionary Guards chief Hossein Salami killed in Israeli attack. Tasnim news agency, a local media outlet, stated: ""Major General Hossein Salami, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was martyred in the Israeli regime's attack on the IRGC headquarters.""The Revolutionary Guard maintains significant influence within Iran's theocratic structure and holds authority over the nation's ballistic missile capabilities, Times of Israel reported.Also read: Operation Rising Lion: Iran's key uranium enrichment facility hit 'several times' - what we know so far Israeli forces report that the initial strikes also resulted in the deaths of Mohammad Bagheri, Iran's military chief, along with several high-ranking military officials and prominent nuclear scientists.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated via YouTube that Israel conducted ""a targeted military operation roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival,"" indicating operations would persist until the threat subsides. He added that the attacks will continue “for as many days at it takes to remove this threat.”Iran warned Israel after it launched ""Operation Rising Lion"" on Thursday, said they will face a “severe punishment.”Israel “opened its wicked and blood-stained hand to a crime in our beloved country, revealing its malicious nature more than ever by striking residential centers,” Khamenei says.“With this crime, the Zionist regime has set itself for a bitter and painful fate and it will definitely receive it,” Khamenei says.Defence minister Israel Katz issued warnings about potential missile and drone attacks, declaring an emergency situation requiring adherence to protective measures. “In the wake of the state of Israel’s preventive attack against Iran, missile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately,” he said in a statement.The statement added that Katz “signed a special order declaring an emergency situation in the home front.”“It is essential to listen to instructions from the home front command and authorities to stay in protected areas,” it saidSecretary Rubio confirmed Israel's independent action, stating the US received prior notification of strikes deemed necessary for Israeli self-defence. He cautioned Iran against targeting US interests.In a statement, he said: “Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel.”Also read: ‘We are not involved’: US distances itself from Israeli strikes on Tehran; warns Iran against retaliation US Senator Jack Reed, leading Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticised the Israeli strike as a dangerous action that could trigger regional conflict.""These strikes threaten not only the lives of innocent civilians but the stability of the entire Middle East and the safety of American citizens and forces,"" he said. Reed further stated: ""I urge both nations to show immediate restraint, and I call on President Trump and our international partners to press for diplomatic de-escalation before this crisis spirals further out of control.""Numerous commercial aircraft were traversing Iranian airspace during the strikes, as evidenced by flight tracking data.After the Israeli strike commenced, some aircraft continued their routes through Iranian airspace, whilst others swiftly adjusted their flight paths to exit the region.Several countries had previously restricted their aircraft from flying over Iran due to ongoing regional tensions.A senior Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, confirmed that Israel has conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear and military installations, though specific locations were not disclosed.During the operational briefing, the official outlined three primary concerns regarding Iran: They claim Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons, despite US intelligence assessments indicating otherwise. Additionally, Iran's extensive ballistic missile arsenal and its distribution of weaponry to regional groups like Hezbollah and Hamas were cited as significant threats.During the Tehran explosions, Donald Trump was observed socialising with Congressional members on the White House lawn. He continued meeting and photographing with guests, though it was not clear whether he had been briefed about the situation.Earlier that day, Trump had commented that whilst an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities was not immediate, it remained a strong possibility.The US government had taken precautionary measures, including withdrawing diplomatic staff from Baghdad and offering evacuation options to US military families across the Middle East region.After the Israel attacked Iran, the oil prices surged over six percent on Friday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the main US oil contract, was trading 6.3 percent higher at $72.29 per barrel, while Brent North Sea crude was up 5.7 percent at $73.29.Also read: Operation Rising Lion: Iran's key uranium enrichment facility hit 'several times' - what we know so far","Israel launched a ""preemptive strike"" on iran, targeting iranian nuclear and military sites.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday said Israel launched a 'targeted military operation' against Iran, striking 'at the heart' of Tehran's ballistic missile programme. The Israeli PM said the attack was to roll back the threat to Israel's ""very survival"".Netanyahu said Israel's attack on Iran would ""continue for as many days as it takes"" after Israel announced it had carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites.""This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat,"" Netanyahu said in a video statement, naming the operation ""Rising Lion"", reported news agency AFP.""We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment programme.

We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile programme,"" he said, adding that Israel had also hit Iranian nuclear scientists ""working on the Iranian bomb,"" he said.""This military operation aims to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as necessary to eliminate that threat. For decades, the tyrants in Tehran have openly and brazenly called for the destruction of Israel,"" he said.Israeli PM claimed that Iran has produced ""enough highly enriched uranium for nine atomic bombs"" and that it could produce ""a nuclear weapon in a very short time"".""They have backed up their genocidal rhetoric with a program to develop nuclear weapons. In recent years, Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atomic bombs - nine. In recent months, Iran has taken steps it had never taken before - steps toward weaponising that enriched uranium. If not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be within a year. It could even be within a few months - less than a year. This poses a clear and present danger to Israel’s very existence. Eighty years ago, the Jewish people were the victims of a Holocaust perpetrated by the Nazi regime,” Netanyahu said in an address shortly after the ""Operation Rising Lion"".The attack comes hours after Iran announced that it has built and plans to activate a third nuclear enrichment facility, escalating tensions with the United Nations just after the UN’s atomic watchdog censured the country for failing to meet its nonproliferation commitments aimed at preventing the development of nuclear weapons.""The Islamic Republic of Iran has no choice but to respond to this political resolution,"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry and Atomic Energy Organisation said in a joint statement.The timing also coincides with the efforts of the United States to actively lead negotiations with Tehran aimed at reaching a deal to restrict Iran’s capacity to develop nuclear weapons.The Israeli strike followed months of friction between US President Donald Trump and Netanyahu over how best to confront Iran. Netanyahu has consistently pushed for military action as a way to thwart Iran’s nuclear ambitions.On Thursday, Trump reiterated his opposition to an Israeli attack, warning that such a move could derail diplomatic efforts. ""I think it would blow it,"" he said. Still, he acknowledged the complexity of the situation, adding, ""It might help it actually, but it could also blow it.""Earlier, Trump had dismissed an Israeli plan to launch a strike against Iran, making it clear that he wanted time to pursue a negotiated settlement with Tehran. Just two weeks ago, he said he had cautioned Netanyahu against attacking while talks were under way.However, those negotiations have stalled in recent weeks, and it remains uncertain how much effort Trump made to prevent this latest escalation.Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday said that the strikes by Israel were ""unilateral"" and that US' priority is now to protect the American forces in the region.Rubio said that Israel said that the strikes were done in the spirit of self-defence.He said that Iran must not harm US interests or personnel.In a statement, Rubio said, ""Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran.

Rubio says U.S. not involved in Israel's strikes against Iran





The United States has made it clear that it is not involved in Israel’s latest strikes on Iran and has warned Tehran against targeting American forces in response. The statement came from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio late Thursday, just hours after Israel carried out airstrikes on Iran.""We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,"" Rubio said. He added, ""Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel.""Israel's attack caused multiple explosions across Tehran early Friday, raising fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Following the strikes, Rubio confirmed that Israel had informed Washington in advance, calling the action necessary for its self-defence. According to Rubio, Israel claimed the strikes were necessary to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear ambitions.The airstrikes came shortly after US president Donald Trump advised both countries against such action, saying it could damage the chances of reaching a peaceful agreement. Talks between Washington and Tehran on Iran’s nuclear programme were scheduled to enter a sixth round this Sunday in Oman.The US department of State had urged American citizens to stay alert and follow local news amid rising tensions in the Middle East.In a post on X, the department had said, “Due to high tensions in the Middle East, the security environment remains complex and can change quickly. We remind US citizens in Israel and the broader region to remain cautious and monitor the news for updates.”The Israeli military expects its operation targeting Iran’s nuclear programme and long-range missile sites to continue for several days, according to The Times of Israel. The IDF is bracing for heavy retaliation from Iran following tonight’s airstrikes.“At the end of the operation, there will be no nuclear threat from Iran,” military officials said.

Verdict on July 2, what proscecutors want

Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment, with a French court hearing disturbing accounts from former employees, predominantly women, about a toxic workplace culture at the gaming giant’s Paris headquarters during the 2010s, according to The Guardian. The accusations, reportedly described as “extremely serious” by prosecutor Antoine Haushalter, include incidents of employees being tied to chairs, forced to perform handstands, subjected to sexual jokes, exposed to pornographic videos in the office, and enduring crude behavior, such as a boss farting in employees’ faces. One woman reported a manager drawing a penis on her arm during a video call with senior leaders. The court case marks the gaming industry’s first major #MeToo trial.The accused include Tommy Francois, 52, former Vice President of Editorial & Creative Services; Serge Hascoet, 59, former Chief Creative Officer; and Guillaume Patrux, 41, former Game Director. Ubisoft, known for blockbuster titles like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Just Dance, was allegedly a “Boys’ Club” where such misconduct thrived, per The Guardian.Francois faces charges of sexual harassment, bullying, and attempted sexual assault. The Guardian reported that he allegedly tied a female employee to a chair before sending her in an elevator to a random floor and forced a woman in a skirt to do handstands, leaving her terrified. At a 2015 office party, he reportedly attempted to kiss a woman while others restrained her; she escaped after shouting. Another woman accused Francois of grabbing her hair and attempting a forced kiss at a U.S. gaming event, showing her nude photos, and drawing on her arm during a video call. Ubisoft’s HR allegedly dismissed her concerns, advising her not to escalate. Francois denies all allegations.Hascoet is accused of bullying and sexual harassment, including making inappropriate sexual comments, such as telling a woman on a work trip she “needed sex” in front of colleagues, and joking that a used tissue he handed to a female employee was “worth gold at Ubisoft,” per The Guardian. He allegedly made sexual noises, forced assistants to run personal errands, and denies any intent to harass.Patrux faces similar charges, accused of punching walls, pretending to strike employees, cracking a whip near faces, joking about an office shooting, and burning an employee’s beard with a lighter, according to The Guardian. He also denies the allegations.Haushalter called the trial an important moment for the gaming industry, highlighted by the #MeToo movement, which empowered victims to speak out. He also highlighted “strong proof” of systemic mistreatment and requested suspended prison sentences of up to three years and fines for the trio. The court concluded hearings, with a verdict expected on July 2, 2025.","Three former ubisoft executives are on trial in france for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment.

UAE cements its place as a beacon of peaceful coexistence







On Monday, UAE President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan received Sultan Mufaddal Saifuddin, the spiritual leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community, at Qasr Al Shati Palace in Abu Dhabi. In view of the UAE's strong commitment to interfaith dialogue and multicultural relations, this meeting exemplified the UAE's continued efforts to foster religious harmony, human dignity and coexistence on an international stage.UAE continues to declare itself a beacon of faith diplomacy, welcoming international interfaith gatherings such as the Abrahamic Family House and the World Tolerance Summit. This meeting, held, includes international faith leaders such as Sultan Saifuddin, further fueling this narrative. The face of the meeting may have appeared as a simple exchange of pleasantries, bearing greater geopolitical and diplomatic implications, but it appeared to the better diplomatic implications.The Sultan of Dawoodi Bohra community welcomed by UAE President highlights the significance of the meeting which was held during one of Islam's most sacred events that contributed a religious and symbolic dimension to the Eid Al Adha.Posted by Dawoodi Bohras on X (Formerly Twitter) leaders from the two sides exchanged Eid wishes, shared common aspirations for international peace, prosperity, and human welfare during religious celebrations. This is an extension of the overall soft power policy that the UAE employs, including religious diplomacy to engender international goodwill.

This model is especially relevant in a world beset by rising polarization, extremism, and cultural misconceptions.Sultan Saifuddin's visit and the respectful reception he was given are evidence of religious institutions' respect for state leadership, as they show how such understanding can bring about social stability and international collaboration.","Uae continues to declare itself a beacon of faith diplomacy, welcoming international interfaith gatherings such as the abrahamic family house and the world tolerance summit.

Khaby Lame: A global star with humble beginnings

The Senegalese Italian TikTok sensation and one of the most-followed influencers globally was detained in Las Vegas for allegedly overstaying his visa. The 25-year-old arrived in the US on April 30 and was held at Harry Reid International Airport on Friday, according to an ICE spokesperson. Although detained, Lame was not issued a deportation order. Instead, he voluntarily left the country, an option that allows individuals to exit without a formal deportation mark on their immigration records. This could be crucial in avoiding long-term re-entry bans, which can stretch up to 10 years.Lame's detainment comes in the middle of US President Donald Trump's intensifying clampdown on immigration, which has triggered protests across major US cities. Recent US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Los Angeles, combined with the controversial deployment of the National Guard, have reignited debates over the administration’s use of executive power. In California, tensions escalated as tear gas and flash-bangs were used on demonstrators outside federal buildings.
