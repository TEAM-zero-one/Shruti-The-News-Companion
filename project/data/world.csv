NEW DELHI: As Hamas agreed partly to the US Gaza peace plan, PM Narendra Modi again welcomed President Donald Trump 's leadership in reaching that agreement, saying peace efforts in Gaza were making ""decisive progress"".Tagging Trump, Modi said in a post on X that indications of the release of hostages marked a significant step forward.""India will continue to support all efforts towards a durable and just peace,"" said Modi, who had last week also welcomed Trump's announcement of a comprehensive peace plan to end the Gaza conflict. Trump had then reposted Modi's endorsement of the peace proposal on his Truth Social account, in an acknowledgment of Modi's support.An early end to the war in Gaza has been on top of India's international agenda but Modi's warm appreciation for Trump's role is significant also in context of ongoing efforts by both sides to pull the India-US relationship back from the brink. Unlike Pakistan, which continues to fawn over Trump for ending its military conflict with India in May, Indian govt has questioned Trump's claims about having negotiated the truce, apparently one of the reasons for the dramatic downturn in India-US ties.After a gap of three months, Modi and Trump spoke last month with the latter calling the PM on his birthday, raising hopes of a turnaround in the ties. Modi had then also backed Trump's initiatives for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The same day India and the US also resumed negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement that both sides see as crucial for restoring normalcy in ties.Modi said last month both leaders remained committed to taking the relationship to new heights. India would not mind a reaffirmation of that sentiment in the form of a meeting on the margins of the upcoming Asean and East Asia summits in Malaysia but that remains uncertain as Trump is yet to officially confirm his participation. Official sources here said there's no proposal so far for a meeting as India itself is yet take a call on the level of participation.Modi has regularly participated in these meetings but Trump took part only once during his previous term. According to diplomatic sources, progress in trade negotiations will be key to not just chances of a meeting in Malaysia but also the proposed Quad summit that India would like to host late this year or early 2026.Modi's message Saturday followed a statement by Hamas that it would release all Israeli hostages as proposed by Trump's peace plan. However, it has remained silent on other key proposals in the 20-point plan, including laying down arms to facilitate peace.","Pm narendra modi again welcomed president donald trump's leadership in reaching that agreement.

NEW DELHI: ED and CBI, besides other agencies like the income tax , have together decided to make a joint submission before the Westminster court in London pledging that the agencies here in India will not file any fresh case against fugitive PNB scam accused Nirav Modi, and if at all it is necessitated anytime in future, it will be with the concurrence of UK court.The assurances include giving a blanket protection from any arrest once the fugitive is extradited to India, not to be booked in any other case, or interrogated by any other agency in any other case other than facing trial in pending cases of money laundering and corruption in which chargesheets have already been filed against him before special courts here.A few years ago the UK high court had turned down his appeal seeking to stop his extradition to India on the ground that his mental condition had deteriorated and that he might end his life.The court had then also accepted the assurances given by Modi govt about the conditions at Arthur Road jail — where the fugitive diamantaire would be lodged once he comes back, noting that India is a “friendly country”. The submission before the Westminster court will be made against an appeal filed by the incarcerated diamantaire seeking to reopen his extradition trial with prayers to stay his deportation cleared by the UK high court.The case has been scheduled for hearing on November 23.For the past several years, India has been fighting a tough legal battle in the UK courts seeking the extradition of the diamantaire, who was arrested in London in 2019 on an Indian extradition request, and has been behind bars for the last six years. In May this year, his bail application had been rejected for the eighth time, citing concerns of his disappearance and influencing witnesses.In July, his brother Nehal Modi, another accused in the PNB scam case, was arrested in the US by American authorities on charges of laundering the proceeds of crime. In multiple chargesheets filed in the PNB case during 2018 and 2019, ED had levelled serious charges against Nehal Modi, of destroying evidence and laundering proceeds of crime on behalf of his brother.“Nehal Modi was personally overseeing that all the accounts, records were destroyed and was influencing the employees/witnesses to conceal money trail and proceeds of crime,” sources said. The ED’s evidence against Nehal Modi includes his footprint in laundering huge stockpiles of gold, diamonds and cash consignments from Dubai and Hong Kong based entities of Nirav Modi.","Ed and cbi, besides other agencies like the income tax, have together decided to make a joint submission before the westminster court in london.

Russia-Pakistan arms deal: Congress hits out at PM; terms it ‘failure of personalised diplomacy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russia-pakistan-arms-deal-congress-hits-out-at-pm-terms-it-failure-of-personalised-diplomacy/articleshow/124307378.cms,"Jairam Ramesh (left), Vladimir Putin and PM Modi (file - agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Congress party on Friday questioned the Modi government's foreign policy approach after reports emerged that Russia is going ahead with supplying advanced RD-93MA jet engines for Pakistan’s JF-17 fighter aircraft, despite India’s diplomatic objections.In a post on X, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “personalised diplomacy” and asked why a traditional strategic partner like Russia was now “providing military support” to Pakistan, even as India continues to engage in high-value defence deals with Moscow.""The Modi government must explain why Russia - once India’s most reliable strategic ally - has chosen to ignore New Delhi’s appeals and proceed with supplying advanced RD-93MA engines to Pakistan’s fleet of Chinese-made JF-17 fighter jets,"" Ramesh wrote, referencing reports that the latest JF-17 Block III variant would be equipped with upgraded engines and PL-15 missiles. These are the same missiles believed to have been used during Operation Sindoor, following the Pahalgam terror attack.He also cited the recent statement of the Indian air force chief, who indicated that the JF-17 may have been among the Pakistani aircraft used during the conflict.Ramesh taking an aim at PM Modi said the development highlights the limitations of high-visibility diplomacy. ""Years of high-profile summits, choreographed photo opportunities with hugs, and grandstanding on the world stage have failed to yield substantive outcomes,"" he said.He added that despite external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s direct intervention in June 2025, the Russian-Pakistani defence deal is reportedly moving forward. India, meanwhile, remains engaged with Russia on major defence purchases, including the S-400 missile systems and potential acquisition of Su-57 stealth fighters.Taking a broader swipe at the government’s strategic posture, Ramesh said India has failed to diplomatically isolate Pakistan. He pointed to Pakistan's army chief, field marshal Asim Munir, who made provocative statements ahead of the Pahalgam attack, continues to receive backing from China and is now being “courted” by both Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump.“India remains unable to diplomatically isolate Pakistan. Instead, Pakistan’s leadership – including its army chief field marshal Asim Munir, whose communally poisonous statements provided the immediate backdrop to the Pahalgam terror attack – is being courted very warmly by President Donald Trump and supplied weapons by President Vladimir Putin, all while enjoying unqualified backing from China during Operation Sindoor,” Ramesh wrote.The Congress has demanded that the Modi government provide a clear explanation of the implications of the Russia-Pakistan deal, and whether it signals a shift in Moscow’s strategic posture in the region.",Congress party questions modi government's foreign policy approach.

Ease of immigration to make Navi Mumbai airport a 'true hub',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ease-of-immigration-to-make-navi-mumbai-airport-a-true-hub/articleshow/124314029.cms,"NMIA will have an initial annual capacity to handle 2 crore passengers

NEW DELHI: Unshackling India's financial capital from its decades-old aviation infra crunch with the inauguration of the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), Modi government is all set to fulfil its vision of giving the country true hubs.From more slots for more aircraft including long range wide bodies, and a revamped immigration and security set up, the government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure Indians from across the country use the Navi Mumbai airport with an initial annual capacity to handle two crore passengers as a hub to fly an Indian carrier to rest of the world. The airport is scheduled to be inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi on October 8, with the first commercial flight in about a month.Soon, passengers travelling from at least seven cities in south and west India like Ahmedabad, Surat and Hyderabad to Mumbai's NMIA or Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to take connecting international flights from there will be able to clear immigration at the first airport itself.This will enable them to fly into Mumbai, clear security and board their next flight - a seamless transit like that currently offered in Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi or Singapore Changi.Only difference: 'Atma Nirbharta' with a majority of them increasingly flying from an Indian hub on an Indian airline and not being ""feeders"" for foreign carriers via hubs abroad.For Delhi, the government is working on at least five cities in north and east India like Amritsar, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Lucknow and Varanasi, where people will be able to clear immigration on their way to Delhi for taking a connecting international flight. NCR is also going to get its second international airport before the end of this year when Noida International Airport (NIA) is expected to become operational.NIA, however, will have almost 95% domestic traffic, and the capital's IGIA still has spare capacity and scope for further growth.So the main focus in Delhi for seamless domestic (D)- international (I), I-D & I-I transfers is on IGIA. NIA will see D-D transfers, just like IGIA does.""NMIA will be a game-changer as CSMIA was for years operating beyond capacity. The travel demand of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is immense. Navi Mumbai, which was only talked about as the site of a second airport since 1997, is now getting an airport and preparatory work has already started for MMR's third airport at Vadhawan. We see the dual airport system positioning Mumbai as the primary gateway for India travellers to the world while connecting the globe with Tier II & III cities here,"" said an official.""We are working to set up a true hub-and-spoke at NMIA, CSMIA and Delhi's IGIA with domestic networks of big and upcoming airlines, including Air India group, IndiGo and Akasa, flying in passengers who then take connecting flights on them to the rest of the world. Ditto on the way back,"" the official added..Officials say the Modi government has been working to strengthen the country's airline ecosystem as it foresaw the country's travel demand in coming years - which would have otherwise been continued to be met by foreign airlines via their hubs abroad.From 2014, India's guiding principle for granting flying rights (bilaterals) to foreign countries was keeping the interests of Indian airlines and passengers foremost. This allowed IndiGo, Air India and AI Express, after their successful divestment in 2022, and young Akasa to increase Indian carriers' share in international traffic to and from India to 46% in 2024 from the low 30s about a decade back.The simultaneous push on airport infrastructure is seeing Delhi NCR and MMR getting their second airports along with major expansion in other places like at Hyderabad and Bengaluru. With the right combination of strong airports and airlines, the focus is now on seamless transfers.""Supply chain constraints have meant IndiGo, AI Group and Akasa, among others, have not been able to get planes at the required pace from Boeing and Airbus. The government has eased the policy of leasing aircraft to help airlines overcome this challenge. IndiGo has been able to grow its international network due to that. AI has also started showing some aggression in the past month. The IndiGo long range Airbus A321s will start arriving from next Jan that will allow the airline to fly to Europe and the far east"" said an official.He said the government is the enabler and it is upto private players in the aviation ecosystem to make the most of India's massive potential.",Nmia will have an initial annual capacity to handle 2 crore passengers.

India’s Growth And Resilience Unshaken Despite Global Tariff Pressures, Says Nirmala Sitharaman

AHMEDABAD: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets lying with banks, RBI , insurance firms, mutual funds, provident fund accounts and other institutions to their rightful owners.The three-month programme also seeks to raise awareness. ""These unclaimed amounts are not government property but belong to individuals and families,"" Sitharaman said. ""Decades have passed when people voiced the need to return unclaimed monies from banks, RBI, or the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF). This is their money.""She said such funds often arise due to missing documentation, forgotten policies or lack of awareness. ""It is like a ripe fruit hanging within reach but not falling into the hands of those to whom it belongs,"" she remarked.The campaign rests on three pillars - Awareness, Access and Action. Awareness means informing people about unclaimed money; Access through RBI's UDGAM portal; and Action, where officials act on even small clues to help claimants.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets.

Poll Which aspect of Mission Sudarshan Chakra do you think is most important? Enhancing air defence Integrating cyber security and surveillance

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army has issued a tender to procure AK-630 air defence guns from the state-owned Advanced Weapon and Equipment India Ltd (AWEIL) under Mission Sudarshan Chakra, an ambitious national security initiative announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day address.“Indian Army Air Defence has floated an RFP (Request for Proposal) for the procurement of six AK-630 Air Defence Gun Systems with AWEIL,” defence officials told ANI. “The system sought is a 30mm multi-barrel mobile air defence gun system with a high rate of fire.”According to the officials, the weapon would be ""utilised to thwart the threat from URAM (Unmanned aerial vehicles, rocket, artillery and mortar) and for the protection of key population centres and centres of faith in close proximity to the international border and Line of Control (with Pakistan).”The gun system would be mounted on a trailer and towed by a high mobility vehicle, with an effective range of up to 4 km and a cyclic rate of fire of up to 3,000 rounds per minute. Detection and engagement would be achieved through an all-weather Electro-Optical Fire Control system.The army conducted internal trials of the AK-630s in May, just days after the conflict with Pakistan came to a halt following a ceasefire request from Islamabad. The system reportedly performed proficiently, effectively neutralising practice aerial targets, though “some areas had been identified for enhancement.”During the four-day cross-border clashes, Pakistan had carried out direct attacks on civilians and religious buildings in border states including Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. Along with the Indian Air Force, the army’s air defence played a key role in thwarting the attacks.Modelled partly on Israel’s famed Iron Dome, Mission Sudarshan Chakra is described is India’s plan to create a ""comprehensive, multi-layered, indigenous security shield by 2035, integrating surveillance, cyber security, and air defence systems to protect key installations from various enemy attacks.""The mission also aims to provide both a defensive barrier and a potential offensive capability, aligning with the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative to enhance self-reliance in defence technology.","The gun system would be mounted on a trailer and towed by a high mobility vehicle.

Transnational organised crime is a concern for India & Canada, says govt

NEW DELHI: While Canadian police focus on tackling the Bishnoi syndicate, pro-Khalistan elements attempted arson at a cinema theatre in Ontario twice within a week. The theatre has stopped screening Hindi movies since. The attacks were carried out on Oct 2 and Sept 25. In the second incident, the suspects fired gunshots to cause a scare.Designated terror group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) released a statement on Friday calling on the Carney govt to ban all “Made In India” films.In the first incident, two masked suspects wearing black clothing attempted to ignite a fire at the theatre’s entrance using flammable liquid from red gas cans, CCTV footage released by Khalistani elements shows. The fire was contained outside, causing moderate damage. This happened at 5.30am on Sept 25.On Oct 2, around 1.50am, a single suspect, described by local police as a heavy-built male wearing black and a face mask, fired multiple shots at the theatre’s entrance doors.Halton Regional Police said they were probing both incidents as targeted attacks.The threatre’s CEO Jeff Knoll linked the attacks to the screening of south Asian films, adding that due to safety concerns, it had halted the screenings of Indian films ‘Kantara: A Legend Chapter 1’ and ‘They Call Him OG’.SFJ chief Pannun claimed “Make in India” was no longer a cultural label but had become a political weapon for Modi’s regime. “Every screening and every product stamped ‘Made in India’ carries the imprint of a violent ideology that is driving India toward a Hindutva totalitarian state,” he said . Allowing Indian films and products into Canadian markets, he warned, was equivalent to opening the door to propaganda that normalises violence against pro-Khalistan Sikhs and undermines the values enshrined in Canada’s Charter.India and Canada had productive talks in the recent NSA-level meeting on advancing the bilateral relationship in areas such as counter terrorism, combating transnational organised crime and intelligence exchanges, said the govt responding to queries on Ottawa’s listing of the Bishnoi gang as a terrorist entity.MEA said security cooperation is an important agenda of continued bilateral collaboration. “Transnational organised crime is a particular concern to both countries. All countries, in fact, must come together to fight this menace,” said MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal. “They agreed to strengthen security cooperation and further reinforce existing mechanisms of engagement.”",Canadian police focus on tackling the bishnoi syndicate.

Poll Do you agree with Rahul Gandhi's statement about the attack on Indian democracy? Yes No

Rahul Gandhi - Conferencia El futuro es hoy

'Demonetisation, GST destroying small, medium businesses'



'Cowardice at heart of RSS-BJP ideology'



'Rahul wants to fight Indian state!'



NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , accused the BJP-led central government of mounting a “wholesale attack on Indian democracy” during an interaction at EIA University in Colombia. The BJP hit back, calling him a “Leader of Propaganda” and criticising him for ""once again"" denigrating Indian democracy on a foreign platform.""The single biggest risk is the attack on democracy that is taking place in India because India has multiple religions, multiple traditions, multiple languages. And India actually is a conversation between all its people and different traditions, different religions, different ideas require space. And that the best method for creating that space is the democratic system. And currently there is a wholesale attack on the democratic system in India,"" Rahul said during a recent interaction with students.Contrasting Indian political system with that of China's, he said, ""This other big risk is risk between different conceptions, different parts of the country, right? Some 16, 17 different languages, different religions. So allowing these different traditions to thrive, giving them space to express themselves is very important for a country like India. We can't do what China does, which is suppress people and run authoritarian system.Our design just will not accept that.""""Most of the people, for example, who are creating polarisation in the US with Mr Trump are those who lost their jobs because of manufacturing. China has demonstrated to the world how you can manage production in a non-democratic setup, but we cannot do that; we are a democratic setup. The challenge is whether we can develop manufacturing like China but within a democratic setup,"" he added.Targeting the central government's policies, including demonetisation and GST, Rahul said that these economic policies ""destroyed small and medium businesses and allowed very large monopolies to control a big section of our economy.""""The Government of India brought two policies - first, the demonetisation of our currency, which essentially destroyed small and medium businesses and allowed very large monopolies to control a big section of our economy; and second, GST, which was again designed to harm medium and small businesses. We believe that supporting these small businesses is the way forward for entrepreneurship, and that’s the difference between us and those in power who believe that a few monopolies should control the economy,"" he said.""In India, we have a huge level of corruption at the centralised level. Three or four businesses are taking over the whole economy, having a direct relationship with the Prime Minister, and it is rampant in India,"" he added.Citing past statements by foreign minister S Jaishankar about China and Hindu ideologue VD Savarkar about beating up a Muslim man, Rahul said that ""cowardice was at heart of RSS-BJP ideology.""""This is the nature of BJP-RSS. If you notice a statement of the foreign minister, he said, 'China is much more powerful than us. How can I pick a fight with them?' At the heart of the ideology is cowardice,"" he said.""In his book, Savarkar has written that once he and his few friends beat up a Muslim man, and they felt very happy that day. If five people beat up a single individual, which makes one of them happy, it is cowardice. This is RSS ideology, to beat weak people,"" he added.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla criticised Rahul for making such statements abroad.""Once again Rahul Gandhi behaves like LoP - Leader of Propaganda Goes abroad and attacks Indian Democracy! After all he wants to fight Indian state! Sometimes Demands US UK should intervene into our affairs and now this From Sena to Judiciary to Sanvidhan to Sanatan!"" he said in a post on X.Moreover, BJP's Pradeep Bhandari accused ""Gandhi-Vadra family"" of keeping India ""poor.""""Rahul Gandhi is anti-India. The one who hates India and its progress can speak such things on foreign soil that India can't be a leader. The Gandhi-Vadra family kept India poor due to such a mindset. When they see that India has emerged as a global leader and a four trillion-dollar economy under PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi is attacking India's progress and its democracy out of jealousy and disgust,"" Bhandari told ANI.""This makes it clear that Rahul Gandhi's remote control is in foreign hands. Those who don't want India to progress push Rahul Gandhi to say such things. He is not a political opponent, but leader of opposing India. He is against India's unity and integrity. 140 crore Indians are witnessing Rahul Gandhi's attempt to defame India from foreign soil,"" he added.Ravi Shankar Prasad also took aim at Gandhi saying that instead of greeting Indians on the occasion of Vijayadashami, he chose to ""speak against India.""“Rahul Gandhi is abroad.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Reveals How India Thwarted Pakistan’s Attempt During Op Sindoor

Our fight against terror continues: Min

NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, defence minister Rajnath Singh Thursday said this shows its “true intentions”. Any misadventure by the neighbour would result in a response “so strong it will change both history and geography” of the area, he warned.“In 1965 (war), Indian Army showed courage by reaching Lahore. In 2025, Pakistan must remember that the road to Karachi also passes through the Creek,” Singh said after performing shastra (arms) puja at Bhuj military station in Gujarat.The marshlands of Sir Creek, a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Rann of Kutch and Pakistan’s Sindh, have been a bone of contention between the neighbours due to differing interpretations of the maritime boundary in the region. The long-standing dispute has implications for access to fishing rights and potential natural resources like oil and gas in the region and affects drawing of maritime boundaries and EEZs in Arabian Sea.Talking about the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, Rajnath said Pakistan made failed attempts to penetrate India’s defences along the LoCand International Border stretching from Leh to the Sir Creek region by launching multiple waves of drones and some missiles.The Indian response “exposed the weaknesses of Pakistan’s air defence”, Rajnath said. Despite its superior capability, India showed restraint because its military action was targeted against terrorism and its training hubs.“The objective of Operation Sindoor was not to escalate and start a war. I am happy that the Indian armed forces successfully achieved all the military objectives of Operation Sindoor.However, our fight against terrorismcontinues,” he said.","Rajnath singh warns pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive sir creek region.

But, FOX Sports later released a statement confirming that Sanchez is now recovering in the hospital and is in stable condition. This update was shared by FOX Sports PR and was, “Mark Sanchez was injured in Indianapolis on Saturday and is currently recovering in the hospital in stable condition.

Elaine Chen and Larry Fitzpatrick allege retaliation by the New York Jets

New York Jets deny allegations and prepare countersuit against Elaine Chen and Larry Fitzpatrick

Elaine Chen, who worked as vice president of finance for the New York Jets, says she was removed from her job after sexual harassment complaints were raised against team president Hymie Elhai. The lawsuit, filed in New York in October 2025, claims Chen and her husband, Larry Fitzpatrick, the Jets’ former vice president of ticket sales, were pushed out of the franchise in July 2025. Chen argues she was punished for supporting the allegations against Elhai, while the Jets strongly deny her claims.In her filing, Elaine Chen says the issue began in July 2025, when an anonymous email was sent to several Jets employees. That email accused Hymie Elhai of sending inappropriate text messages and making unprofessional remarks to women in the workplace.Elaine Chen says her husband, Larry Fitzpatrick, was questioned by team officials after receiving the email and was fired on July 25. She says she was dismissed just five days later, on July 30, despite denying any role in writing or sharing the email.Chen claims she had no direct proof but had heard from others that Elhai harassed female staff members.In the lawsuit, she says she was told she lost her job because the team could no longer trust her.She also argues that at least two other employees who saw the same anonymous email were not punished. According to Chen, the Jets were “targeting anyone” who believed the allegations should be properly investigated.The Jets have called the lawsuit “categorically false.” In a statement published on October 3, 2025, the franchise said it carried out a third-party investigation and found that the claims against Hymie Elhai had no merit.The team says the anonymous email was actually part of a “deliberate conspiracy” involving Elaine Chen, Larry Fitzpatrick, and other former employees.Also Read: Arthur Jones cause of death: How did the Ravens’ Super Bowl champion die at 39 The Jets also accuse Fitzpatrick of deleting more than 4,000 text messages to hide his role in the matter. They claim those texts showed both Fitzpatrick and Chen worked together to create the email that tried to damage Elhai’s reputation.According to the franchise, Chen’s lawsuit left out important evidence and contradicted her earlier interviews during the internal review.A New York Jets spokesperson told The Daily Mail that Chen was fired “for legitimate and lawful business reasons” and accused her of joining a plan to defame Elhai.The team says it will now countersue Elaine Chen, Fitzpatrick, and others for defamation and libel. Hymie Elhai, who joined the Jets in 2000 and became president in 2019, has not commented directly on the case.","Former jets executive elaine chen alleges retaliation and firing after explosive sexual harassment accusations against team president hymie elhai.

UAE moon-sighting committee : Guardians of tradition





The UAE has officially confirmed that Ramadan 2026 will begin on Thursday, February 19, 2026, following the successful sighting of the new crescent moon. Astronomers and moon-sighting committees across the Emirates observed the moon, marking the start of the holy month for fasting, prayer, and reflection.As the Islamic year progresses, anticipation builds for the arrival of Ramadan 2026. Astronomers from the Emirates Astronomy Society have provided preliminary calculations, indicating that the holy month is expected to commence on Thursday, February 19, 2026. This projection is based on the expected birth of the new crescent moon on Tuesday, February 17, 2026, at 4:01 PM UAE time. However, the moon will set just one minute after sunset on that day, making its sighting impossible that evening. Consequently, the first day of Ramadan is anticipated to be Thursday, February 19, pending official confirmation by the UAE's moon-sighting committees.In Abu Dhabi, fasting hours are projected to begin at approximately 12 hours and 46 minutes at the start of Ramadan. These hours are expected to gradually increase to 13 hours and 25 minutes by the end of the month, aligning with the extension of daylight hours from 11 hours and 32 minutes to 12 hours and 12 minutes.Early in Ramadan, temperatures in Abu Dhabi are anticipated to range between 16°C and 28°C, influenced by lingering northern winter winds. By the end of the month, temperatures are expected to rise to between 19°C and 32°C, as spring weather patterns and westerly winds typically develop. Additionally, rainfall remains possible throughout the holy month, with precipitation levels potentially exceeding 15 millimeters, in line with seasonal climate averages for this time of year.The UAE Moon-Sighting Committee, officially known as the Shawwal Moon-Sighting Committee, is responsible for observing the crescent moon that marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of Shawwal, leading to the celebration of Eid Al-Fitr. Chaired by His Excellency Sheikh Abdullah bin Bayyah, President of the UAE Council for Fatwa, the committee comprises leading local scholars, Islamic jurists, and expert astronomers. They convene annually to receive reports and testimonies regarding the moon's visual sighting, ensuring that the Islamic calendar aligns with lunar cycle-based observations.With Ramadan 2026 officially beginning on February 19, communities across the UAE are preparing for a month of spiritual reflection, generosity, and togetherness. From moon sightings to iftar gatherings, the holy month promises faith, joy, and cultural celebration for everyone observing Ramadan.","Uae confirms ramadan 2026 begins february 19, with moon-sighting committees uniting faith, tradition, and astronomy for the holy month.

Hamas on Friday announced it had agreed to release all Israeli hostages, alive or deceased, under the terms of US President Donald Trump’s Gaza proposal, and expressed readiness to immediately enter mediated talks to finalise the details, reported news agency Reuters.In the statement, Hamas said it agreed ""to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump's proposal"" - if the proper conditions for the exchanges are met.The announcement came shortly after Trump issued an ultimatum to Hamas, warning that unless it agreed to a peace deal with Israel by Sunday 6 pm Washington DC time, unprecedented consequences would follow.“An Agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M., Washington, D.C. time. Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas. THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.The US president urged Palestinians to leave Gaza’s conflict-hit areas, which have faced continuous Israeli bombardment since the October 7 attacks.“I am asking that all innocent Palestinians immediately leave this area of potentially great future death for safer parts of Gaza. Everyone will be well cared for by those that are waiting to help. Fortunately for Hamas, however, they will be given one last chance!” he said.Trump also highlighted his 20-point Gaza peace plan, which he claimed had been agreed upon by Israel, the US and regional powers. He described it as a historic breakthrough that would end centuries of bloodshed in the region.“Great, powerful, and very rich Nations of the Middle East, and the surrounding areas beyond, together with the United States of America, have agreed, with Israel signing on, to PEACE, after 3000 years, in the Middle East. THIS DEAL ALSO SPARES THE LIVES OF ALL REMAINING HAMAS FIGHTERS! The details of the document are known to the WORLD, and it is a great one for ALL! We will have PEACE in the Middle East one way or the other. The violence and bloodshed will stop. RELEASES THE HOSTAGES, ALL OF THEM, INCLUDING THE BODIES OF THOSE THAT ARE DEAD, NOW!” Trump declared.UN also welcomed Hamas’s announcement and expressed encouragement over Hamas’s readiness to release hostages and engage in negotiations. “The Secretary-General welcomes and is encouraged by the statement issued by Hamas announcing its readiness to release hostages and to engage,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. He urged all parties to seize this opportunity to end the tragic conflict and protect civilians.On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale surprise attack on Israel, marking the most significant escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.The assault commenced during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and involved a barrage of over 4,000 rockets, along with coordinated incursions by land, air, and sea. Hamas militants breached the Gaza-Israel barrier at 119 locations, infiltrating 21 Israeli communities, including Be'eri, Kfar Aza, and Alumim.The attackers targeted military installations and civilian areas, resulting in the deaths of at least 1,195 individuals, comprising 736 Israeli civilians, 79 foreign nationals, and 379 security personnel. Additionally, approximately 250 individuals were taken hostage to Gaza, including civilians and soldiers. The assault also led to widespread destruction, with numerous homes and infrastructure damaged or destroyed.This unprecedented attack has significantly intensified the ongoing conflict, leading to severe humanitarian consequences and drawing widespread international attention.","Hamas agrees to release all israeli hostages, alive or deceased, under the terms of us president donald trump’s gaza proposal.

Previous US government shutdowns

What programs and payments will stop during US government shutdown





The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure. The full shutdown began at midnight Wednesday, September 30, after Democratic and Republican leaders failed to agree on even a short-term deal to keep the government fully funded past the current fiscal year. So far, it is unclear how long the shutdown will last, or how widespread its impact will be.A key sticking point behind the stalemate is said to be Democrats’ insistence on including the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap funding bill. Republicans have claimed that Democrats are pushing to provide government benefits to undocumented immigrants. Republicans claim that Democrats want to give health care to ""illegal immigrants."" Democrats say that they are only trying to restore health care coverage options that were available to immigrants having “lawful presence” in the United States before those options were eliminated by President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” tax bill this year.While so far Elon Musk has not directly commented on the US government shutdown, he has shared/reposted several tweets that support Republican's claim that Democrats want to give health care benefits to ""illegal immigrants”. He quoted VP JD Vance's post on Chuck Schumer rewarding illegal immigrants, and wrote, ""Once Chuck realized that importing voters was a surefire way for Dems to win elections and create a permanent one-party state in America (just like happened in California and New York), he became very much in favor of bribing illegals to come to America!""In his post, JD Vance wrote, ""Chuck Schumer once recognized that it was disastrous to give illegal aliens rewards for breaking the law.Now he wants to shut down the government unless we…reward illegal aliens for breaking the law. x.com/westernlensman…""Elon Musk also shared a Twitter post of White House deputy chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller that says, ""First shutdown in world history to demand free healthcare for illegal aliens.""""In 2019, every Democrat presidential candidate rose their hand in support for healthcare for illegal aliens. Today, Democrats are willing to shut down the government over free healthcare for illegals. Democrats have always put illegals before Americans,"" reads another Tweet reposted by Elon Musk.The American federal government has either shut down or experienced funding gaps 14 times since 1980. The longest shutdown on record occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, lasting 35 days. That partial shutdown was a result of a stalemate over President Donald Trump’s demand for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.While every government shutdown is unique, they all operate under the same basic principles: non-essential services cease, and many federal employees are furloughed without pay. However, agencies deemed critical for the ""protection of lives and property"" remain operational. These ""essential"" employees, who include air traffic controllers, law enforcement agents, and active-duty military personnel, are required to work but do not receive their paychecks until funding is restored.However, OMB this time is said to be not posting agencies’ shutdown contingency plans on its website. Instead, the plans are hosted only on each agency’s site. This is reported to have made it harder to assess how the Trump administration will handle the shutdown and which activities it will deem essential.","The us government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked congress failed to pass a funding measure.
