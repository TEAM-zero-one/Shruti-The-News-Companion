Writing from middle, not end



Moments over milestones



Power of the ordinary



Once the preserve of people who had lived long, complicated lives — ageing film stars, war survivors, Nobel laureates — memoirs now follow a different timetable. From bookstore front tables to literary fest panels across India, writers in their twenties and thirties are redefining what a memoir looks like, and who gets to tell it.These are not tales of epic achievement or reflections after retirement, but lives still in motion with millennials and GenZs sharing their tales of growing up queer or disabled, surviving political violence, navigating family expectations, illness, ambition, and the ordinary challenges of becoming an adult, somewhere mid-journey.One such writer is K Vaishali, who was just 24 when she first thought of writing her life story. Growing up as a lesbian and dyslexic person in India, her life had been a tug of war between secrets and confessions — at home and on university campus — navigating double marginalisation. Even as the urge to pen her story grew, so did the hesitation.“I thought hiding under the garb of fiction would be easier. It was my editor who pushed me to make it a memoir,” says the author, now 33. While working on the book, Vaishali discovered queer memoirs by Western writers but struggled to find Indian reference points.“I wanted young people to know there is hope. I didn’t have that growing up,” she says.While many writers wrestle with questions about the relevance of their life story, Sanjana Ramachandran never did. Growing up in a Tamil Brahmin family, she was just 17 when she knew her “filmy” life had to be written about. Ramachandran never climbed Everest or entered the Limca Book of Records, but did something many women of her generation would recognise: appeared for competitive exams, pursued engineering followed by an MBA, clashed with a strict father, and explored her politics and sexuality. Titled ‘Famous Last Questions’, the memoir came out last year. She was 31.“There was no way to not write it,” she says. While working on the book, Ramachandran realised how closely her experiences mirrored those of other ’90s kids in India who lived double lives at home and struggled to be themselves. “I knew it would be helpful to me and to some others, no matter how small or large the number.”A similar zeal defined Tarini Mohan’s ‘Lifequake’, which traces how the young development professional’s life was turned upside down after an accident that led to a traumatic brain injury at 23. A decade later she began writing the book, eager to capture the details in case they became blurry later. “I didn't want it to be inspiring or a success story about ‘overcoming’ limitations, just a normal girl’s journey,” she says. “I hate that word. You don’t overcome disability. You live with it.” In the book, Mohan is vulnerable as she talks about not just slipping in and out of coma, but everyday things she took for granted. “Like going out dancing.”While personal stories are the staple of memoirs, some writers are also trying to find a balance between the political and the personal. Zara Chowdhary’s ‘The Lucky Ones’ recounts her 16-yearold self navigating the Gujarat riots of 2002 with family, and how that violence changed their lives.“I was always keenly aware of the lapses and voids. Memory, whether my own or that of survivors within my household or the larger community, is pliant. The gaps often tell a more profound story. Different versions only reveal how all nonfiction is also ultimately fiction,” she says.In the memoir, which was recently awarded the Shakti Bhatt Prize, the writer not only documents her family’s story but also braids it together with other witness accounts, and how the aftermath of the violence was navigated over generations. “It’s about keeping one’s conscience at the centre of one’s writing,” she adds, “and asking what is still urgent or relevant.”Tara Khandelwal, editor and founder of storytelling agency Bound, says such examples show that the definition of ‘memoir’ is finally changing in India. “There’s a growing awareness that a memoir doesn’t have to be the chronological story of your life from point A to Z. It can be about a year or a particular episode in one’s life,” says Khandelwal.To tap into this curiosity, Bound recently launched a new imprint, ‘Moments’. The submissions so far range from grandchildren writing about grandparents to a young cybercrime specialist documenting their cases. “Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction,” Khandelwal says. “That’s what makes it tick.”Another is “personal branding” in an age of algorithm-driven social media platforms, points out Karthika V K, publisher at Westland Books. “There’s a change in the way that personal experience rubs up against public expression. It’s no longer only the very senior or obviously successful person whose lives are worth sharing,” she says.This, of course, means that there are shallow narratives and vanity projects alongside many more courageous and inspiring attempts to articulate lived experience of conflict, growth, achievement and failure. From startup CEOs and social media influencers to therapists and young parents.“Selective or partial memoirs are now far more popular than the conventional autobiography,” she says. “And where readers are interested, publishers will follow.”","Writers in their twenties and thirties are redefining what a memoir looks like.

Iran Reaffirms 3000-Year Civilisational Bond With India, Says Chabahar Port 'Will Work Nicely'

NEW DELHI: India joined China, Pakistan and 4 other countries in voting against a UN Human Rights Council resolution that strongly deplored the crackdown on protests in Iran and extended the mandate of a fact-finding mission on the country by 2 years, while authorising it to investigate last month’s “repression”.The 47-member body adopted the resolution with 25 votes in favour, 7 against and 14 abstentions.India has a history of not backing country-specific resolutions and has mostly in the past voted against UN resolutions on human rights situation in Iran but the vote was still significant as it came when Tehran was in dire need of support against a US backlash over the protests. Significantly, when the fact-finding mission was established in 2022, India had only abstained and not voted against.Iran ambassador to India Mohammad Fathali was quick to thank India for its “principled and firm support...including opposing an unjust and politically motivated resolution”.“This stance reflects India’s commitment to justice, multilateralism, and national sovereignty,” said the ambassador in a post on X.India has mostly in the past voted against similar resolutions in the UN, following the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.In 2024, India abstained because of comments made by Iranian authorities on the J&K issue. It was back to voting against in 2025 after assurance from Iran it would not comment on India’s internal affairs.India has traditionally viewed country-specific resolutions and intrusive investigative mechanisms as politically motivated. According to sources, India’s vote this week was aligned with its own interests and not with the concerns of major groups in the Council.While underscoring its strategic autonomy, India’s backing of Iran also suggests it has not given up yet on the strategic Chabahar port in Iran that finds itself in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump. The Trump administration had last year revoked the sanctions waiver issued in 2018 but later extended the waiver till April 2026 this year, allowing India a temporary reprieve. India said last week it remains in touch with the US to work out this arrangement. India sees Iran as playing a pivotal role in facilitating its connectivity with Afghanistan and Central Asian countries.Underling the need for India to work with Iran on the Chabahar port, a source speaking on condition of anonymity said India’s interest lies in maintaining a functional relationship with Iran and that is reflected in India’s rejection of the resolution that called for an urgent investigation by the fact-finding mission “in the context of the repression of nationwide protests beginning 28 December 2025”.The fact that this wasn’t a regular session, but a special one called by the Council to address the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran was also seen as unwarranted by India.The resolution strongly deplored the violent crackdown of peaceful protests resulting in the deaths of “thousands of persons, including children, and large numbers of injured individuals, as well as the arrest of thousands in connection with the nationwide protests that started on 28 December 2025”.","India joined china, pakistan and 4 other countries in voting against a un human rights council resolution.

“Invitation To Nation Building”: PM Modi Hands Over 61,000 Appointment Letters At 18th Rozgar Mela

Recall difficulties you faced, shield others from them, PM tells recruits

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday urged over 61,000 newly-recruited personnel to reflect on the difficulties they faced while dealing with govt offices over the past 5-7 years, and to ensure citizens don't encounter similar problems during their tenure.The PM was virtually addressing the 18th edition of Rozgar Mela at 45 locations. ""India is signing trade and mobility agreements with several countries. These trade agreements are bringing new opportunities for youth of the nation,"" he said. He also highlighted his govt's big push for reforms.In his address, the PM also highlighted how the world's trust in India is increasing and is also creating many new possibilities for the youth. He added that India is the only large economy in the world that has doubled its GDP in a decade. ""Today, more than a hundred countries are investing in India,"" he said.Highlighting govt’s big push for reform, Modi said the talk of India’s “Reform Express” is being discussed everywhere and every new recruit also has a role to play. Assigning a task to them, the PM said, “Recall, in the last 5-7 years, when and in what form have you had contact with govt? Whether you had work in some govt office, or interacted through some other medium and you faced trouble, felt some deficiency, or felt some irritation — just remember such things.Now you have to decide that those things which troubled you, sometimes troubled your parents, sometimes troubled your friends, and what used to pinch you, feel bad, or make you angry — now you will not let those difficulties happen to other citizens during your own tenure.”Modi said that they now being a part of govt need to carry out small reforms at their level and must ensure that the maximum number of people are benefited. He said apart from the policy reforms, ease of living and ease of doing business is strengthened by honesty of govt employees. The PM also urged the young employees to work with the motto 'Nagrik Devo Bhava (Citizen is akin to God)’ while discharging their duties.Modi said unprecedented investments in modern infrastructure has led to increased employment across construction-related sectors and India's startup ecosystem is also expanding rapidly, with nearly two lakh registered startups employing over 21 lakh youth.On the recent next-generation reforms in GST, PM said these have benefitted youth entrepreneurs and MSMEs, while labour reforms have strengthened social security for workers and employees, benefiting businesses as well.In an official statement, the PMO said that since its inception, more than 11 lakh recruitment letters have been issued through Rozgar Melas organised across the country.","Pm narendra modi urged over 61,000 newly-recruited personnel to reflect on the difficulties they faced while dealing with govt offices.

Air India on Saturday announced the cancellation of all its flights to and from New York and Newark on January 25 and 26, citing forecasts of a severe winter storm with heavy snowfall.In a travel advisory, the airline said a major winter storm is expected to affect New York, New Jersey and adjoining areas along the US East Coast from early Sunday through Monday, significantly impacting flight operations.“Considering the safety of our passengers and crew, all Air India flights to and from New York and Newark have been cancelled on January 25 and 26,” the airline said.Air India added that its teams would provide full assistance to passengers booked to travel on these dates.The airline also shared helpline numbers for further information, asking passengers to contact its 24×7 call centre at +91 11 6932 9333 and +91 11 6932 9999.Meanwhile, harsh winter conditions across the United States have taken a toll on nearly half the population, as a days-long storm system brings snow, sleet, ice, bitter cold and widespread power outages.Forecasters warned that the damage, particularly in areas coated in ice-could be catastrophic and rival the impact of a hurricane.After sweeping through the South, the storm is expected to move into the Northeast, dumping up to a foot (30 cm) of snow from Washington through New York and Boston, according to the National Weather Service.Boston has declared a cold emergency through the weekend, while Connecticut is coordinating with neighbouring New York and Massachusetts in case travel restrictions are required on major highways.","Air india on saturday announced the cancellation of all its flights to and from new york and newark on january 25 and 26.

'Never Defied Cong In Parliament': 'Unapologetic' Shashi Tharoor Defends Modi Praise, Sindoor Stand

NEW DELHI: The ongoing tension between the Congress and Shashi Tharoor sharpened further after another party MP took a swipe at the Trivandrum MP, remarking that he was “not a big part” of Congress. The rift has been in focus as Tharoor skipped a crucial poll-related party meeting in Kerala, opting instead to attend the Kerala Literature Festival. Responding to media reports on the discord, Tharoor said that while some of the claims were true, he would prefer to convey his views within the party.""Shashi Tharoor is not a big part.(It’s not like it matters if he wasn’t seen; there’s nothing to it),"" Congress MP Imran Masood said on Saturday.Speaking to reporters on the rift earlier in the day, Tharoor said that such ""matters should not be discussed on public platforms"", adding that he would prefer to ""convey concerns directly to the party leadership"".""It is better to convey concerns directly to the party leadership. Several things have appeared in the media, some of which may be true while others may not be, and that such matters should not be discussed on public platforms.I had informed the party in advance that I would not be attending the programme and whatever I have to say will be said within the party,"" he said.""I have nothing to say about the Ernakulam controversy. I had wished to release book at the event, but the book launch at the Jaipur Literature Festival had to be postponed due to political commitments. This is the reason I chose to attend the event in Kozhikode,"" he added.He also defended his stance on Operation Sindoor which went against the Congress party's positions.""I have at no stage violated any of the Congress’ positions in Parliament; the only issue on which there has been public disagreement on principle is about Operation Sindoor where I did take a very strong stand, and I remain unapologetic about that,"" he said speaking at the Kerala Literature Festival.The senior Congress leader gave a key party meeting a miss on Friday, skipping consultations with the state leadership and the AICC high command as the Kerala assembly elections approach. The absence drew sharp reactions from within the party, with leaders such as Sandeep Dixit questioning the Thiruvananthapuram MP’s relevance to the Congress.","Trivandrum mp imran masood took a swipe at tharoor, remarking that he was “not a big part” of congress.

Indian seafarers are most abandoned in the world again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-seafarers-are-most-abandoned-in-the-world-again/articleshow/127319128.cms,"Representative image: ANI

LONDON: Indian seafarers are the most abandoned in the world for the third year running.A total of 1,125 Indian seafarers were abandoned on ships in 2025 out of a total of 6,223 seafarers abandoned across 410 ships worldwide, making 2025 the worst year on record for seafarer abandonment.The number of Indian seafarers abandoned has gone up 25% compared to 2024, when 899 were abandoned. In 2023, it was 401. After Indians, the next highest cohort to be abandoned in 2025 were Filipinos (539).India is the third-biggest supplier of seafarers in the world, after the Philippines and China.Worldwide the total number of seafarers abandoned has increased by 32% and ship abandonments are up 31% compared to 2024, according to the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), headquartered in London.ITF data shows that seafarers were owed a total of $25.8 million in 2025 as a consequence of abandonment. From this, the ITF has recovered and returned $16.5 million to seafarers.The two countries where most ship abandonments took place were Türkiye and the UAE.Seafarer abandonment is defined as failing to cover the cost of a seafarer’s repatriation; leaving a seafarer without maintenance; or severing ties with a seafarer, including failing to pay wages for at least two months.“It’s nothing short of a disgrace that, yet again, we are seeing record numbers of seafarers abandoned by unscrupulous ship owners,” said David Heindel, chair of the ITF seafarers’ section.An Indian seafarer abandoned with three Indian crew on the “Eleen Armonia”, off the coast of Nigeria, since June, without pay, said: “I can’t sleep from stress, and if this continues I don’t know how it will affect my health. I joined this vessel quickly because the assignment meant I could spend Christmas and New Year with my new daughter and family. I have now missed these and an important family event. As seafarers, it feels really shameful that we’re treated this way. ”Last Sept India’s Directorate General of Shipping blacklisted 86 vessels linked to recurrent Indian seafarer abuse.Three hundred and thirty-seven ship abandonments in 2025 were on vessels sailing under flags of convenience — flags of a country other than the country of ownership. These flags are commonly used by shadow fleets (carrying sanctioned goods) to hide the identity of the real ship owner and are associated with poor safety standards and working conditions.","India is the third-biggest supplier of seafarers in the world, after the philippines and china.

NEW DELHI: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has expressed concern over Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in West Bengal, saying the exercise is ""being done in a hurry,"" further warning that it is ""unjust to voters"" and could jeopardise democratic participation with the state assembly elections just months away.Speaking to PTI from Boston on Saturday, the renowned economist said that while electoral roll revisions can strengthen democracy if done carefully, the current process in Bengal lacks adequate time and fairness.""A thorough review of electoral rolls done carefully with adequate time can be a good democratic procedure, but this is not what is happening in West Bengal at this time,"" Sen said.""The SIR is being done in a hurry, with inadequate time for people with voting rights to have sufficient opportunity to submit documents to vindicate their entitlement to vote in the coming assembly elections. This is both unjust to the electorate and unfair to Indian democracy,"" he added.Recalling his own experience during the revision process, Sen said the time pressure was evident even among Election Commission officials. ""Sometimes, the officials of the Election Commission themselves seem to lack enough time,"" he said.Sen said he was questioned about his right to vote from Santiniketan—his home constituency, despite having voted there earlier and having his details already recorded.""When they questioned my right to vote from my home constituency in Santiniketan - from where I have voted earlier, and where my name, address and other details are registered in official records - they questioned me about my deceased mother's age at my date of birth, even though, as a voter herself, my mother's details, like mine, were stored also in their own official records,"" he added.The economist also highlighted documentation challenges faced by many Indians, particularly those born in rural areas. ""Like many Indian citizens born in rural India (I was born in the then village of Santiniketan), I do not have a birth certificate, and my eligibility to vote required further paperwork to be presented on my behalf,"" Sen said.Although his case was eventually resolved, Sen expressed concern for others who may not have the same support.""Even though I could happily say (like the Beatles) — ‘Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends’ — I worried about others who do not have so many loyal friends. My friends helped me to get through the rigid gates of the formidable EC,"" he said.Sen was summoned for a hearing after a ""logical discrepancy"" was flagged regarding the age difference between him and his mother.Asked whether the SIR could benefit any political party, Sen said he could not make a definitive assessment.""I am not an election expert, so I cannot answer the question with certainty. I have been told by those who seem to know more, that the BJP will benefit from the under-accounting,"" he said, adding, ""I don’t know whether that is true, but the real point is that the EC should not insist on a faulty arrangement and force our proud democracy to commit an unnecessary error, no matter who benefits.""Sen warned that the poor and underprivileged are most at risk of exclusion.""An obvious answer must be the underprivileged and the poor. The documents needed for being allowed into the new electoral roll are often difficult to obtain for the underdogs of society,"" he said.""The class bias that may show up in the necessary requirement of getting and showing particular documents in order to qualify to enter the new voters' list will tend to work against the indigent,"" he added.He also flagged concerns about minority communities, saying, ""Indian Muslims are sometimes relegated to disadvantaged positions through the activism of the recently bolstered Hindutva extremists. Some categories of Hindus also may face discrimination and targeting.""Sen stressed that institutions must act to protect voting rights. ""The EC and the Supreme Court must make sure that no adult Indian citizen has difficulty to qualify for voting,"" he said.Expressing his desire to vote in the upcoming elections, Sen said it would depend on logistics.""I would very much like to do that. It depends, however, on the exact date on which my constituency’s voting is fixed,"" he said, recalling that on one earlier occasion he travelled across three countries within 48 hours just to cast his vote in Santiniketan.","Nobel laureate amartya sen has expressed concern over special intensive revision (sir) of electoral rolls in west bengal.

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant on Saturday described high courts as “primary sentinels” (guards) to ensure that the rule of law is not a “distant concept” for the common man.CJI Kant made the remark at a felicitation programme of the Bombay high court in Mumbai.“High courts are the primary sentinel guarding the doorsteps of the ordinary citizen, ensuring that the rule of law is not a distant concept but a localised, breathing reality,” PTI quoted the chief justice as saying.“HCs should not remain only revisional or appellate courts but should be vibrant and accessible centres to constitutional remedy. They are not mere stepping stones to the Supreme Court ,” the country’s top jurist added.CJI Kant further stressed that though the Supreme Court, as the highest court of the land, has the final word, a high court’s word is often the “most vital” one.""When the law is silent, the sentinel does not remain mute. We have seen HCs issue directions to protect the environment, ensure dignity of every human being, like prisoners, and securing the rights of migrant workers during a national crisis,"" he said.The CJI also stated that he is opposed to litigants approaching the top court directly, bypassing the HCs.“I am often loudly vocal against those who approach us without first availing the remedy to move the high court. People who are rich and privileged should not think that they have direct access to the Supreme Court merely because Article 32 of the Constitution allows it,"" he remarked.Article 32 of the Constitution empowers citizens to approach the Supreme Court directly for enforcement of their fundamental rights.",Chief justice of india (cji) surya kant described high courts as “primary sentinels’ (guards) to ensure that the rule of law is not a “distant concept” for the common man.

'Never Defied Cong In Parliament': 'Unapologetic' Shashi Tharoor Defends Modi Praise, Sindoor Stand

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday clarified that he has never violated the party line in Parliament, asserting that his only public disagreement in principle was over Operation Sindoor , when he led India’s delegation to countries in the Americas to present New Delhi’s position on counterterrorism and Pakistan’s role in terrorism.Responding to questions at the Kerala Literature Festival, Tharoor, as quoted by news agency PTI, said he had taken a strong stand on the issue and remained “unapologetic.”He said, ""I have at no stage violated any of the Congress’ positions in Parliament; the only issue on which there has been public disagreement on principle is about Operation Sindoor where I did take a very strong stand, and I remain unapologetic about that.""His remarks come amid recent reports highlighting “Tharoor’s differences with the party leadership,” with speculation that he is upset over Congress leader Rahul Gandhi not adequately acknowledging him at a recent event in Kochi, as well as over alleged repeated attempts by state leaders to sideline him.The senior Congress leader skipped a key party meeting with the state leadership and the AICC high command on Friday ahead of the Kerala assembly polls.This was followed by reactions from party colleagues, including Sandeep Dixit, who said the Thiruvananthapuram MP was no longer “relevant” to the party.Clarifying his absence from the Congress meeting amid speculation of a rift with the party, Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor said it was better to convey concerns directly to the party leadership rather than discuss them publicly.“Several things have appeared in the media—some of which may be true, others not—and such matters should not be discussed on public platforms,” he said, adding that he had informed the party in advance about his inability to attend the programme. “Whatever I have to say will be said within the party,” Tharoor added.Explaining his position and reports of partyline differences, Tharoor said that as an observer and writer, he had penned a newspaper column after the Pahalgam incident, arguing that the attack should not go unpunished and calling for a kinetic response.He said that while India remains focused on development, it should not be drawn into a prolonged conflict with Pakistan, and that any action should be limited to targeting terrorist camps.Tharoor added that he was surprised to see the government act in line with what he had suggested.Referring to Jawaharlal Nehru, Tharoor recalled the former prime minister’s famous question: “Who lives if India dies?”“When India is at stake—when its security and its place in the world are involved—India comes first,” he said.He added that while political parties may differ as part of the democratic process, national interest must always prevail over political differences.On the partyline differences, Tharoor also recalled the time when BJP came into power in 2014 and said, ""It was even reported that the RSS ideologue Govindacharya was writing the draft of a new constitution. And yet the Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the constitution was his holy book.""",Congress mp shashi tharoor on saturday clarified that he has never violated the party line in parliament.

I welcome the youth present today,"" he stressed.""Today, India is one of the youngest countries in the world. Our government is continuously working to ensure that more opportunities are made for India's youth power.

In the last few years, a lot of resources have been put into making world-class infrastructure. In this, a lot of jobs have increased in any sector connected to construction. India's startup ecosystem is also progressing forward at a great speed,"" the Prime Minister declared.Highlighting the growth of startups in India, PM Modi highlighted how more than 21 lakh youth are employed across the startup ecosystem, with Digital India propping up a new kind of economy.He said, ""Today there are around 2 lakh registered startups, in which more than 21 lakh youth are working.

'Republic Day 2026 Flypast Will Be IAF's Tribute To Operation Sindoor': Says Wing Commander Deshwal

New Delhi: From Bactrian camels to Zanskar ponies, a rare contingent of “animal soldiers” will for the first time be seen marching down Kartavya Path joining the 6,050 military personnel during the 90-minute Republic Day parade on Monday.They will be under the command of Captain Harshita Yadav, daughter of a retired IAF officer, and from the first batch of Indian Army’s Remount & Veterinary Corps.Speaking to TOI, she said, “This contingent is very uniquely curated. There are two Bactrian camels from Ladakh, four Zanskar ponies, four raptors (specially-trained birds of prey), 10 military dogs, mostly indigenously-bred. They are all Army soldiers and have different operational roles.”Perfectly adapted to extreme cold, thin air and altitudes above 15,000 feet, the Bactrian camels, which are recently inducted in Army operations, can carry a load of up to 250 kg and traverse long distances in the cold deserts.She said the Indian Army has been using indigenously-bred dogs for quite some time and they are trained basically for two purposes — detection (explosives, mine detection, tracking, search and avalanche rescue) and protection (assault on enemies).“Training of birds like kites or any animal involves neuroscience. Once you understand the science behind these animals and the training part, then these are highly trainable,” Captain Harshita said.IAF Air Commodore Manish Sabharwal, during a Republic Day press preview on Friday, said the S-400 air defence system, which shot down multiple Pakistan aircraft and also a spy plane from a distance of over 300 km deep inside Pakistan, which is a “documented kill”, will also be showcased at the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) tableau during the parade for the first time.The tableau will showcase India's victory in Operation Sindoor last year and the jointness of the three services displayed during the decisive action. One side will feature lethal military weapons that proved crucial during the operation. The other side will depict the destruction of the infrastructure on the side of Pakistan.Major General Navraj Dhillon, Chief of Staff, Delhi Area, said Lt Gen Bhavnish Kumar, GOC, Delhi Area, will head the parade for the fourth time.Battalion, Shaktibaan regiment, drone shakti and robotic mules to take part in the parade for the first time, along with Ladakh Scouts,” he said. He said the Army will feature the debut of a Battle Array Formation showcasing synchronised manoeuvres alongside tanks, missile systems, drones and armoured platforms. The defence assets that will be showcased during the parade will include BrahMos, Akash missile system, Medium Range Surface-To-Air Missile (MRSAM) system, Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS), Dhanush artillery gun, Shaktiban and a static display of some drones.The parade will also see the debut of the Shaktiban Regiment, which has been set up in the artillery. The newly-raised regiment will be equipped with a drone, counter-drone and loiter munition. Eighteen marching contingents and 13 bands will take part in the parade.Akash weapon system and MRSAM system are being fielded in this year's parade. Universal Rocket Launcher System URLS 'Suryastra', which can carry out surface-to-surface strikes up to 300 km, is being showcased for the first time in the parade, Maj Gen Dhillon said.As European Council president Antonio Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will be the chief guests, a small EU contingent, comprising an officer of the colonel rank, will lead the delegation. Following him in their contingent will be four flag-bearers.A senior military official said women’s participation is also in big numbers. CRPF’s Assistant Commandant Simran Bala will be the first woman officer to lead an all-male contingent at the parade.Captain Samira, a fourth-generation army officer, is the commander of an Army tableau depicting the success of Op Sindoor. She told TOI the tableau will display the indigenously developed military assets and weapon systems used during the Pakistan conflict and will also highlight Atmanirbhar Bharat.DRDO will showcase some of its path-breaking innovations for national security during the parade. Apart from displaying long-range anti-ship hypersonic missile (LR-AShM), DRDO will have a tableau 'naval technologies for combat submarines'.A formation flying named “Operation Sindoor” comprising Rafale, Su-30, Jaguar and MiG-29 combat jets will feature in the IAF's R-Day flypast that will serve as a powerful symbol of the dominance it established during the four-day hostilities with Pakistan last May. A total of 29 aircraft, including 16 fighters, nine helicopters and four transport planes, will be part of the flypast.A total of 30 tableaux to roll down Kartavya Path and 150 years of Vande Mataram will be the theme of the parade.","A rare contingent of ‘animal soldiers’ will for the first time be seen joining the 6,050 military personnel during the 90-minute republic day parade on monday.

'Netaji’s Strategic Realism Matters More Today As World Fragments', Says CDS Anil Chauhan At JNU

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said his govt was following Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's vision of a strong India as a weak nation could not achieve its goals. He added that the country now knew how to build, manage and use power.In a video address to a programme in Andaman and Nicobar Islands on Parakram Diwas, which commemorates Netaji's birth anniversary, Modi said due to the insecurities of those who came to office after independence - a swipe at Jawaharlal Nehru and his successors from Congress - the glorious history of the islands, which were briefly under the control of Bose's Indian National Army during the World War II, were not preserved as they wanted to credit only one family for independence.His govt has taken corrective measures, he added. Home minister Amit Shah lauded Netaji's ""unwavering determination to liberate India"" through his long and fraught journey across different countries and said every youth should read about his life to strengthen their resolve to protect the nation.""Netaji declared an independent India in 1943 by hoisting the tricolour in Andaman and Nicobar Islands,"" he said in a post. In his remarks, Modi said India was making its defence sector self-reliant in line with Bose's vision.India struck its enemies in their homes during Op Sindoor, he said in reference to the military strikes on terror sites in Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack, and destroyed them, he said, emphasising his govt's deft use of power to achieve its goals and the expansion of its defence production.""In their political self-interest, the nation's history was neglected,"" he said, noting that the islands continued to be knowns by the names of British officers before his govt made the correction. Port Blair was now 'Shri Vijaypuram', a name that reminded us of Netaji's victory, he said, recalling that 21 islands of Andamans were named after 21 Param Vir Chakra awardees in 2023.At a presser, BJP slammed Congress for trying to erase Bose's contribution from history in its long tenure in office and said he played the most decisive role in the country's independence. Nehru dismissed Bose's party Forward Bloc as a negative group against Congress and imbued with fascism and communalism, BJP's Sudhanshu Trivedi said, citing comments of B R Ambedkar and others to claim that Bose's campaign had ensured that the colonial rulers were not sure about the loyalty of Indian soldiers.","Pm narendra modi said his govt was following netaji subhas chandra bose's vision of a strong india.

'Bangladesh does not deserve a govt aligned with radicals',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-does-not-deserve-a-govt-aligned-with-radicals/articleshow/127331988.cms,"ANI file photo

Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says in an interview with Alpyu Singh that free and fair elections in her country are impossible under Muhammad Yunus’ interim govt and that India deserves a reliable neighbour. Excerpts:

Tarique Rahman

has assumed office as

Bangladesh Nationalist Party

chairman recently. How do you look at his return?

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss

A lot of people are questioning whether an election could actually take place in Feb? If so, how will

Awami League

take part, considering that there is a ban on your party?

As atrocities against minorities continue in Bangladesh, India's external affairs ministry reacted by saying there is a disturbing pattern in all this. What do you think is reason behind these recurring attacks?

How can India help in restoring peace in Bangladesh?

What do you think is the future of India-Bangladesh bilateral relations?

The people of Bangladesh should remember that Tarique Rahman has lived in exile in London for years, far removed from the daily realities faced by ordinary citizens. He fled the country because of his role in abetting his late mother, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, in the embezzlement of public funds. This is not a matter of political disagreement, but of accountability and integrity.BNP leadership has consistently aligned itself with extremist elements when it suits its short-term interests, even at the cost of national stability... it has chosen exclusion, intimidation, and opportunism. Bangladesh deserves leadership that governs from within the country, respects pluralism, and is accountable to the people, not figures who seek power through alliances with radical forces while remaining safely abroad.The question is not whether elections will take place but whether these will be elections in any meaningful or legitimate sense... At present, Bangladesh is ruled by an unelected regime that has appointed itself the authority to rewrite our country's constitution and amend our legislation to ban the nation's most widely supported party from participating in elections.Over half the voters in Bangladesh have confidence in Awami League and would vote for us if Awami League were allowed to participate.It is precisely this fear that has led them to ban us.A govt's most basic duty is to protect its citizens. The interim govt has not only failed in this responsibility, it has actively emboldened this repression. Under Yunus, extremist groups that my govt worked hard to contain have been empowered and elevated to positions of authority. These criminals, many of whom belong to known terrorist orgs, have been allowed to spread a hardline ideology that threatens to remove any trace of diversity from our country and carry out deplorable acts of violence against peaceful Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Ahmadi Muslims with total impunity. The current climate is the direct result of the appeasement of fundamentalist forces.India has rightly condemned the human rights abuses and political repression that have become all too common under the Yunus regime. They are watching in dismay right now as Bangladesh descends into lawlessness, as minority groups face daily acts of violence, as political imprisonments become the norm, and as harmful, hostile rhetoric emanates from Dhaka. India understands that prosperity of our two nations is tightly linked.n India is Bangladesh's closest friend and longest-standing ally, a relationship built through geography, history and cooperation. Yunus has done considerable damage to this relationship through his empowerment of extremist groups who freely target religious minorities with impunity and his willingness to allow mobs to besiege Indian diplomatic premises and threaten representatives. This is recklessness by an administration with neither the experience nor the mandate to dictate Bangladesh's foreign policy.India deserves a reliable partner in Bangladesh, one that can maintain stability and honour its commitments. We must return to being the friend our neighbours knew they could trust.","Ousted bangladesh pm sheikh hasina says free and fair elections in her country are impossible under muhammad yunus’ interim govt.
