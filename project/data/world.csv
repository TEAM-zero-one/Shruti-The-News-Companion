Prahaar: India unveils its first-ever counter-terrorism policy; proportionate reply to attacks part of 'Prahaar',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-unveils-its-first-ever-counter-terrorism-policy-proportionate-reply-to-attacks-part-of-prahaar/articleshow/128734192.cms,"Representative image

India’s First Counter-Terror Doctrine PRAHAAR: Playbook To Counter Hybrid Terror To Radicalisation

.

Prahaar aims at graded police response to radicalisation

Prahaar calls for global cooperation to tackle terror

NEW DELHI: Government on Monday unveiled the country's first-ever anti-terror policy elevating its ""pro-active and intelligence-guided"" approach to the level of a doctrine, which focuses, apart from the persisting threat of ""hostile neighbours"" deploying terror, on the new challenges of terrorists using modern communication devices and criminal networks.'Prahaar', an acronym for India's comprehensive counter-terrorism policy and strategy, aims at criminalising all terrorist acts and starving terrorists, their financiers and supporters of funding, weapons, safe havens and cyber resources.The policy rests on seven key pillars, represented by each letter of the acronym. It focuses on 'prevention' of terror attacks; 'responses' that are swift and proportionate; 'aggregating' of internal capacities for a whole-of-govt approach; 'human rights' and rule of law-based processes for mitigation of threats; 'attenuating' the conditions enabling terrorism, including radicalisation; 'aligning' international efforts to counter-terrorism; and 'recovery' through a whole-of-society approach.Stating that India has been at the forefront of the fight against terrorism, the policy refers to 'neighbours' which use terrorism as an instrument of the state, highlighting threats from jihadi outfits as well as global terrorist groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda.Describing the way forward, the policy hints at the scope for further collaboration among various agencies on intelligence collection and investigation.While seeking amendments in the counter-terror legal framework ""from time to time"", it underlines the continual need for building capacity of state-level counter-terror mechanisms and unity in their structure, resources, training and investigation methods.Stating that violent extremists based on foreign soil are using the latest technologies, including drones, to unleash terror in Punjab and J&K, the policy flags the use of organised criminal networks for logistics and recruitment, for executing terror strikes in India.Also, drawing attention to the use of social media and instant messaging apps for terror communication and propaganda, the policy concedes how encryption, dark web and crypto have allowed terror groups to operate with anonymity.With foreign-based terror groups relying on infrastructure, logistics and terrain knowledge of local outfits for trans-national terror attacks, Prahaar emphasises the need for international cooperation and collaboration, including to counter the misuse of information and communications technology (ICT) by terrorists, with investments in technology and partnerships with private enterprise.The counter-terror strategy aims at preventing attacks with a ‘pro-active and intelligence-guided’ approach with synergy among the central and state agencies. Similarly, it calls for pro-active disruption of cyber activities of terror groups and continuous disruption of overground worker networks by the law enforcement agencies (LEAs).For timely counter-terror response, the strategy requires all stakeholders at central, state and district level to have a uniform anti-terror structure and standard procedures. As regards “aggregating” capacities, LEAs and security agencies must be modernised with the latest tools, technology and weaponry. Prahaar also seeks to safeguard human rights with legal processes that allow multiple levels of redressal and appeal to terror accused.The policy aims at graded police response to radicalisation with legal action dependent on the level of radicalisation. At the same time, socio-economic conditions of vulnerable youths and groups must be addressed with education and constructive engagement, in addition to de-radicalisation programmes.The need to align and shape international efforts against terrorism with treaties and processes like extradition, deportation as per UN norms are also outlined.","India's first-ever anti-terror policy elevates its ""pro-active and intelligence-guided"" approach to the level of a doctrine.

"Kishtwar Encounter: Tyson: Four-legged Army hero who led anti-terror op in J&K despite taking a bullet; With Op Trashi-1, all 7 terrorists eliminated",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tyson-four-legged-army-hero-who-led-anti-terror-op-in-jk-despite-taking-a-bullet-with-op-trashi-1-all-7-terrorists-eliminated/articleshow/128733674.cms,"SRINAGAR/JAMMU/DELHI: Not all Army heroes wear uniforms. This is true for Tyson, a four-legged soldier, who showed extraordinary courage by charging first into a terrorist hideout and helping security forces eliminate three Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists in the Chhatroo belt of J&K’s Kishtwar despite being shot in its leg.“Tyson is a local dog adopted and trained by the Indian Army for counter-terror operations,” a source told TOIin Delhi. “The Army’s silent warrior crawled into the hideout carved into the rugged terrain of Chhatroo, prompting the terrorists to open fire,” sources from Kishtwar said over phone. Despite getting a bullet injury, Tyson continued the mission and was the first to reach near the ‘dhok’ and also enabled the security team to reach the hideout and neutralise terrorists. Later, the injured canine was airlifted for medical treatment,” officials said. The dog is now in Udhampur and “is doing fine”.‘Operation Trashi-1’ was a mega multi-agency counter-terror operation that “reflected months of planning and an integrated approach involving the Army’s Counter Insurgency Force (Delta), police force and CRPF”.In a joint press conference of police and Army in Jammu, IGP Jammu B S Tuti on Monday said it all started when a terror group called ‘Israel Group’, comprising seven hardcore terrorists, infiltrated into Indian territory in 2024.They were engaged 17 times over a period of nearly one-and-a-half years. He said three of them were killed in April 2025. “Yesterday was the culmination of this year-and-a-half-long operation,” Tuti said, referring to the killing of JeM commander Saifullah.“Yesterday’s operation is indicative that we have neutralised their leadership in Kishtwar. However, their foot soldiers remain active in other areas,” he said. Though he didn’t specify the number of terrorists, he said around 20 foreign terrorists are believed to be active in the Jammu region.Maj Gen APS Bal, General Officer Commanding, Counter Insurgency Force (Delta), said, “Op Trashi-1 is a “perfect example of perseverance, clarity of thought and seamless coordination at all levels, troops on the ground, corps commanders, ADGs, IGs, between DGP and Army Commander.” He said all available resources were deployed “in a joint and integrated manner, from a dog to a drone.”He said the operation began on Jan 14 in Kishtwar, with first contact established on Jan 18 when the terrorists’ hideout was busted. Further encounters followed on Jan 22, Jan 25 and Jan 31, and again on Feb 4 and Feb 8.During the operation, Maj Gen Bal said, soldiers faced harsh terrain and weather, including snowfall, rain and landslides. The forces were rotated regularly to prevent fatigue, with some teams inserted by helicopter and some through 6-8 hours of trekking.“Every day we sat at the drawing board, reoriented and realigned ourselves, redeployed and started working again,” he said. The senior officer said the first breakthrough came on Feb 4 with the killing of (commander’s aide) Adil. On Feb 21, an input shared by the SSP Kishtwar was passed on to the brigadier of 9 Sector and corroborated through multiple agencies. A joint operation was then launched on the rugged mountains. Reinforcements, including special forces, were quickly mobilised. The Army used real-time surveillance drones and night vision equipment to track and contain terrorist movement.“We achieved success without suffering any casualty or harm to our troops, except the injury to the brave dog Tyson,” Maj Gen Bal said. During the search of the area, till now, war-like stores, including three AK-47 rifles, have been recovered along with bodies of the slain terrorists.","Tyson is a local dog adopted and trained by the indian army for counter-terror operations.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of Canadian prime minister Mark Carney's visit to India, his government has started the process to revoke the citizenship of Tahawwur Rana, Pakistan-born businessman, currently being tried in India for helping plan the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that killed 166 people.However, the move to cancel his citizenship is not based on terrorism charges, but on alleged misrepresentation in his citizenship application.According to documents obtained by Global News, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has accused Rana of lying about his residence history. In his 2000 application, he claimed he had lived in Ottawa and Toronto for four years, with only a six-day absence from Canada. Rana moved to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2001.An investigation by the Canadian police later found that he had actually spent most of that period in Chicago, where he owned properties and businesses, including an immigration firm and a grocery store.In a letter dated May 31, 2024, IRCC told Rana that he had misrepresented his time in Canada and failed to declare his absences.The department described it as a “serious and deliberate deception” and said his actions showed a lack of respect for Canada’s citizenship laws.The case has now been referred to the Federal Court, which will decide whether his citizenship was obtained through false representation or fraud.","Tahawwur rana is currently being tried in india for helping plan the 2008 mumbai terror attacks that killed 166 people.

"Tensions rising between Iran and US: India explores ways to secure crude, LNG supplies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tensions-rising-between-iran-and-us-india-explores-ways-to-secure-crude-lng-supplies/articleshow/128732243.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: With tensions rising between Iran and the US and fears of war looming, India has started exploring ways to secure its energy supplies.Iran has signalled the temporary closure of sections of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow gateway linking the Gulf to the open seas, which witnesses nearly 20% of global crude movement. Any restriction on cargo movement through the Strait of Hormuz may impact India's supplies of crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman. India imports 90% of its crude requirement - nearly 5.5 million barrels per day (mbpd) - and more than 40% comes from West Asia through this narrow passage.If the Strait of Hormuz is closed, officials said, India may try to partially secure supplies through the 360-km Habshan-Fujairah strategic oil pipeline and the 1,200-km East-West crude oil pipeline that provides access to the Red Sea. While the former is operated by Adnoc and has the capacity to carry 1.5 mbpd, the latter is controlled by Aramco and has a capacity of 5 mbpd.Though India purchased nearly one-third of its crude requirement from Russia over last three years, recent trends show the share of oil from Moscow has started dipping. India's crude purchases from Saudi have witnessed a six-year high this month. Officials said New Delhi has already diversified crude imports in the last few years and its strategic oil reserves may last up to 74 days.Energy expert Narendra Taneja said, ""Our main worry is not the availability of crude, but that prices may go up globally."" Prashant Vasisht, senior VP and co-group head of corporate ratings agency ICRA, said, ""For every increase of $10 a barrel, India's annual import bill would rise by $13-14 billion."" Taneja, however, said the situation may not come to that pass and closure of the Strait of Hormuz would not be acceptable to the US and to the Gulf's oil exporting countries.",Iran has signalled the temporary closure of sections of the strait of hormuz.

Lok Sabha Sees Massive Ruckus As Rahul Gandhi Mentions Epstein Files, Adani Case; Slams PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Monday stepped up his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of presiding over what he described as a series of national “shames”, as he went on to talk about the US trade deal and Epstein files charges. This comes after PM Modi slammed Congress for the 'shirtless' protest at AI Summit terming it ""(dirty and shameless) politics”.""Modi ji, you talk of shame? Let me tell you what shame is. Your name, your minister’s, and your friend’s appearing together in the Epstein files, your name being linked to such a vile criminal—that’s what shame is,"" he said in a post on X, along with a video message.Accusing the PM of selling out the nation to the US via the trade deal, Rahul said, ""The trade deal you’ve struck with America, in which you’ve sold out the country—that’s what shame is.

Indian Embassy In Mexico Issues Advisory For Nationals After Killing Of Drug Lord 'El Mencho'

NEW DELHI: The Embassy of India on Monday issued an advisory asking Indian nationals in several parts of Mexico to remain indoors following a major security operation that killed a top cartel leader and sparked widespread violence.Mexican authorities said Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, was wounded in a clash with soldiers in Tapalpa and died while being flown to Mexico City.“Dear all Indian nationals in Mexico: There are ongoing security operations and related road blockages and criminal activity, Indian nationals in Jalisco State (areas of Puerto Vallarta, Chapala, and Guadalajara), Tamaulipas State (areas of Reynosa and other municipalities), areas of Michoacan State, Guerrero State, and Nuevo Leon State should shelter in place until further notice,” the Indian Embassy said.“For assistance please contact the Embassy of India at +52 55 4847 7539,” it added.Officials said six suspected cartel gunmen were killed in the operation, three soldiers were wounded and taken to hospital in the capital, and two suspects were arrested. Authorities also seized a cache of weapons, including rocket launchers capable of taking down aircraft and destroying armoured vehicles.The strike in western Jalisco was described by officials as one of the most significant blows to organised crime since the arrests of Joaquín Guzmán and Ismael Zambada García, co-founders of the Sinaloa cartel.Within hours of the announcement, cartel gunmen set vehicles ablaze, blocked highways and clashed with security forces, spreading retaliatory violence across at least five states and paralysing transport networks.Amid the unrest, the United States Department of State and Canadian authorities also urged their citizens in parts of Mexico to shelter in place due to violence, road blockages and flight cancellations.","Mexican authorities said nemesio rubén oseguera cervantes, leader of the jalisco new generation cartel, was wounded in a clash with soldiers.

Karnataka Governor Walks Out Mid Address, Assembly Erupts In Constitutional Showdown Inside House

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: A group of first-time Congress MLAs from Karnataka has written to senior party leaders — including Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge and former party chief Rahul Gandhi — seeking representation in the state Cabinet during the proposed reshuffle.In a joint representation addressed to the Congress high command and the state leadership — including chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy chief minister and state unit president DK Shivakumar — the legislators urged that at least five first-time MLAs be inducted as ministers.“We request you to ensure that at least five first-time MLAs are accommodated as ministers during the reshuffle,” the letter said.The legislators noted that 38 of the 135 Congress MLAs elected to the 224-member House in the 2023 assembly polls being first-time members was a “clear message” from the people, as they want to see “new young faces.”“As you are aware, the people have elected 38 Congress members to the assembly for the first time and thereby sent out a clear message that they want to see new young faces in the legislature,” the MLAs wrote.They further pointed out that when the 34-member ministry was constituted under Siddaramaiah, no debutant legislator was inducted into the Cabinet.“That being the case, it is justified that the first-timers are also accommodated.It is the need of the hour that young, dynamic, and proactive debutant MLAs are provided an opportunity to serve as ministers,” the letter stated.The signatories argued that appointing newcomers to ministerial positions would not be “unprecedented,” noting that in several states first-time MLAs had gone on to become chief ministers or ministers. A blend of youth and experience, they argued, would strike the “right balance” in governance and strengthen the party’s prospects in 2028.The letter comes amid an ongoing leadership tussle within the state Congress, with Shivakumar reiterating his claim to the top post, reportedly based on an understanding with the party high command after the 2023 victory. At the time, veteran leader Siddaramaiah was chosen to lead the government for his second term, while Shivakumar was made his deputy and reportedly assured the chief minister’s post for the latter half of the five-year tenure.The Karnataka Congress government completed its first two-and-a-half years in November 2025.",A group of first-time congress mlas from karnataka has written to senior party leaders.

NEW DELHI: The Union ministry of home affairs on Monday released India’s first comprehensive anti-terror policy, naming it “PRAHAAR”, and flagged threats ranging from cross-border terrorism and cyber-attacks to the misuse of drones and emerging technologies.The policy emphasizes that apart from terror sponsored from across the border, “criminal hackers and nation states continue to target India through cyber-attacks.”It notes that India faces terrorist threats across water, land and air, and states that capacities have been developed to secure critical sectors of the economy, including power, railways, aviation, ports, defence, space and atomic energy, against state and non-state actors.The strategy document, uploaded on the MHA’s website, states that “India does not link terrorism to any specific religion, ethnicity, nationality or civilisation.” It adds that the country has long been affected by “sponsored terrorism” from across the border, with “Jihadi terror outfits as well as their frontal organisations” continuing to plan and execute attacks.The policy names global terror groups such as Al-Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), stating that they have sought to incite violence in India through sleeper cells, while violent extremists operating from foreign countries have hatched conspiracies to promote terrorism.It further highlights the use of advanced technologies by handlers across the border, including drones, particularly in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. Terror groups are increasingly engaging organised criminal networks for logistics and recruitment, the policy says.On the digital front, the document points to the use of social media platforms, instant messaging applications, encryption tools, the dark web and crypto wallets for propaganda, funding and operational guidance, enabling anonymous activity.“Disrupting/Intercepting terrorist efforts to access and use CBRNED (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosive, Digital) material remains a challenge for Counter Terrorism (CT) agencies. The threat of state and non-state actors misusing drones and robotics for lethal purposes remains another area of concern,” the policy states.As part of its roadmap, the MHA has suggested associating legal experts at every stage of investigation, from the registration of FIRs to prosecution, to strengthen cases against perpetrators.The policy emphasises that national measures must be complemented by international and regional cooperation to address transnational terrorism. It also notes that foreign-based groups increasingly rely on local infrastructure, logistics and terrain knowledge to carry out attacks.On radicalisation, the MHA said terror groups continue attempts to recruit Indian youth. Once identified, such individuals undergo a graded police response, and “Legal action is initiated against the individual based on their level of radicalisation.”The policy also underlines the role of community and religious leaders, stating that moderate preachers and NGOs are engaged to spread awareness about the consequences of radicalisation and extremist violence.It also calls for constructive youth engagement and steps within prisons to prevent radicalisation of vulnerable inmates, alongside de-radicalisation programmes.The document positions PRAHAAR as a framework to address evolving security threats through coordinated legal, technological and community-based responses.",The union ministry of home affairs on monday released india’s first comprehensive anti-terror policy.
