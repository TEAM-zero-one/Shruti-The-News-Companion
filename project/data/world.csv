NEW DELHI: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi has claimed that Beijing mediated several global conflicts, including the standoff between India and Pakistan in May following the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir.Speaking at the Symposium on the International Situation and China’s Foreign Relations on Tuesday, Wang said Beijing had taken an “objective and just stance” to build peace and focused on addressing “both symptoms and root causes”.“This year, local wars and cross-border conflicts flared up more often than at any time since the end of WWII. Geopolitical turbulence continued to spread,” Wang said at the symposium in Beijing.“To build peace that lasts, we have taken an objective and just stance, and focused on addressing both symptoms and root causes. Following this Chinese approach to settling hotspot issues, we mediated in northern Myanmar, the Iranian nuclear issue, the tensions between Pakistan and India, the issues between Palestine and Israel, and the recent conflict between Cambodia and Thailand,” he said.The statement comes despite Beijing’s role during the May 7–10 Operation Sindoor conflict between India and Pakistan coming under serious scrutiny and criticism, particularly over alleged military assistance provided by China to Islamabad.After the conflict flared up, Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt General Rahul R Singh had said Beijing used the confrontation as a “live lab”, while declining to directly elaborate on the charge.Gen Singh said China’s strategy during Operation Sindoor was based on its ancient military doctrine of the “36 stratagems”, accusing Beijing of seeking to hurt India by “killing with a borrowed knife” — a reference to alleged Chinese support to Pakistan.Meanwhile, the Indian Army on Tuesday hailed Operation Sindoor, underlining ten major milestones achieved by the force in 2025.“Nine terrorist camps across the border were destroyed. The Indian Army neutralised seven camps, while the remaining two were destroyed by the Indian Air Force. Pakistan attempted to target military and civilian assets using drones, but Indian Army air defence units successfully neutralised all threats, preventing damage and casualties. More than a dozen terror launch pads along the Line of Control were destroyed using Indian Army ground-based weapons,” the Army said.“The director general of military operations of the Indian Army was approached by his Pakistani counterpart with a request for a ceasefire. An understanding was reached to stop firing and military action,” it added.India and Pakistan were locked in a brief but intense military confrontation in May, triggered by a terror attack in the Pahalgam valley of Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, which claimed 26 innocent lives.India responded with Operation Sindoor, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.India has consistently dismissed claims of any third-party mediation, maintaining that the four-day confrontation was resolved through direct military-to-military communication.New Delhi has maintained that after sustaining heavy damage, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) called his Indian counterpart, and both sides agreed to stop all firing and military action on land, air and sea with effect from May 10.",Chinese foreign minister wang yi claims beijing mediated several global conflicts.

NEW DELHI: The outgoing year (2025) will be remembered for India's focus on reforms as a continuous national mission, PM Narendra Modi said on Tuesday, asserting that his govt prioritised collaboration over control and facilitation over regulation in the true spirit of a modern democracy.""What makes the reforms of 2025 significant is not only their dimension but also their underlying philosophy. We modernised institutions, simplified governance, and strengthened the foundations for long-term inclusive growth,"" he said, citing a host of measures.Asking investors to keep trusting India and investing in its people, he said in a post on LinkedIn, that the country's youthful demography is the prime engine of ""Reform Express"", a term he first used earlier this month during Parliament's winter session to underscore his govt's commitment to fast-paced reforms across sectors.These reforms, which included opening up of nuclear sector to private players, higher education, 100% FDI in insurance sector, and introduction of four labour codes to cover a complex web of 29 laws, were designed with empathy, recognising the realities of small businesses, young professionals, farmers, workers and the middle class.""They were shaped by consultation, guided by data and anchored in India's constitutional values.They add momentum to our decade-long efforts to move away from a control-based economy to one that operates within a framework of trust, keeping the citizen at its core. These reforms are aimed towards building a prosperous and self-reliant India,"" he said. He emphasised that his govt will continue pursuing the reform agenda in the coming years.Amid opposition's determined protest against his govt's decision to bring G RAM G Act in replace UPA-era MGNREGA, he said provisions of the new law raise employment guarantee from 100 to 125 days, resulting in increased spending towards strengthening village infrastructure and livelihoods.In Parliament's monsoon session, he said five landmark maritime legislations were passed to simplify documentation, make dispute resolution easier and reduce logistics costs, replacing outdated Acts.Modi said GST slab rationalisation will ensure dispute reduction and better compliance and has boosted consumer sentiment and demand, while tax break for individuals earning upto Rs 12 lakh is an ""unparalleled relief for the middle class"". These reforms mark India's move towards a transparent, technology-driven tax administration, he said.Modi said that trade deals with New Zealand, Oman and Britain will add to investments, job creation and encourage local entrepreneurs.He said a bill introduced in Parliament will lead to establishment of a single, unified higher education regulator in 'Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan' to replace overlapping bodies (UGC, AICTE and NCTE, etc). ""Institutional autonomy will be strengthened, with innovation and research boosted,"" he said.In a boost to small and medium businesses, the definition of ""small companies"" has been expanded to include firms with turnovers up to Rs 100 crore, reducing compliance burdens and associated costs for thousands of firms. Another bill will enhance governance norms in Sebi and investor protection.","Pm narendra modi: outgoing year 2025 will be remembered for india's focus on reforms.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Compared with the uae and saudi arabia, bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry. Golden residency visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Bahrain’s golden residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126234204,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-648989,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

From First Woman PM To Fierce Rivalry: Khaleda Zia’s Three Terms That Redefined Bangladesh Politics

Leaders worldwide offers condolences after the death of former PM





Former Bangladesh prime minister and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Khaleda Zia died early Tuesday at the age of 80, party officials confirmed. She had been undergoing treatment at Evercare Hospital in Dhaka. According to her party, Zia died around 6.00 am, shortly after Fajr prayers, after remaining in critical condition for months.A dominant figure in Bangladesh’s politics for decades, Khaleda Zia was the country’s first woman prime minister and the long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina. She had been suffering from multiple serious health complications, including heart, lung, liver and kidney ailments, diabetes and pneumonia. Zia had been under intensive medical care since November.Her death comes just days after her elder son and BNP’s acting chairperson Tarique Rahman returned to Bangladesh from London, ending 17 years of self-imposed exile as the country moves toward crucial national elections.Khaleda Zia was born in 1945 in Jalpaiguri and grew up in Dinajpur. She married Ziaur Rahman in 1960, who later became Bangladesh’s president after seizing power as a military chief in 1977.Following his assassination in a military coup in 1981, Khaleda, who had never been involved in politics, entered public life and took charge of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1984.She emerged as a key leader in the mass movement against military ruler HM Ershad, earning a reputation as an uncompromising figure in the struggle to restore democracy. In 1991, she led the BNP to victory and became Bangladesh’s first elected woman prime minister, introducing the parliamentary system of government and later playing a role in establishing the caretaker government system for elections.Khaleda Zia served as prime minister two times from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2006. Her political career was defined by a fierce rivalry with Sheikh Hasina, a contestant who shaped Bangladesh’s politics for more than three decades.In later years, Zia faced multiple corruption cases, which her party described as politically motivated. She was jailed in 2018 and remained largely confined due to illness after being granted temporary release in 2020. In January 2025, the Supreme Court acquitted her in the final corruption case against her, effectively clearing her name.Following Hasina’s ouster in a mass uprising in 2024, an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus allowed Zia to travel abroad for advanced treatment. She returned from London in May but remained seriously ill and withdrew from active politics, though she continued as BNP chairperson until her death.Khaleda Zia is survived by her elder son Tarique Rahman, while her younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko died in 2015. Despite years of illness and imprisonment, she remains one of the most influential and polarising figures in Bangladesh’s political history.Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his 'sincere condolences' after the death of Khaleda Zia and recalled his meeting with former PM in Dhaka in 2015.In a post on X, he wrote: ""Deeply saddened to learn about the passing away of former Prime Minister and BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia in Dhaka. Our sincerest condolences to her family and all the people of Bangladesh. May the Almighty grant her family the fortitude to bear this tragic loss. """"As the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh, her important contributions towards the development of Bangladesh, as well as India-Bangladesh relations, will always be remembered. I recall my warm meeting with her in Dhaka in 2015. We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership. May her soul rest in peace,"" PM Modi further wrote.Muhammad Yunus also expressed his profound grief over the death of former BNP chief and described her as a ""great guardian"" of the nation and a towering figure in Bangladesh's democratic history.""Begum Khaleda Zia was not merely the leader of a political party; she represented an important chapter in the history of Bangladesh,"" Yunus wrote in his message. The BNP has declared seven days of official mourning following her death.","Former bangladesh pm khaleda zia has died at the age of 80. Zia was the country's first woman prime minister and long-time political rival of sheikh hasina.

Security Forces Launch Cordon-And-Search Operations In Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch

JAMMU: Security forces Tuesday launched cordon-and-search operations in the upper reaches of Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch districts in J&K after reported sightings of terror suspects.

The train made an unscheduled halt around 5 pm after someone pulled the emergency chain, prompting frightened passengers to jump onto the tracks.

Unaware of an oncoming train on the adjacent line, several were struck by the Karnataka Express approaching from the opposite direction.

The incident occurred between Maheji and Pardhade stations near Pachora, more than 400 km from Mumbai, turning panic and confusion into a deadly accident.

In the early hours of January 29, at around 1 am, a crush broke out near the Sangam nose area, close to a main bathing ghat. As devotees moved through narrow and crowded paths ahead of the Amrit Snan, panic spread, and a stampede followed.

Ambulances rushed the injured to the central hospital inside the Mela grounds, where nearly 30 people died, and several others were injured.

February 15: New Delhi railway station stampede

On the night of February 15, a massive rush of passengers waited to board trains to Prayagraj, where the Maha Kumbh was underway.

As several trains were delayed, the already overcrowded platforms 14 and 15 turned chaotic within a few minutes, as people rushed forward, resulting in multiple casualties.

The government later told the Lok Sabha that 49,000 general or unreserved tickets were sold at the New Delhi Railway Station counter at around 13,000 more than the usual daily figure.

March 28: Myanmar - Thailand earthquake

Myanmar’s military government said at least 1,002 people were killed and over 2,300 were injured. Meanwhile, in Thailand, a high-rise building under construction collapsed, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing.

Centred near Mandalay, the quake was followed by a strong aftershock and damaged roads, a bridge and a dam, hampering rescue efforts in Myanmar, which is already grappling with civil war and a humanitarian crisis.

Tremors were felt in China’s Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, where houses were damaged, and people were injured near the Myanmar border.

April 1: Gujarat firecracker factory explosion

Most of those killed were migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh who had arrived only two days earlier and were staying with their families inside the premises.

Survivors and local sources said children as young as six were made to work with explosives for very low wages. They were assigned risky tasks such as tying fuses, packing gunpowder and assembling fireworks, often because their small hands were considered suitable for the work.

Many of those killed in Deesa had survived a similar firecracker factory explosion in Harda, Madhya Pradesh, in February 2024, highlighting how the same workers were exposed to deadly risks more than once.

April 22: Pahalgam terror attack

Around 3 PM, terrorists descended from the mountains of Baisaran Valley and opened fire on tourists in the area, known as 'mini Switzerland' for its scenic meadows. Panicked women were seen weeping and searching for their loved ones amid pools of blood as cries for help echoed across the valley.

The attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of the banned Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Following the attack, the government suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, shut the Attari-Wagah border and halted visas.

India launched Operation Sindoor on May 6–7 in retaliation, targeting terror hideouts in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Indian officials later said over 100 terrorists were killed during the operation.

The police had deployed a large contingent, but managing the crowd proved extremely difficult. The stadium had a capacity of holding 35,000 people, yet around 2 to 3 lakh fans showed up, far exceeding expectations.

Thousands of fans thronged the stadium and surrounding areas, overwhelming security personnel. Many attempted to climb gates, trees, and fences to get a view of the players.

At Vidhana Soudha , Karnataka police used mild cane charges to disperse surging fans during the felicitation program. Panic spread quickly as crowds surged, with people scrambling to climb fences and trees in desperation.

July 9: Texas Hill country flash flood

The disaster resulted in over 135 confirmed fatalities and estimated economic losses of approximately $1 billion.

Remnants of a tropical storm system stalled over the region, dumping record rainfall in short durations that overwhelmed the Colorado River basin.

The disaster exposed severe vulnerabilities in local drainage infrastructure, prompting a state-wide ""Flood Zone Reassessment"" by the Texas government.

August-September: Monsoon battered the subcontinent

Uttarakhand was hit by flash floods beginning August 5, a disaster that left over 70 people dead or missing, including 11 Indian Army soldiers. Cloudbursts in the Himalayas triggered massive landslides in Kishtwar and Chamoli.

In Punjab and Haryana, the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers overflowed, submerging hundreds of acres of paddy fields just before harvest. From mid to late August, Punjab grappled with the ""Great Punjab Flood"", the worst flood crisis since 1988. Over 1,400 villages were inundated, and the death toll in Punjab alone stood at 57, with over 3.5 million residents affected and 4.8 lakh acres of crops destroyed. The effect was seen in Pakistan too, where over 2 million people were displaced.

In late August, 138 people were killed in the Jammu division due to torrential downpours. Udhampur recorded a historic 629.4 mm of rain in 24 hours on August 27, shattering a record.

September 27: Karur stampede

During a rally for actor-turned-politician Vijay's party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), at Velusamypuram, a crowd crush occurred around 7.45 pm as supporters surged forward to catch a glimpse of the leader’s convoy. The tragedy claimed 39 lives, including at least nine children and 18 women. Additionally, over 100 people sustained crush injuries ranging from suffocation to fractures.

(TVK), at Velusamypuram, a crowd crush occurred around 7.45 pm as supporters surged forward to catch a glimpse of the leader’s convoy. The tragedy claimed 39 lives, including at least nine children and 18 women. Additionally, over 100 people sustained crush injuries ranging from suffocation to fractures. The venue, which anticipated 15,000–30,000 attendees, saw a massive influx of over 50,000 people. The chaos was exacerbated by the leader's 7-hour delay, a failure of the sound system/microphones, and inadequate barricading along the Karur-Erode highway.

Rescue operations were severely hampered as the massive convoy of vehicles and the dense crowd blocked the entry of ambulances. Reports indicated that several attendees had already begun fainting from dehydration and heat exhaustion hours before the crush began.

October 21-October 31: Hurricane Melissa (Category 5)

The storm made a catastrophic landfall in Jamaica at New Hope on October 28, making it the most devastating landfall in history. with wind speeds exceeding 250 km/h, effectively shutting down the island's power grid for weeks. The slow-moving storm caused at least 45 deaths there and more than $130M in infrastructure damage, while over 90,000 people were displaced.

After devastating Jamaica, the storm battered Cuba and the Bahamas, and even though Melissa weakened before reaching here, Haiti suffered severely with 23 confirmed deaths and thousands displaced due to mudslides. The southern islands faced ""salt spray burn,"" where hurricane-force winds coated agricultural land in salt, destroying 80% of the local crop yield for the 2026 harvest season.

Insured losses were estimated at nearly $8 billion. The Caribbean tourism industry faced a complete seasonal shutdown, with cancellations extending well into 2026.

November 3: Northern Afghanistan earthquake

A magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck near the border of Samangan and Balkh provinces at a depth of 28km, catching residents asleep in the early hours.

Reports confirmed over 20 fatalities and 300+ injuries, with the number rising as rescuers reached remote mountain villages cut off by landslides.

Significant damage was reported to historical infrastructure in Mazar-i-Sharif, including structural cracks in the outer walls of the Blue Mosque complex.

November 10: Red Fort car bomb blast

At 6:52 pm, a high-intensity vehicle-borne IED exploded in a white i20 car near Gate No. 1 of the Lal Qila Metro Station, just outside the historic Red Fort complex.

The powerful blast killed 15 people, mostly tourists and security personnel, injured dozens more, shattered windowpanes of buildings up to 500 metres away, and burned nearly a dozen nearby vehicles, including e-rickshaws and autos.

Intelligence agencies linked the attack to a ""doctor's module"" terror cell and utilised high-grade explosives, indicating sophisticated logistical support. Afterwards, the National Capital Region (NCR) was placed under a high-security grid. New checkpoints and facial recognition surveillance were permanently installed around all UNESCO heritage sites in Delhi.

November 26-December 2: Cyclone Ditwah

The storm stalled over the island nation of Sri Lanka, causing 410+ deaths and displacing nearly 230,000 people. The economic damage was estimated at $4.1 billion (approx. 4% of GDP).

In India, Chennai's IT corridor faced severe inundation, disrupting operations for global tech firms for 4 days. Reservoirs in coastal Andhra Pradesh breached, flooding the delta farmlands.

The receding waters triggered outbreaks of waterborne diseases in both countries, overwhelming local healthcare systems already strained by the monsoon.

December 14: Bondi Beach mass shooting

Two gunmen, a father and son, opened fire at the crowded beachfront event, resulting in 16 deaths, including one perpetrator, and creating mass panic among holidaymakers.

Authorities classified it as an ISIS-linked terror attack. Police recovered pipe bombs, other explosives and an ISIS flag from the truck belonging to the attackers at the scene that, fortunately, failed to fully detonate.

Australia declared a National Day of Reflection. The incident led to an immediate bipartisan review of hate-group designations and stricter monitoring of online radicalisation hubs.

December 2-December 15: Indigo airline operational collapse

December 3 marked the ""initial meltdown"" phase, where the airline was forced to cancel roughly 200 flights in a single day, signalling the start of a week-long systemic failure. 2 days later, the cancellation number rose to over 1000 flights.

IndiGo's size, high night-flight dependence, and razor-thin utilisation margins made recovery slower than expected. When one pilot timed out, it triggered a 'domino effect.' As IndiGo was packed with passengers but no pilots, fares for other aviation giants also went up.

Major airports saw queues of passengers lined up, as some waited for over 12 hours. The crisis struck many major cities, including Bengaluru, Delhi, Kolkata, and Hyderabad. However, operations normalised later following the government's introduction of a price cap and DGCA’s probe.

December 6: Goa nightclub fire

The fire broke out at approximately 11:45 PM on a Saturday night during a crowded dance party. While initially thought to be a gas cylinder explosion, investigators later confirmed the fire was triggered by the improper use of indoor electrical firecrackers and spread within seconds due to dried palm leaves.

The tragedy was particularly lethal because the building lacked emergency exits, and the main entrance was a narrow lane that prevented fire trucks from getting closer than 400 meters. 23 of the 25 victims died of smoke inhalation/suffocation rather than burns.

The Magisterial Inquiry revealed the club's trade license had expired in March 2024. Meanwhile, the owners, Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, flew to Phuket, Thailand, but were arrested after an Interpol Blue Corner Notice.

Murphy’s law worked hard in 2025.A year full of “what else can go wrong”, and then the wrong proceeds to make its way in, perfectly settling down, even stretching through months.

Occurring on December 6, at the peak of the 2025 tourist season, the incident exposed a massive web of illegalities and administrative failures.2025 tested the resilience, the limits across borders and institutions. It also forced uncomfortable reckonings. Each tragedy sparked questions that could no longer be postponed about preparedness, accountability, infrastructure, governance and collective responsibility. In many cases, they also triggered change: tighter safety norms, renewed probes, policy corrections, and communities stepping up for one another in moments of collapse.Each tragedy, each crisis has only strengthened the bounce-backs.

'Deeply Concerned': PM Modi Reacts To Reports Of Attack On Putin’s House, Ukraine Responds

Russia claims Putin targetted in attack

Third day of powercuts for Ukrainians after Russian attack

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday expressed concern over reports that the residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin had been targeted and called for restraint and a renewed focus on diplomacy.In a post on X, PM Modi said he was 'deeply concerned' by the reports and stressed that diplomatic engagement remained the best way forward. ""Deeply concerned by reports of the targeting of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation. Ongoing diplomatic efforts offer the most viable path toward ending hostilities and achieving peace. We urge all concerned to remain focused on these efforts and to avoid any actions that could undermine them,"" he said.Russia earlier claimed that Ukraine had launched a drone attack on President Putin’s state residence located between Moscow and St Petersburg. According to Reuters, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov alleged that 91 long-range drones were fired at the residence in the Novgorod region on December 28–29, all of which were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defences.Lavrov described the incident as a “terrorist attack” and said Moscow would revise its negotiating position on ending the Ukraine war.He added that Russia had already selected targets in Ukraine for what he called “retaliation strikes.”Ukraine rejected the accusation. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Russia’s claims as “lies,” alleging that Moscow was using the narrative to justify further attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv. “This alleged ‘residence strike’ story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, as well as Russia’s refusal to take necessary steps to end the war,” Zelenskyy said.He added that Ukraine does not take actions that undermine diplomacy, accusing Russia of doing the opposite, and urged the international community not to remain silent as efforts continue toward achieving a lasting peace.For three days following the latest Russian air attacks on Ukraine, residents have been without electricity or heating in Vyshhorod, a satellite town about 20 km north of Kyiv.As night-time temperatures fall to around minus 3 degrees Celsius, they spend much of the day in a small shelter equipped with heat and electricity, where they can also power their gadgets and devices.Around 20 people gather in the modest building—described on a sign outside as an “islet of warmth and power”—charging mobile phones and laptops to stay connected and continue working.",Pm narendra modi expresses concern over reports that the residence of russian president vladimir putin had been targeted.

Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

SRINAGAR: In a move to curb the spread of anti-national propaganda, a designated NIA court in Srinagar on Tuesday issued a proclamation against three Kashmiris, in an FIR registered by the Counter Intelligence Kashmir (CIK). Investigators have established their alleged role in propagating content deemed prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India. The court directed them to appear before it by Jan 31, 2026.The proclamation was issued against Mubeen Ahmad Shah, Azizul Hassan Ashai alias Tony Ashai, both residents of Srinagar, and Rifat Wani of Kupwara. All three have been living outside India for a long period.Mubeen Shah, former president of Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is a prominent Kashmir-born businessman who was detained a day before the abrogation of Article 370. He was released from Agra jail in Dec 2019. He subsequently left the country.The CIK, in a statement, described the court ruling as a major crackdown on anti-national propaganda and secessionist misinformation. “These elements were masquerading as news portals, journalists and freelancers, while in reality weaponizing social media platforms such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and WhatsApp to create, upload and circulate fake, motivated, exaggerated, secessionist and out-of-context content,” the CIK statement said.The deliberate objective of this digital misinformation campaign was to incite street violence, disrupt normal life, damage public property, disturb public order and fuel mass unrest, thereby promoting anti-national sentiments and advancing a secessionist agenda aimed at creating disaffection against the Union of India, the statement added.Despite being declared absconders, the accused are notorious for their continued hostile activities and remain highly active on social media platforms, where they persist in peddling false, fabricated and provocative content with the intention of inciting large-scale violence and destabilizing public order in the union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir, it added.","A designated nia court in srinagar on tuesday issued a proclamation against three kashmiris.

"Salt Lines: A forgotten 4,000-km 'living border' reappears in a Mumbai museum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/salt-lines-a-forgotten-4000-km-living-border-reappears-in-a-mumbai-museum/articleshow/126206594.cms,".

In the open-air plaza of Mumbai's oldest museum, a long, zig-zag wall of cloth ripples in the breeze. At first glance, it looks like a giant curtain. Step closer to squint at the crimson prints on it and the cloth becomes a partition: neat plant patterns on one side and chaotic termite marks on the other.Block-printed deliberately with dyes from homegrown shrubs like babool and karonda, this 20-metre-long cotton wall at the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum quietly leads visitors back to a little-known 4,000-km hedge that once formed a thorny botanical border across India, buzzing with birds and bees.Part hedge, part fence, the Inland Customs Line — a forgotten boundary created by the British in the 19th century to enforce the Empire’s deadly salt tax— is the centrepiece of 'Salt Lines', the first Indian solo exhibition by artist duo Himali Singh Soin and David Soin Tappeser who go by Hylozoic/Desires.Supported by RMZ Foundation and IAF with curatorial Advisor Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, the show revisits the colonial 4000 km border of which 2500 constituted a fence of plants known as the Great Hedge of India.Stretching from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal and patrolled by thousands of customs staff, the hedge--described as ""utterly impassable to man or beast""--was built by the East India Company and later the British Raj to enforce the salt tax in the mid nineteenth century.“We first stumbled upon the incredible history of the Inland Customs Line when we were doing more general research on… salt,” the artists say. Its scale shocked them: “It seemed improbable to us that such a large botanical infrastructure could have existed for much of the 19th century without everyone knowing about it.”Salt, which had been lightly taxed under earlier Indian rulers and the Mughals, became one of the British Empire’s most lucrative revenue streams after Bengal Presidency governor Robert Clive’s victory at The Battle of Plassey in 1757.Through monopolies and price controls, the East India Company's officials forced peasants and merchants to buy salt from government depots at inflated rates. Even during the catastrophic Bengal famine of 1770, which killed an estimated ten million people, land revenue and salt taxes were collected in full.Originally consisting of thorny branches and deadwood piled into a crude fence, it was designed to stop smugglers from moving coastal salt into British-controlled territories, where it was heavily taxed. From the 1860s, the British began converting it into a living hedge, planting hardy native shrubs, digging trenches, building embankments, and maintaining a patrol road. Under officials such as AO Hume, entire teams tended the hedge, watering, pruning, and replanting it.Between 1867 and 1870, Hume oversaw a dramatic expansion of the hedge. By 1869 it stretched more than 2,300 miles from the Indus to the Mahanadi, patrolled by nearly 12,000 men. The line snaked through what is now Pakistan, skirted Delhi, passed Agra, Jhansi, Hoshangabad, Khandwa, Chandrapur and Raipur, and terminated in present-day Odisha. Where living shrubs failed due to rocky soil or frost, stone walls were erected instead; elsewhere, dry hedges of dwarf Indian plum had to be rebuilt constantly after damage from insects, fire and storms.At its height, the hedge was said to be up to 12 feet high and 14 feet thick, made of tightly trimmed trees and shrubs of babool, Indian plum, carounda, prickly pear, and thuer, depending on the soil and climate, with a thorny creeper woven throughout. By the 1870s, more than 14,000 men were employed to guard and maintain it, making it one of the largest security operations in the subcontinent.“On no branch of their duties have the whole establishment bestowed anything like so much time, labour, care, and thought, as on the rearing of this barrier...after all it must be remembered that our barrier is to the Line what the Great Wall once was to China: alike its greatest work and its chiefest safeguard,"" wrote Hume.The hedge was lost in the archives, say the artists who scoured the National Archives of India, the British Library, the South London Botanical Institute, the Alkazi Collections and more for its history. “We found textual evidence… but no imagery.”To fill the gap, they created speculative visual records such as re-enactments at Sambhar Lake, an important British salt outpost, and AI-generated images, printed using a 19th-century salt process and toned with gold.At the centre of 'Salt Lines' is 'The Hedge of Halomancy' (2025), a 23-minute film. It follows Mayalee, a courtesan known to history for resisting the British. “She refuses the British administrators… when they attempt to replace her traditional salt stipend with cash payments,” the artists explain.Salt, in the film, becomes material and metaphor. A three-dimensional salt crystal acts as “a magical talisman,” linking Mayalee to Hume and, symbolically, to Gandhi’s march to Dandi. In another room called the 'Salt Office', historical salt-tax objects including two photographs of Bombay’s salt satyagraha from the Alkazi Collection sit beside Salt Prints (2024). “Salt is an acid and a base, an amazing symbol of equilibrium,” the artists say.Sound underscores this tension. “The speculative chapters… are underpinned by bansuri and sitar,” says David. The archival sections use “tuba and percussion,” echoing British military bands and their transformation into Indian wedding music.How did the hedge disappear from public imagination? Nature played the first role. “Termites… begin to eat into the hedge,” the artists note. “Winds, rats, tigers stormed through parts of the hedge.” Human anger, it seems, finished the job. “During the 1857 mutiny, people burnt parts of the hedge down in fury.”When the British gained control over salt-producing regions like Sambhar Lake, they found a cheaper way to tax salt at its source. The hedge — expensive and unwieldy — was dismantled on April 1, 1879.Nature reclaimed it. The living shrubs died or were cut; deadwood was carted off by villagers; embankments eroded. Within decades, almost nothing remained. ""The natural world’s resistance not only contributed to the fall of the hedge but also to its utter erasure from history,"" say the artists.Many historians had never heard of it until British writer Roy Moxham rediscovered it in the 1990s, travelling across India to piece together its remnants for his book 'The Great Hedge of India'. “People seldom realise how critical salt is to health,” wrote Moxham. “And yet, it seems inconceivable to me how this incredibly painful part of history, the immense abuse people endured at this time, could be so utterly forgotten. ”When he set out to find the remnants of the Customs Hedge, Moxham had imagined the barrier as a piece of British whimsy constructed to collect a minor tax. Along the way, he realized that the men posted along it, mostly local recruits, worked in isolation for months, patrolling harsh terrain with sticks, whips, and firearms. Those caught bypassing the hedge faced imprisonment. Famine, he discovered, was worsened by the Salt Tax. In 1877–'78, crops failed from poor rains in the North-Western Provinces while grain was exported, causing starvation. Official reports recorded 1.3 million deaths, with most deaths attributed to disease rather than hunger, though salt deficiency increased mortality.""I had assumed it was merely a flamboyant boundary, perhaps fashioned by administrators with fond memories of English hedgerows,"" wrote Moxham. ""It was a terrible discovery to find that it had been constructed, and ruthlessly policed, so as to totally cut off an affordable supply of an absolute necessity of life,"" he concluded.It is fitting that the exhibition sits inside the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai’s oldest, built by the British in 1857 as the Victoria & Albert Museum, Bombay. For the artists, its vitrines and industrial models echo the themes of extraction in the exhibition while Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, the museum’s managing trustee and director, says 'Salt Lines' allows the institution to “engage with the nature of colonial artistic production… including local people who harvested and consumed salt. ”As visitors leave 'Salt Lines', Hylozoic/Desires offer a last thought — a reminder of what the exhibition ultimately attempts: “All we know is that the artist’s work is to research rigorously, and then… enter into the missing gaps of history and the doubt of the future, and imagine how else we can be.”",'salt lines' is the first indian solo exhibition by artist duo himali singh soin and david soin tappeser who go by hylozoic/desires. The show revisits the colonial 4000 km border of which 2500 constituted a fence of plants known as the great hedge of india.

""Zia was sent to Jogmaya Primary School in Nayabasti, where she studied up to Class III, and was then admitted to Sunitibala Sadar Girls' School in Samaj Para,"" he said. ""By then most of their relatives moved to East Pakistan, and Zia's father migrated there,"" Sharma added.Sharma said the family's departure followed a formal exchange of property.""Iskandar went for a property exchange with one Amarendranath Chakraborty and moved to East Pakistan. Chakraborty's family still lives in the house at Nayabasti,"" he said.Those who remember her family recall the emotional ties that endured long after her departure. ""Siyon Mandal, who became a teacher at Sishu Niketan Prathamik Bidyalaya, was her best friend during primary school days. I remember how Siyondi was elated when Zia came to office in Bangladesh. The news of her demise has left people who knew her sorry,"" said Dasgupta, a former proprietor of now-defunct Das & Co.Neighbours, too, spoke of a bond that survived borders and decades. ""Zia's niece came only a couple of months ago to see Zia's birthplace. We talked about how good it would have been if the country was never partitioned.

Turkish police carried out major raids across the country on Tuesday, detaining 357 people suspected of links to the Islamic State (IS), the interior minister said.The operations came just a day after a deadly encounter in Yalova province, where three police officers and six IS militants were killed. Eight other officers and a night guard were injured when police stormed a house used as an IS hideout.Authorities said the recent wave of raids follows intelligence suggesting IS operatives were planning attacks during Christmas and New Year’s celebrations.On Tuesday, police conducted simultaneous operations in 21 provinces, including Istanbul, Ankara, and Yalova.Earlier, the Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office reported that 110 suspects had been held in raids on 114 addresses.Several detainees are believed to have collected money under the guise of charity and channelled it to IS networks in Syria.Police said digital materials recovered from the raids connected the suspects to IS fighters in conflict zones.IS has a history of deadly attacks in Turkey, including the 2017 Istanbul nightclub shooting during New Year celebrations, which killed 39 people.","Turkish police carried out major raids across the country on tuesday, detaining 357 people suspected of links to the islamic state.

Inspection of drug manufacturing sites in India is confidential information that is exempt from public disclosure under the Right to Information according to the drug regulatory authorities. Though the Central Drug Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) is supposed to have started risk-based inspection of drug-making facilities since December 2022, when asked how many such inspections have been conducted each month since then the CDSCO claimed that the information was exempt under the RTI Act. However, retired and active drug controllers pointed out that there was no blanket exemption on this information.“The public has the right to seek information on how many inspections have been conducted each year along with the dates of the inspections, the name of company and the names of the drug inspectors who conducted the inspection. Drug inspectors are public functionaries paid with public money to ensure safety of drugs in public interest. Why shouldn’t this information be available in the public domain, on the website of every state drug controller?” asked Dr KV Babu, ophthalmologist and RTI activist, who sought the information.Section 8(1) (d) cited by most drug authorities to deny information “exempts information the disclosure of which would prejudice the commercial interests of a third party, unless the public interest in disclosure is served”. The law clearly states that public interest overrides commercial interests.Section 8(1) (h) exempts “information that would impede the investigation or prosecution of offenders”. “This would only apply to those inspections which resulted in cases being filed as the drug authorities can claim that revealing the inspection reports could affect the case in court. But barring those inspection reports, the details of all other inspections can be made public. However, since there is no rule mandating the disclosure, the default mode is to not reveal it,” said an assistant drug controller who did not want to be named.Section (g) protects “information that would endanger life or physical safety, or identify sources of information for law enforcement”. “How does revealing this apply to information regarding inspection of drug-making facilities? If anything, not revealing it is endangering the life of the public who consume the medicines,” said Dr Babu.CDSCO’s drug alert list released every month shows that there are companies whose products are repeatedly found to be substandard with serious failings such as the presence of bacterial endotoxins and sterility issues in Ringer Lactate intravenous fluids. The products of one such company, Paschim Banga Pharmaceuticals, killed six new mothers in Karnataka, after which it was shut down. However, the Ringer Lactate fluid produced by this company was found contaminated with bacterial endotoxins in April 2020, again in August 2023, October 2024 and in November 2024 before it was connected to the deaths in Karnataka. Samples tested in December 2024 and those tested in January and February 2025 were also found similarly contaminated. However, with no data on inspections in the public domain, there is no way of knowing if drug control authorities ever inspected this unit before the deaths occurred or when they last inspected it or what they found if they did.Similarly, samples of yet another manufacturer of Ringer Lactate fluid, Swaroop Pharmaceuticals in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh being sold in Odisha were found to be contaminated with bacterial endotoxins in July, August, September, October and December 2022. In January 2023, samples of the product lifted in Mizoram, in February in Odisha and again in December 2023 were found to be similarly contaminated. Yet there is no information in the public domain on whether inspections were conducted of the manufacturing facility of this company and what was found to be the reason for the repeated contamination. There is no information regarding any risk-based inspection of manufacturers of Ringer lactate fluid following the deaths in Karnataka.“Earlier, every unit had to be inspected once a year by state drug inspectors and every two years the licence had to be renewed after the unit was inspected to see if they are fit for renewal. This was diluted in the name of ‘ease of business’ and now inspections need to be done only once every three years. Framing of regulations ought to be patient/consumer centric and not to suit the business,” said Ravi Uday Bhaskar Director-General of All India Drug Controller Officers Confederation.Incidentally, there is no prioritization of inspection of manufacturing sites, from where drugs originate. Most of the drug regulation is in the form of lifting samples from an estimated 1.7 lakh pharmacies, stockists, distributors etc scattered across the country and getting them tested. In contrast there are less than 8,000 manufacturing units according to the 2023 report of the government’s survey of pharma clusters. According to the survey, there are 118 pharma clusters in India and 7,673 pharma manufacturing units.Though the government announced risk-based inspections, the rules do not specify any criteria, parameters or methodology to determine what constitutes a “risk-based” inspection or how manufacturers are to be categorized by risk level, making it open ended and discretionary. “This results in inconsistent interpretation across states and in practice, a reduction in inspection frequency and oversight, thereby diluting regulatory control over manufacturing compliance,” said Uday Bhaskar.RTIs queries to 16 zonal offices and the CDSCO on inspections have been stonewalled repeatedly.",The central drug standards control organisation (cdsco) is supposed to have started risk-based inspection of drug-making facilities since december 2022. When asked how many such inspections have been conducted each month since then the cdsco claimed that the information was exempt under the rti act.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126253501,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-777839,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

We modernised institutions, simplified governance, and strengthened the foundations for long-term, inclusive growth,” he said.PM Modi said the government pushed ahead with higher ambition, faster execution and deeper change. He added that the reforms were meant to help citizens live with dignity, give entrepreneurs confidence to innovate and allow institutions to function with clarity and trust.Citing examples, the prime minister pointed to reforms in GST, labour laws, foreign investment, taxation, rural employment, and more.He said the simplified two-slab GST structure of 5 per cent and 18 per cent had eased the burden on households, MSMEs, farmers and labour-intensive sectors.PM Modi also said that the middle class has been given major relief, with no income tax for those earning up to Rs 12 lakh a year, while small businesses were supported by expanding the definition of small companies. He also highlighted 100 per cent FDI in insurance, new maritime and labour laws, key trade agreements, clean energy reforms under the SHANTI Act, and higher rural employment under the Viksit Bharat–G RAM G Act, 2025.Concluding his post, PM Modi said the reforms aimed to move India from a control-based system to one built on trust, with citizens at the centre. ""Building a Viksit Bharat is the polestar of our development trajectory. I urge everyone in India and abroad to deepen their bond with the India growth story. Keep trusting India and investing in our people,"" he said.","Prime minister narendra modi said india was being recognised globally for next-generation reforms.

Press release by the defence ministry

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday cleared a major tranche of defence procurements worth about Rs 79,000 crore, approving missiles, rockets, radar systems, drones and support platforms aimed at significantly strengthening the combat capabilities of the armed forces. The approvals were granted by the defence acquisition council chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh.As per a statement by the defence ministry, the DAC accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for a wide range of proposals across the Army, Navy and Air Force. The approvals cover the procurement of Loiter Munition Systems for artillery regiments, Low Level Light Weight Radars, Long Range Guided Rocket Ammunition for the Pinaka Multiple Launch Rocket System (MRLS), and the Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System Mk-II.Following the meeting, Rajnath Singh said the decisions reflected the government’s focus on defence preparedness. In a post on X, he wrote, “The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) meeting held today accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for various proposals of the three Services amounting to a total of about Rs 79,000 crore.”He added, “The MoD under the leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi is working tirelessly to strengthen India’s defence preparedness.The decisions taken today will help in enhancing operational capabilities of the Armed Forces.”The ministry said loiter munition will be used for precision strikes against tactical targets, reflecting the growing emphasis on stand-off and high-accuracy weaponry. The low level lightweight radars are designed to detect and track small-sized, low-flying unmanned aerial systems, a capability that has become increasingly critical in modern battlefields.For the Indian Navy, the DAC approved procurement of Bollard Pull (BP) tugs, High Frequency Software Defined Radios (HF SDR) Manpack, and the leasing of High Altitude Long Range (HALE) Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). The ministry said induction of BP tugs will assist naval ships and submarines in berthing, unberthing and manoeuvring in confined harbour waters.The Indian Air Force will receive approvals for the procurement of Automatic Take-off Landing Recording Systems, Astra Mk-II missiles, Full Mission Simulators and SPICE-1000 long-range guidance kits.“Induction of the automatic take-off landing recording system will fill the gaps in the aerospace safety environment by providing high definition all-weather automatic recording of landing and take-off,” the ministry said.It added that Astra Mk-II missiles, with enhanced range, will improve the ability of fighter aircraft to neutralise adversary platforms from large stand-off distances.","Defence minister rajnath singh said the decisions reflected the government’s focus on defence preparedness.

'India Will Be 3rd Largest Economy': PM Modi Sounds Warning To Trump, Says World is Betting on Delhi

India Becomes Fourth Largest Economy

High Growth, Low Inflation - The Goldilocks Situation

In a major feat, India has moved past Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy in nominal GDP terms, according to the government’s year-end economic review. The economy is set to overtake Germany to become the third largest after the US and China in the coming years. A final confirmation will depend on the data released by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in the first half of 2026 when the final figures for 2025 will be released.“With GDP valued at $4.18 trillion, India has surpassed Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy and is poised to displace Germany from the third rank in the next 2.5 to 3 years with projected GDP of $7.3 trillion by 2030,” the government release said.India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now. The size of its economy has doubled in the last ten years, and it is now eyeing the position of being the third largest in the world.A government economic note issued late Monday highlighted that India remains one of the fastest-expanding major economies globally and is well placed to maintain its growth pace.IMF forecasts for 2026 value India’s economy at $4.51 trillion, slightly above Japan’s projected $4.46 trillion.The government’s optimistic outlook comes even as the economy faces headwinds following the imposition of steep US tariffs in August linked to India’s purchases of Russian oil.Recent high-frequency data signals that economic momentum is holding firm. Inflation has stayed below the lower bound of the tolerance band, joblessness is easing, and exports are showing steady improvement, the government review noted.Financial conditions also remain supportive, marked by healthy credit expansion to businesses, while demand continues to be resilient, aided by a further pickup in urban consumption.India’s real GDP expanded by 8.2% in the second quarter of FY 2025-26, accelerating from 7.8% in the preceding quarter and 7.4% in the final quarter of FY 2024-25. This growth was driven by strong domestic demand, even as global trade and policy uncertainties persisted. Real gross value added rose 8.1%, underpinned by solid performance in the industrial and services sectors.The Reserve Bank of India raised its growth projection for FY 2025-26 to 7.3%, up from 6.8% earlier. The upward revision factors in sustained domestic demand, rationalisation of income tax and GST, softer crude prices, an early push in government capital spending, and accommodative monetary and financial conditions, all supported by contained inflation.“Ongoing reforms are likely to further enable growth prospects. The present macro-economic situation presents a rare “goldilocks period” of high growth and low inflation,” the review said.CPI inflation stood at 4.26% in January and gradually moderated over the first half of the year, before declining further to multi-year lows during the latter half. Headline inflation continued to soften and touched historic lows of around 0.25% in October. This sharper-than-expected disinflation was primarily driven by a correction in food prices.RBI has cumulatively cut the repo rate by 1.25% this year, down from 6.5% to 5.25%. The move reflected a balanced approach between supporting growth and managing inflation, aided by a favourable outlook for both headline and core inflation.India’s external position continues to display considerable strength. Supported by healthy growth in services exports and a steady rise in overseas remittances, the current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 1.3% of GDP in the second quarter of FY 2025–26, down from 2.2% in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, the government release said.Remittance inflows rose by 10.7% year-on-year during the quarter, reinforcing external stability. With services exports maintaining momentum and remittance flows remaining strong, the CAD is expected to stay contained through 2025–26.“India’s growth outlook remains buoyant, with global and domestic institutions upgrading their assessments on the back of strong economic fundamentals. Reflecting broad-based momentum across key sectors, the Reserve Bank of India revised its GDP growth projection for FY 2025–26 upward from 6.8% to 7.3%,” the review said.","India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now.
