Global agreement reached to eliminate hazardous pesticide chlorpyrifos with exemptions for India and other countries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-agreement-reached-to-eliminate-hazardous-pesticide-chlorpyrifos-with-exemptions-for-india-and-other-countries/articleshow/120863171.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a significant decision, countries across the globe on Saturday struck a major deal to eliminate the use of one of the most hazardous pesticides , Chlorpyrifos, with certain exemptions, under the Stockholm Convention at the ongoing meet in Geneva.India, which opposed its complete elimination at this stage, will continue to use it for another five years as per its registered uses for 12 crops, including rice, wheat, gram, sugarcane, beans, cotton, mustard, brinjal, onion, apple, barley, and groundnut, to deal with certain pests and termites.Over 40 countries, including all 27 European Union (EU) nations, the UK, and the US, have already banned the use of Chlorpyrifos on food crops. India, during the negotiation, pitched for exemptions, arguing the need for its use in certain crops in the absence of alternatives. The country, along with other nations, including Russia, Kenya, Zambia, and Costa Rica, also favoured exemptions for ensuring food security .Though India and many countries will continue to use it for select exempted purposes in the cultivation of certain crops while dealing with pests, the decision will ultimately push the users to look for alternatives in the final goal of complete elimination of the use of Chlorpyrifos, a highly toxic organophosphate pesticide with harmful effects on health and the environment.The decision was taken at the ongoing Conference of the Parties (COPs) to the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm (BRS) Convention in Geneva, being held to galvanise global efforts to manage hazardous chemicals and waste in an environmentally sound manner.Experts who have been tracking the development at the Convention welcome the listing of Chlorpyrifos in Annex A (meant for elimination) of the Convention but expressed their concerns at the long list of exemptions.“The world can no longer turn a blind eye to the overwhelming scientific evidence on Chlorpyrifos. Its global elimination is a critical step toward safeguarding public health, environmental integrity, and the rights of future generations,” said Dileep Kumar of the Pesticide Action Network (PAN) India.""We support a broad spectrum evaluation and speeding up the separation of highly hazardous chemicals for elimination. The survival of life, including biodiversity, is at stake. Also, national govts have to take up their own independent physico-chemical and ecotoxicological evaluation to propose such chemicals for elimination,” said Narasimha Reddy Donthi, a public policy expert.The specific exemptions allowed under the decision include 18 crop-pest complexes (rice, maize, wheat, sugarcane, onion, peanut, barley, cabbage, chickpea, cotton, pineapple, and rapeseed, among others); control of leaf-cutting ants for agricultural use; control of locusts; control of ticks in cattle; and wood preservation against borers and termites in building foundations.","India, which opposed its complete elimination at this stage, will continue to use it for another five years. Over 40 countries, including all 27 eu nations, the uk, and the us, have already banned the use of chlorpyrifos on food crops.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120863183,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-924494,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Somewhat concerned Very concerned

NEW DELHI: Days before the Pahalgam massacre, terror chatter picked up from across the border indicated terrorists' plans to hit tourist places in J&K, particularly hotels on outskirts of Srinagar, more specifically areas like Dachigam, etc, senior officials following the investigations told TOI on Saturday.J&K Police sources, however, insisted that while intelligence was available on likely terror plans to target tourists and hotels, it was generic in nature, also naming non-local migrant labourers, Hindu pilgrims and Kashmiri pandits as potential targets and several areas like Kulgam, Pulwama, etc, as ""vulnerable spots"". There was no mention of Baisaran, which had no history of terror activity or attacks, in these inputs. The intelligence was followed up, with J&K Police brass camping in Srinagar to ensure that security at several prominent tourist places and hotels was tightened.Sources said the two local terrorists - Adil Thoker and Asif Sheikh - in the Pahalgam attack team had blended in with the tourists before herding them into the food stalls area, making it easier for the male victims to be segregated. They added that the entry and exit to Baisaran, which is open round the year barring periods of heavy snowfall and Amarnath Yatra - is ticketed and a fence installed since a tender to manage it for three years was awarded to a Bijbehara businessman last year.The outskirts of Srinagar in the foothills of Zabarwan range were seen as prone to attacks as a group of Pakistani terrorists linked to two attacks in Oct 2024 - at Gagangir, in which six non-local labourers and a doctor were killed, and at Buta Pathri, which left two Army personnel and two Army porters dead - was supposedly active there. Investigations so far suggest that Hashim Musa, the Pakistani assailant in Pahalgam also involved in Gagangir and Buta Pathri attacks, was in Tral along with another Pakistani and two local terrorists, days before they struck in Baisaran.An officer said agencies have looked into the possibility of terrorists having initially planned to strike during PM Modi's April 19 visit to J&K to flag off a train service between Katra and Srinagar. The motive of the terrorists, backed by Pakistan's ISI, could have been to divert attention from the major rail infrastructure upgrade, a source said adding that when the PM's visit was called due to bad weather, the terrorists, who were possibly hiding in Tral by then, waited until April 22 to execute the attack.A second police officer said the terrorists chose to hit tourists to demolish the 'normalcy' narrative, with the record tourist arrivals in the Valley being cited as a barometer of normalcy. Overground support, another functionary said, was a reality with three of every 10 OGWs being hardcore, ideologically committed cadre. Hitting the other seven, who may be working for some quick money, by having their houses demolished may be counter-productive as they also double up as intelligence assets, it was stressed. The houses of nearly nine OGWs in J&K were demolished in the wake of Pahalgam attack; the Omar Abdullah govt is said to have requested the Centre to exercise caution.Officials on Saturday flagged use and recovery of sophisticated weapons - suspected to be left behind by NATO troops in Afghanistan - in Kashmir.","Terror chatter picked up from across the border indicated terrorists' plans to hit tourist places in j&k.

This was mentioned in a Russian readout of a conversation that foreign minister Sergey Lavrov had with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar about the Pahalgam terrorist attack on Saturday.Jaishankar reiterated in his talks with Lavrov that perpetrators, planners and backers of the Pahalgam must be brought to justice. India sees Pakistan as having done little to respect the principles enshrined in the Simla Agreement but acknowledges its importance in underlining the significance of bilateralism in addressing disputes. The agreement has also been important for upholding the sanctity of the LoC, which resulted from the ceasefire of December 1971, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs and use of peaceful means for resolving disputes. Pakistan has so far not issued a notification for putting the agreement in abeyance.According to Russian authorities, Lavrov and Jaishankar discussed issues related to Russia-India cooperation and the “aggravation of India-Pakistan relations following the terrorist attack in Pahalgam”. The conversation followed President Vladimir Putin’s message to PM Narendra Modi last week that Russia expects the organisers and perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack to face “deserved punishment”.“Sergey Lavrov called for settling disagreements between New Delhi and Islamabad on a bilateral basis by political and diplomatic means per the provisions of the Simla Agreement of 1972 and the Lahore Declaration of 1999. The ministers also discussed the schedule of upcoming contacts at the highest levels,’’ said the readout.Both sides also discussed Putin’s likely visit to India later this year for the annual India-Russia summit.

Pahalgam attack aftermath: Long leaves cancelled at ordnance factories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-attack-aftermath-long-leaves-cancelled-at-ordnance-factories/articleshow/120858421.cms,"AI generated image

Poll Do you support the cancellation of long leaves for employees in defense manufacturing during times of national security tensions? No, it affects employee well-being. Yes, it's necessary for national security.

‘Cancellation of leaves aimed at accelerating defence production’



NAGPUR/JABALPUR/KOLKATA: Amid surging tensions with Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack , Munitions India Limited (MIL), agglomerate of the 12 ordnance factories across the country, has cancelled long leaves of its employees at most plants, sources told TOI on Friday. No leave beyond two days is permitted for the next two months.Senior management sources, including those on the board, denied the directive had anything to do with the post-April 22 tension. The official reason - from Ordnance Factory Chandrapur to Jabalpur - is that they have missed production targets for April and are catching up. Officials at Chandrapur cited pressure of global export orders.MIL said it put its employees on ""alert mode"" after the Pahalgam attack. ""If there is urgency to expedite our production, we should be able to do it... But there is no official decision to cancel leave of employees across the 12 factories,"" a senior MIL official told TOI.On condition of anonymity, an official at Jabalpur’s Ordnance Factory-Khamaria said the order was issued “in view of national security”. An official at Ordnance Factory-Itarsi echoed this.In case of emergency, employees can apply to the “appropriate authorities”, says the order issued Thursday.At Gun & Shell Factory-Cossipore in Bengal, an employee confirmed that an order had been issued on Friday, cancelling leaves in the “current scenario”. An officer in Kolkata refused to confirm or deny the development but said it would be “logical if leaves were cancelled given the current situation”.Leaves of all employees of Badmal Ordnance Factory in Balangir, Odisha, have also been cancelled for 60 days. There is, however, no such order at OF-Bhandara (Maharashtra) under MIL, which manufactures powerful explosives RDX and HMX.A senior official from the Department of Defence Production, under which the ordnance factories come, told TOI, “We have not issued any official circular in this regard to ordnance factories. But some PSUs have internally instructed their employees to avoid going on leave due to the current scenario.”Mukesh Singh, president of Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS), one of the largest unions of the ordnance factories, told TOI, “We have come to know from our employees working in MIL that their leave has been cancelled. However, we have not got any official communication from the company as yet.”The Pune-headquartered MIL is the main ammunition manufacturing company under ministry of defence. The 12 units under it produce the Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher, IAF bombs, armour-piercing tank ammunition, high-explosive tank ammo and artillery shells, plus infantry weapons like 81mm and 51mm mortar bombs, and hand grenades (including a multi-mode type that can be switched between offensive and defensive modes). They also produce 5.56mm, 7.62mm and 9mm bullets for the full range of firearms used by infantry.At OFK and OF-Chandrapur, all 7,000 employees have been told no extended leaves will be allowed, and those sanctioned stand cancelled. The same held for OF-Itarsi.OFK is one of the largest ammunition manufacturers for the military. In the Balakot air strike, 1000-pound bombs made at OFK were used by IAF to pound locations across the LoC. And during the Kargil War, OFK supplied the fuzes for Bofors shells that smashed Pakistani positions atop mountain tops.Leaves have not been cancelled at non-MIL ordnance factories — like the five in Kanpur and Jabalpur-based Gun Carriage Factory, which manufactures the Dhanush 155mm artillery guns.A senior officer of Ordnance Factory Chandrapur (OFC) said cancellation of leaves is aimed at accelerating production. Apart from orders from Indian armed forces, MIL — a defence PSU carved out of erstwhile Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) — is also sitting on a huge export order, said sources.","Mil said it put its employees on ""alert mode"" after the pahalgam attack.

US approves HawkEye 360 sale to boost India’s surveillance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-approves-hawkeye-360-sale-to-boost-indias-surveillance/articleshow/120859058.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move to boost New Delhi’s surveillance power amid heightened military tension, the US state department has approved the sale of HawkEye 360 technology to India, which will help the country gain maritime domain awareness in the Indo-Pacific, aided by a growing constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit.The proposed sale, the state department statement said, “will improve India's capabilities to meet current and future threats by bolstering its maritime domain awareness, analytical abilities and strategic posture”.A US Defence Security Cooperation Agency statement said New Delhi requested purchase of the SeaVision software, including its preferred software enhancements, training as a technical assistance field team, remote software, analytic support, documents, and other logistics and programme support elements. The estimated total cost is $131 million. “The principal contractor will be Hawkeye360, located in Herndon, Virginia,” the statement said.HawkEye 360, an American geospatial analytics private company, collects and analyses radio frequency (RF) signal location with a constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit. These satellites detect and geolocate radio frequency (RF) emissions. They track communication signals from ships, aircraft, vehicles, and coastal systems. Some vessels, which ‘go dark’ to roam undetected in disputed areas and evade tracking after turning off their Automatic Identification System (AIS), can also be detected with this advanced technology.Indian forces can now identify illegal fishing, smuggling and perform effective surveillance in the Indian Ocean Region with the help of this technology.With this technology, India gains deeper visibility across its Exclusive Economic Zone. Currently, the Indian Navy uses P8i reconnaissance aircraft and Sea Guardian drones to monitor strategic locations and detect vessels keeping their AIS switched off.The Hawkeye 360 system uses Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as additional layers. Each layer improves detection, verification and classification of threats. EO satellites capture high-resolution daytime imagery; infrared sensors identify thermal emissions from engines and exhausts; and SAR satellites capture radar-based images regardless of weather and time. This layer confirms ship size, speed, and location. The system combines speed, precision, and adaptability and works continuously across all weather and time conditions.“The proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the US by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defence partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions,” the US statement said.","Hawkeye 360, an american geospatial analytics private company, collects and analyses radio frequency (rf) signal location with a constellation of satellites in low earth orbit.

Focus on security and intelligence operations Implement economic and diplomatic measures

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday announced a series of sweeping punitive measures against Pakistan, halting all imports, suspending mail services, and denying port access to Pakistani vessels with immediate effect.The move marks a sharp escalation following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people, most of them tourists.A notification issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on May 2, and now incorporated into the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023, states: “Direct or indirect import or transit of all goods originating in or exported from Pakistan, whether or not freely importable or otherwise permitted, shall be prohibited with immediate effect, until further orders.” Any exemptions will require explicit government approval.The Department of Posts has simultaneously suspended the exchange of all categories of mail and parcels from Pakistan via air and land routes. A government official said this suspension is in response to ""cross-border linkages"" identified in the Pahalgam strike and vowed “severe punishment to those involved in the attack.”India has also barred ships bearing the Pakistani flag from docking at any Indian port. The directive, issued in the interest of national security, also prohibits Indian-flagged vessels from visiting Pakistani ports. “This order is issued to ensure safety of Indian assets, cargo and connected infrastructure, in public interest and for interest of Indian shipping,” the notification reads.Trade data reveals limited bilateral exchange in recent years. From April 2024 to January 2025, India imported just $2.88 million worth of goods from Pakistan—mainly fruits, nuts, oilseeds, and medicinal plants—while exports stood at $1.18 billion, dominated by organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals.

Poll Do you think the recent incidents will affect tourism in Kashmir long-term? No Yes

NEW DELHI: Days before terrorists gunned down 26 tourists in a brutal massacre in Pahalgam, intelligence agencies had sounded the alarm about a possible attack on visitors staying near Srinagar's scenic foothills, according to a report by PTI citing official sources.Acting on these inputs, security forces increased patrolling around areas like Dachigam and Nishat, with senior police officials stationed in Srinagar.The focus was heightened after a terror strike in Gangangir, Sonamarg last October, which left seven people dead.Despite a two-week-long search operation based on these inputs, no breakthroughs were made, and the mission was called off on the very day of the Pahalgam attack.Officials believe the terrorists may have aimed to disrupt the planned visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to flag off the first train from Katra to Srinagar -- an event seen as symbolic of Kashmir’s integration with the rest of the country. Although the PM’s visit, originally set for April 19, was postponed due to inclement weather, sources suggest Pakistan-based elements may have wanted to overshadow it with violence.According to initial assessments, two local terrorists had blended in with the tourists in Valley's Pahalgam.When the shooting began, they herded the group to a food court, where two Pakistani terrorists opened fire.Officials see the attack as an attempt to instill fear and possibly provoke retaliatory violence against Kashmiris in other parts of India. Swift intervention by chief minister Omar Abdullah and coordination with New Delhi helped preempt such outcomes, with states asked to ensure the safety of Kashmiri residents.Security officials have also flagged a shift in the nature of militancy in J&K, citing recoveries of advanced weapons - including M-series rifles and armour-piercing bullets -- possibly sourced from Nato stockpiles left behind in Afghanistan.Cautioning against using tourist numbers as a barometer of peace, officials referenced the 2006 incident where four tourists were killed in Srinagar soon after a former CM had claimed peace based on rising tourist footfall. “Tourism should be viewed as an economic activity, not a measure of normalcy in a conflict zone,” one official said.On concerns about Baisaran being closed to tourists, officials clarified it remains open year-round except during the Amarnath Yatra and snowfall. A contract was awarded last year for tourist operations, and new facilities like a zipline have been added.","Intelligence agencies had sounded the alarm about a possible attack on visitors staying near srinagar's scenic foothills.

No, they need improvement Yes, very efficient

NEW DELHI: The Army is going in for the procurement of another lot of man-portable air defence missile systems , which can intercept and destroy hostile fighter jets, aircraft, drones and helicopters at ranges up to 6-km, amid the ongoing tensions with Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror massacre.The defence ministry-Army on Friday issued the tender or RFP (request for proposal) for 48 launchers, 48 night-vision sights, 85 missiles and a missile test station of the very short-range air defence system-new generation ( VSHORADS-NG ). Vendors have been told to submit their bids by May 20.""The fire-and-forget VSHORADS-NG, based on infra-red homing technology, are needed by Army to meet the evolving dynamic air threat. There are major shortages in such man-portable systems for terminal and point defence against all types of aerial threats,"" an officer said.The RFP said the all-weather air defence system, which should have anti-jamming characteristics and be capable of being para-dropped, will be employed across all kinds of terrain, ranging from plains and deserts to high-altitude areas of around 4,500-metres.The indigenous VSHORADS being developed by DRDO is still not ready for production and induction, with the latest set of trials being conducted in Feb this year. Consequently, the Army and IAF had earlier also inducted a limited number of such systems under emergency provisions due to the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh with China.They included the Russian Igla-S man-portable air defence systems, assembled in India by Adani Defence. While the Army and IAF have the old Igla-1M systems since 1989, the shoulder-fired Igla-S is an improved variant with a longer interception range of up to 6-km.Now, the tense situation with Pakistan seems to have triggered a fresh round of procurements. A tri-Service case for acquisition of 5,175 VSHORADS and associated equipment was initiated way back in June 2009, which eventually led to the Igla-S system being selected over the French and Swedish systems in the fray.

Farooq Abdullah links Pahalgam attack to local support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farooq-abdullah-links-pahalgam-attack-to-local-support/articleshow/120858237.cms,"Poll Do you think that remarks made by political leaders can influence public perception of Kashmiris? No, people form their opinions independently. Yes, they can significantly impact views.

SRINAGAR: National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah said Saturday the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack that left 26 people dead could not have taken place without local assistance. “I don’t think these things can happen unless someone supports them,” he said.Abdullah also reiterated his party’s longstanding opposition to Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying the agreement has harmed the region’s interests and must be reviewed.His comments about local support in the Pahalgam attack drew criticism from PDP president and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti. She called his remarks “deeply disturbing” and “regrettable”.“As a senior leader, that too as a Kashmiri, his statement risks fuelling divisive narratives providing ammunition to certain media channels to further stereotype & stigmatise Kashmiris and Muslims,” Mufti said in a post on X. “This isn’t only misleading but fatal at a time when students and traders from J&K are already facing heightened vulnerability and attacks.”NC pushed back against Mufti’s interpretation of the remarks. Party chief spokesman Tanvir Sadiq accused her of twisting Abdullah’s words and demanded an apology.“It’s shocking that someone who has served as CM would stoop this low. Farooq Abdullah never mentioned ‘Kashmiris’ or ‘locals’,” Sadiq said in a statement. “At a time when we’re trying to protect Kashmiri students, traders, and families across India, it’s shameful to misrepresent his words and endanger them further.”Abdullah visited the family of Syed Adil Hussain Shah, the pony handler killed in the attack, at Hapatnar in Pahalgam. He welcomed central govt’s announcement to suspend the water treaty with Pakistan and urged govt to divert Chenab water to Jammu and build power infrastructure on Jhelum in Kashmir.“We do not want their (Pakistan's) water supply to be stopped, but we have a right on our rivers. Today if you go to Jammu, you see there is a huge shortage of water,” he said.Abdullah recalled that his government had tried to draw water from the Chenab to Jammu but was blocked by the World Bank under IWT restrictions. “Today is the opportunity for us to divert this water from there to Jammu,” he said.“In Kashmir we are deprived of electricity. We can generate thousands of megawatts,” he added, calling on the government to build hydropower infrastructure on the Jhelum.Referring to the Pahalgam attack, Abdullah said: “They (terrorists) have lost it. It has been proven today that we are not going to get scared. Kashmir was and will always be a part of India.

'Will take firm & decisive action against terrorists': PM Modi on Pahalgam attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-take-firm-decisive-action-against-terrorists-pm-modi-on-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/120858701.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is committed to taking “firm and decisive” action against the terrorists who perpetrated the Pahalgam attack and those who support them, said PM Narendra Modi amid repeated calls by the global community for restraint and de-escalation and as tensions soar with Pakistan. After a bilateral meeting with visiting Angola President João Manuel Lourenço, Modi said both leaders agreed that terrorism is the biggest threat to humanity.Modi delivered his media statement after the meeting in Hindi but switched over to English while talking about the April 22 attack and India’s resolve for decisive action against the perpetrators. The PM had done the same 2 days after the attack while speaking in Madhubani in Bihar where he, in his first response to the tourist massacre, pledged to identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers.Modi’s remarks on the Pahalgam attack, particularly about action against those who support terrorists, are significant as these suggest India hasn’t given up on the military option for pursuing those who perpetrated the attack and their backers. Lourenço, who currently holds the chairmanship of the African Union, also strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and expressed solidarity with the Indian people.As the government weighs punitive measures against Pakistan for its role in the attack, it has come under some serious pressure from friends and partners like the US, EU and Gulf countries to avoid any escalation and resolve the cross-border terrorism issue with Pakistan diplomatically.Modi was speaking days after US secretary of state Marco Rubio urged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate and work for peace in South Asia. His counterpart S Jaishankar had responded by saying that the perpetrators must be brought to justice. Rubio’s comments were followed by remarks by US Vice President JD Vance that India’s response to the attack should not lead to any broader regional conflict. Unlike Rubio though, Vance seemed to throw a noose around Pakistan’s neck by explicitly asking it to work with India “to the extent that they are responsible” and ensure that the terrorists “sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down”. The state department too said Modi had full support of the US on terrorism, in comments apparently meant to assure India that Washington is not tone-deaf to India’s anxieties about Pakistan’s backing of terrorists.Modi was also speaking a day after defence minister Rajnath Singh cancelled his visit to Moscow for Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on May 9.“I thanked President Lourenço and the people of Angola for their condolences on the loss of lives in the terrorist attack in Pahalgam. India is committed to taking firm and decisive action against the terrorists and those who support them. We thank Angola for their support in our fight against cross-border terrorism,’’ said the PM, while announcing an expansion of the energy partnership with the southwestern African country that is an important supplier of oil and gas to India. Modi also announced a $ 200 million defence credit line for the modernization of Angola’s armed forces.","India is committed to taking ‘firm and decisive’ action against the terrorists who perpetrated the pahalgam attack and those who support them, says pm narendra modi.

‘Move doesn’t reflect desire for justice, but is diversionary ploy’



Poll Do you believe that Pakistan's proposal for a 'neutral' probe is genuine? No, it is a deception Yes, it is genuine

NEW DELHI: India has rejected Pakistan's proposal for a ""neutral"" probe into the mass killings at Pahalgam by dismissing it as a deception meant to distract attention from Islamabad's complicity in the slaughter of innocent tourists. ""They are pursuing their familiar playbook of deception and duplicity.The term 'neutral' is nothing but a loaded euphemism for the blatant lie that those making the offer were not complicit in the carnage. They are trying to pull the wool over the world's eyes,"" an official told TOI.It does not reflect a desire for justice, but is a diversionary ploy. They are trying to deflect international attention, evade scrutiny and accountability and undermine India’s right to defend its sovereignty and security.”Another source said, “Neutrality in investigation implies a dispute over facts, but here the facts about the identity of the perpetrators and their masterminds are incontrovertible and consistent with the pattern of use of terror gangs as an instrument of proxy war. It is the Pakistani state itself that has been using terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e Mohammad to further its objectives.” Pakistan’s PM Shehbaz Sharif first spoke of “a credible and neutral probe”, and found endorsement from China. Then, US secretary of state Marco Rubio last week asked India to work together with Pakistan, raising eyebrows here.“The focus must not be merely on individual perpetrators but on the Pakistani state that has enabled, equipped and exported terrorism. It is time for the international community to hold Pakistan accountable for not just the Pahalgam killings but also for raising and sustaining a terror infrastructure that has been responsible for killings in different countries. Falling for Pakistan’s neutrality rhetoric is a betrayal of justice for the victims of Pahalgam but also of victims of all the terror attacks that have been traced to Pakistan,” said a source, pointing to the arrests of Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh, one of the plotters of the 9/11 attack, in Pakistan.India’s contempt for the idea of an allegedly neutral probe is rooted in the bitter experience it has had with Pakistan over the decades. Sources pointed out that Islamabad had denied any link to the 26/11 assault on Mumbai until investigation forced them to acknowledge Ajmal Kasab’s Pakistani citizenship. India agreed to a joint probe into the attack on the Pathankot airbase only to realise that Pakistan used the mechanism to stall the investigation and protect the perpetrators.“Blaming the alleged non-state actors for the terror attacks they organise is a tactic which has no takers now. They have deployed it right since 1947, when their army regulars disguised themselves as tribal lashkars to invade J&K. It was put to use in 1965 as part of Operation Gibraltar when their soldiers masquerading as locals unsuccessfully tried to trigger an uprising; and at the time of incursions in Kargil in 1999 when their regulars and terrorists were responsible,” said a source, pointing out that no action was taken against the perpetrators of 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai, 26/11 terrorist strikes and Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy despite India providing irrefutable evidence.“Hafiz Saeed and Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi continue to play with impunity. The worst thing is the brazenness with which they go about this. They lied to the world that Sajid Mir, one of the masterminds of 26/11, was dead but he was found to be alive. Then they claimed that he was in jail.”","India rejects pakistan's proposal for a 'neutral' probe into the mass killings at pahalgam.
