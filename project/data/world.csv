“Deal Is A Key Priority For Both Sides” Us Expert Lauds India-Us Trade Pact

Parliamentary approval process underway

Double contributions convention to be implemented in parallel

Tariff reductions and market access

The India-UK free trade agreement signed in July last year is expected to be implemented from April 2026, a government official said.India and the United Kingdom signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24, 2025, under which 99 per cent of Indian exports will enter the British market at zero duty, while India will reduce tariffs on a range of British goods including cars and whisky.“We are expecting the pact to be implemented from April this year,” the official said, as quoted by news agency PTI.The agreement requires approval from the UK Parliament before it can take effect. In India, such trade agreements are cleared by the Union Cabinet.According to PTI, after ratification by the British Parliament, the pact will be implemented on a mutually agreed date. The House of Commons held a debate on the India-UK CETA earlier this week.Chris Bryant, minister of state in the UK Department for Business and Trade, responded during the debate on behalf of the Labour government, describing CETA as a significant achievement that goes “well beyond India's precedent in opening the door for UK businesses”.The British Parliament is currently ratifying the agreement, including debates in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, along with committee reviews, before implementation in the coming months.Alongside CETA, the two countries have signed a Double Contributions Convention (DCC) pact to prevent temporary workers from having to pay social security contributions in both countries.The official said both CETA and the DCC are likely to be implemented in parallel, as per PTI.CETA aims to double bilateral trade, currently estimated at $56 billion, between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies by 2030.Under the agreement, India will reduce import duties on Scotch whisky from 150 per cent to 75 per cent immediately, with a further reduction to 40 per cent by 2035.Also read| India-UK trade deal: From 99% duty-free access to benefits for Indian professionals - Here’s the FTA in 10 big numbers Import duties on automobiles will be cut to 10 per cent over five years from the current levels of up to 110 per cent, under a quota-based liberalisation system.In return, Indian exporters are set to gain improved access to the UK market for goods such as textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, sports goods and toys.India has also agreed to lower tariffs on British consumer products including chocolates, biscuits and cosmetics.During his visit to India in 2025, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed the desire for the agreement to be implemented as soon as “humanly possible.”Speaking in Mumbai in October last year, Starmer described the trade deal as Britain’s largest post-Brexit trade achievement and said he had instructed his team to ensure it is executed “as quickly as humanly possible”.Also read| India-UK trade deal: Starmer wants FTA implementation as soon as 'humanly possible'! The agreement was signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to London in July 2025.Economists estimate the pact could increase trade between the two countries by about £25.5 billion ($34 billion) by 2040, with UK officials describing that figure as a starting point for further growth.If implemented as expected in April 2026, the agreement would mark a significant step in expanding bilateral economic ties and reducing tariff barriers across key sectors.","India and the united kingdom signed the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (ceta) on july 24, 2025.

Indian coastal authorities 'seize' 3 US-sanctioned oil tankers linked to Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-coastal-authorities-seize-3-us-sanctioned-oil-tankers-linked-to-iran/articleshow/128437223.cms,"Photo: File photo of oil vessel Asphalt Star

NEW DELHI: Indian coastal authorities reportedly “seized three US-sanctioned tanker ships linked to Iran” earlier this month, a source informed TOI on Monday. The vessel seizures follow the improvement in India-US relations with Washington announcing recently that it would cut import tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%.In a related development, US military forces boarded another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the vessel from the Caribbean Sea, in an effort to target illicit oil trade connected to Venezuela, the Pentagon said on Sunday.‘Shadow fleet’ vessels Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star and Al Jafzia carrying sanctioned Iranian oil were seized on Feb 6. India’s unprecedented enforcement action took place the same day that Washington and New Delhi unveiled a major bilateral trade framework.Indian coastal authorities said in a post on X on Feb 6 that they had intercepted the three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai after detecting suspicious activity involving a tanker in India's exclusive economic zone. However, the post was later deleted.Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star and Al Jafzia frequently changed their identities to evade action by coastal states, and their owners were based overseas, it was said.According to Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), a Washington DC-based research institute, “All three were previously sanctioned by the US for their ties to Iran. They form part of a 30-tanker fleet managed by Jugwinder Singh Brar, a UAE-based Indian national designated by the Treasury Department in April 2025 for operating in the petroleum sector of the Iranian economy. The Stellar Ruby was still flying an Iranian flag at the time of the seizure”.Importantly, Iran too had seized an oil tanker, MT Valiant Roar, on Dec 8 with 16 Indian crew members on board. Of the 16, eight have been released, but eight are still in Iran’s custody. Their families have been demanding the release of the sailors.As for US forces boarding another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean, Venezuela has faced US sanctions on its oil for several years and relied on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. President Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in Dec to pressure then-President Nicolás Maduro -- Maduro was apprehended in Jan during an American military operation.Several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast in the wake of the raid, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight. The Defense Department said in a post on X that US forces had boarded Veronica III, conducting “a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding.” “The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine — hoping to slip away,” the Pentagon said. “We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance and shut it down,” it added.","Indian coastal authorities reportedly ‘seized three us-sanctioned tanker ships linked to iran’ vessels stellar ruby, asphalt star and al jafzia carrying sanctioned iranian oil were seized on feb 6.

In Mumbai, the leaders will jointly inaugurate the India-France Year of Innovation which will be celebrated through 2026 in both countries, according to the ministry of external affairs. The India-France Year of Innovation and Cultural Commemoration will be held at the Gateway of India on Tuesday evening.The Indian govt had last week approved a proposal to procure 114 Rafale fighter jets under a govt-to-govt framework from France. India and France will also hold on Tuesday the 6th Annual Defence Dialogue in Bengaluru that is expected to see the renewal of their defence cooperation agreement for another 10 years.Discussions are also likely to focus on greater cooperation involving air and maritime assets, in line with the ambitious Defence Industrial Roadmap agreed to in 2024.Both leaders will also look to discuss regional and global issues, including the Russia-Ukraine war, the situation in Gaza and the Indo-Pacific region where India sees France as an indispensable partner. With uncertainty looming over Quad, the partnership with France, a resident power in the Indian Ocean, has become even more significant for India.According to Indian authorities, both leaders will hold discussions on strengthening bilateral cooperation across a wide spectrum of areas as enshrined in the Horizon 2047 Roadmap that was adopted three years ago, setting the course for bilateral cooperation over the next 25 years. Macron's participation in the AI summit in India follows his co-chairing with Modi the same summit in France last year.Both leaders had then stressed their common commitment to concrete actions to ensure that the global AI sector can drive social, economic and environmental outcomes in public interest.

India Speeds Up Chenab Hydropower Projects, Redrawing Indus Rivers Water Control Lines For Pakistan

JAMMU: India is preparing to stop surplus water from the Ravi flowing into Pakistan once the Shahpur Kandi dam on Punjab-J&K border becomes operational, marking a long-awaited shift in use of eastern river waters of Indus basin.J&K minister Javed Ahmed Rana said Monday the dam is expected to be completed by March 31 and is a priority for drought-prone Kathua and Samba districts. Officials said the project will irrigate about 5,000 hectares in Punjab and more than 32,173 hectares across Kathua and Samba in J&K. Central assistance of Rs 485.38 crore was approved for the irrigation component.Former irrigation minister Taj Mohideen said the dam falls outside Indus Waters Treaty because India has exclusive rights over the Ravi. Rana added that suspension of the treaty has accelerated power and dam projects in J&K.The 1960 treaty divides the Indus system’s waters, designating eastern rivers (Sutlej, Beas, Ravi) to India and western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan. India put the treaty in abeyance after the April 2025 terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people, a sharp policy shift aimed at pressuring Pakistan over cross-border terrorism.The move halted data sharing and opened the door for greater use of western river waters.Part of the Ravi flows unused through Madhopur into Pakistan despite demand in Punjab and J&K, Rana said, stressing that the dam would curb such wastage. Projects like Shahpur Kandi are critical to reallocating flows towards domestic irrigation and away from downstream discharge.The project was first cleared in Nov 2001 but stalled for years amid interstate disputes. After a series of bilateral and central meetings, Punjab and J&K reached an agreement in Sept 2018. Union cabinet chaired by PM Narendra Modi approved implementation on Dec 6 that year.Bani MLA Dr Rameshwar Singh said residents had waited years for completion. “Once it is completed, the water will no longer flow into Pakistan but will instead be used to irrigate our own vast areas in Kathua,” he said.","India is preparing to stop surplus water from the ravi flowing into pakistan once the shahpur kandi dam on punjab-j&k border becomes operational.

'From 25 Years To 5’ Rajnath Singh Pushes DRDO With 5-Year Ultimatum On 5th And 6th Gen Engines

The significance of aero engines

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday urged Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) scientists to complete the indigenous aero-engine project within five years, instead of taking decades as is conventionally expected.Stressing India's strategic autonomy and the significance of mastering critical technologies at speed, the Union minister said that factoring in the nation's current circumstances and strategic requirements, the 25-year target must be compressed to five years.Rajnath Singh acknowledged the deadline as a challenge; however, he said it should not come ""as a shock or a surprise.""""If developing an engine takes 25 years, then given India’s current circumstances, our strategic requirements and our national ambitions, we must assume that 20 of those years are already gone and only five remain. This should not come as a shock or a surprise. It is a challenge. We have to achieve in these five years what other countries typically accomplish in twenty. And within that compressed timeframe, we must deliver our very best,"" said the defence minister.Rajnath Singh further said that India cannot remain limited to fifth-generation engines and must begin work on sixth-generation and advanced technologies immediately.The increasing global use of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and advanced materials in defence systems, he said, requires India to stay ahead of the curve.Speaking at the Gas Turbine Research Establishment in Bengaluru, Rajnath Singh said the establishment, functioning under the DRDO, has become ""the foundation of India's strategic capability,"" crediting its scientists for consistently delivering successful tests and strengthening the country's defence preparedness.The minister reiterated that self-reliance in critical defence technologies was no longer an option amid rapidly evolving geopolitical realities.""When we came to power, we took steps towards self-reliance. In the defence sector too, we made several efforts to promote self-reliance. As defence minister, during my nearly 7-year tenure, I made every effort to prioritise the development of the Aero engine, and we did so,"" he said.""Looking at today's global political situation, I don't think there's any need to explain how crucial self-reliance is in such critical technology. The world's geopolitical scenario is changing very rapidly. Supply chains are breaking, and new ecosystems are developing. In such a situation, only the country that has its own technology will remain safe, secure, and able to sustain itself,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.""We are passing through that historical phase when the eyes of the entire world are on India. All countries want to be a part of India's this growth story. All countries want to partner in our 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative. In such a situation, we have a lot of options, a lot of opportunities. We have to take full advantage of these opportunities and further strengthen our technological capabilities,"" he further stated.An aero engine in defence refers to the propulsion system that powers military aircraft such as fighter jets, transport planes, helicopters and certain unmanned aerial vehicles.In the case of combat aircraft, it is typically a high-performance turbofan engine that generates the thrust required for supersonic speed, rapid climb, manoeuvrability and sustained operations in demanding conditions. It also supports critical functions such as afterburner performance, payload capacity and combat range. In simple terms, the engine determines how fast, how far and how effectively a military aircraft can operate.Its significance lies in strategic autonomy. Aero engines are among the most complex and tightly controlled defence technologies in the world, mastered by only a handful of countries. If a nation depends on foreign suppliers for engines, it remains vulnerable to supply restrictions, upgrade limitations and export constraints.For India, developing an indigenous aero engine is crucial not just for powering current platforms like Tejas but also for future projects such as next-generation fighter aircraft. Mastery of this technology strengthens national security, reduces long-term dependence and places the country in an elite technological league globally.",Defence minister rajnath singh urges drdo to complete indigenous aero-engine project within five years.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy is gearing up to mark a defining moment in India's maritime story as Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25, placing the 'City of Destiny' once again at the heart of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.“The current edition of IFR and MILAN exercise will be larger in scope and deeper in meaning as navies of 72 countries, including US and Russia, will participate and the mega joint naval events will feature over 60 warships and naval aircraft of three countries,” said a Navy source. The IFR will position India’s eastern seaboard as a focal point for naval diplomacy and multilateral maritime engagement. Warships and assets from Germany, Philippines, and UAE are participating for the first time, including the Philippines' ‘BRP Miguel Malvar’ (FFG-06) and a UAE Navy warship, Al Emarat. Since 2001, India has used IFRs and opened its ports to allied navies to project maritime strength, foster international cooperation, and establish its role in blue water operations.The star of Operation Sindoor’s naval leg, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, is all set to be the centre of attraction at the fleet review. The Vikrant carrier battle group deployed in the northern Arabian Sea, played a key role in the strategy of compellence, thereby forcing the Pakistan Navy to be in a defensive posture and requesting an urgent ceasefire.For the IFR, it will sail to the Bay of Bengal. China and Turkey have not been invited for the event and the decision is reportedly linked to their military support to Pakistan during last year’s conflict in May.President Droupadi Murmu, Governor S Abdul Nazeer and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu will attend the IFR on Feb 18, while defence minister Rajnath Singh will participate in Milan-2026 on Feb 19.MILAN 26 will bring together navies from friendly foreign countries to strengthen professional bonds, share best practices and enhance cooperation at sea. Milan’s sea and harbour phases will focus on interoperability, maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, air defence, and search-and-rescue operations.Significantly, the IFR will coincide with the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium's conclave of chiefs, showcasing India's convening power in a contested region. Beyond the warships at sea, the International City Parade will carry naval camaraderie into the streets, while a high-level maritime seminar will sharpen the intellectual edge of the gathering. These events promise to elevate IFR and MILAN 2026 beyond ritual, transforming them into platforms for strategic dialogue, operational trust and enduring people-to-people engagement.Technology will feature prominently at IFR 2026, but with a clear lesson: technology amplifies capacity, but governance shapes effects. Drones, autonomous surface and subsurface vehicles, and AI-enabled maritime domain awareness tools can multiply the reach of a modest fleet.The fleet review is a time-honoured naval tradition that assembles ships and sailors from friendly foreign navies, serving as a platform for confidence-building, mutual respect, and operational familiarity.end","Visakhapatnam will host both the international fleet review (ifr) and exercise milan from feb 15 to 25.

'Tremendous Alliance': Netanyahu Highlights India's Love For Israel Ahead Of PM Modi's Visit

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday jabbed the Centre after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to Israel, saying India was learning about its own government’s decisions from foreign leaders.PM Modi is set to travel to Israel on a two-day visit from February 25 to 26, news agency PTI repeorted citing sources. The visit was first mentioned by Netanyahu while addressing the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations on Sunday.Reacting to this, Congress general secretary (communications) Jairam Ramesh in a post on X wrote, “India hears of the halt to Operation Sindoor first from the US Secretary of State. India hears of the India-US trade deal first from the US President.”“Just now India has heard of Prime Minister Modi’s dates for his visit to Israel first from Mr. Netanyahu - who has reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and is now dispossessing and displacing more Palestinians in the occupied West Bank,” Ramesh added.The Congress remarks also referred to the recently concluded interim India-US trade agreement, which was first announced by US President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform earlier this month.The party alleged that key diplomatic and trade decisions were being communicated abroad before being formally shared in India.“Parliament address on the anvil. Who’s coming here next week? Narendra Modi,” Netanyahu said at the gathering, highlighting what he described as a “tremendous alliance” between India and Israel.Meanwhile, a source in Jerusalem told PTI that PM Modi’s visit is “likely to be short from February 25 to 26”, but added that “its impact is deep given the popularity PM Modi enjoys not only in Israel but around the world”.The programme for the visit is still being worked out. However, PM Modi is expected to address the Israeli Knesset during his stay and discuss bilateral and regional issues. This will be his second visit to Israel, after his landmark trip in July 2017, the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to the Jewish state.Netanyahu, speaking about the upcoming visit, described India as “enormously powerful” and “enormously popular” and said both sides would discuss expanding cooperation.India has consistently supported a “two-state solution” to the Israel-Gaza conflict, while also maintaining a strategic partnership with Israel.Last year, PM Modi and Netanyahu held a telephonic conversation and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.PM Modi had then said, “Spoke with my friend Prime Minister Netanyahu. We reviewed progress in the India-Israel Strategic Partnership and agreed to further strengthen our cooperation. Also reaffirmed our shared commitment to zero tolerance for terrorism. India supports all efforts aimed at achieving a just and durable peace in the region.”Netanyahu’s own visit to India has been on hold since 2023 following the October 7 Hamas attacks, which disrupted planned engagements.","Pm modi is set to travel to israel on a two-day visit from february 25 to 26.

NEW DELHI: At a time when climate change is increasingly reshaping public health risks across the globe, Indian media, including TOI, has quietly carved out a leadership role in linking the two, reports Jahnavi.A new study published in The Lancet Planetary Health has found that Indian news outlets are emerging as global frontrunners in climate-health journalism, surpassing coverage trends in both the US and China. According to the research, Indian outlets - including TOI - recorded the highest proportion of substantive climate-health coverage at 46.4%, compared to 31.3% in the US and 17% in China.The study, titled 'The evolution of news coverage about climate change as a health issue: a decadal analysis in China, India and the USA', examined legacy media coverage across the three countries between 2012 and 2023. Researchers conducted a manual content analysis of articles from five mainstream newspapers and one news agency per country, sourced through archival databases. In India, TOI was among the five newspapers included in the sample.Climate-health journalism was defined as news content that substantively connects climate change to human health outcomes or health-related actions.The study noted that Indian media consistently performed better in covering issues that directly affect everyday life like heat, food security, air quality, and extreme weather.","A new study has found that indian news outlets are emerging as global frontrunners in climate-health journalism.

NEW DELHI: AI could either amplify India's demographic advantage or weaken it, depending on the choices made now, chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said on Monday, calling for coordinated national action.Speaking virtually at AI Impact Summit during a session on 'Employability in the AI age', Nageswaran said technological adoption must be deliberately aligned with mass employability rather than allowed to evolve on its own.""This will not happen by drift,"" he said. ""It will require political will, state capacity, and national commitment to aligning technological adoption with mass employability.""Framing AI as a pivotal moment in India's growth journey, he argued that the outcome would be shaped by execution. ""India can be the first large society where human abundance and machine intelligence reinforce, and not undermine, each other.

As the country gears up to host the mega International Fleet Review (IFR) and subsequent MILAN Exercise, the Indian Navy has created a MILAN village in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam for the incoming delegates and naval personnel from over 70 countries.

It will feature a variety of stalls with naval souvenirs and handicraft and handloom products. Together, they will showcase craftsmanship from across the country. Visitors will also be treated to mouth-watering Indian cuisine, offering a diverse range of regional flavours and tastes of India.The flag officer commanding-in-chief, Eastern Naval Command, Vice Admiral Sanjay Bhalla, said, “MILAN village reflects the spirit of camaraderie and cultural connect that complements professional naval engagement. As Visakhapatnam hosts IFR, MILAN and IONS in close succession, this convergence represents a significant moment in India’s maritime outreach and cooperative engagement with partner navies.Meanwhile, the Indian Navy welcomed naval ships from Thailand, Australia and Sri Lanka on Sunday.Exercise MILAN 2026, to be held at Visakhapatnam from Feb 15 to 25, will form a key pillar of India’s historic maritime convergence alongside IFR 2026 and the IONS Conclave of Chiefs. As one of the largest multilateral naval exercises in the Indo-Pacific, MILAN 2026 will bring together navies from across the globe to strengthen interoperability, maritime domain awareness and collective response capabilities.The harbour and sea phases of the exercise will focus on complex maritime operations, including anti-submarine warfare, air defence, search and rescue, and cooperative security missions, reinforcing a shared commitment to free, open, inclusive and rules-based seas.MILAN 2026 represents a major operational manifestation of PM's MAHASAGAR vision, reaffirming India's role as a preferred security partner and a responsible stakeholder in the global maritime commons.","The indian navy has created a milan village in the coastal city of visakhapatnam for incoming delegates and naval personnel.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Akhilesh Prasad Singh made a stark remark against Om Birla 's Bangladesh visit calling it a reward from the Centre for not letting the Leader of Opposition, Rahul Gandhi , speak in the Lok Sabha. Om Birla will be visiting Dhaka for the swearing-in ceremony of Bangladesh PM-elect Tarique Rahman.Speaking to ANI, Singh said, ""Om Birla must have been rewarded by the government for not allowing the LoP to speak in the Lok Sabha. At the same time, now that a new government has been formed (in Bangladesh), the Indian government should go there and strongly raise the issue of the atrocities being committed against minority Hindus and end the tension there.""The Congress leader also endorsed remarks made earlier by Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge, who questioned the legal and financial status of the RSS . Kharge had described the BJP as a “devil’s shadow” and raised concerns about the RSS’s registration, funding sources and tax compliance.""His question is valid because the RSS hasn't been registered for a long time. Regarding the money issue, it's true that when electoral bonds were introduced, there was some kind of fraud. It evolved a certain party in such a way that a level playing field no longer existed,"" he said.Earlier, Priyank Kharge asked why the RSS had not registered itself despite operating extensively in India and abroad.""They're unregistered. They don't want to register. All I'm asking is to follow the law of the land.If you're an individual, that does not mean that you should not be registered. Which law says that? You should be registered. I'm asking how you're getting the donations? Where are you getting the donations from? Who is donating? How come you're running such large operations domestically and internationally, and you're still not paying taxes?"" he said.Citing media reports, Kharge claimed that over 2,500 organisations were responsible for funding the RSS and called for greater transparency. “This is a question the government should be asking,” he said.He also referred to statements by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat about the organisation functioning on “Guru Dakshina”, traditionally offered to a guru. Kharge questioned whether collecting funds in the name of the RSS’s symbolic saffron flag — which the organisation considers its “guru” — exempted it from financial scrutiny. Drawing a comparison with religious institutions, he argued that even temple donations are subject to audits and asked whether the RSS considered itself “above the law. ”Kharge further cited Bhagwat’s past remarks linking the BJP’s political success to the RSS’s support, reiterating his claim that the BJP functioned as the “shadow” of the RSS.","Om birla will be visiting dhaka for the swearing-in ceremony of bangladesh pm-elect tarique rahman.

NEW DELHI: Mani Shankar Aiyar on Monday invoked BR Ambedkar after Congress distanced itself from the former Union minister’s praise of the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government in Kerala ahead of the assembly polls.Speaking to news agency ANI, Aiyar took a sharp jibe at Rahul Gandhi , saying he is a Gandhian but not a “Rahulian.”Citing Ambedkar’s biography ""A Part Apart"", Aiyar said, “There is a biography of Dr Ambedkar which says ‘a part but apart.’ So that’s the only thing I can say. Mr Rahul Gandhi has forgotten that I am a member of the party, and therefore I am a Gandhian, I am a Nehruvian, I am a Rajivian, but I am not a Rahulian.”“I am in the Congress party , I haven’t left it. If Pawan Khera is going to expel me, I will happily go outside and kick his backside after I have left,” he added.Aiyar also said that he has ""no respect complete contempt for"" Pawan Khera.""Do you think the people of Kerala don't know what is happening in Congress leadership? At least in Pinarayi's government there is discipline. They have no Mani Shankar Aiyars. I am Mani Shankar Aiyar because Nehru was a rebel against Gandhi, Subhash Bose was a rebel against Gandhi. Yet Gandhi made Jawaharlal Nehru the PM of India. If Subhas Bose had survived the aircrash on 17th August 1945, I am certain he would have been the President of India.So, that is how they dealt with dissidence. How does the present Congress deal with it? They put somebody like Pawan Khera as the official spokesman. I have absolutely no respect and complete contempt for Pawan Khera,"" Mani Shankar Aiyar said.He also described Pawan Khera as a ""puppet"" who just repeats what party MP Jairam Ramesh tells him. He stated that Khera is not a spokesperson but a ""parrot.""""I want you to send a message to Pawan Khera. He has allied with MA Baby in Delhi and he is getting upset about my being allied with Pinarayi Vijayan here. What kind of Congressi is he? Above all, how stupid can a party be than to make Pawan Khera the spokesman? There are a million people in Congress who would make a better spokesman. This chap is just a puppet, he is saying whatever Jairam Ramesh tells him. He repeats the same thing, he is not a spokesman, he is a parrot,"" Aiyar said.Aiyar also slammed Congress general secretary KC Venugopal and said, ""Can you imagine what is the condition of a party which raises a rowdy like KC Venugopal to the level of Sardar Patel, to Rahul Gandhi? That is all I need to say as an answer.""Earlier on Sunday, Aiyar stoked fresh controversy after lauding Vijayan and expressing hope for the return of the Left government in the upcoming assembly elections.Speaking at an international seminar titled “Vision 2031: Development and Democracy,” Aiyar asked Vijayan to “pick up the baton that the Congress has dropped.”“I do not know whether this is a compliment or an insult, but I deeply regret the absence of my party colleagues on this occasion, which is a state occasion and therefore a national occasion. While Kerala is the first state in panchayati raj in practice, it ranks only second in law,” Aiyar said.“So, in the presence of the chief minister, who I am confident will continue in office, I renew my plea — to reinforce Kerala as the best panchayati raj state in the country. Therefore, I must fall at your feet, Chief Minister Vijayan, and request you to pick up the baton that the Congress has dropped. Thank you, and may Kerala prosper,” he added.Aiyar’s remarks did not sit well with the party. Congress national spokesperson Khera sought to distance the party from the comments, saying Aiyar has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years.In a post on X, Khera said Aiyar “speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity.”“Mr Mani Shankar Aiyar has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years. He speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity,” Khera said.Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh also rubbished Aiyar’s remarks, saying the United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to return to power in Kerala.“Let there be no doubt. The people of Kerala will bring the UDF back for more responsible and responsive governance. They also know the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are covert partners,” he said.","Mani shankar aiyar invoked br ambedkar after congress distanced itself from the former union minister’s praise of the pinarayi vijayan-led government in kerala ahead of the assembly polls.

However, there was never any question of the PM travelling as the date and even the time of the swearing-in was clashing with his bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Mumbai that was scheduled weeks in advance.The foreign ministry said Birla’s participation at this “important event” underscored the deep and enduring friendship between the peoples of India and Bangladesh, reaffirming India’s steadfast commitment to the democratic values that bind the two nations.“As neighbours united by a shared history, culture, and mutual respect, India welcomes Bangladesh’s transition to an elected govt under the leadership of Tarique Rahman, whose vision and values have received an overwhelming mandate of the people,” MEA said in a statement.Modi was among the first global leaders to congratulate Rahman on X on Friday morning, shortly after it became evident the BNP leader was going to form the new govt with absolute majority. Modi said the results reflected the trust that the Bangladesh people had in Rahman’s leadership. Later in the day, he also became the first foreign leader to speak to Rahman and offer cooperation with him in his efforts to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh.Importantly for India, BNP responded positively to Modi’s messages as it said Bangladesh remained committed to upholding democratic values, inclusivity, and progressive development for all its citizens.“We look forward to engaging constructively with India to advance our multifaceted relationship, guided by mutual respect, sensitivity to each other’s concerns, and a shared commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity in our region,” said the party.","Lok sabha speaker om birla will represent india at the swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected govt of bangladesh led by tarique rahman.
