CEASEFIRE: India Pakistan Stop Firing After 3 Days of Standoff | Operation Sindoor |

Here's what happened after the ceasefire

Just hours after the ceasefire agreement, J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah questioned the truce deal as Srinagar was jolted by loud explosions on Saturday evening. “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!! This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up,” Abdullah posted on X.

questioned the truce deal as Srinagar was jolted by loud explosions on Saturday evening. “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!! This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up,” Abdullah posted on X. Earlier, the US had taken credit for the ceasefire, as according to CNN, it had been told that it was Vice President JD Vance who finally called Prime Minister Modi ""at noon Eastern time on Friday"" to urge him to get India to talk directly to Pakistan ""to consider options available for de-escalation"". According to CNN, the officials said Vance first took the intelligence to Trump and then called PM Modi to tell him that the US believed that if hostilities continued over the weekend, there was ""a high probability of a dramatic escalation"".

Sirens blared and explosions echoed across India’s border states on Saturday evening as Pakistan once again launched drones into Indian airspace. Loud blasts were reported in Srinagar, while air raid sirens went off in Udhampur and other parts of the Jammu region.

Blackouts were enforced in several areas across Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Rajasthan as a precaution amid what marks another Pakistani drone intrusion in a series of nighttime provocations.

An alert sentry at Nagrota Military Station thwarted a possible intrusion with timely action, triggering a brief exchange of fire and sustaining minor injuries, the Army's White Knight Corps said. A search operation was also launched for the suspect.

Foreign secretary Vikram Misri held a press briefing after the ceasefire violation and said: "" For the last few hours, this understanding is being violated by Pakistan. The Indian Army is retaliating and dealing with this border intrusion. This intrusion is extremely condemnable and Pakistan is responsible for it. We believe that Pakistan should understand this situation properly and take appropriate action immediately to stop this intrusion.""

Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi had a phone conversation with Indian National Security Advisor Doval. As per Chinese foreign ministry, ""Doval said that the Pahalgam terrorist attack caused serious casualties among Indian personnel and that India needed to take counter-terrorism actions. War was not India's choice and was not in the interests of any party. India and Pakistan would be committed to a ceasefire and look forward to restoring regional peace and stability as soon as possible.""

as soon as possible."" External affairs minister Jaishankar said after the ceasefire that India and Pakistan had reached an understanding to stop ""firing and military action."" He further reiterated New Delhi's ""uncompromising stance"" against terrorism in all its forms.

After the ceasefire violation, the government gave the Indian armed forces instructions to deal strongly with any instances of repetition of the violations along the LoC and international border.

Amritsar was placed under a red alert early Sunday morning following heightened security concerns, with district authorities urging residents to remain indoors. The situation in Jammu city remained normal on Sunday, a day after intense shelling from Pakistan. No drones, firing and shelling were reported during the intervening night of May 10-11. The situation was also normal in Poonch area after no drones, firing and shelling were reported during the night.

India's BIG ULTIMATUM As Pakistan Army Violates Ceasefire; Vows 'Strong Response' | FULL

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan agreed to an immediate ceasefire on Saturday, following a sharp escalation in cross-border tensions triggered by the deadly April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir 's Pahalgam.The breakthrough came after what the US President Donald Trump called ""intense diplomatic engagement"" over the past two days.The tension began when Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 civilians in Pahalgam.In retaliation, India launched ' Operation Sindoor ' on May 7, carrying out precision strikes on nine terror launchpads located in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK).Pakistan responded with drone attacks targeting areas in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. These attacks were intercepted by Indian defence systems but raised fears of a broader conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Amid growing concern, the United States played a key role in de-escalating the situation. US secretary of state Marco Rubio said he and Vice President JD Vance held discussions with senior officials from both countries. Rubio also commended PM Modi and Pakistan for choosing dialogue over confrontation.However, just a few hours after the ceasefire declaration, violation was witnessed by Pakistan in Srinagar and other border areas.Before the ceasefire was announced, India, in a drastic revision of its security doctrine, Saturday declared that it would from now on consider every instance of terrorism directed against it as an ""act of war"" and would respond accordingly.Sources explained that the decision considerably lowers the threshold for India to give full-scale military response to attacks orchestrated from across the border. Although India responded militarily to terrorist attacks in Uri in 2016, Pulwama in 2019 and, most recently, Pahalgam by exercising the military option, the decision on Saturday bakes the new security posture into a doctrine.",J&k chief minister omar abdullah questioned the truce deal as srinagar was jolted by loud explosions on saturday evening.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121071143,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-100886,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
'India saw 9.3% excess deaths during first 2 Covid years': Government sources,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-saw-9-3-excess-deaths-during-first-2-covid-years-government-sources/articleshow/121071073.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: India recorded 9.3% 'excess deaths' in 2020-21, the first two years of Covid-19 pandemic, government sources said on Saturday referring to the latest Civil Registration System (CRS) data.Excess deaths, which refer to additional deaths from any cause observed during these years, over and above the expected fatalities in the absence of pandemic, was much higher in other high- and middle-income countries, govt sources said.""US reported 17.6% more deaths than expected in 2020-21 while Italy and UK reported 11.8% excess deaths and Russia reported 29.9% such deaths. France, Germany and Canada reported 6.7%, 5.3% and 5.2% excess deaths. Among the middle-income countries, Mexico had 43.6% excess mortality while Brazil had 12.6% excess mortality,"" they added.In the past, reports of exorbitantly high excess deaths in India during 2020 and 2021, based on modelling methodology, have emerged in public domain. A WHO report estimated India's excess deaths at 47 lakh. Another report in a top journal cited a figure of about 41 lakh excess deaths in this period. Some experts also suggested that the excess deaths were essentially caused Covid-19 and that Indian govt played them down.Govt sources said excess deaths in these years are not equal to deaths caused due to Covid. It includes reported Covid deaths (4.81 lakh by the end of 2021), unreported Covid-19 deaths, deaths due to all other causes, and possible indirect effects of Covid-19, they said.Officials from health ministry said the number of deaths documented in CRS has been increasing over time, even in the years preceding Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. The annual increment observed each year, compared to the previous year, has varied from 1.3% in 2016 to 9.9% in 2019, with the average increase over three preceding years (2016 to 2019) estimated at 6.4% per annum. ""Our teams conducted preliminary analyses of CRS data to assess cumulative excess deaths in the years 2020 and 2021,"" said an official. He added that based on the three-year (2016-19) annual rate of increase of 6.4% mentioned above, the expected number of deaths would be 81,31,869 in 2020 and 86,54,185 in 2021. However, the observed deaths were 81,15,882 in 2020 and 1,02,24,506 in 2021.""The excess deaths, defined as observed minus expected deaths, were (-)15,987 and 15,70,321, respectively,"" said the official. ""Thus, the total excess deaths over the two-year period amounted to 15,54,334. As a percentage, this is 9.3% higher than the expected deaths. This translates into about 1,249 excess deaths per one million population,"" he added.",Excess deaths refer to additional deaths from any cause observed during these years.

NEW DELHI: It was shortly after 9am that India’s director general of military operations , Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai, got a call on the hotline from his Pakistani counterpart Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah.Abdullah sounded Ghai out on a ceasefire and, it is learned, referred to the conversation US secretary of state Marco Rubio had with Pakistan Army chief Gen Asim Munir, in a clear indication that the feelers were coming from his boss.Ghai briefed his bosses on the development but got no instruction from them to engage with Abdullah.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri made no mention of the contact made by Pakistan in the media briefing he held at 10.50am, where he disclosed the losses that IAF had inflicted on Pakistan’s airbases. IAF had stepped up attacks by the time Rubio called foreign minister S Jaishankar around 11am.In fact, IAF kept pressing on the escalation pedal after the conversation with Jaishankar where the latter, going by his post on X, appears to have maintained that ""India's approach has always been measured and responsible and remains so"".If Rubio had insisted on immediate de-escalation, his pitch certainly did not have much resonance at the meeting PM Modi held with defence minister Rajnath Singh, NSA A K Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Anil Chauhan and the three service chiefs - Gen Upendra Dwivedi, Adm Dinesh Tripathi and Air Chief Marshal AP Singh - and chiefs of IB and RAW, Tapan Deka and Ravi Sinha.Sources said the participants were unanimous on consolidating the upper hand that India had - something that was acknowledged also by Pakistan when it reached out for ceasing hostilities.The meeting also took into account the advantages India would have had going forward: high morale of forces, adequate firepower, comfortable fiscal situation, international sympathy and the ace in the form of 'blue water' Indian Navy.No wonder, when India and Pakistan reached an understanding just a couple of hours later, it came as a surprise to many who scrambled to find clues to the sudden turn.CNN cited defence sources to say it was US vice-president J D Vance's call to Modi on Friday where he shared US intelligence about Pakistan's plans for a dangerous escalation: perhaps shorthand for use of nukes, which made India relent.But that also seemed to be an inadequate explanation. For one, Pakistan has always talked brazenly about its willingness to use its nukes. For another, India had steadily moved higher on the escalation ladder for the full 24 hours after Vance's purported counsel. In fact, it had on Saturday mocked Pakistan when it called a meeting of the National Command Authority, the body which deals with its nuclear arsenal, only to call it off.The absence of any response on the pause in hostilities from Modi, home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, even BJP, only deepened the puzzle.",Pakistan sounded out india’s director general of military operations lt gen rajiv ghai.

War was not India's choice and was not in the interests of any party. India and Pakistan would be committed to a ceasefire and look forward to restoring regional peace and stability as soon as possible,"" Chinese foreign ministry quoted NSA Doval.During the call, Wang Yi expressed China’s strong condemnation of the attack and stressed the importance of regional stability.According to the Chinese foreign ministry, Wang Yi told NSA Doval that both India and Pakistan are China’s neighbours and that peace in the region is “hard-won and deserves to be cherished.”He urged both sides to remain calm, exercise restraint, and resolve differences through dialogue and consultation. Wang added that China supports a “comprehensive and lasting ceasefire” between India and Pakistan and called it a goal in line with the fundamental interests of both nations and the broader international community.Doval, according to Chinese statements, conveyed India’s deep concern over the Pahalgam attack, which resulted in serious casualties.He reiterated India’s focus on counter-terror efforts and the country’s commitment to ceasefire and de-escalation, despite Pakistan’s repeated provocations.India had launched a major counterterrorism operation, ‘ Operation Sindoor ’, on May 7 targeting 9 terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, with precision strikes.In response, Pakistan has repeatedly used drones against Indian border states, which have so far been intercepted and neutralised by Indian air defence systems.","National security advisor ajit doval spoke with chinese foreign minister wang yi.

NEW DELHI: Srinagar was jolted by loud explosions on Saturday evening, just hours after India and Pakistan formally agreed to a ceasefire.

Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!” Abdullah posted on X (formerly Twitter), expressing concern over the violation of the agreement.""This is no ceasefire.

Foreign secretary Vikram Misri confirmed that the ceasefire, effective from 5:00 pm IST, covers all military activity — on land, sea, and air. A follow-up meeting between DGMOs is scheduled for May 12.However, the explosions reported in Srinagar cast a shadow over the agreement’s implementation.

""The armed forces are maintaining a strong vigil on the situation. They have been given instructions to deal strongly with any instances of repetition of the violations of the border along the International Border as well as the LoC,"" said Misri.Earlier in the day, against the run of the play, the conflagration seemed to have come to a quick and abrupt end after the top military officials spoke around 3.35pm, and as Misri announced, agreed both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, in the air and sea from 5pm IST Saturday.""Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to the understanding,"" said Misri, adding that the DGMOs will talk again on May 12 at 1200 hours.

This came even as the opposition party has offered its support to the government in its efforts against terrorism after the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people on April 22.""At a time when the nation stands united as Indians, this petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable. Our government has learned the futility of past approaches the hard way -- after inviting Pakistan to participate in the investigation of the Pathankot blasts in 2016. It is only then that it took to the path of military action, carefully calibrated and maturely conducted. This advertisement is neither appropriate nor mature. Delete it, please, @BJP4India,"" Tharoor said in a post on X. BJP posted a video on X criticising the UPA regime for its ""passivity"" and calling it out on its ""futile peace talks"" with Pakistan.""The message to the enemies is loud and clear. Don't mess with us! Unlike the UPA regime’s passivity, New India has no patience for futile peace talks,"" it said.Tharoor's reaction comes at a time when his appreciation for the Modi-government in certain foreign policies made headlines fueling rumours of rift with the grand old party. BJP leader Amit Malviya even took a jibe at him calling him PM Modi's fan after he sided with the current government's stance on Russia-Ukraine policy. ""Prime Minister Modi needs new haters… Old ones are turning into his fans,"" Malviya had said.Additionally, his presence at Vizhinjam port inauguration and sharing stage with PM Modi gained attention after the prime minister said that the event would give ""sleepless nights to several people"" taking a jibe at INDIA bloc.However, BJP leader CR Kesavan criticised Congress saying, ""We salute the exemplary courage and unparalleled commitment of our brave armed forces in decisively defeating the cowardly attacks of Pakistan on Bharat and our civilians...But unfortunately, the poisonous political propaganda of the Congress Party and their noxious fake narratives have now been weaponised by the enemy state of Pakistan...After Operation Sindoor commenced, Udit Raj of the Congress Party gave the name Operation Sindoor a communal colour. So the Congress Party is failing the nation again and again. It's high time they stop politicising the army and stop their fake factory of false narratives...""Meanwhile, India and Pakistan have agreed to stop the military action against each other with the former categorically maintaining ""a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations"".""India and Pakistan have today worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action.

NEW DELHI: Before the pause in hostilities on Saturday evening, cross-border combat had rapidly moved up the escalation ladder with India strongly striking back at Pakistan by targeting nine airbases and two radar sites to inflict heavy damage in the early hours of the day.The operational situation seemed to be flaring up once again barely two hours after the cessation of hostilities at 5pm, with multiple ceasefire violations by Pakistan and air intrusions by its drones being reported from all along the western front.Senior officers, however, stressed that ""all major military actions"" have stopped from either side, though it may take some time for things to settle down on the ground amid the surcharged tensions between the rival forces.""As decided, Indian DGMO Lt-General Rajiv Ghai will talk to his Pakistani counterpart Major General Kashif Abdullah on Monday to work out the nuts and bolts of the truce,"" a senior officer said.The exchange of fire and shelling along the 778-km Line of Control petered out later in the night after taking place at multiple locations like Akhnoor, Nowshera, Poonch, Rajouri, Jammu, RS Pura, Arnia and Kathua in the evening.Some of the drones spotted at different locations in J&K, Rajasthan and Gujarat were taken down, while the rest flew back. ""There is no firing happening along the LoC now,"" an officer said.In the early hours of Saturday, India's swift and calibrated precision attacks came after Pakistan deployed fighters like F-16s and JF-17s, high-speed missiles like Fatah, armed drones and loitering munitions against Indian military bases at over 26 locations under its Operation Bunyan al-Marsoos (Iron Wall).With Pakistan firing several missiles at different airbases, India accepted it sustained ""limited damage to equipment and personnel"" at IAF bases in Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj. Pakistan, however, has suffered ""very heavy and unsustainable losses"" after Operation Sindoor was launched in the early hours of May 7.India's hit-back was particularly severe. Long-range weapons fired by IAF fighters caused extensive damage to crucial Pakistani airbases like Skardu, Jacobabad, Bholari and Rahim Yar Khan, with deep craters being formed on their runways.The other airbases to be targeted were Rafiqui, Murid, Nur Khan-Chaklala, Sukkur and Chunian as well as radar sites at the Pasrur and Sialkot aviation bases. The weapons used included BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Crystal Maze-2 missiles, Scalp air-to-ground cruise missiles, Hammer air-to-ground precision-guided munitions and Spice-2000 precision-guided bombs.""In addition, the loss of air defence weapon systems and radars made the defence of Pakistani airspace untenable,"" Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said. Colonel Sofia Qureshi, in turn, said there was also ""extensive and precise damage"" to military infrastructure, command control centres, and logistical installations across the LoC.The officials did not take questions about how many fighters India had lost during the high-tempo Operation Sindoor, nor were the number of casualties given.They, however, warned Pakistan to cease and desist. ""Every misadventure by Pakistan has been met with strength. Every future escalation will invite a decisive response. We remain fully operationally, ready to launch whatever may be required in the nation's defence,"" Commodore Raghu R Nair said, after the truce was announced.The military officers also slammed Pakistan for a ""malicious misinformation campaign"" with ""totally false"" claims of destruction of an Indian S-400 air defence system in Adampur, the BrahMos missile base in Nagrota and the Suratgarh and Sirsa airfields, among others.""Pakistan also made false allegations that the Indian Army had damaged mosques.

NEW DELHI: Sirens blared and explosions echoed across India’s border states on Saturday evening as Pakistan once again launched drones into Indian airspace , just hours after both countries agreed to a ceasefire.Loud blasts were reported in Srinagar, while air raid sirens went off in Udhampur and other parts of the Jammu region.Blackouts were enforced in several areas across Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Rajasthan as a precaution amid what marks another Pakistani drone intrusion in a series of night-time provocations.What makes this attack particularly significant is that it came just after Pakistan itself reached out to India earlier in the day, proposing a full ceasefire across land, air, and sea-a move later confirmed by ministry of external affairs. US President Donald Trump also announced the development on his Truth Social, said: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.”Despite the ceasefire agreement , India continues to deal with persistent drone attacks from Pakistan. However, most of these threats have been neutralised by India’s air defence systems.The tension is constantly escalating as India’s strong retaliatory strike—‘ Operation Sindoor ’—launched on May 7, targeting terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.This operation was a direct response to the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, in which 26 people, mostly tourists, lost their lives in a Pakistan-backed assault.","Loud blasts were reported in srinagar, while air raid sirens went off in udhampur and other parts of the jammu region.

What is 'act of war'

NEW DELHI: In a significant toughening of its counter-terrorism doctrine, the government on Saturday declared that any future ""act of terror"" on its soil will be treated as an ""act of war"" and will be responded to accordingly.A top government official said, “Any future act of terror in India will be considered an act of war against the country and will be responded to accordingly.” The statement marks a formal shift in India’s rules of engagement, drawing a clear red line for Pakistan-based terror groups.Under international law, an “act of war” implies a hostile action by one state that could justify retaliatory use of force. India’s new stance signals a readiness to invoke self-defence provisions under Article 51 of the UN Charter.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting nine terror camps inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Pakistan retaliated with artillery shelling and drone attacks, which India claimed caused no significant damage.Indian Army Colonel Sofiya Qureshi dismissed Islamabad’s claims of damage to Indian military installations, calling them “completely wrong” and part of a “coordinated misinformation campaign.” Wing Commander Vyomika Singh affirmed that Indian strikes targeted only terrorist infrastructure, not civilian or religious sites.Meanwhile, Commodore Raghu R Nair confirmed that India’s armed forces have been instructed to comply with a ceasefire understanding reached with Pakistan. The ceasefire, effective from 5:00 pm IST on Saturday, was announced after the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) of both nations held a phone conversation.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri revealed that further DGMO-level talks are scheduled for May 12 to ensure compliance. External affairs minister S Jaishankar reaffirmed India’s zero-tolerance policy on terrorism, while Pakistan’s Deputy PM Ishaq Dar said Islamabad remained committed to peace without compromising on sovereignty.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that both countries had agreed to begin dialogue at a neutral location, following intense diplomatic engagement with Indian and Pakistani leadership over the past 48 hours.","The statement marks a formal shift in india’s rules of engagement, drawing a clear red line for pakistan-based terror groups.

NEW DELHI: While US President Donald Trump, the first to announce the development, said both India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"", secretary of state Marco Rubio went a step further and claimed the countries had consented to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site. This was immediately denied by Indian govt sources who, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there's no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place.They also said the ""stoppage of firing and military action"" between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries. India has never accepted mediation in ties with Islamabad and has also refused to have any bilateral engagement with India for almost a decade because of Pakistan's support to cross-border terrorism.Officials here said India had already achieved its goal of taking out high-value terrorist infrastructure and had also retaliated with full force against Pakistan's escalation, as evident from the heavy damages inflicted on Pakistan's military facilities. Govt sources also said India will not roll back the measures it announced against Pakistan on April 23, a day after the Pahalgam attack, including its decision to keep the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.According to Rubio, he and vice-president JD Vance engaged with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including PMs Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, and national security advisers Ajit Doval and Asim Malik. ""We commend Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace,"" he said.Earlier in the day, in the first major US action to avert a full-blown war between India and Pakistan, Rubio had called Munir, the architect of a major escalation by Pakistan Friday night, and asked him to work for de-escalation. For the first time, Rubio also offered US support for direct talks between the two sides to end the spiralling conflict, while asking them to find ways to step back.Rubio followed it up with phone calls to foreign minister Jaishankar and his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar, repeating the same offer from the US of facilitating ""productive discussions"" to prevent conflicts. Jaishankar told Rubio, as he later said in a post on X, India's approach has been measured and responsible and remains so. Rubio stressed in his talks with Jaishankar that both sides need to identify methods to de-escalate and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation.""He further proposed US support in facilitating productive discussions to avert future disputes,"" said the US readout. This was the first such offer of mediation by the US to defuse tensions, and followed comments by Vance that the US will not get involved in a war that is fundamentally none of its business.Rubio's intervention suggests that the US' patience is wearing thin after Friday night's escalation that resulted from the Pakistan army aggression and the possibility of an all-out war between India and Pakistan, the kind of which has not been seen since both became nuclear-weapon states in 1998. His calls followed remarks by the White House that Trump has good relations with both countries and wants to see de-escalation as quickly as possible.","Us president donald trump said both india and pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" secretary of state marco rubio went a step further and claimed the countries had consented to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121068371,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-549181,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India's Operation Sindoor, conducted on the night of May 6 and 7, resulted in the elimination of around a dozen high-value terrorists in Pakistan, including IC-814 hijacker Yusuf Azhar , chief of Lashkar's Muridke headquarters Abu Jundal aka Mudassar, and the son of the 2016 Nagrota attack plotter.Sources termed the deaths of the jihadi commanders as a severe setback to Pakistan's military-terror nexus, adding that fresh estimates show that at least 130-140 terrrorists were killed in the strikes India launched to avenge Pahalgam killings.The precision strikes also exposed the thin veil that had been long placed between the Pakistani govt and its terror proxies with the funerals of jihadi A-listers being attended by the military-political establishment.Mudassar, the head of LeT's headquarters at Muridike and one of the most notorious figures among the killed, received a guard of honour by Pakistan army at his funeral.Indian intelligence has gathered video evidence, which prove that a wreath was laid on behalf of Pak army chief Asim Munir and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz. ""His funeral prayer was held in a govt school. A serving Lt General of Pakistan army and IG of Punjab Police attended the prayer,"" a senior intelligence officer said.Another high-value target was Yusuf Azhar, who went by the alias of Ustad and was a wanted man with an Interpol Red Notice. He was a brother-in-law of Maulana Masood Azhar, who had covertly entered India using a fake passport arranged by his handler Abdul Latif, prior to the 1998 Kandahar hijacking.India had formally requested Pakistan to take action against him, listing him as a wanted terrorist in 2002. However, he had continued to operate from Jaish-e-Mohammed 's Markaz Subhan Allah at Bahawalpur, which was destroyed in the strikes. Masood Azhar's eldest brother-in-law Hafiz Muhammed Jameel was also killed in the strikes, sources confirmed. He was in charge of the Markaz at Bahawalpur.The other high-value target was Abu Akasha alias Khalid, affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba . He was involved in multiple terrorist attacks in J&K and was engaged in weapons smuggling from Afghanistan, sources said. ""His funeral was held in Faisalabad and attended by senior Pakistani army officials and deputy commissioner of Faisalabad,"" said a senior officer.The Indian surgical strike also resulted in the elimination of Jaish's Mohammad Hassan Khan, son of Mufti Asghar Khan Kashmiri, operational commander of JeM in POK. He played a key role in coordinating terrorist attacks in J&K, including the Nagrota attack.""This time, the message was loud and clear: India knows where to find the perpetrators of heinous attacks, from Parliament in 2001 to the Pahalgam attack. The carefully drawn list of targets effectively communicated that India can strike at will, settling a two-decade-old score,"" the officer added.The biggest outcome of Operation Sindoor was the destruction of Muridke and Bahawalpur - terror sanctuaries that thrived for decades.Markaz Subhan Allah, JeM's primary hub for training and indoctrination of jihadis, was spread across 15 acres. It was here that Maulana Masood Azhar had resurfaced on Nov 30, 2024, addressing cadres for the first time in two years. His speech reiterated anti-India rhetoric, vowing revenge for construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.Over a dozen major terror strikes, including the 2019 Pulwama attack, were planned here. The perpetrators of the Pulwama attack had even trained at this facility, which was home to over 600 cadres and hosted regular training sessions for JeM members.India had dealt the first major blow to the Pak-sponsored terror factories in 2019 by bombing terror camps at Balakot, regarded as the 'first launchpad for jihad'.",India's operation sindoor resulted in the elimination of around a dozen high-value terrorists in pakistan.

Srinagar: While India and Pakistan agreed to a pause in firing and military action, with no mention of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) which India has put in abeyance, two gates of the Baglihar dam were thrown open on Saturday, causing Chenab River to swell.Sources said two gates of the dam remained open from around 8.30am till 4.30pm. The gates were opened to regulate rising water levels triggered by heavy rainfall in the region on Friday.The IWT gives India exclusive rights to use the waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - and their tributaries, before they enter Pakistan, while the latter secured rights over the waters of the western rivers - Chenab, Jhelum and Indus.Following the Pahalgam terror attack, India put the treaty in abeyance.On May 3, National Conference president and former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir , Farooq Abdullah , said his party had consistently opposed the IWT as it was harming the interests of J&K, and asserted that it was time to divert Chenab water to Jammu and harness power from the Jhelum in Kashmir. ""We have been saying for a long time that this treaty has to be reviewed,"" he added.NC has maintained that the IWT gave away the rights over the rivers to Pakistan without consulting J&K, and the treaty should be re-looked.In March 2003, J&K legislative council had adopted a resolution moved by NC, then in opposition, asking the Union govt to review the IWT with a view to safeguarding the interests of the UT (then a state). In 2011, Omar Abdullah, as the then CM, had asked compensation from the central govt on account of losses incurred by the State due to the IWT. In 2010, J&K government had accorded sanction to engage a consultant to quantify the losses suffered by J&K because of the treaty.","Two gates at the baglihar hydroelectric power project dam built on the chenab river were opened.
