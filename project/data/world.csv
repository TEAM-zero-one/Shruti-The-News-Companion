Justice Trivedi's career recap

Boycott of judge’s farewell not in good taste, says CJI

NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai on Friday disapproved of the decision of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the SC Advocates-on-Record Association to boycott the courtroom farewell for Justice Bela M Trivedi , the tenth woman judge in the 75-year history of the court.The boycott stemmed from a split decision of an SC bench on punishment to an AoR who had reportedly suppressed material and attempted to mislead the court in a criminal case. While Justice Trivedi had ordered the AoR’s name to be struck off the rolls for a month, her colleague Satish C Sharma had let him off with a warning.During the farewell in the CJI’s courtroom, many advocates, especially women, complimented Justice Bela M Trivedi for a sterling career that exemplified integrity, hard work and protection of institutional dignity.She had joined Ahmedabad City civil court as an additional district and sessions judge in 1995, when her father, too, was a judge in that court. She became an high court judge in 2011 and was appointed as a judge of Supreme Court in Aug 2021.CJI B R Gavai said though Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Kapil Sibal was present, the boycott of farewell of a judge by the two associations was not in good taste. “We deprecate such a stand of SCBA and SC Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA).” CJI’s bench partner Justice A G Masih said, “Good traditions must be followed and respected.”Justice Trivedi, who will retire on June 9, would not be available on the last working day of SC on May 23 prior to the summer break as she has a family wedding in the US. She said it is for the first time that the CJI has broken tradition to invite all her relatives for tea after the ceremonial bench, and dinner.Attorney general R Venkataramani said Justice Trivedi delivered justice while scrupulously adhering to the law. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Justice Trivedi has never attempted to mould relief to suit popular sentiments, which is a rare thing. This needs courage of conviction, courage to displease people. I lost most of the matters before her, as HC or SC judge, but our respect can never depend on the relief we got or refused.”SG Mehta said, “There are certain individuals who feel that ‘my word should be the last word in law’ and that never happened in Justice Trivedi’s court, where the last word was the word of law even if it was at the expense of displeasing some people... Our respect and love for the judge is not contingent upon whether relief is being granted or not.”",Cji b r gavai disapproved of the decision of the supreme court bar association and the sc advocates-on-record association to boycott the courtroom farewell for justice bela m trivedi.

Operation Sindoor: Over 600 Pakistan drones killed by Army air defence units,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-over-600-pakistan-drones-killed-by-army-air-defence-units/articleshow/121221694.cms,"Indian Army's air defence units swiftly deployed along the western front, successfully neutralizing over 600 Pakistani drones and repelling the rest during 'Operation Sindoor'. A multi-layered air defence network, integrating legacy weapons with indigenous systems like Akash and Akashteer, showcased unmatched precision and thwarted Pakistan's attempts to overwhelm India's air defence grid. This operation demonstrated India's enhanced AD preparedness.

NEW DELHI: Over 600 drones launched by Pakistan were simply swatted out of the sky while the rest were repelled by Army air defence (AD) units, which were swiftly deployed along the western front in the build-up to the launch of ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ on May 7, senior officers said on Friday.More than 1,000 AD gun systems and 750 short and medium-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, of all shapes and sizes, plugged into a wide array of radars, were mobilised in double-quick time. This ensured the multi-layered air defence network transformed from a peacetime posture to full operational readiness to thwart the multiple waves of drones unleashed by Pakistan during the four days of hostilities last week.“The operation not only safeguarded vital military and civilian infrastructure but also shattered the myth of drone supremacy. It has shown that Indian boots on the ground, backed by indigenous technology and rigorous training, can defend the skies with unmatched precision,” a senior Army Air Defence (AAD) officer said.Pakistan’s strategy of launching multiple drone swarms , many of them armed, were aimed to map and test India’s AD radar network as well as get the Indian armed forces to deplete their stockpiles of ammunition and missiles designed to take on hostile aerial threats. The Indian defence establishment was ready, having built adequate ammo reserves through regular and emergency procurements over the last five years due to the military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh.“Pakistan’s strategy was to overwhelm India’s integrated air defence grid, gather real-time intelligence, and target population centres, military assets and places of worship. But it failed spectacularly,” another officer said.“We neither open up all our radars, nor keep them open round-the-clock, to ensure the adversary does not pick up electronic signatures. One also does not use the top-end Russian S-400 (interception range 380km) or Barak-8 MR-SAM (70km, jointly produced with Israel) AD systems against low-value targets like small drones,” he added.Old ‘legacy’ AD weapons like L-70 anti-aircraft guns, ZU-23mm twin-barrel guns and upgraded Schilka, often underestimated in this era of high-tech warfare, proved their mettle in this arena. “They emerged as highly effective point defence systems against low-flying, hard-to-detect drone swarms,” he said.The indigenous Akash AD missile systems, with an interception range of 25km, also played a major role in taking care of the bigger threats like aircraft, armed UAVs and the Turkish Byker Yiha III kamikaze drones.Army deployed six nodes of its new indigenous Akashteer air defence control and reporting systems, which were fully plugged into IAF’s larger IACCS ( integrated air command and control system ) for a real-time composite air situation picture available to all commanders on the ground, as reported by TOI earlier.“Akashteer’s digital backbone offered unmatched situational awareness and real-time command-and-control capabilities, enabling commanders to neutralise threats swiftly without risking friendly aerial platforms,” the officer said. The “sheer scale” of engagement, speed of deployment, and level of integration between sensors, shooters & networks across the Services is “a turning point” in India’s AD preparedness, he added.","Indian army's air defence units swiftly deployed along the western front, successfully neutralizing over 600 pakistani drones and repelling the rest.

Supreme Court Criticizes Repeated PILs on Rohingya Deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-irked-by-repeated-pils-to-stop-rohingya-deportation/articleshow/121220210.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday was irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims within a fortnight and told senior advocate Colin Gonsalves that he can’t be filing PIL after PIL on the same issue without any new fact to seek modification of SC’s May 8 decision refusing relief.On May 8, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had refused to grant interim stay on apprehended deportation of Rohingyas despite spirited arguments from Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan. The bench had said Rohingyas, who are not Indian citizens, do not have a right to reside anywhere in the country.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said India is not a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees and disputed validity of UNHCR granting refugee status to Rohingyas, who are from Myanmar and had fled to other countries because of serious threat to their lives from the military.On Friday, Gonsalves said on May 8 itself the Union govt had deported 28 Rohingyas, who were handcuffed and taken to Andaman Island, given life jackets and pushed towards Myanmar. After somehow reaching Myanmar, they took help of fishermen to make phone calls to their relatives in Delhi to inform them that they faced imminent threats to their lives.The bench of Justices Kant and Singh said these are bald averments and who is there to verify these facts are true to his knowledge. “When the country is facing such a situation at present, you cannot come up with fanciful PILs like this. There is no material to support vague and sweeping allegations made in the petition. Unless the petitioner provides prima facie credible material, it is difficult to pass an interim order which is contrary to the one refused on May 8 by a 3-J bench.”Gonsalves cited a SC judgement on protection of Chakma refugees to seek similar relief for Rohingyas. He also cited a UN Report as well as an order of the International Court of Justice to claim that Rohingyas are not migrants but refugees whose protection of lives is mandated by the UN.The bench said, “We do not want to comment on the UN Report today. We will give an answer to that on July 31, when this petition along with the pending one would be taken up for hearing.” Gonsalves said this would allow govt to deport more Rohingyas, whose number exceed 8,000 in different parts of the country and 800 of them are in Delhi.","Supreme court irked by successive attempts through pil to stop alleged deportation of rohingya muslims within a fortnight.

India gives special entry to 160 Afghan trucks via Attari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gives-special-entry-to-160-afghan-trucks-via-attari/articleshow/121221556.cms,"Afghan trucks allowed to unload goods at Attari

At $1 billion, India is Afghanistan’s largest export market in South Asia

NEW DELHI: A day after external affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke to acting Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in the first political contact between India and the Taliban, India is learned to have approved as a “special gesture” entry of 160 Afghan trucks carrying dry fruits and nuts through the Attari border with Pakistan. Interestingly, India is yet to formally recognise the regime in Kabul.According to sources, Pakistan held up clearance for a while on the Wagah side for the movement of the trucks before allowing some of them to unload at Attari on Friday.India had decided to shut the Attari-Wagah border on April 23 after the Pahalgam terrorist attack a day earlier. Pakistan has in the past allowed one-way trade between Afghanistan and India through that border, facilitating export of Afghan goods to India but no reverse exports.The meeting between EAM Jaishankar and Afghan acting foreign minister Muttaqi was the first political engagement between India and Taliban on May 15. Despite the hurdles created by transit issues in Pakistan, India remains the largest market for Afghan products in South Asia and annual trade stands at approximately $1 billion.The one time in the recent past Pakistan did allow India to send goods to Afghanistan through the land border was in late 2021, after India proposed sending 50,000 tonnes of wheat as aid to the drought-affected country. The Taliban, who had just returned to Kabul, pushed Pakistan not to hold up clearance for the supply.Muttaqi had called Jaishankar Thursday ahead of his upcoming visit to Iran and China, a fact India attaches a lot of significance to. Both leaders had agreed to remain in touch, and Jaishankar thanked Muttaqi for the solidarity Kabul expressed for India after the Pahalgam attack and for not buying into subsequent attempts by Pakistani authorities to sow discord between India and Taliban, including through the claim that India fired missiles at Afghanistan. A source said this was significant “posturing” given the tense situation that followed Operation Sindoor.Since foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Muttaqi in Dubai earlier this year, India has been looking to resume work on its projects in Afghanistan, while also considering more development cooperation projects. These efforts will likely be further expedited by India’s move to politically engage Kabul.“We are considering humanitarian aid for Afghan refugees expelled by Pakistan,” said a source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Formal recognition, however, will have to wait as long as the international community remains convinced that Taliban dispensation is not serious about providing inclusive governance and removing restrictions on women.“Since 2021, India has sent 50,000 tonnes of wheat, 350 tonnes of medicines, 40,000 litres of Malathion (pesticide) and 28 tonnes of earthquake relief material to Afghanistan. We have provided 2,000 online scholarships for Afghan students. This aid was appreciated by the Afghan side,” added the source.","Afghan trucks allowed to unload goods at attari border with pakistan.

It could harm relations with Pakistan. It is a strategic move for India.

Indus Waters Treaty

What India is planning



Impact on Pakistan

NEW DELHI: India is considering a significant escalation in its use of water from the Indus river system, a move that could drastically reduce the water supply to Pakistan. This development comes amid heightened tensions following a deadly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22 by Pakistan-backed terrorists.Shorlty after the attack, India had suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a landmark water-sharing agreement between the two countries that has historically regulated the use of the Indus river and its tributaries.Despite the ceasefire agreement reached after intense fighting in early May, the Indus Waters Treaty remains suspended, and India's water projects are moving forward, according to a report by Reuters.Experts note that while large-scale infrastructure projects take years to complete, the political message and initial impacts on water flow are already significant. The situation remains fluid, with the potential for water to become a new flashpoint in the already tense India-Pakistan relationship.The Indus Waters Treaty, brokered by the World Bank in 1960, allocates the waters of six rivers between India and Pakistan. India controls the eastern rivers — Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi — while Pakistan has rights over the western rivers —Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum. Under the treaty, India is allowed limited use of the western rivers for irrigation and hydropower projects but must not significantly affect the water flow to Pakistan.Following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, in which 26 civilians were killed, India suspended its adherence to the treaty, citing Pakistan's involvement in cross-border terrorism.External affairs minister S. Jaishankar has made it clear that the treaty will remain ""in abeyance"" until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably stops cross-border terrorism. He also emphasised that India is willing to engage with Pakistan only on issues related to terrorism and the return of illegally occupied territories in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), rejecting broader talks on Kashmir or the treaty itself for the time being.In a strategic move, India is accelerating plans to increase its water extraction from the Indus river system, particularly focusing on the Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus rivers, which are primarily allocated to Pakistan under the treaty.One of the most impactful projects under consideration is the expansion of the Ranbir Canal on the Chenab river.Originally built in the 19th century and currently about 60 kilometers long, the plan is to extend this canal to 120 kilometers.This expansion would increase India’s capacity to divert water from 40 cubic meters per second to 150 cubic meters per second, significantly reducing the flow of water into Pakistan’s Punjab province, a key agricultural region.Additionally, India is exploring other irrigation and hydropower projects that could further reduce water availability downstream. Government documents reviewed by Reuters indicate proposals to potentially redirect water from the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers into rivers within northern Indian states, further limiting water flow into Pakistan.These projects include the construction of dams capable of storing large quantities of water-something India has not previously done on the western rivers under the treaty’s restrictions.Read More: Operation Sindoor: How India delivered devastating blow to Pakistan’s air defence with dummy jets, BrahMos missiles Pakistan relies on the Indus river system for approximately 80% of its agriculture and much of its hydropower generation. Any substantial reduction in water flow could have severe consequences for Pakistan’s food security, economy, and energy supply.Islamabad has already reported a 90% drop in water levels at a critical receiving point following Indian maintenance work on Indus projects, providing a glimpse of the pressure it might face if India proceeds with its plans.Pakistan has condemned India’s suspension of the treaty and warned that attempts to halt or divert water flows would be considered an ""act of war.""The Indus Waters Treaty has long been regarded as one of the most successful water-sharing agreements globally, having survived multiple wars and ongoing tensions.",India is considering a significant escalation in its use of water from the indus river system.

BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said even Congress leaders now acknowledge the party has “no future,” accusing the opposition alliance of being driven by “self-interest” rather than public service.“When the INDI alliance was formed, its only goal was to grab power — even if it meant being anti-India, abusing Prime Minister Modi, or demoralising our armed forces,” Bhatia told PTI. “Now, Chidambaram himself has said the alliance is dead.”Echoing the sentiment, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said on X, “Even Rahul Gandhi’s close aides know Congress has no future.”Former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar also weighed in, saying the INDIA bloc was nothing more than a rebranded version of the “corrupt” UPA and lacked a shared vision or ideology.“It is an alliance of dynasty-driven parties, known only for their love of corruption and hatred of Modiji.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday confirmed it will participate in the government’s proposed multi-party parliamentary delegations to several countries to explain India’s stand on terrorism from Pakistan . While the government has not officially announced the plan, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh told PTI that Union minister Kiren Rijiju had spoken to the Congress president in this regard.However, Ramesh also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for avoiding domestic political consultation on key national security issues.“The Prime Minister has refused to chair two all-party meetings on the Pahalgam terror attacks and Operation Sindoor .

NEW DELHI: In a display of modern warfare, India unveiled its indigenous air defence network with Akashteer , a fully automated Air Defence Control and Reporting System.The newly operational automated air defence system, Akashteer, played a central role in intercepting and neutralising a large-scale missile and drone attack launched by Pakistan on the night of May 9th and 10th, according to a press release from the Ministry of Defence.The ministry said the attack targeted both military and civilian areas and was repelled without any of the projectiles hitting their intended targets. “By the time the enemy knew they were being watched, they were already being targeted,” the statement claimed.Akashteer focuses on strategic warfare rather than raw power, according to the government. The integrated platform delivers instantaneous aerial surveillance data to all connected entities (control room, radars and Defence Gun), facilitating synchronised air defence activities. The system automates the process of detecting, monitoring and countering hostile aircraft, drones and missiles. It combines different radar mechanisms, sensors and communication systems into one unified operational structure.The government further revealed that, Akashteer automates surveillance and response, and provides a real-time common air picture to various defence units. It is vehicle-mounted, enhancing mobility and allowing deployment in active combat zones. ""Akashteer has demonstrated that it sees, decides, and strikes faster than anything the world has fielded,"" said the government, boasting the capabilities of the defence system.The government said Akashteer was developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative to reduce reliance on imports and increase indigenous capability. “What stood between them and their intended targets was not just technology, but years of commitment to Atmanirbhar Bharat,” the release said.Pakistan, which reportedly used Chinese-supplied HQ-9 and HQ-16 systems, failed to intercept Indian counter-strikes during the exchange. Officials said the performance gap highlighted the strategic value of domestic defence systems tailored to Indian requirements.Akashteer is part of a broader network that includes integration with the Indian Air Force’s Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS) and the Indian Navy’s TRIGUN platform. This tri-services coordination is designed to reduce friendly fire incidents and improve response times.The system also forms a component of India's wider C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) framework, a critical part of modern military operations.Akashteer joins a growing list of indigenous platforms under development, including the Dhanush artillery system, ATAGS, MBT Arjun, LCA Tejas, ALH, and several naval platforms. According to the Ministry of Defence, 65 per cent of defence equipment is now produced domestically, compared to 30 to 35 per cent a decade ago.India is targeting Rs 3 lakh crore in total defence production by 2029. The private sector now contributes 21 per cent of output, supported by 16 Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), over 430 licensed companies, and about 16,000 MSMEs.While Akashteer’s performance during Operation Sindoor is still being assessed in detail, officials say its use marks a transition in India’s approach from reactive defence to more proactive and integrated airspace control.","Akashteer played a central role in intercepting and neutralising a large-scale missile and drone attack launched by pakistan.

NEW DELHI: The Indus Waters Treaty will remain suspended “until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”, Union Jal Shakti ministry has conveyed to the cabinet secretary in its monthly report.Though the ministry has articulated the country’s well stated position on the issue after keeping the treaty in abeyance, the communication assumes significance in the wake of the latest missive from Pakistan appealing to India to reconsider the 1960 treaty, citing the dependence of millions of people on the water being regulated by it.In a report to cabinet secretary T V Somanathan on Tuesday, Debashree Mukherjee, secretary of Jal Shakti ministry, said the govt announced that the treaty would be held in “abeyance” with immediate effect in the aftermath of the “Pakistan-sponsored” terror attack on civilians in Pahalgam.“The key water-sharing treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism ,” she said in her report.","The indus waters treaty will remain suspended “until pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”, union jal shakti ministry has conveyed to the cabinet secretary in its monthly report.

‘Indirect terror funding’: Rajnath slams IMF on $1 billion loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indirect-terror-funding-rajnath-slams-imf-on-1-billion-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/121221520.cms,"Defence minister Rajnath Singh

India has put terror exporter Pakistan on probation: Rajnath

NEW DELHI: International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) should reconsider its recent $1 billion financial assistance to Pakistan , defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Friday, stressing that Islamabad “will certainly use a large part of the aid to fund terror infrastructure” since it has started rebuilding those destroyed by India on May 7.“Will this not be considered indirect funding (of terror) by IMF? The funds India gives to IMF should not be used, directly or indirectly, to create terror infra in Pakistan or any other country,” Singh said, in what is being seen as a not-so-subtle dig at US, which has the largest holding in IMF.Speaking to IAF and Army personnel at Bhuj air force station in Gujarat, Singh said Pakistan has announced funds to rebuild the headquarters of LeT and JeM at Muridke and Bahawalpur, which were among the nine terror hubs hit by India in just 23 minutes. “Pakistan will also spend tax collected from its citizens to give around 14 crore to JeM chief Masood Azhar, though he is a UN-designated terrorist,” Singh said.The made-in-India BrahMos missiles showed Pakistan “the light of day in the darkness of night” in the precision strikes launched by IAF fighters against airbases and radar sites, he said.Warning Pakistan that Operation Sindoor was not yet over, Singh said, “Our actions were just a trailer, and if need be, we will show them the full picture. Attacking and eliminating terrorism is the new normal of ‘ new India ’.”The fight against terrorism has now become a part of the new national defence doctrine, which will root out this hybrid and proxy warfare actively aided and abetted by Islamabad, Singh said.On Thursday, at the Army base in Srinagar, Singh had said the nuclear weapons of a “rogue” country like Pakistan should be placed under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). On Friday, he asked IMF to refrain from providing any further bailouts to Pakistan.The ongoing cessation of hostilities, which came into effect at 5 pm on May 10, means India has kept Pakistan “on probation” to see whether it ceases cross-border terrorism . “If Pakistan’s behaviour improves, it is fine. But if there is any disturbance, harshest punishment will be given,” Singh said.India’s fighter jets with their standoff weapons can strike every corner of Pakistan. “The world has witnessed how the IAF destroyed terror camps and later Pakistan’s airbases. The IAF gave the proof that India's war policy and technology have changed,” he said. “They conveyed the message of ‘new India’ that we are not just dependent on weapons and platforms imported from abroad, but made-in-India equipment have become a part of our military power. The (air defence) weapons manufactured in India are also impenetrable,” Singh said.","India has put terror exporter pakistan on probation: rajnath singh. “our actions were just a trailer, and if need be, we will show them the full picture.

Lovely Professional University (LPU), a private university, has terminated six MoUs with universities in Turkiye and Azerbaijan.Signed in Jan 2025, the MoU had enabled research collaboration and student and faculty exchange. IIT-Roorkee said the decision aligns with national interest. “Our global partnerships must reflect the values, priorities, and security considerations of our country,” said Kamal Kishore Pant, director of the IIT.Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University (CSJMU), Kanpur, a state-govt run university, has also ended similar MoUs, while there are many others reviewing their international agreements with higher education institutions from Turkiye.LPU cited the two countries’ pro-Pakistan stance during recent Indo-Pak tensions as the reason for ending collaborations. These included student and faculty exchanges, joint research, and dual degree programmes.LPU chancellor and Rajya Sabha MP, Ashok Kumar Mittal said: “National security is not safeguarded solely at the borders — it must be defended in every classroom, boardroom, and international collaboration.”On Thursday, the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) urged over 1,100 universities to review and, if needed, suspend or end partnerships with institutions in Pakistan, Turkiye, and Bangladesh. The appeal follows a terrorist attack in Pahalgam that claimed 26 lives.AIU president, Vinay Kumar Pathak accused these countries of supporting anti-India narratives and called for academic institutions to show national solidarity in their international engagements.","Iit-roorkee has cancelled its memorandum of understanding (mou) with inonu university, turkiye.

SRINAGAR: In the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack , security forces revised their counter-terrorism strategy over the past month, leading to the killing of six terrorists in two operations since May 13. This was revealed at a press conference addressed jointly by IGP Kashmir Vidhi Kumar Birdi, GOC Victor Force Maj Gen Dhananjay Joshi, and IGP (G) CRPF Mitesh Kumar on Friday. Now that the snow is melting, security forces are focusing more on the higher reaches of Kashmir Valley as well as on the hinterland to ensure the end of terrorism in J&K.On Thursday (May 15), three local Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists were shot dead in an encounter in south Kashmir’s Tral. Two days before that, security forces killed three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists — including local commander Shahid Kuttay — in the upper reaches of south Kashmir’s Shopian, around 80km north of Srinagar, on May 13. With these two operations, the number of listed local terrorists has dropped to a single digit — the lowest ever since armed insurgency began in the Valley in the 1990s, the press conference informed.Following the Pahalgam massacre, the Army had made several areas as focus regions, GOC Victor Force Maj Gen Joshi said. “We were getting intelligence inputs that terrorist groups have now moved to higher reaches in the forests after the snow melted. Keeping this in mind, our domination party was continuously deployed in the upper reaches and the forests in the high mountains,” he added.“On May 12 night, we received inputs that a group of terrorists might be present in Shopian’s Kellar area. So, the parties already deployed there for domination relocated themselves and focused on that place, closing in on spotting suspicious movement on May 13 morning,” Maj Gen Joshi said, adding that three ultras were shot dead in the ensuing firefight. Joshi said the operation took place in the higher reaches, at very high altitudes, and in a difficult terrain.Speaking about the Tral encounter, Joshi said, “This operation was carried out in a completely different setting — a village in Nadar area. We had intel that terrorists were hiding there. As soon as the cordon was imposed, the holed-up terrorists opened fire from multiple houses.” After ensuring the security of civilians, the search teams moved from house to house and killed three terrorists at separate locations, he added.“Both operations demonstrate the security forces’ capability to locate and neutralise terrorists, whether in remote forests or densely populated villages,” Joshi said.Over the past month, security forces and police reviewed their strategies, and with mutual coordination among various agencies, intensified anti-terror operations, IGP Birdi said. “Such operations are possible only because all of us in J&K, especially Kashmir Valley, are united and committed to eradicating the terror ecosystem, and any form of terrorist activity,” Birdi added.IGP (G) CRPF Mitesh Kumar praised the synergy between all security and intelligence agencies involved. “The successful operations reflect the high level of coordination among the Army, Rashtriya Rifles, J&K Police, CRPF, and intelligence agencies,” Kumar said, adding: “This collaboration will continue, and it is key to eliminating terrorism from J&K.”",Security forces are focusing more on the higher reaches of kashmir valley as well as on the hinterland to ensure the end of terrorism in j&k.

IAEA Confirms No Nuclear Radiation Leak from Kirana Hills Nuclear Facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/iaea-denies-radiation-leak-in-pak-after-op-sindoor-airstrikes/articleshow/121168129.cms,"Representative Image (AI)





DEHRADUN: There was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Wednesday (IST), rejecting widespread reports that claimed Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills in Pakistan's Sargodha district during Operation Sindoor, triggering a radioactive incident.The clarification followed social media speculation and foreign media theories suggesting a nuclear stockpile in Pakistan had been hit during the airstrikes. Fredrik Dahl from IAEA's press department in an email response to TOI's query stated, ""We are aware of the reports. Based on information available to the IAEA, there was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan.""The development came two days after Indian Air Force's director general air operations, Air Marshal A K Bharti, denied that India had targeted Kirana Hills or any nuclear installation in Pakistan. When asked by the media, Bharti said, ""Thank you for telling us that Kirana Hills houses nuclear installations. We didn't know about it. We have not hit Kirana Hills and whatever is there.""The ministry of external affairs also rejected reports of a radiation leak. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, during a press briefing on Tuesday, said, ""Our military action was entirely within the conventional domain. Some reports were suggesting that Pakistan's National Command Authority would convene a meeting, but those were later denied.In fact, Pakistan's govt representatives have officially denied this on record. ""IAEA's statement sought to dispel speculation that a radiation leak led to the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Some foreign experts on global media platforms had amplified the theories, claiming the reports were accurate. The rumours intensified after some flight tracking platforms allegedly spotted a US department of energy aircraft—used in nuclear emergencies like Fukushima—near Pakistan.Another claim that an Egyptian military aircraft landed in Pakistan carrying boron, a chemical used to contain radioactive emissions, also circulated. Both these claims were unverified and dismissed by former military officials as baseless. Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retd), who served as deputy director general military operations during the Kargil war, told TOI, ""Hitting any nuclear installation is a very irresponsible thing to do, which the highly professional Indian forces will never do. All these stories are bogus conspiracy theories that can't be believed.""He added, ""Above all, both countries in 1988 signed the India-Pakistan Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack Against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, or simply called the non-attack agreement. Under this, both maintain an understanding of not attacking each other's nuclear installations as it would then lead to a devastating armed escalation. Having said that, our forces are fully ready to respond to any misadventure by Pakistan. """,Iaea: there was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in pakistan.

NEW DELHI: In one of the most daring and technologically advanced operations, the Indian Air Force (IAF) used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on Pakistani airbases in Round 2 of Operation Sindoor on May 10. According to sources quoted by ANI, approximately 15 BrahMos missiles were launched in precision attacks that targeted critical infrastructure across 11 of 12 key Pakistani Air Force bases, effectively paralysing its air defence and strike capabilities.The missile strikes came as part of Round 2 of India's counter-offensive following the terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which was carried out by Pakistan-backed groups. On the night of May 9–10, as Pakistan tried to target civilian and military infrastructures in India, New Delhi escalated military response under the broader Operation Sindoor with the BrahMos missiles spearheading the IAF's multi-layered assault strategy.“This was the first time the BrahMos missile system was used in an active conflict,” sources in the defence establishment told ANI. “Its performance exceeded expectations, delivering high-precision strikes that crippled key Pakistani air assets and defence networks,” they said.The IAF’s plan began with the launch of dummy aircraft, designed to simulate an incoming fighter threat. This decoy tactic prompted Pakistan to activate its radar and air defence systems, including the HQ-9 missile batteries. Once these systems were exposed, Indian forces launched loitering munitions, such as the Israeli Harop drones, to neutralise the air defence grid.With the Pakistani radar network compromised, the IAF then followed up with long-range precision strikes. The BrahMos cruise missiles, alongside Scalp, Crystal Maze, and Rampage munitions, were used to devastating effect. These were launched from fighter aircraft operating under the Western and Southwestern Air Commands.“The BrahMos missiles played a central role in disabling runways, hardened shelters, and command centers, significantly degrading the Pakistan Air Force’s ability to launch counter-operations,” ANI reported, citing multiple defence sources.The aftermath of the strike forced the Pakistani military to relocate many of its aircraft to rear bases and reportedly resulted in the loss of several high-value assets, including long-endurance UAVs and an airborne early warning system destroyed in a hangar in Sindh province.According to ANI, the intensity of the BrahMos-led strikes forced Pakistan to abandon its plans for further retaliation. In a telling sign of the damage inflicted, Pakistan urgently sought a Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) level meeting to propose a pause in hostilities and explore an understanding with India.The operational use of BrahMos in this conflict marks a historic milestone for India's missile capabilities. Developed jointly by India and Russia, the BrahMos is known for its Mach 2.8 speed, precision strike capabilities, and versatility across land, sea, and air platforms.“This operation has not only validated the BrahMos missile’s deterrent value but also demonstrated its potency as a first-strike option in modern warfare,” a senior defence official told ANI.",The indian air force (iaf) used brahmos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on pakistani airbases.

"‘Khet mein tank, jeet ka prank’: Pakistan's Shehbaz Sharif ridiculed for airbase visit after PM Modi’s Adampur tour, netizens call it ‘TikTok war PR stunt’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khet-mein-tank-jeet-ka-prank-pakistans-shehbaz-sharif-ridiculed-for-airbase-visit-after-pm-modis-adampur-tour-netizens-call-it-tiktok-war-pr-stunt/articleshow/121188249.cms,"NEW DELHI: A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Adampur airbase in Punjab to boost troop morale following India's decisive Operation Sindoor , Pakistan's PM Shehbaz Sharif attempted a similar show of support by visiting troops at the Pasrur Cantonment in Sialkot. However, Sharif's move was widely mocked and criticised as an unsuccessful attempt to match PM Modi's leadership display.He visited Pasrur and Sialkot airbases (or what’s left of them) to declare an alleged “victory” under the theatrically named “Operation Bunyan al-Marsoos.”But the Pakistani PR attempt backfired. Social media exploded with memes, calling Sharif a “copycat,” mocking the barren backdrop of his speech from atop a tank, and asking whether he was addressing soldiers or scarecrows on a field.“Shehbaz Sharif’s obsession with India is unreal. Modi visits a real airbase, Shehbaz rushes to a random farm like: ‘Look! No damage here!’ From PM to PR clown, Shehbaz is the only leader who treats national security like a TikTok trend,” one user posted.In the viral video of his visit, flanked by Pakistan army chief general Asim Munir and what appeared to be borrowed tanks, Sharif boldly claimed Pakistan had “defeated India,” framing it as revenge for 1971. That’s when the memes really took off.“War khud hi announce karo, khud hi jeet jao, aur khud hi tali bhi baja lo, kya baat hai Pakistan!” a user joked.“PM Shehbaz Sharif: ‘We have won the war.’ Meanwhile, even their GPS can't find the airstrip,” quipped another.While PM Modi walked shoulder-to-shoulder with IAF personnel and was pictured beside S-400 systems and MiG-29 fighters, Sharif’s visuals featured him standing solo atop a tank in what users called a “crop field.” No runway, no radar, no aircraft — just dusty ground and declarations.“Picture of Shehbaz Sharif from Kirana Hills,” mocked one user, referencing unverified reports of a nuclear radiation leak in the region — which India has denied striking.“They will do everything India does, even if they don’t have the resources,” another added.The trolling continued with users dubbing the Pakistani leader as “PR Minister” and drawing parallels with Bollywood and sitcom characters. Clips from Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, Gangs of Wasseypur, and Welcome were edited to mock the speech.“Udit Bhai feat,” wrote a user, referencing the viral “Welcome” meme.“Modi to Shehbaz Sharif,” another captioned a Gangs of Wasseypur clip showing a character laughing uncontrollably.The Pakistani PMO posted filtered photos of Sharif with troops but conspicuously avoided any shots of runways or airstrips, a fact not lost on online commentators, many of whom believe this confirms the heavy damage inflicted by India during Operation Sindoor.India has denied Pakistan’s counter-claims of downing jets or damaging airbases. PM Modi’s landing in a Hercules aircraft and speech from a fully operational airstrip was seen as a mic-drop moment.“Shehbaz Sharif trying to copy Modi is like a school kid copying homework but forgetting the main question,” a meme read.Notably, this isn’t Sharif’s first Modi mimicry. After Modi restructured India’s National Security Advisory Board with a former RAW chief, Sharif made headlines for appointing ISI chief Gen Asim Malik as NSA. His speeches post-terror attacks often echo PM Modi’s tone - minus the audience, impact, or airpower.“From Kirana Hills to copycat thrills, Shehbaz Sharif’s only battlefield is Twitter,” one user said.India’s Operation Sindoor, launched after Pakistan’s drone and missile attacks, reportedly damaged multiple airbases across Pakistan. International media like The New York Times and The Washington Post acknowledged India’s upper hand.PM Modi, addressing IAF personnel, declared, “Ghar mein ghus ke maarenge,” while Sharif was left fending off online laughter.","Pakistan's pm shehbaz sharif attempted a similar show of support by visiting troops at the pasrur cantonment in sialkot.
