India Calls Out Pakistan Twice at UNHRC Over Terror and Kashmir Lies, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bombing

NEW DELHI: In order to smoothen Lashkar-e-Taiba operations and ensure uninterrupted training in a new terrain, the Pakistani military has launched a “clean-up drive” in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province to neutralise Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan TTP ) cadre in Lower Dir district.The clean-up drive, launched in June this year, has not only resulted in the death of over two dozen TTP operatives but also allowed the LeT to start constructing its new terror centre within a month of the operation. The recent aerial attack on an alleged TTP facility in Tirah Valley in KPK on Sept 22 was a part of this drive, an intelligence dossier has disclosed.Though Pakistan was the main patron of the Taliban — a militia of fundamentalists trained in Deobandi madrasas in Pakistan — and helped them fight and beat Russians, Americans as well as local ethnic groups like Tajiks and aided them install themselves in Kabul, the TTP has refused to be as pliant as ISI — Pakistan’s spy agency — expected it to. Its assertion of autonomy can potentially be problematic for ISI’s plans to find a new base for the LeT in KPK, considering that it is the homeground for Taliban.ISI has tried to recruit terrorists from the Lower Dir region for the jihad against India, Al Badr, but LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen had no presence there before Operation Sindoor in May. “Due to sectarian differences — TTP being Deobandi and anti-Pakistan and LeT following the Ahle Hadith ideology and being pro-Pakistan — there have been targeted killings of LeT commanders in Lower Dir by TTP operatives,” according to the dossier.In 2011, the LeT had tried to establish a temporary training centre in Lower Dir, but a suicide bomb attack carried out by TTP at the funeral of an LeT commander had led to the deaths of dozens of LeT members, a source said.Since June, the Pakistani army and air force have killed over 40 civilians in airstrikes, officially claiming these operations aimed at making Khyber Pakhtunkhwa “terror free”. “These operations are in reality focused on removing terrorists hostile to the Pakistani state while simultaneously facilitating the establishment of anti-India terror groups in the region, reflecting Pakistan’s longterm state strategy of endorsing ‘good terrorism’ while eliminating ‘bad terrorism’,” said a source.Lashkar, the sources said, has also been asked by Pakistani spy agency ISI to share training facilities with the Hizbul Mujahideen.“Operationally, the LeT’s new training centre expected to be completed by Dec 2025 poses a long-term threat. While still under construction, it is already emerging as a fresh hub for terrorist training,” the source added.",Pakistani military has launched a “clean-up drive” in khyber pakhtunkhwa province to neutralise tehreek-e-taliban pakistan ttp ) cadre in lower dir district.

Bishnoi ‘terror tag’ shows clout of Khalistani groups in Canada



NEW DELHI: Canada govt Monday listed Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate as a “terrorist entity”. The tag that follows Royal Canadian Mounted Police claims, not substantiated yet, that Bishnoi hired the killers of pro-Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar allows Canadian cops to prosecute offences committed by the gang pertaining to financing, travel and recruitment. It means any assets owned by it in the country, like property, vehicles and money, can be frozen or seized.This comes at a time when the gang is facing a crackdown by Indian authorities, with several of its self-proclaimed members killed or injured in encounters.Canada’s ‘terrorist’ tag on the Bishnoi gang shows the clout of pro-Khalistani Sikh groups in the country who have blamed him for organising the killing of Nijjar and his associates allegedly at the instance of Indian agencies. The development comes on a day external affairs minister S Jaishankar held talks with his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand in New York. In 2023, former Canadian PM Justin Trudeau had claimed Canada had “credible evidence” of Indian agents’ role in Nijjar’s murder in British Columbia that June.It would now be an offence for anyone in Canada or Canadians abroad to knowingly deal with property owned or controlled by the Bishnoi group.“It is also an offence to directly or indirectly provide property knowing that it will be used by or benefit a terrorist group. Immigration and border officials can now inform decisions on admissibility to Canada under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,” a statement by govt said.It added that “the Bishnoi gang is a transnational criminal organisation operating primarily out of India. They have a presence in Canada and are active in areas with significant diaspora communities. The Bishnoi gang engages in murder, shootings and arson, and generates terror through extortion and intimidation.They create a climate of insecurity in these communities by targeting them, their prominent community members, businesses, and cultural figures.”This is the second instance after Dawood Ibrahim — the mastermind of the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, enlisted by Pakistan to hurt India through narco-terrorism, who was designated a terrorist by the UN as well as the US — that an Indian criminal gang has been designated a terrorist entity by a foreign govt.Lawrence Bishnoi is currently lodged in the Sabarmati jail in Gujarat. His associates Goldy Brar and Rohit Godara are handling the operations of the gang and claim to be operating independently.The move is believed to have been mounted by three recent murders, sources said. On May 14, a businessman named Harjeet Dhadda was shot multiple times in a parking area in Mississauga, Ontario. A month later, a businessman in Surrey, British Columbia, and another in Brampton were shot dead, allegedly by Bishnoi and Brar gang’s shooters.","Bishnoi ‘terror tag’ shows clout of khalistani groups in canada.

India’s Bold UN Stand: Delhi Backs Palestine’s Two-State Solution, Testing Ties With 'Friend' Israel

NEW DELHI: India’s developmental assistance of close to $80 million for Palestine in the past 11 years is almost double that of the amount that was given in the preceding 65 years, according to Indian authorities. India has continued to extend humanitarian assistance to the people of Palestine both bilaterally and through UNRWA, despite the ban imposed on the agency by Israel. It contributes annually $5 million to UNRWA and has provided $27.5 million to the agency since 2020-21.“India’s developmental assistance, given to Palestine since 2014 is almost double of what was given in the preceding 65 years (around $42 million) and projects worth $40 million are in the pipeline,” said a diplomatic sourceWhile govt has faced some criticism for its flip-flop over the Gaza issue, like its decision in June this year to abstain from voting on a UNGA resolution for lasting and unconditional ceasefire, it believes India’s overall position, including its long-standing commitment to a 2-state solution, has remain unchanged.Indian authorities also see as significant that the govt hasn’t voted against any of the 175 resolutions on Israel-Palestine issues in the UN during past 10 years, suggesting India’s voting pattern at UN has remained unchanged. India was among the 142 countries that voted recently in favour of a UNGA resolution endorsing the New York Declaration that outlined tangible, irreversible and timebound steps for a 2-state solution.Since the Gaza conflict erupted in 2023, India has had to do a tough balancing act between its increasingly important relationship with Israel and its traditional support for the Palestinian cause. It has strongly condemned the Oct 7, 2023, terrorist strikes by Hamas, defending Israel’s right to defend itself from acts of terrorism, but equally condemned the loss of civilian lives in the Israel-Hamas war and sought respect for international humanitarian law.While the recent visit by Israeli hardliner Bezalel Smotrich raised eyebrows, govt sees it as a visit purely in his capacity as Israel’s finance minister to sign a bilateral investment agreement. The deal was under discussion for the past six years, before it was finalised last month. According to Indian authorities, the visit was meant to ramp up India’s economic and financial ties with Israel.“India remains concerned at the security situation and has called for a ceasefire, release of all hostages and peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.At the same time, India has emphasized the need for safe, timely and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Palestine,” said a source, citing Palestinian ambassador Abdullah Shawesh’s recent remark that he is satisfied with India’s position. India has also been calling for efforts to bring Israel and Palestine closer for early resumption of direct peace negotiations.","India’s developmental assistance of close to $80 million for palestine in the past 11 years is almost double that of the amount given in the preceding 65 years.

Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country will soon announce some proposals to take in foreign workers for whom the American dream is now too costly because of the $100,000 H-1B visa fee. ""Not as many H1B visa holders will get visas in the US. These people are skilled, and this is an opportunity for Canada... We will soon bring a proposal on this,"" Carney said, adding that these people are enterprising and willing to move for work.In a major overhaul of the employment-based visa system, the Donald Trump administration has imposed a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas which will make it difficult for companies to hire foreign workers, as tech companies will now have to pay this fee if they want to hire foreign workers. The move is aimed at saving jobs for Americans, while it will hurt foreign workers from India and China.Several countries, including Germany and the UK, have seized the opportunity and reached out to Indian talent.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is said to have started exploring proposals to abolish visa fees for top global talent even before Trump's major H-1B move. Starmer has a global talent task force that has been developing ideas to draw the world's best scientists, academics and digital experts to Britain.One option being weighed is a zero-fee system for applicants who have studied at the world’s top five universities or won prestigious prizes.German ambassador to India, Dr Philipp Ackermann, recently made an open call to highly skilled Indians to work in Germany. ""The average Indian working in Germany earns more than the average German. Because a high salary means Indians are contributing big time to our society and our welfare. We believe in hard work and giving the best jobs to the best people,"" he said.Indians are already Canada's top source of immigrants, as figures reveal that out of 32,000 tech workers who migrated to Canada from April 2022 to March 2023, around 15,000 were Indian. In 2024, about 87,000 Indians obtained Canadian citizenship, making them the largest group among new Canadian citizens.In 2022, about 118,095 Indians became permanent residents in Canada.

India Pushes Forward Trade Agenda As Goyal Addresses Tariff Pressures And Global FTA Plans

Poll Should India prioritize expanding its ties with the EU over its relationship with Russia? Yes, focus on the EU No, maintain ties with Russia

The 13th round of India-EU negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) this month was a missed opportunity, but the EU remains committed to concluding a “meaningful package” by the end of this year, EU ambassador to India Herve Delphin has said. India and the EU will hold another round of FTA talks in Brussels on October 6, hoping to close several chapters that both sides could not in the last round here.Delphin’s remarks confirm that there are lingering issues that both sides need to address to be able to meet the year-end deadline. EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, who visited India this month, had said that he expected more progress in the last round.Separately, Germany’s ambassador to India Philipp Ackermann told TOI last week the 13th round was good but not good enough, while expressing confidence that India and the EU will get down to closing more chapters in the next round. Before the 13th round, only 12 of the 24 chapters, including SMEs, transparency, dispute settlement and customs and trade facilitation - had been closed.“The 13th round earlier in September was a bit of a missed opportunity to make some breakthrough. The EU was and is still ready to conclude on a meaningful package. We look forward to India engaging in earnest and moving, like the EU has shown readiness to do, towards a mutually beneficial deal,” said Delphin, addressing an event that explored the way forward in India-EU relations against the backdrop of global disorder.Delphin said that the EU and India offer each other important strategic options to “de-risk the economic turmoil and the security uncertainties, to tap into our complementarities and combine respective strengths and scale to serve each other’s interests”.The EU push towards strategic autonomy and India’s own, as Delphin said, strategic conundrum in the form of challenges posed by the US, China and Russia have forced both sides to diversify their partnerships. However, India’s energy ties with Russia, as EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said this month, remains an impediment to progress in India-EU ties. On its part, India wants EU to shun “double standards” on the issue of Russian oil, with the MEA reminding the EU last week of President Donald Trump’s remarks urging Europe to not purchase Russian energy.Delphin said it is for India to consider how it can square its position on Russia, a strategic partner, with its support for peace and its desire to enhance ties with the EU. Apart from its energy ties with Russia, India’s participation in the Russia-Belarus military exercise Zapad-2025 has also been met with disapproval in Europe.“We also have to be clear-eyed about those issues on which we are not aligned...there is a Russia question - specifically linked to its war of aggression against Ukraine and its hostile attitude towards as seen in past weeks and days and the violation of European air space by Russian drones,” said Delphin.“India has pronounced itself for peace. Russia is a strategic partner for India. And India wants to deepen its ties with the EU. This will require further consideration in Delhi on how to square those terms,” he added.",India and the eu will hold another round of fta talks in brussels on october 6.

Rajnath Singh Hails India’s New Stealth Frigates, Calls Them ‘F-35 On Water’ In Naval Power Push

NEW DELHI: Stressing that warfare is now measured in hours and seconds, with satellites, drones and sensors redefining the nature of conflict, defence minister Rajnath Singh Monday directed the Coast Guard to develop a futuristic road map that anticipates new challenges, adapts new strategies and integrates cutting-edge technologies.“Preparedness, adaptability and rapid response must be the cornerstones of Coast Guard’s vision,” Singh said while addressing top commanders of the maritime force.Warning that maritime threats are increasingly becoming technology-driven and multi-dimensional while cyber and electronic warfare are present-day realities, Singh said India needs to integrate AI, machine learning-based surveillance, drones, cyber defence etc into its maritime security framework to stay ahead of terrorists, criminals, pirates and adversaries.“A nation may attempt to paralyse our systems, not with missiles, but through hacking, cyber attacks and electronic jamming. Automated surveillance networks and AI-enabled systems are essential to reduce response times to seconds and ensure readiness at all times,” Singh said.Urging Coast Guard to maintain not just routine surveillance but also keep a close track on geopolitical events for readiness to respond swiftly to external developments, he said “instability” in neighbouring countries like Myanmar and Bangladesh often spills into the maritime domain, especially in the Bay of Bengal, through refugee influx, illegal migration and irregular maritime activities.Singh said any disruption in sea trade can have “cascading effects” on the security and economy alike. “We must treat national security and economic security as one and the same,” the minister said.","Defence minister rajnath singh monday directed the coast guard to develop a futuristic road map that anticipates new challenges. “preparedness, adaptability and rapid response must be the cornerstones of coast guard’s vision,” singh said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124220465,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-155820,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Another 12 cheetahs arrived from South Africa in February 2023.India now hosts 27 cheetahs, of which 16 were born in the country. At Kuno, 26 cubs have been born since the project began, but 19 cheetahs—nine imported adults and 10 India-born cubs—have died so far, leaving 24 animals at Kuno and three at Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.Amid those losses, India today has seven more cheetahs than were initially imported, and Kuno’s cub survival rate stands above 61 per cent, exceeding the global average of 40 per cent.Officials call the progress a “big success” and are negotiating with African nations, including Botswana and Namibia, to bring in 8–10 more cheetahs by December to strengthen the gene pool.","Mukhi, a female cub born at kuno national park, will become the country’s first india-born cheetah to reach adulthood.

What motivated the Houston Texans to trade OT Cam Robinson to the Cleveland Browns?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-motivated-the-houston-texans-to-trade-ot-cam-robinson-to-the-cleveland-browns/articleshow/124217189.cms,"(Image via Getty: Cam Robinson)

Houston Texans traded veteran OT Cam Robinson to Cleveland Browns for a 2027 late-round pick

Fans react to Cam Robinson trade to Cleveland Browns

Also Read:

As per Nick Brinkerhoff of USA TODAY, two straightforward reasons led to the Cam Robinson trade: Despite offensive line concerns, offensive tackle Cam Robinson was inactive for the Houston Texans’ Week 4 matchup against the Tennessee Titans. And, for two, the Cleveland Browns lost Dawand Jones to a season-ending injury and desperately need a starter at their left tackle position. Jones suffered a lateral collateral ligament (LCL) tear and a hamstring avulsion in the Browns' 13-10 victory over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. So what are the exact Robinson trade details? Let’s find out.On September 29, NFL Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported on X that the Texans are trading offensive tackle Cam Robinson to the Browns for a 2027 sixth- or seventh-round pick.According to Brinkerhoff, Robinson was previously expected to be Houston’s left tackle in 2025. However, the emergence of rookie left tackle Aireontae Ersery, whose rapid improvement impressed both coaches and teammates, contributed to the Texans' decision to move Robinson. Texans star pass rusher Will Anderson Jr. told Kevin Patra of NFL Network in August, “Tae, Aireontae, man, he has really like shocked me a lot.His mindset as a rookie. There’s not a lot of guys like that. He wants to be great. He wants to get better every day. He stays after practice with me and Danielle (Hunter). He just has the grit, the grime in his game, and he has all the tools to be a great offensive lineman in this league.”Fans had mixed reactions. Some questioned trading a veteran offensive lineman when the Texans already have O-line concerns, while others saw potential benefits for the Browns, especially for quarterback Joe Flacco. One fan directly wrote: “Browns really out here coupon clipping for linemen.” Another speculated: “So puzzling. OL is, by most accounts, the Texans' weakest position room. Maybe they have somebody they consider an upgrade in the works?” A third fan sarcastically commented, “Ah yes, trading away even more offensive linemen, exactly what the Texans need to be doing. ” A fourth fan declared, “They just made their O LINE worse??? A fifth fan was happy for Cleveland Browns veteran quarterback Joe Flacco: “Robinson brings veteran experience with stabilizing presence for Flacco’s protection.” A fan expressed concerns for Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud, “If they hate Stroud this much they can trade him to Pittsburgh.” Another reiterated, “Who they r planning to keep on O line to protect QB CJ Stroud? Poor guy already broken mentally after taking so many hits with this bad O line.”",Houston texans traded veteran ot cam robinson to cleveland browns for a 2027 late-round pick.

Pak PM SHAMED For ‘Desperate’ Pitch To Trump After India’s ‘Terror’ Insult; ‘Made To Wait...’

Why it matters



Religious optics: Patel’s past positions on Hindu identity amplify the symbolism. He has publicly defended the Ram Temple as a 500-year civilisational struggle. Munir, meanwhile, has repeatedly championed the Two-Nation Theory, framing Hindus and Muslims as fundamentally different. For critics, their handshake was a clash of incompatible worldviews.

US tilt toward Pakistan: The optics worsen at a time when Trump has already unsettled Delhi — from tariffs to public praise for Pakistan’s diplomacy.

Nobel frustration: Trump has reportedly bristled that India has not nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize, a personal slight that has seeped into diplomatic irritation. Ironically, New Delhi is one of the only establishments who have openly defied Trump even as allies have bent over to fete him.

Ceasefire claims — and India’s rebuttals:



The big picture



Trump’s Hindu outreach: From Diwali speeches to opposing California’s caste bill, Trump had aggressively wooed Hindu-Americans before the 2024 US Presidential Elections. Patel, with his religious identity and pro-Modi rhetoric, is an important part of that effort.

He wrote the Nunes memo, became Trump’s Russiagate warrior, and cultivated a brand of being loud, unapologetic, and Hindu. He is Trump’s dharma warrior in Washington, embodying both sanskar and swagger.

Defenders insist Patel was only following diplomatic protocol. But when India–Pakistan relations are this combustible, and Trump has already alienated Delhi, even a handshake cannot escape political weight. Diaspora politics: Patel embodies the tension of being both an American official and a Hindu son of Gujarat. That double burden makes every act — even a courtesy greeting — a test of loyalty in the eyes of the diaspora.

Bottom line







When Kash Patel came to his Congressional confirmation as FBI chief, he chanted Jai Shree Krishna, touched his parents’ feet, and swore on the Bhagavad Gita — the perfect amalgamation of diaspora sanskar and MAGA defiance. The man who broke every stereotype about Indian-Americans is now at the centre of a storm: a single photo of him shaking hands with Pakistan’s Army Chief Asim Munir has ignited outrage across India and its diaspora.President Donald Trump hosted Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last week. Among the senior American officials present was FBI Director Kash Patel. While Trump’s hospitality for Pakistan’s leadership was expected, the image of Patel — Indian-origin, Hindu, and a vocal defender of the Ram Mandir — warmly greeting Munir struck a raw nerve. The photo went viral, spawning accusations of betrayal, opportunism, and hypocrisy.The reactions reflected a sharp divide. Some critics called Patel’s gesture with Munir a disgrace for the Hindus across the world, given Munir's utterances about Indians and Hindus.Others took a more pragmatic view, noting that as FBI Director “he could hardly decline such a greeting in his official capacity.” Still others pushed back against the controversy itself, asking why every episode was filtered through religion: “Munir is a Pakistani, Patel is an American — both will inevitably prioritise national interests over faith. ”Patel’s handshake cannot be separated from the broader drift in Trump-era India–US ties:In May 2025, Trump claimed he “brokered” a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Delhi said it was negotiated directly by the two militaries. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh called Trump’s assertion that India stopped operations “under pressure” baseless. The Ministry of External Affairs issued a six-point rebuttal, stressing that no US leverage or trade carrots influenced its decision. At the UN in September 2025, India declared “no room for any third party” in its disputes, directly rejecting Trump’s boast of mediation. Even Pakistan acknowledged that India flatly rejected third-party involvement during Operation Sindoor. Despite this, Trump continues to credit himself for “calling off” India’s military actions — a narrative Delhi has consistently dismissed.Kash Patel is no ordinary bureaucrat. He is the Hindu face of Trump’s MAGA world, the chief of the FBI, the man who chanted Jai Shree Krishna in Congress, and the rare Indian-American to turn faith into political muscle. That is why his handshake with Asim Munir is not being judged as protocol but as a betrayal of history, faith, and India’s strained relationship with Trump’s America. Of course it's important to remember that loyalties come in different forms, and Patel's is too Donald Trump before anything else.","Patel’s past positions on hindu identity amplify the symbolism.

First-cousin marriage: UK NHS cites benefits; conservatives slam report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/first-cousin-marriage-uk-nhs-cites-benefits-conservatives-slam-report/articleshow/124213696.cms,".





UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is facing criticism for linking first-cousin marriages to “stronger extended family support” and economic benefits.Experts warn that marrying a first cousin carries health risks, including a higher chance of children inheriting recessive genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis or thalassaemia, reported The Standard.The controversy comes after NHS staff in Bradford described marrying a cousin as a “cultural practice”.The guidance, released by NHS England’s genomics education programme, although noting that first-cousin marriages, common in the British Pakistani community, are linked to a greater risk of genetic conditions in children, it recommended public health measures such as awareness campaigns rather than banning cousin marriages, saying that outlawing the practice could stigmatise communities.The document received severe backlash from the conservatives of the UK, including Tory MP Richard Holden, who said that the NHS should act against “damaging and oppressive cultural practices” and call for an end to cousin marriage, reported The Daily Mail.“The Conservatives want to see an end to cousin marriage as a backdoor to immigration too, but Labour are deaf to these sensible demands. Sir Keir Starmer should stop running scared of the misogynistic community controllers and their quislings who appear in the form of cultural relativist-obsessed sociology professors, and ban a practice the overwhelming majority, from every community in Britain, want to see ended for good,” he said.Holden has also proposed a bill to ban first-cousin marriages, though Downing Street has said the government has no plans to take this step.Aneeta Prem MBE, founder of the Freedom Charity, also criticised the guidance, saying cousin marriages are a safeguarding risk. She added that the practice is linked to dishonour abuse, where young people are pressured and have little real choice. “The health evidence is clear. These are preventable harms that place families and the NHS under immense pressure. This is about protecting rights, not targeting communities,” she said, as quoted by The Daily Mail.First-cousin marriages have been legal in the UK since a law was passed during Henry VIII’s reign.","First-cousin marriages have been legal in the uk since a law was passed during henry viii’s reign.

I have never offered Charlie or Turning Point any money in an attempt to influence Charlie's opinion on anything.

40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford rammed a Michigan Church with his vehicle, got out and opened fire with an assault rifle, killing at least four people in the latest mass violence in the country. Officers killed Sanford in the parking lot behind the church.Sanford was not just a crazed gunman as he had a long history of serving in the US Army -- he joined the Marine Corps in 2004 and held the titles of organizational automotive mechanic and vehicle recovery operator. In 2007, he started a nearly seven-month deployment under Operation Iraqi Freedom.Thomas Sanford’s mom, Brenda Walters-Sanford, posted the eerie message on Facebook before Sunday’s carnage at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints church in Grand Blanc Township, according to screenshots circulating online.“Talking to someone who constantly avoids accountability is not a real conversation – it’s a battle. It’s a cycle of deflection, projection, twisting, and playing the victim,” the post on her since-deleted account said. “When I try to express how your actions have hurt me, you don’t listen with the intention of understanding; you listen with the intention of defending yourself. That’s not communication — that’s self-preservation of your ego.“I don’t owe my peace to someone who only wants to win an argument, not to understand my heart. My energy is not a prize for someone committed to misunderstanding me. At some point, you have to value yourself enough to stop begging someone to hear you,” the post read.The context of the post is not clear.While the motive of the attack is not clear, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday indicated the gunman “hated people of the Mormon faith.” “From what I understand based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith,” Leavitt told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning.“They are trying to understand more about this: How premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note.”Sanford was a Trump supporter as he was seen wearing a Trump 2020 shirt in an old photo. His mother was also a red supporter and shared a social media post on Charlie Kirk's birthday on October 14. The post urged everyone to wear Red on Kirk's birthday.","Michigan church shooter thomas sanford hated mormons, white house said.

President Donald Trump's decision to significantly increase the fee for H-1B visa has prompted an immediate reaction from business world, political leaders and more. The change in H-1B visa has also drawn attention of Canada's political leadership and industry.

Experts believe the move will severely limit opportunities for highly educated foreigners, particularly recent international graduates of U.S. universities.The call to attract and retain the talent left stranded by the H-1B changes appears to have the attention of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. In a recent speech before the Council of Foreign Relations in New York City, Carney highlighted Canada's homegrown research and AI talent, noting that ""unfortunately, most of them go the U.S.""He then addressed the US policy change directly, quipping, ""I understand you're changing your visa policy.Maybe we can hang on to one or two of them.""Immigration lawyer Evan Green stated that the situation presents ""a wonderful opportunity for the Canadian government to take advantage of.""His sentiment is echoed by the non-profit group Build Canada, which has released a memo urging the country ""to move fast.""
