NEW DELHI: Mocking Ottawa's decision to designate it a terror group, Lawrence Bishnoi gang has claimed responsibility for Monday's killing of 68-year-old Indian-origin millionaire Canadian businessman Darshan Singh Sahsi. The group said the target refused to pay ""protection money"", reports Rajshekhar Jha.The group has also claimed responsibility for firing at Punjabi singer Channi Nattan's residence in Canada while warning the music industry against working with singer Saradar Khera. It released videos of both shootings.Coming after Canadian authorities designated it a terrorist outfit, the twin incidents signal Bishnoi gang's defiance while underlining both its reach and capability to strike at will in the country.Sahsi was shot dead in his car outside his home in Abbotsford, British Columbia, on Monday morning. He hailed from Ludhiana and was president of Canam International, a leading clothing recycling firm.Goldy Dhillon of the Bishnoi gang claimed responsibility for the murder through a social media post which alleged that Sahsi was involved in a drug-trafficking operation and had been asked for money by the gang, which he refused to pay and even blocked their number.The sensational killing had prompted brief lockdowns of schools in the neighbourhood as the Abbotsford police patrol officers responded to the shooting.In the second incident, the Bishnoi group stated that the attack was carried out because Channi Nattan was reportedly ""developing close ties"" with fellow singer Saradar Khera. Making the claim, Goldy Dhillon also released a video of the firing. ""Sat Sri Akal! I am Goldy Dhillon (Lawrence Bishnoi Gang). Reason for the firing at singer Channi Nattan's house yesterday is Saradar Khera.""The gang issued a warning to the music industry: ""Any singer who works with or maintains a relationship with Saradar Khera will be solely responsible for their own loss. This is because we will continue to inflict significant damage upon Khera.""Canada designating it a 'terrorist entity' was largely seen as a blow to the Bishnoi gang. The move, seen as having been prompted by pressure from the pro-Khalistani groups who have blamed Bishnoi for the assassination of Hardip Singh Nijjar, a terrorist wanted in India, was supposed to enable law enforcement agencies to use significant investigative tools and access the resources needed to disrupt operations of the gang.The terrorist designation also unlocks critical powers, allowing Canadian police to prosecute offences pertaining to financing, travel and recruitment. A terrorist listing means anything owned by that group in Canada - property, vehicles or money - can be frozen or seized.","Lawrence bishnoi gang claims responsibility for killing of darshan singh sahsi.

"India, China hold talks again, but de-escalation far off on ground",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-china-hold-talks-again-but-de-escalation-far-off-on-ground/articleshow/124922210.cms,"NEW DELHI: A year after troop disengagement between India and China from the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh, there is as yet no actual de-escalation on the ground with the rival armies set to remain forward deployed for the sixth successive winter in the forbidding high-altitude terrain.The military thrust amid the ongoing diplomatic détente is to manage tensions and “maintain peace and tranquillity” all along the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC), stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA), however, continues with its relentless infrastructure build-up along the frontier.At the 23rd round of corps commander-level meeting at the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point in eastern Ladakh on Oct 25, “both sides agreed to continue to use existing mechanisms to resolve any ground issues along the border to maintain stability”, the external affairs ministry said on Wednesday.This was the first meeting of the “general-level mechanism” in the western sector of the LAC since the 24th round of special representatives talks between national security advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Aug this year.The meeting between the Indian 14 Corps commander and the South Xinjiang Military District chief was held in “a friendly and cordial atmosphere”. The two sides “noted the progress” since the 22nd round between them a year ago and “shared the view that peace and tranquillity has been maintained in the border areas”, the MEA said.The troop disengagement at Depsang and Demchok, along with “coordinated patrolling” by the rival troops there, has certainly reduced the chances of any clashes and inadvertent vertical escalation. The trust deficit, however, remains high, sources said.De-escalation and the consequent de-induction of troops, which will require return of all additional troops to their permanent peacetime locations, and the restoration of status quo that existed before April 2020 are “still nowhere on the horizon”, the sources added.After initially being caught off-guard, India had pumped in well over 50,000 troops into eastern Ladakh, along with heavy weapon systems like tanks, howitzers and surface-to-air missile systems, to match the PLA after it made multiple incursions into the region in April-May 2020. Similar “mirroring” of forward troop deployments took place in the eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal) and middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) sectors of the LAC as well.“Over five years later, there have been some troop reductions, which in any case is done during the winters. But the bulk of the troops from either side remain in place. There is an uneasy calm,” a source said.China’s continuing massive infrastructure build-up all along the LAC, which ensures it can rush additional troops and weapons to forward areas many times faster than India, remains a major concern.Similarly, China has deployed additional fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones at its airfields facing India like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi, Lhunze and Hoping after upgrading them with new and extended runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities, as reported earlier by TOI.Restoration of patrolling rights in areas where “no patrol buffer zones” were established to India’s disadvantage after previous rounds of disengagement till Sept 2022 is also yet to take place.There was supposed to be only “a temporary moratorium” in patrolling in these buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3-km to 10-km, which largely came up on what India considers to be its own territory.","The military thrust amid the ongoing diplomatic détente is to manage tensions and “maintain peace and tranquillity” all along the 3,488-km long line of actual control (lac), stretching from eastern ladakh to arunachal pradesh. Both sides agreed to continue to use existing mechanisms to resolve any ground issues along the border to maintain stability.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124922218,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60228,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Punjabi-Canadian Businessman Darshan Sahsi Shot Dead Outside Home in Suspected Targeted Killing





NEW DELHI: A chilling video has emerged showing the killing of Darshan Singh Sahsi, a 68-year-old Indian-origin businessman, who was shot dead in his car outside his home in Abbotsford, British Columbia, on Monday morning.The video shows that as unsuspecting Dharshan Singh sits in his car, an assailant quietly tiptoes toward the vehicle on a busy road and opens fire from close range.Sahsi, originally from Ludhiana and the president of Canam International, a well-known clothing recycling firm, was found with fatal gunshot wounds inside his vehicle.Police said the attack was targeted.According to investigators, the shooter lay in wait in a parked car, and as soon as Sahsi entered his vehicle, the assailant opened fire before fleeing the area.A homicide probe is now underway.Soon after the incident, Goldy Dhillon, a close aide of jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi , claimed responsibility on social media. Dhillon alleged that Sahsi had refused to pay extortion money demanded by the gang and even blocked their number.The post claimed Sahsi was “involved in drug trafficking” and was “punished” for denying the demand — a claim that police have not verified.The murder comes just weeks after the Canadian government declared the Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate a ‘terrorist entity’, giving law enforcement agencies greater powers to seize assets, track funding, and curb gang operations.Despite the designation, Bishnoi’s gang has continued violent operations in Canada. Dhillon recently took credit for drive-by shootings at multiple locations in Surrey and Maple Ridge, as well as an attack on comedian Kapil Sharma’s café in Canada.Abbotsford Police said they are reviewing the video evidence and working with federal agencies to determine any cross-border links.The Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate claimed responsibility for the killing of a 68-year-old Indian-origin businessman who was shot dead in his car in Canada in a targeted shooting.","Darshan singh sahsi, a 68-year-old indian-origin businessman, was shot dead in his car outside his home in abbotsford, british columbia.

8th Pay Commission : Top things to know about Cabinet decision





In a big cheer for central government employees, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission.The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel.In January 2025, the Government announced the formation of the 8th Central Pay Commission to review and propose revisions to the salaries and benefits of Central Government employees.Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: How much salary & pension hike should central government employees, pensioners expect? Top things to know According to the Cabinet release, the 8th Central Pay Commission Commission will function as a temporary entity, consisting of a Chairperson, one Part-Time Member, and one Member-Secretary. Its recommendations are due within 18 months of its establishment, with the possibility of submitting interim reports when specific recommendations are finalised.The 8th Pay Commission, led by former Supreme Court justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, will deliver a preliminary report to the government.Professor Pulak Ghosh from IIM Bangalore has been appointed as a part-time commissioner, whilst Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain will serve as the Member Secretary.When questioned about the implementation timing of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations, I&B Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""The specific date will be decided once the interim report comes in... But, mostly it should be January 1, 2026.""The 8th Central Pay Commission's deliberations will consider:i. The economic conditions in the country and the need for fiscal prudence;ii. The need to ensure that adequate resources are available for developmental expenditure and welfare measures;iii. The unfunded cost of non-contributory pension schemes;iv. The likely impact of the recommendations on the finances of the State Governments which usually adopt the recommendations with some modifications; andv. The prevailing emolument structure, benefits and working conditions available to employees of Central Public Sector Undertakings and private sector.Terms of Reference (TOR) serves as a framework document for a pay commission, establishing guidelines and parameters for preparing its report. It includes essential definitions, terms and conditions that guide the commission's work.The Terms of Reference is drafted by a Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM), with final approval from the Cabinet Committee under the Finance Ministry. The JCM includes union representatives from various ministries. From its 60 members, 12 are chosen for the standing committee. These selected members engage in discussions about TOR subjects with secretary-level government officials. The finalised TOR is then submitted for Cabinet approval.The significance of TOR lies in its function as a main reference document when a pay commission develops its recommendations.According to a TOI report, The government has kept the terms of reference undisclosed, yet the committee's primary responsibility involves examining the financial implications of non-contributory pension programmes.The central government's decision to transition from the National Pension System to Unified Pension Scheme for pre-2004 recruits lacks clarity on pension payment obligations.This absence of estimated liabilities has resulted in no budgetary allocations. Additionally, any increase in employee remuneration and benefits will inevitably lead to enhanced pension commitments.Central Pay Commissions are established periodically to assess and recommend changes to emoluments, retirement benefits and service conditions for Central Government employees.These recommendations are typically implemented on a ten-year cycle. Following this pattern, the 8th Central Pay Commission's recommendations would take effect from January 1, 2026.The 7th Pay Commission was established in February 2014, with its proposals taking effect from January 1, 2016.Central government staff receive dearness allowance (DA) to offset inflation's impact on their actual salary value. This DA rate undergoes regular revision every six months, with adjustments linked to inflation levels.","The 8th central pay commission’s proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel.

India-US trade deal soon?

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday hinted that Washington could soon reach a trade deal with India, emphasising that the two countries have strong bilateral ties.“If you look at India and Pakistan, so I'm doing a trade deal with India, and I have great respect and love. As you know, for Prime Minister Modi, we have a great relationship,” Trump said while speaking at a luncheon for APEC CEOs.Addressing business leaders, Trump revisited events from earlier this year and claimed he intervened to halt escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.According to him, his refusal to move ahead with a trade deal and the threat of punitive tariffs, prevented what he described as a looming conflict.“And I called Prime Minister Modi. I said, we can't make a trade deal with you. No, no, we must make a trade deal. I said, no, we can't. You're starting a war with Pakistan. We're not going to do it. And then I called Pakistan.”He went on to elaborate that he warned both nations of severe economic consequences if they continued hostilities.“And to be warned for the tariffs, I said I was going to put 250% tariffs on each country, which means that you'll never do business.In other words, there's nothing you can sell for 250%.”He further added, “That means that's a nice way of saying we don't want to do business with you. You don't have to say that because that's a nasty we don't want to do business. You say, we're going to put two hundred and fifty percent tariffs if you don't stop the war.”Trump has repeatedly claimed that his intervention prevented the war, claiming the threat of refusing trade deals forced India and Pakistan to step back.India, however, has maintained that the United States had no involvement in de-escalation efforts. According to New Delhi, the decision to cease hostilities was taken after a request from the Pakistani DGMO to his Indian counterpart.Trade relations between the US and India have been under strain in recent months. Washington imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods in response to India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, arguing that the imports were “helping to power Russia’s war machine.” Now, Indian imports to the US market are now subject to a 50% tariff.Earlier this week, EAM S Jaishankar also had a meeting with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Kuala Lumpur to discuss international relations and ongoing trade negotiations between their nations.","'nicest guy modi, great fighter munir': trump repeats india-pak truce claim; hints at trade deal.

Michael Carter II trade gives Eagles defensive flexibility



Why the Jets and Eagles both benefit from the swap



The Philadelphia Eagles have made another strategic midseason move, acquiring cornerback Michael Carter II from the New York Jets in a deal that could reshape their defensive flexibility. The trade sends Carter and a 2027 seventh-round pick to Philadelphia in exchange for wide receiver John Metchie and a 2027 sixth-round pick. It’s a small shift on paper but one that might carry a big impact for both sides.For the Eagles, this deal is about solidifying depth and experience in the secondary. Carter, who missed the Jets’ last game due to a concussion, was expected to be cleared after the bye week. In his five appearances this season, he posted 14 tackles and two pass deflections — modest numbers that don’t fully reflect his reliability in the slot. According to Pro Football Focus, Carter has played 85 percent of his career snaps at nickel corner, making him a natural fit for Philadelphia’s evolving defensive schemes.The Eagles have been experimenting with Cooper DeJean’s role, alternating him between the slot and outside coverage. Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio recently addressed that internal debate, saying, “We considered it. But when you have one of the better players at a certain position, and it’s an important position where you get involved more, you hate to take a really good player at one position to maybe not be as good of a player or impactful of a player at another position.But it’s definitely something that we’ve talked about.”That quote perfectly sums up the team’s dilemma — DeJean’s versatility is an asset, but the Eagles lacked a true nickel specialist. With Carter’s arrival, Fangio now has the flexibility to keep DeJean outside full-time if needed, strengthening both coverage spots without compromising defensive efficiency.While the Eagles gain a proven slot defender, the Jets offload a player who became expendable after the addition of Jarvis Brownlee Jr. Carter remains under contract through 2027 with $20.3 million left on his deal, though only $2.3 million is guaranteed, making the move financially low-risk for Philadelphia.The Eagles part ways with John Metchie, a talented receiver who never found his rhythm in their crowded offense. Despite showing flashes of potential in seven games, Metchie managed just four catches for 18 yards. The trade offers him a clearer path with the Jets, while Philadelphia effectively swaps a late-round pick for a defensive upgrade.Time will reveal how Michael Carter II fits into the Eagles’ rotation, but one thing is certain — his addition gives the Birds much-needed versatility and stability in the secondary, right when the season’s intensity is about to peak.Also Read: Cam Newton reacts to viral Alabama A&M mascot clash, reveals surprising reason behind the playful scuffle","Philadelphia eagles acquire cornerback michael carter ii from the new york jets.

Joe Alwyn is reportedly handling Taylor’s engagement with quiet grace

From heartbreak to healing: both stars move forward in different directions



Taylor Swift’s engagement to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has captured headlines across the world, but one person fans can’t stop wondering about is her longtime ex, Joe Alwyn. The British actor, who dated Swift from 2016 until their quiet split in 2023, has remained almost completely out of the spotlight since their breakup. Now, sources close to him are finally revealing how he feels about Taylor’s new chapter and it’s more complicated than fans might think.While many expected Joe to react emotionally to the engagement news, insiders say he’s showing remarkable maturity. “He genuinely hopes Taylor’s happy,” one source told RadarOnline, emphasizing that Joe has no plans to reach out or make a public statement. “For him, it’s time to move on for good,” the insider added.Those who followed Taylor and Joe’s relationship know that they kept their romance intensely private, a stark contrast to the very public love story she now shares with Kelce. During their six-year relationship, the two collaborated creatively, with Alwyn even co-writing several of Taylor’s Folklore and Evermore tracks under the pseudonym “William Bowery.”Their breakup marked the end of one of Swift’s most introspective eras, and while she has since moved on to global headlines and NFL stadium appearances, Joe has chosen the opposite path, retreating into his acting career and maintaining his signature low profile.Despite the emotional weight of seeing an ex move on so publicly, Joe seems content to focus on his career. He recently wrapped filming Panic Carefully alongside Julia Roberts and portrayed Laertes in a reimagined film adaptation of Hamlet.Meanwhile, Taylor’s own life couldn’t be more different. Her concert film, The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, grossed over $50 million this month, and her engagement to Kelce has made her one half of America’s most-watched couple.While Swifties debate whether Joe might secretly harbor lingering emotions, those close to him insist otherwise. For Joe, it’s not about jealousy, it’s about closure. After years of shared memories and creative collaboration, his quiet acceptance may be the truest sign of peace in a story the world can’t stop following.Also Read: Taylor Swift beams with pride as Travis Kelce hits 100th touchdown and breaks into her viral ‘Fate of Ophelia’ dance","Joe alwyn is reportedly handling taylor swift's engagement with quiet grace.

Josh Allen’s wife Hailee Steinfeld left out of ‘Sinners’ Oscar song submissions as studio focuses on top contenders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allens-wife-hailee-steinfeld-left-out-of-sinners-oscar-song-submissions-as-studio-focuses-on-top-contenders/articleshow/124898400.cms,"Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' is a strong awards contender, but Warner Bros. strategically submitted only two original songs for Oscar consideration. ""I Lied to You"" and ""Last Time (I Seen the Sun)"" were chosen to avoid splitting votes, despite fan outcry over Hailee Steinfeld's exclusion. Her track didn't meet Academy guidelines for inclusion in the film's narrative.

Only two tracks submitted for Best Original Song as strategy takes priority

Why Hailee Steinfeld’s contribution didn’t make the cut





Ryan Coogler’s Sinners has been positioned as one of the most powerful awards contenders of the year, a stylish vampire thriller with blockbuster appeal and prestige filmmaking credentials. From its bold production design to a breakout performance by Miles Caton, the film has checked nearly every box needed for a major Oscars campaign. But there’s one category where the studio made tighter decisions than fans expected: Best Original Song.Sinners arrived with a soundtrack packed full of original tunes and fan favorites. Yet Warner Bros. ultimately selected just two tracks to represent the film at the Academy Awards: “I Lied to You” by Raphael Saadiq and Ludwig Göransson, and “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” co-written by Caton and Göransson. According to the Oscars rulebook, “No more than three songs from any one film may be submitted for Original Song, regardless of writer(s). ”That means Sinners had room to put up one more contender, but insiders believe the studio wanted to avoid splitting voter attention. Both submissions already feature in emotionally powerful moments: one fuels a barn-burning time-shifting sequence, while the other rolls into the film’s credits, giving Caton another shot at recognition to pair with his Best Supporting Actor buzz.Fans were quick to ask why Hailee Steinfeld’s track, written and performed for the soundtrack, wasn’t included. The Academy’s guidelines provide the answer: songs must have “a clearly audible, intelligible, substantive rendition… used in the body of the motion picture or as the first new music starts in the end credits.”Steinfeld’s song doesn’t meet that threshold within the movie itself, knocking it out of Oscars contention, at least for now. It may still qualify for other honors such as the Grammys’ visual media categories.While disappointed supporters believe “Hailee Steinfeld song should be up there” because it was “different,” the strategic choice suggests Warner Bros. is laser-focused on maximizing wins in a competitive season, especially with fierce rivals like One Battle After Another dominating predictions.With the race heating up and music emerging as a secret weapon, Sinners is still well positioned for Academy gold, even if one fan-favorite track remains just outside the Oscar spotlight.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld embraces a new digital chapter as she brings ‘Beau Society’ to Substack and reflects on new beginnings with Josh Allen","Ryan coogler's 'sinners' is a strong awards contender, but warner bros. strategically submitted only two original songs for oscar consideration.

Coming from a modest family, Gabrielle Union worked her way in the industry and lives a life of luxury today with the NBA legend and their only daughter, Kaavia Wade.

Terry Rozier's unpaid tax led to Federal Tax Lien

Scary Terry's attorney reveals tax lien issue was resolved

Miami Heat's Terry Rozier was arrested by the FBI on Thursday, October 23 in Orlando, Florida, on charges of gambling and match fixing . Now, a new update has been made available to the public in the matter, after ESPN revealed that he owed $8.2 million in taxes, and was hit with a tax lien in 2023. Coincidentally, it was the same year that he was accused of match fixing during a game, while he was still playing for the Charlotte Hornets. Not so much of a coincidence now!As per the recent reports, when Terry Rozier was playing for the Charlotte Hornets back in 2023, he was in massive debt. The player owed the federal government $8.2M in unpaid taxes, and being unable to pay that, it resulted in a Federal Tax Lien. Instead of consulting with a CA or similar financial experts, it seems like he decided to go the gambling route - go big or go home, right?Unfortunately, he is not going to jail, after the point guard was arrested last week by the FBI on charges of illegal gambling and match fixing. This has been a multi-year investigation that has been going on for the last few years, and now finally the government is ready to take some action.According to Terry Rozier's attorney, the tax lien issue he was facing was resolved. In fact, according to Atty. Jim Trusty, the Miami Heat star never owed anyone any money. But the lien is a record that is publicly available, and so far, it has not been removed according to the available records. In a statement to the Associated Press, his attorney wrote:""There was never a debt of $8 million. Out of his total taxes owed in 2021 ($8m) he actually owed $9000.That was paid but the now-defunct lien still needs to be pulled from the local courthouse.""Along with charges of betting on games and manipulating outcomes, Rozier has also been changed with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. And although he was cleared back in January of this year by the NBA after being investigated on suspicious gambling activity, it seems like the investigation was not up to the mark if the FBI directly went and made the arrest. He has been put on leave since last week, and according to recent reports will not be receiving the salary during this period.Also Read: Sports gambling skyrockets as the FBI’s NBA probe raises questions","Miami heat's terry rozier was arrested by the fbi on thursday, october 23 in orlando, florida, on charges of gambling and match fixing.

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold



Also Read |





For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth. Coveted by collectors and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity and prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The asian arowana (scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.
