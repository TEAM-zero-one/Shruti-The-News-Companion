New Delhi: India and Russia on Friday vowed to scale up bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030, with PM Narendra Modi saying the target could be ach-ieved ""well ahead of schedule"".""Considering the tremendous potential in our partnership, I am confident that we will achieve this target well ahead of schedule. We are making rapid progress towards this goal,"" Modi said, recalling the target of $100 billion that he and President Vladimir Putin had set last year. The two leaders were speaking at the India-Russia Business Forum.Modi said India and Russia could jointly drive growth in the Global South with India's leadership in affordable EVs, two-wheelers and CNG mobility and Russia's strength in advanced materials, and could collaborate in vaccine development, cancer therapy and automotive components.The PM said both countries were ""actively working"" towards the early conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union - comprising Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.Putin said Moscow wanted to deepen cooperation across security, economy, trade and culture. ""What we want is the development of our multi-faceted relations with India in various fields,"" he said. Russian companies, he added, were ready to ""increase manifold"" their purchases of Indian goods and services.He stressed that free trade would require resilient payment systems and insurance mechanisms, an issue that has complicated settlements since financial sanctions on Russia. Putin said Russia was looking to expand energy cooperation with India and ready to ensure uninterrupted fuel shipments. Moscow, he said, was open to joint work on small modular reactors and even floating nuclear power plants. He also wanted to enhance industrial cooperation with a focus on new technologies such as AI.The first round of talks on FTA between India and the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union began last week. India wants to increase the composition of products in its trade basket with Russia as India exported goods worth $4.9 billion to Russia in 2024-25, while importing goods worth $63.8 billion, primarily crude oil and petroleum products, with a trade imbalance of $59 billion.","India and russia vow to scale up bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030.

Nations reaffirm anti-terror commitment

NEW DELHI: The long-standing extensive defence partnership between India and Russia will “reorient” itself from largely a buyer-seller relationship at present to joint R&D, co-development and co-production of advanced military technologies and systems.The joint statement issued after the Modi-Putin summit said this was in tune with India’s quest for self-reliance in defence production. Both sides agreed to encourage joint manufacturing in India of spare parts, components and other products for maintenance of Russian-origin arms as well as defence equipment under the Make in India programme through transfer of technology, it said.The two countries will also work to set up joint ventures to meet the needs of the Indian armed forces as well as “subsequently export to mutually friendly third countries”, it added.While no fresh defence deal was inked during the summit, as was expected, the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov on Thursday discussed India’s plan to procure another five squadrons of the S-400 ‘Triumf’ air defence systems and Rs 10,000 crore worth of their surface-to-air missiles for existing units, which performed extremely well during Operation Sindoor, as was earlier reported by TOI.In the air defence arena, India is also looking to acquire short-range Pantsir and man-portable Verba surface-to-air missile systems. Another procurement on the anvil is R-37 air-to-air missiles, with a range of over 200km, and its advanced version called RVV-BD to arm upgraded Sukhoi-30MKI fighters in IAF’s combat fleet.Joint production of advanced and lightweight variants of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles also figured in the talks. These BrahMos-NG missiles, for instance, will be able to arm even lightweight fighters instead of the present ones that only heavyweight Sukhoi-30MKI jets can carry.PM Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin expressed satisfaction with the regular military contacts between the two countries, while appreciating the ‘Indra’ joint military exercises between their armed forces. They reaffirmed their commitment to maintain the momentum of joint military cooperation activities and expand military delegation exchanges, the statement said.PM Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed their strong commitment to preventing and countering terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border movement of terrorists and terrorist financing networks and safe havens.“India and Russia have long stood shoulder to shoulder in the fight against terrorism. Whether it is the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, or the cowardly attack at Crocus City Hall, the root of all such incidents is the same. India firmly believes that terrorism is a direct assault on the values of humanity, and that global unity against it is our greatest strength,” said Modi in his media statement. According to the joint statement, the leaders unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation by any “religious or ideological pretexts, whenever, wherever, and by whomsoever they may be committed”.They also called for actions against all UN-listed terrorist groups and entities, including al-Qaida, ISIS/Daesh and their affiliates, aimed at rooting out terrorists’ safe havens.","The long-standing extensive defence partnership between india and russia will ‘reorient’ itself from largely a buyer-seller relationship at present to joint r&d, co-development and co-production.

Putin, Modi Supercharge India’s Atomic Future With Big Reactor Push And Next-Gen Mini Reactors

NEW DELHI: As the world watched the India-Russia summit intently, hoping PM Narendra Modi would nudge President Vladimir Putin towards an early end to the Ukraine war, Modi’s message to the president going into the bilateral meeting was that the welfare of the world lay in the path to peace that the international community must work together to find. Modi reiterated that India was not neutral but on the side of peace, while backing all recent efforts to bring the war to an end.Putin thanked Modi for his efforts to seek a solution and briefed him on ongoing efforts, including with the US, to resolve the crisis peacefully. Both leaders were very upfront about sharing their perspectives as they brought the issue up in their televised opening remarks, with Modi attributing their continued exchanges on Ukraine to the trust they share in their relationship.“We support every effort for peace and we stand shoulder to shoulder with every effort for peace. The entire world has passed through many crises, from Covid until now. We hope that very soon the world will get relief from these worries and on the path of progress in the right direction, a new hope will emerge for the global community,” said Modi, expressing confidence that ongoing efforts would soon see the world headed towards peace.He also said India had always been ready to contribute to such efforts and would remain so.India will hope that Modi’s message, along with the fact that there was no big-ticket announcement in sensitive areas like defence, will help soothe frayed nerves in the West, which has been visibly riled by India’s hosting of Putin, even if under the 25-year-old annual summit mechanism. India is in the advanced stages of a free trade agreement with both the US, which has slapped a 25% tariff on India for its oil trade with Russia, and EU.With EU at least, India is hoping to conclude negotiations in the next few weeks as it would clear the ground for a successful India-EU summit on Jan 27. Brussels has closely followed Putin’s visit, concerned that it could throw a spanner in its efforts to upgrade the relationship with India through the FTA, for which both sides are still required to address contentious issues like EU’s carbon tax and its insistence on a commitment to the Paris Agreement in the bilateral trade agreement. However, except for the optics of the summit, it’s unlikely that EU would tie itself up in knots over the outcomes that focused mostly on areas like economic cooperation, healthcare, migration and media.India’s fresh call for peace followed its decision earlier this week to abstain from voting on a UNGA resolution demanding an end to Russia’s forced relocation of Ukrainian children.“We have had continuous discussions on Ukraine. You have also, from time to time, as a true friend, kept us informed of all matters. I believe that this trust is a great strength. I have discussed this subject many times with you and have also placed it before the world: the welfare of the world lies in the path of peace. We must all search for the path to peace together,” said Modi in his opening remarks.In his opening remarks, Putin said he discussed at length the Ukraine issue with Modi at the private dinner the PM hosted for him on Thursday. “I could share a great deal of details about the events taking place in Ukraine and what is being undertaken by us jointly with some other partners, including the US, on the question of a possible peaceful settlement of this crisis. And the actions we are taking together with some partners including the US on a possible peaceful settlement,” said Putin, adding that the relationship with India was characterised by substance.","India will hope that modi’s message, along with the fact that there was no big-ticket announcement in sensitive areas like defence, will help soothe frayed nerves in the west. Putin thanked modi for his efforts to seek a solution and briefed him on ongoing efforts, including with the us, to resolve the crisis peacefully.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125798449,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-41860,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'Israel-India Defense Ties Are Long-Standing And Strategic': Expert Danny Citrinowicz

NEW DELHI: Israel has urged India to formally designate Hamas and other groups acting against it as terrorist organisations, saying that New Delhi’s position carries significant weight across South Asia.Senior officials from Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs, speaking in Jerusalem, said they believe India understands the “networks and linkages” behind these organisations. They stressed that Israel had already proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and now expects “reciprocation” from India.“Our request from India is to work hard to sanction and designate these organisations as terrorist groups. Israel designated Lashkar-e-Taiba a couple of years ago, and we would like to see this reciprocated,” one official said, as quoted by ANI.Israel also underlined what it described as strong ties between Hamas and LeT, and warned that Iran’s IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah have increasingly been relying on transnational criminal groups to conduct attacks.“You're not going to see an Iranian operative act directly in Europe. What you will see is a criminal group -- a drug lord, a human trafficker or another network -- connected to an Iranian handler who then carries out an attack, as we've seen in Scandinavia or in London,” the official said.The remarks came just days after a similar appeal from the Israeli Defence Forces. “It will be a good thing if India did. India and Israel have a common enemy. It will be good to have a clear statement on who we face,” Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, International Spokesperson for the IDF, said in Tel Aviv on December 1.Another official emphasised that even a declaratory move from India would have a “strong global impact”, given the influence India holds in the region. “Neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Maldives ‘look up to India’, and New Delhi’s stance shapes regional responses,” the official said.“It's not only about freezing assets or banning operatives from entering India. It signals that India has clearly seen what Hamas is doing, and no operative should step on Indian soil,” he added.“We are putting pressure on India to designate Hamas... After having designated Lashkar-e-Taiba, we would like to see the same,” the official said, noting “clear attempts” by Hamas to rebuild its structures and stressing that dismantling them remains central to the next phase of the US-proposed ceasefire.Hamas, founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, is designated a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Canada and several other countries. India condemned the October 7, 2023, attacks but has not yet listed Hamas under its domestic terrorism laws.",Israel has urged india to formally designate hamas and other groups acting against it as terrorist organisations.

Here are Prime Minister Narendra Modi's top quotes from the joint press conference

My friend President Putin, delegates from both countries - I am happy to welcome President Putin for the 23rd India–Russia Bilateral Summit. Twenty-five years ago, President Putin laid the foundation of our strategic partnership.

The world has witnessed many ups and downs in the last eight decades. However, the friendship between India and Russia has remained like a pole star. This relationship is built on mutual respect and trust... Today, we have held discussions on all factors that will help strengthen this relationship.

Energy security has been a strong pillar of our partnership, and we will continue this win-win cooperation. Our collaboration in civil nuclear energy has spanned decades and contributed to clean energy. Our cooperation in critical minerals is essential for maintaining a diverse and reliable global supply chain.

This year in October, millions of devotees received the blessings of Lord Buddha's sacred relics at the International Buddhist Forum in Kalmykia. I'm pleased that we will soon be launching a free 30-day e-tourist visa and a 30-day Group Tourist Visa for Russian citizen.

Top quotes from Putin's address

We are ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel for the growing Indian economy.

I thank President of India, Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister of India and all our Indian colleagues for the warm and hospitable welcome accorded to the Russian delegation...I thank PM Modi for the dinner at his residence yesterday.

Last year, our bilateral trade turnover grew by 12 per cent, setting a new record. We are currently forecasting that this year’s trade agreement will remain at the same impressive level.

The Prime Minister gave us a list of challenges that deserve the attention of both governments, and we will act on them. The creation of a Free Trade Agreement between India and the Eurasian Economic Union will help. Our countries are gradually moving to mutual settlements in national currencies, which already account for 96% of commercial transactions. We are also witnessing successful partnerships in energy - stable supplies of oil, gas, coal, and everything required for India’s energy needs.

India and Russia have long been standing shoulder to shoulder in the fight against terrorism. Whether it is the terrorist attack in Pahalgam or the cowardly attack on the Crocus City Hall, the root of all these incidents is the same. India's unwavering belief is that terrorism is a direct assault on the values of humanity and that global unity against it is our greatest strength. India and Russia have close cooperation in the UN, G20, BRICS, SCO, and other forums. We will continue our dialogue and cooperation in all these forums.

Our country, for the last half a century, has been helping to arm and modernise the Indian Army, including the Air Defence Forces, aviation, and the Navy. In general, we are undoubtedly satisfied with the results of the negotiation we just had...I can express my confidence that the current visit and the agreements reached will help further deepen the Russian-Indian strategic partnership for the benefit of our countries and the people, the peoples of India and Russia.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo's operational crisis entered its fourth straight day on Friday, triggering widespread chaos at airports across the country, leaving thousands of passengers stranded with no food, no water, vacant counters and lost luggages.IndiGo has suspended all departures from Delhi Airport until midnight on Friday, intensifying the ongoing travel chaos. This comes a day after the airline cancelled over 550 domestic and international flights, far exceeding its usual daily disruptions. The worst-hit routes were those connecting Pune, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Goa, triggering delays and congestion across major airports nationwide.According to PTI, airport-wise cancellations included 118 in Mumbai, 100 in Bengaluru, 75 in Hyderabad, 35 in Kolkata, 26 in Chennai and 11 in Goa, with several other airports reporting disruptions as well.Across airports, frustrated passengers complained about long queues, no staff support, uncertainty over alternative flights and hours-long waits at baggage belts.Many shared photos on X showing crowds sleeping on luggage, overflowing check-in areas and piles of unattended bags — unsure whether to go home or hope for a last-minute update.Sharing a post on X, one user wrote, ""Spent the last 4h at Bangalore airport. Some people have been here for more than 13 hours. Every single Indigo flight has been delayed significantly and then cancelled. I still find privilege in having the opportunity to try and get on any flight so I can get to my meetings, yet, no flights available until 24h from now. This is not progress. Thousands stranded.""Inside the terminal, long queues snaked across check-in counters and security lines, with seating areas completely full. A passenger travelling to Bengaluru told TOI that, ""My flight was scheduled to depart at 2.15 pm on Thursday. I rushed to see if I could get a ticket on another airline. But a ticket to Bengaluru had become pricier than a seat at a Taylor Swift concert. Clearly, other carriers were indulging in 'surge pricing. '""Later, when the passengers asked an IndiGo staffer about their delayed flight, he reportedly said: ""The plane is ready, but we don’t have a pilot to fly it,"" offering no clear answers on the delay or cancellation.At several airports, frustration boiled over — angry flyers protested at gates, and the chaos even disrupted boarding for other airlines.Airlines reportedly increased fares amid the crunch. A Delhi–Bengaluru ticket for Friday/Saturday ranged between Rs 11,000 and Rs 43,145, while Mumbai–Kolkata fares touched Rs 19,000.With IndiGo operating 65% of India’s domestic market, disruptions have hit other carriers too. Aircraft stuck at airports like Pune delayed the movement of other airlines.The DGCA held multiple emergency meetings and directed IndiGo to stabilise operations immediately and ensure fares do not rise due to reduced capacity.""To reduce passenger inconvenience while maintaining safety margins, IndiGo has requested operational variations/exemptions from specific FDTL provisions for A320 operations up to 10th February 2026. IndiGo has assured DGCA that corrective actions are underway and that normalized and stable operations will be fully restored by 10 February 2026,"" the DGCA said after meeting the airline management.IndiGo assured the regulator that ""normalized and stable operations will be fully restored by 10 February 2026."" The DGCA has asked IndiGo to submit a detailed roadmap on pilot hiring, training schedules, roster restructuring and safety assessments. A 15-day progress report is now mandatory.A DGCA inspection at Delhi’s Terminal 1 found passenger-handling manpower ""inadequate,"" and the airline has been told to urgently increase staff across affected terminals.Pilot associations have criticised IndiGo for poor planning. The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) alleged that despite getting a two-year preparatory window before the full implementation of new flight duty and rest period norms for cockpit crew, ""inexplicably adopted a hiring freeze"".In a statement on X, IndiGo said, ""The last two days have seen widespread disruption across IndiGo’s network and operations. We extend a heartfelt apology to all our customers and industry stakeholders who have been impacted by these events. IndiGo teams are working diligently and making all efforts with the support of MOCA, DGCA, BCAS, AAI and airport operators to reduce the cascading impact of these delays and restore normalcy. ""The airline urged passengers to check flight status before travelling.IndiGo has informed the regulator that more cancellations are likely in the coming days. Flight operations will be trimmed from December 8 to reduce disruptions.IndiGo operates more than 400 aircraft, runs over 2,300 flights daily, connects 90+ domestic and 45+ international destinations, and flew 118 million passengers in FY25. It was recently named ""Best Airline in India and South Asia"" at the 2025 Skytrax Awards.The government on Friday placed the new Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules in abeyance with immediate effect, saying the step was taken “solely in the interest of passengers” without compromising safety.Aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said the pause aims to stabilise IndiGo’s operations, which saw over 1000 cancellations today, with airports like Delhi witnessing no IndiGo departures.The ministry has ordered a high-level inquiry to fix accountability and prevent future disruptions.Airlines must now issue automatic refunds, provide hotel stays for stranded passengers, and prioritise seniors and persons with disabilities. Full normalisation is expected by Monday.The government has ordered an independent probe after preliminary findings pointed to gaps in IndiGo’s internal oversight, operational preparedness, and compliance planning.A four-member committee—comprising Joint DG Sanjay K. Bramhane, Deputy DG Amit Gupta, SFOI Capt. Kapil Manglik and FOI Capt. Lokesh Rampal—has been tasked with a comprehensive review of how the crisis escalated.The panel will examine causes of the disruption, manpower and rostering adequacy, compliance with revised FDTL norms, accountability for planning failures, and the airline’s mitigation efforts. It will submit its findings within 15 days for necessary regulatory action.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers on Friday said the airline expects fewer than 1,000 cancellations on Saturday, adding that operations should stabilise between December 10 and 15.Apologising to passengers, he said earlier corrective steps were insufficient, prompting a full system “reboot” that led to over 1,000 cancellations today, the highest so far.Elbers said DGCA’s relief in the implementation of FDTL norms was “of great help”.IndiGo, which usually operates 2,300 flights daily, has sharply reduced services as planning gaps triggered massive disruption nationwide.The government expects schedules to progressively improve over the weekend.Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu has held IndiGo’s “mismanagement” of crew planning under the new FDTL rules responsible for the massive disruptions.He was quoted by ANI as saying that other airlines had adapted to the revised flying-time norms, but IndiGo failed despite months of engagement by the ministry.The government has granted the airline temporary abeyance from FDTL norms and formed a committee to identify accountability.Naidu said the immediate priority is restoring normalcy, clearing airport backlogs, and ensuring support for affected passengers.He added that congestion should ease from tomorrow, with airports expected to return to regular flow.Indian Railways has stepped in to absorb the massive travel demand created by the IndiGo crisis, deploying 116 extra coaches on 37 trains across 114 augmented trips.These additions can carry up to 4,000 passengers per trip, accommodating 4,89,288 travellers overall. The Railways is also rolling out 30 new special trains with 18 coaches each, capable of transporting 30,780 passengers per trip, covering 21,16,800 passengers across 57 trips.With Northern Railways planning more specials, the overall arrangements are designed to handle 35,000 passengers per day, ensuring connectivity for nearly 26 lakh travellers during this period.IndiGo attributed the disruption to ""unforeseen operational challenges"" including technical issues, weather interruptions and the rollout of revised crew duty rules (FDTL norms).The DGCA, however, said the disruptions stemmed from misjudging manpower needs under the new rules that limit pilot duty hours and night landings. After reviewing data, the regulator said the airline’s crew requirements ""exceeded their anticipation"".IndiGo told the regulator that it currently has 2,357 captains and 2,194 first officers available for December. But the airline’s crew requirement has sharply risen since the second phase of the FDTL rules kicked in. In November, IndiGo needed 2,422 captains and 2,153 first officers, higher than October’s requirement of 2,186 captains and 1,948 first officers.The data shows a clear crew shortage, which is a major reason behind the ongoing flight disruptions. With the new FDTL norms also limiting the number of night landings per pilot, night operations have been hit the hardest. The airline admitted that crew requirements were higher than expected and shared its updated projections with the regulator.IndiGo underestimated how many crew members it would need after the second phase of FDTL rules kicked in on November 1. Despite this, the airline increased its domestic flights by 6% — from 14,158 in the summer schedule to 15,014 in the winter schedule starting October 26.This mismatch between flights and available pilots and crew has created a major crunch, turning into a double blow for passengers: cancelled flights and skyrocketing fares.""These disruptions have arisen primarily from misjudgement and planning gaps in implementing phase 2 of the flight duty time limitation, with the airline accepting the actual crew requirement for new (rules) exceeded their anticipation,"" the DGCA added.","Indigo has suspended all departures from delhi airport until midnight on friday, intensifying the ongoing travel chaos. This comes a day after the airline cancelled over 550 domestic and international flights, far exceeding its usual daily disruptions. The worst-hit routes were those connecting pune, bengaluru, mumbai, delhi, hyderabad, and goa.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125780312,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-106896,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

The Battle Pakistan Lost To India Days Before 1971 War | I Witness

NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on December 5, the third day of the 1971 war, underscoring how air power proved decisive in shaping the conflict’s outcome and paving the way for India’s victory and the creation of Bangladesh.In a post on X, the IAF recalled its strike on the Sakesar radar station, which crippled Pakistan’s key western air defences for two days.“On the third day of the 1971 war, the IAF was everywhere the enemy looked — and many places where they didn’t expect. Hunters tore through Drigh Road and Karachi, smashing storage hangars. Canberras kept up relentless pressure, delivering 1,44,000 lbs of ordnance across four major airfields,” the post said.The IAF added that 132 missions were flown on the western front, with An-12s and Canberras “raining devastation on enemy concentrations.” On the eastern front, with the Pakistan Air Force effectively grounded, 104 offensive sorties by the IAF cleared the way for the Indian Army’s rapid march into East Pakistan, ultimately leading to the birth of Bangladesh.It also recalled the legendary Battle of Longewala, fought from December 4 to 7, 1971, in Rajasthan’s Longewala sector, where heavily outnumbered Indian troops held their ground against a major Pakistani assault — a defence in which the IAF also played a crucial role.“Four Hunters rewrote history — shattering an enemy armoured thrust and leaving 27 tanks destroyed and 10 more damaged. Jaisalmer stood safe because air power arrived when it mattered,” the post highlighted.The 1971 India–Pakistan war began on December 3 with Pakistan launching pre-emptive strikes on Indian air bases amid the Bangladesh Liberation War in East Pakistan. The conflict ended on December 16 with Pakistan’s defeat, the surrender of 93,000 troops — the largest military capitulation since World War II — and the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation.","The indian air force (iaf) on thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on december 5, the third day of the 1971 war.

IndiGo says more cancellation in next few days

NEW DELHI: The Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise after IndiGo reported widespread operational disruptions and an unusually high number of flight cancellations across its network since late November 2025.Civil Aviation Minister reviewed the situation with senior MoCA officials and IndiGo’s top management, directing the airline and all relevant aviation bodies to take urgent steps to assist passengers and stabilise operations. The Ministry said it is keeping a “close watch” on the situation, according to DGCA's statement cited by ANI.""In addition, the Civil Aviation Minister has also held a meeting with senior officers of the Airport Authority of India and instructed AAI to inform all airport directors that they should constantly monitor the situation and provide all support to stranded passengers. He also directed DGCA to closely monitor the airfares during the flight disruptions/cancellations,"" according to the released statement.Apart from the ministry, DGCA, in a detailed review meeting chaired by the Director General (Civil Aviation), flagged concerns over IndiGo cancelling 170–200 flights per day, a level significantly higher than normal for the country’s largest airline.IndiGo attributed the disruptions to transitional challenges from the implementation of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) Civil Aviation Requirements, which came into effect in two phases — 01 July 2025 and 01 November 2025 — following court directions.The airline said the new fatigue-management rules, crew-planning issues, and winter operational constraints have sharply impacted scheduling stability.DGCA has directed IndiGo to normalise operations at the earliest and ensure that the current situation does not lead to fare increases.IndiGo has been instructed to submit:As DGCA released its statement assuring firm corrective action and close monitoring, IndiGo, however, informed the regulator that stabilising its network will require a short transition period. The airline told DGCA that additional cancellations will continue over the next two to three days as part of its schedule-reset effort aimed at restoring roster balance and preventing further last-minute disruptions, as reported by PTI.IndiGo has also conveyed that it will proactively scale down flight operations starting December 8 to minimise passenger inconvenience and allow crew-planning teams to rebuild buffers eroded over recent weeks. According to the airline, this controlled reduction in operations is essential to streamline rosters, align crew availability with revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms and ensure that fatigue-management standards are fully complied with.The carrier has assured DGCA that corrective measures are already underway and that full operational stability will be restored by February 10, 2026. IndiGo said its recovery plan includes accelerated crew recruitment, intensified training cycles and a phased reintroduction of flights once adequate staffing and roster resilience are secured.",The civil aviation ministry and the directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise.

India nears target but still bears 73% of South Asia’s malaria burden: WHO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-nears-target-but-still-bears-73-of-south-asias-malaria-burden-who/articleshow/125798085.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: India remains the centre of malaria transmission in the WHO South-East Asia Region, accounting for 73.3% of all estimated cases and nearly 89% of malaria deaths in 2024, even as the region records one of the world’s steepest declines in malaria, World Malaria Report 2025 showed.The region logged 4.79 lakh cases in 2024 — a 65.7% fall since 2015 — and just 99 reported deaths, but WHO estimates indicated a far larger burden of 2.7 million cases and 3,900 deaths, with India driving most infections and fatalities.Despite this dominance, India remains on track to meet the 2025 Global Technical Strategy goal of a 75% drop in incidence, having crossed a 70% reduction by 2024. Most districts continue to report sustained declines, tho-ugh localised outbreaks in forest belts and cross-border spillover from Nepal persist as major challenges.Children under 5 accounted for 8.7% of cases and 18% of deaths, while P.vivax, notoriously difficult to eliminate, caused nearly two-thirds of infections. The report credits the gains to aggressive interventions — large insecticide-treated net drives in India, Myanmar and Nepal; 143% growth in rapid testing since 2015; and 100% treatment coverage. Low-level pfhrp2/3 gene deletions were detected in India, but treatment failure for key ACTs remained below 5%, indicating continued drug efficacy.A key milestone highlighted was India’s exit from High Burden to High Impact group in 2024, marking its shift from a global high-burden nation to one nearing elimination in several states — a transformation few countries have achieved at this scale. Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste are malaria-free. WHO warns drug resistance, climate-related outbreaks and declining international funding threaten global progress.Dr Sunil Rana of Asian Hospital said malaria persists in India because timely healthcare fails to reach tribal and forest communities. “Longer mosquito-breeding seasons, delayed care-seeking, weak surveillance and unchecked migration through border zones keep outbreaks alive,” he said.","India remains the centre of malaria transmission in the who south-east asia region.

'Like Pole Star': PM Modi Lauds Strong Ties With Russia; Hails Moscow's Support In War On Terror

Relationship built on trust has stood test of time: PM

NEW DELHI: Amidst the turbulence the world has witnessed in the past eight decades, the India-Russia relationship has remained like the pole star, resting on mutual respect and trust, said PM Modi as both sides reaffirmed their commitment to upgrading the economic partnership in the summit with President Putin.The two countries signed more than a dozen agreements and MoUs, including in health, migration and maritime cooperation, and adopted a framework for economic cooperation that is expected to boost trade to $100 billion by 2030, as Putin said Russia is ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel to India.Russia is a reliable supplier of oil, gas, coal, and everything required for development of India’s energy, said Putin, hailing India’s “independent and self-sufficient” foreign policy. The Indian side maintained its energy partners, old or new, understood the need for diversification, given its focus on securing energy interests and the stability in oil prices.While there was a “general discussion” on defence including the Make in India initiative and legacy cooperation, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the focus was on economic cooperation and efforts to ensure balanced and sustainable trade by facilitating more Indian exports to Russia.Both leaders also strongly backed ongoing efforts for early conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with Eurasian Economic Union. Modi underlined the significance of civil nuclear cooperation, saying energy security has been a strong and vital pillar of the India-Russia partnership.“Over the past eight decades, the world has witnessed many ups and downs. Humanity has faced numerous challenges and crises. Yet, through all of this, the India-Russia friendship has remained steady like a guiding star. Built on mutual respect and deep trust, our relationship has stood the test of time,” said Modi, adding the new economic cooperation programme till 2030 would make trade and investment diversified and balanced. He said cooperation in critical minerals was vital to ensure secure and diversified supply chains across the world.India announced a free 30-day e-tourist visa and a 30-day group tourist visa for Russian citizens. The manpower mobility agreement will create new strength and new opportunities for both countries, said Modi, who also raised the need for early release of Indians serving in the Russian army with Putin.According to a joint statement — as both sides called for comprehensive reform of UN Security Council to reflect contemporary global realities — Russia reiterated its steadfast support for India’s permanent membership in a reformed council.Putin also said Russia and India were conducting independent foreign policy together with like-minded countries in BRICS and SCO and promoting a more “just and democratic multipolar world order”. “We are defending the main principles of the international law enshrined in the UN Charter. Among them, the right of any country for its own way of development and the preservation of their cultural civilisational identity, respect for sovereignty, careful balance of interests of all participants of the world community,” said Putin.“In general, we are undoubtedly satisfied with the results of the negotiations we just had,” said Putin in his media statement.On international issues, the leaders endorsed their cooperation in keeping Afghanistan free of terrorism and stressed the importance of resolving the Iran nuclear issue through dialogue. They also expressed concern, according to the joint statement, over the humanitarian situation in Gaza.","The two countries signed more than a dozen agreements and mous, including in health, migration and maritime cooperation. The framework for economic cooperation is expected to boost trade to $100 billion by 2030.

Russia Confirms Su-57 Fighter Jets, S-400 Deal On Agenda Ahead of Vladimir Putin’s India Visit

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin will begin his first visit to India in four years with a private dinner hosted by PM Narendra Modi Thursday. The two will discuss ways to shore up the special and privileged strategic partnership with a focus on economic ties, while exchanging views on key global and regional issues. The PM is expected to reiterate India’s position seeking early end to the Russia-Ukraine war and a return to dialogue and diplomacy. Putin had hosted Modi for a private dinner during the latter’s Russia visit last year for the annual summit.Putin’s main engagements are scheduled for Friday, beginning with a visit to Rajghat, followed by a ceremonial welcome at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The leaders will hold talks at Hyderabad House for the main summit. After lunch with Modi, Putin will participate in India-Russia Business Forum. He will return to Rashtrapati Bhavan, where President Droupadi Murmu will host a banquet in his honour.Putin’s aide Yury Ushakov said a joint statement was expected to be adopted and bilateral documents would be signed across a wide range of areas, including Program for the Development of Strategic Areas of Russian-Indian Economic Cooperation until 2030.Modi last held a bilateral meeting with Putin on the margins of SCO summit this year in Tianjin, and the two have spoken by phone five times in 2024.“This visit... provides an opportunity to discuss the extensive agenda of Russian-Indian relations comprehensively.

After S-400 Gamechanger, Putin & Modi Set For S-500 Monster Missile Pact | Full Detail

Tough to give India S-500 systems as of now, says official

NEW DELHI: India and Russia on Thursday agreed to further enhance their expansive defence partnership, including through collaboration in niche military technologies and stronger defence-industrial cooperation, which is likely to see Moscow continuing as New Delhi’s leading arms supplier for the foreseeable future, reports Rajat Pandit.Ahead of the Modi-Putin summit, defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov stressed ties were based on “a deep sense of trust, common principles and mutual respect” while inking a protocol on “ongoing and prospective areas” of defence cooperation.The 22nd inter-governmental commission on military and military-technical cooperation, co-chaired by the ministers, underlined India’s intent to retain its strategic autonomy despite mounting pressure from the US and EU to distance itself from Russia.Sources said discussions ranged from India acquiring additional S-400 Triumf air defence systems and their surface-to-air missiles in large numbers to upgrading IAF’s Sukhoi-30MKI fighter fleet and arming them with long-range R-37 and RVV-BD air-to-air missiles.The joint production of advanced variants of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as procurement of short-range Pantsir and man-portable Verba air defence systems also figured in the talks.“It will be difficult for Russia to supply advanced S-500 air defence systems as of now even if India wants them. Its fifth-generation Sukhoi-57 fighters are also on offer, but India is yet to take a decision,” an official said.Taking note during the meeting of the special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia, Rajnath Singh said India is determined to expand the capacity of its indigenous defence industry for both local production and exports under the aegis of ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ policy.Belousov, in turn, said Russian defence industry was ready to support India towards becoming self-reliant in defence production, highlighting that both the countries were “united by many years of friendship and strategic cooperation”.India also wants Russia to expedite deliveries of critical military hardware that have been hugely delayed due to the Ukraine war. These include the two remaining squadrons of the five S-400 squadrons contracted for $5.43 billion in 2018 as well as the advanced Akula-class nuclear attack submarine, which was supposed to arrive this year on a 10-year lease under the $3 billion deal signed in March 2019. “Russia says the two S-400 squadrons will be delivered next year, while the submarine will come in 2028,” a source said.India plans to acquire another five S-400 squadrons, while defence ministry has also cleared the Rs 10,000 crore procurement of 280 of its missiles with interception ranges of 120km, 200km, 250km and 380km to replenish stocks used during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities with Pakistan as well as build reserves, as was earlier reported by TOI.IAF also wants R-37 air-to-air missiles, with a range of over 200km, and its advanced version called RVV-BD to arm its upgraded Sukhoi-30MKI fighters. This will counter Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 long-range missiles that initially caught it off-guard during Operation Sindoor.Advanced lighter versions of BrahMos missiles, whose strike range has already been enhanced to 450km from the initial 290km and will eventually go up to 800km, are also on the cards.While the heavyweight Sukhoi fighters armed with BrahMos missiles had carried out long-range precision strikes against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, the plan now is to go for smaller air-launched BrahMos-NG missiles that can be carried by lightweight jets as well.The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles with a 2.8-Mach speed becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.","India and russia agree to further enhance their expansive defence partnership.
