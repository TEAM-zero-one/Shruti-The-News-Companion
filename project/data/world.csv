Ties normalisation contingent on public safety talks: Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eam-jaishankar-canadian-fm-laud-progress-in-2025-roadmap/articleshow/125289277.cms,"Canada FM Anita Anand Visits India To Strengthen Bilateral Trade, Energy And Security Cooperation

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand met on the margins of the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Canada, amidst efforts by both sides to rebuild the relationship after the diplomatic row over the killing of a Sikh separatist in 2023. While both sides appreciated progress in implementation of the new roadmap that was launched during Anand’s visit to India last month, the Canadian minister also stressed the significance of ongoing law enforcement dialogue between the two countries.While India sees the dialogue as important to check the anti-India activities of Khalistan separatists in Canada, Ottawa considers essential for the safety and security of its own citizens. In an interview to ToI last month, Anand had said Canadians have the right to feel safe and secure in their own country.“Appreciated the progress in implementation of the New Roadmap 2025. Look forward to the further rebuilding of our bilateral partnership,” said Jaishankar after the meeting. India was among the guest countries that were invited to participate in the G7 meeting in the Niagara-on-the-Lake town.After the 2 sides announced a series of measures last month in a joint statement to normalise the relationship, including through trade discussions, Canada’s minister for international trade Maninder Sidhu arrived in India on Wednesday to explore opportunities in trade and investment.However, Ottawa also maintains, and as Anand reiterated at a press event, rule of law and public safety concerns are foremost in the advancement of the relationship. Anand recalled the joint statement that sought a constructive relationship based on mutual respect for rule of law and a commitment to upholding the principles of sovereignty and territorial integritySignificantly, Anand, who has maintained that Canada will carry forward the relationship with a step-by-step approach, also asserted that the normalisation will be contingent on the law enforcement dialogue. “We are taking the relationship step by step to ensure that we are stressing the importance of public safety and security in the interests of all Canadian citizens, first and foremost...it will be systematic, and it will not occur unless we can ensure that this public safety dialogue continues,” said Anand in an interview to Canada’s CBC Radio. She was responding to a query on whether Canada can have a relationship with a country accused of violating its sovereignty.","Canada fm anita anand visits india to strengthen bilateral trade, energy and security cooperation.

Global carbon emission projected to hit record high in 2025; Renewable energy push makes emission growth in India & China slower,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-carbon-emission-projected-to-hit-record-high-in-2025-renewable-energy-push-makes-emission-growth-in-india-china-slower/articleshow/125287789.cms,"NEW DELHI: Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels are projected to rise by 1.1% in 2025, reaching record high of 38.1 billion tonnes, over 2024 with the US heading for the highest percentage increase of 1.9% followed by India (1.4%), China and the EU (0.4% each) among the big four emitting countries, shows Global Carbon Budget - an annual, peer-reviewed report released on Thursday.It says the emissions in India and China are, however, growing more slowly from 2024 to 2025 than in recent years due to strong growth in renewable energy in both the countries.Growth rate from 2023 to 2024 was the highest at 4% for India and 0.7% for China whereas the EU and the US reported a decline of 2.6% and 0.6%, respectively, when the overall global emissions increased by 0.8%. In 2024, the largest absolute contributions to global fossil CO2 emissions were from China (32%), the US (13%), India (8%), and the EU (6%).On the positive side, total CO2 emissions – the sum of fossil and land-use change emissions – have grown more slowly in the past decade (0.3% per year), compared to the previous decade (1.9% per year).The 20th edition of the annual report, produced by an international team of more than 130 scientists under the Global Carbon Project, however, underlined that though decarbonisation of energy systems is progressing in many countries, this is not enough to offset the growth in global energy demand.As a result, the remaining carbon budget for keeping the world within 1.5 degree Celsius of warming (around 170 billion tonnes of CO2 ) will be exhausted in about four years if emissions continue at current levels.The remaining carbon budget is the amount of carbon dioxide that can still be emitted while keeping global warming within a certain temperature limit, such as 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels. The budget is rapidly diminishing as emissions from fossil fuels and land-use change continue to far outpace the rate at which carbon is removed from the atmosphere.“The remaining carbon budget for 1.5 degree C, 170 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, will be gone before 2030 at current emission rate. We estimate that climate change is now reducing the combined land and ocean sinks - a clear signal from Planet Earth that we need to dramatically reduce emissions,” said Pierre Friedlingstein of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute, who led the study.According to the report, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is set to reach 425.7 ppm in 2025, 52% above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels.The report says, “With no sign of the urgently needed decline of global emissions, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere – and the dangerous impacts of global warming – continue to increase.”“It is 10 years since the Paris Agreement was negotiated, and despite progress on many fronts, fossil CO2 emissions continue their relentless rise. Climate change and variability are also having a discernible effect on our natural climate sinks. It is clear that the countries need to lift their game. We now have strong evidence that clean technologies help reduce emissions while being cost effective compared to fossil alternatives,” said Glen Peters, senior researcher at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research.",Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels are projected to rise by 1.1% in 2025.

Ladakh airbase close to China border activated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladakh-airbase-close-to-china-border-activated/articleshow/125285799.cms,"Nyoma airbase underwent Rs 230cr upgrade

NEW DELHI: In a major booster shot for military capabilities in eastern Ladakh, India on Wednesday operationalised its new Nyoma airbase close to the frontier with China, even as a large Army exercise called 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' is now under way in Arunachal Pradesh on the eastern front.The developments at the opposite ends of the 3,488-km LAC underscore the high military readiness being maintained along the China frontier. ""There is ongoing reset in bilateral diplomatic ties. Military CBMs are also being progressively strengthened but the trust deficit on the ground remains high,"" a senior officer told TOI. ""With no de-escalation along LAC, troops will continue to be forward deployed for 6th successive winter since multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020,"" he said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, to formally inaugurate the strategically located airbase. He was accompanied by Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Jeetendra Mishra.Located just about 35 km from the LAC, Nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth Rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway, a new ATC complex, hangars, crash bay and accommodation, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Mudh airfield is now fully capable of handling and sustaining operations by heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. Primarily, it will help quickly rush troops, weapons and supplies to areas such as Pangong Tso, Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026 though high altitude will be a limiting factor. China has assiduously upgraded all its airbases facing India over the last five years to offset the terrain constraints due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.China now has additional fighters, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones deployed at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports all along the LAC.In the far reaches of the Eastern Himalayas, thousands of soldiers from the 3 Spear Corps of the Indian Army, along with elements of IAF, ITBP and others, are now also engaged in the 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' exercise in the high-altitude terrain of Mechuka and other areas of Arunachal Pradesh.From airlift and force projection to mountain warfare manoeuvres and multi-domain integrated operations, the exercise aims at validating rapid mobilisation, operational logistics and precision-strike capabilities. ""The right force must reach the right place at the right time during conflicts,"" an officer said.While Nyoma will be another operational base for the IAF in Ladakh after Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and the Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground), India has also progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, civil ALGs in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal) of the LAC are also now being increasingly used for military purposes.","Nyoma airbase underwent rs 230cr upgrade and is among the world's highest at 13,710 feet.

CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.",Cji b r gavai calls 1979 rape verdict a'moment of institutional embarrassment' he says it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable.

How Kashmir’s Jaish Posters Led To Delhi’s Red Fort Blast And Exposed A Nationwide Terror Network

Chidambaram’s earlier warning during Operation Sindoor debate

NEW DELHI: Former home minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Wednesday slammed the Centre over its “discreet silence” on what he described as the growing threat of homegrown terrorism.His statement comes two days after the Delhi bomb blast near Lal Quila Metro station that killed 12 people and injured several others.In a post on X addressing the recent Delhi blast and the arrests of educated professionals allegedly involved in the plot, Chidambaram reiterated his long-held concern over the rise of “homegrown terrorism” in India.Chidambaram wrote: “I have maintained before and after the Pahalgam terror attack that there are two kinds of terrorists — foreign-trained infiltrated terrorists and home-grown terrorists. I said so in Parliament during the debate on Operation Sindoor . I was mocked and trolled for the reference to home-grown terrorists. However, I must say that the government observed a discreet silence because the government knows that there are home-grown terrorists too. The point of this tweet is we should ask ourselves what are the circumstances that turn Indian citizens — even educated persons — into terrorists.”His remarks come amid revelations that several suspects have been arrested in the Delhi blast case. This includes doctors Muzammil Ganaie, Adeel Ahmad Rather, Shaheen Shahid and Umar Un Nabi who were allegedly part of a Faridabad-based terror module linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed .Chidambaram’s latest remarks mirror his warning in Parliament during the Operation Sindoor debate. The counter-terror operation was launched after the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.During the debate, Chidambaram had questioned the government’s handling of the Pahalgam terror attack and the subsequent operation.Raising concerns over the lack of transparency, he asked, “Where are the terrorist attackers? Why have you not apprehended them, or even identified them? A news item had emerged about the arrest of a few people who gave the attackers shelter. What happened to them?”He further questioned the government’s reluctance to disclose details of the probe.“The Government is unwilling to disclose what the NIA has done all these weeks. Have they identified the terrorists, where they came from? For all we know, they could be homegrown terrorists. Why do you assume that they came from Pakistan? There’s no evidence of that,” Chidambaram said.His statement had sparked a sharp backlash from the BJP benches, with Home Minister Amit Shah accusing the Congress leader of “trying to give a clean chit to Pakistan.”Union home minister went on to detail the evidence gathered by investigating agencies.“NIA had already arrested those who gave them shelter. Those who fed them were detained. When the terrorists’ dead bodies reached Srinagar, they were identified as the three people who carried out the terror attack in Pahalgam. The rifles seized from them matched the FSL reports,” Shah said.Following the backlash, Chidambaram defended himself, accusing critics of distorting his remarks. He wrote on X, “Trolls are of different kinds and use different tools to spread misinformation.”","Chidambaram’s latest remarks mirror his warning in parliament during the operation sindoor debate.

Gisele Bündchen's shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining when a chapter ends, a new one begins..Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?",Supermodel gisele bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former nfl quarterback tom brady.

Megan Thee Stallion’s testimony remains central as court affirms conviction



Lanez faces prison reality as Megan Thee Stallion’s star continues to rise



A California appeals court has denied rapper Tory Lanez’s final attempt to overturn his conviction for shooting Megan Thee Stallion , marking a decisive legal victory for the Houston-born Grammy winner. The ruling, issued Wednesday by the California 2nd District Court of Appeal, leaves Lanez’s 10-year prison sentence intact, nearly five years after the violent incident that captured global attention.The appellate judges rejected Lanez’s arguments that his trial was unfair and that evidence had been wrongly admitted. The decision means Megan Thee Stallion, now romantically linked to Dallas Mavericks star Klay Thompson, can finally close one of the darkest chapters of her career. Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, was convicted in December 2022 of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, having a loaded, unregistered weapon in a vehicle, and discharging it with gross negligence.During the 2022 trial, Megan Thee Stallion, born Megan Pete, testified that Lanez shot at her feet after an argument that followed a party at Kylie Jenner ’s Hollywood Hills home in July 2020. She told jurors that as she tried to walk away, Lanez shouted “Dance, b***h!” before firing several shots.Bullet fragments were later surgically removed from both of her feet.The appeals panel, led by Judge Anne H. Egerton, found that “the testimony was more than sufficient to support the jury’s finding that Peterson personally inflicted great bodily injury.” Egerton also ruled that the trial judge acted appropriately in allowing the jury to hear key evidence, including a recorded interview with Kelsey Harris, a friend who was in the SUV that night.“Once on the stand, to say Harris was a reluctant witness is an understatement,” Egerton wrote, defending the prosecution’s decision to present her earlier statement that directly implicated Lanez. The court also dismissed claims that prosecutors had introduced racial bias by mentioning Lanez’s tattoos, calling any potential error “harmless.”Lanez’s legal team had argued he was denied a fair trial, citing procedural errors and alleged prejudice from social media narratives. The judges, however, unanimously rejected those claims, stating, “We find no prejudicial error and, accordingly, affirm Peterson’s conviction.”The 33-year-old rapper, currently serving his sentence at the California Men’s Colony near San Luis Obispo, reportedly survived a stabbing attack earlier this year.Meanwhile, Megan Thee Stallion has continued to ascend in her career, with chart-topping hits and high-profile performances. Stallion’s romance with Klay Thompson has also been the talk of the town since the couple started dating in mid-July 2025.Also Read: “He was so skilled” – Lakers legend Magic Johnson mourns loss of his dear NBA friend who passed away after battling cancer","California appeals court affirms conviction of tory lanez for shooting megan thee stallion.

Conor McGregor’s legal team seeks a fresh appeal in the Supreme Court



A panel of three Supreme Court judges will meet on Thursday to review Conor McGregor’s application for a further appeal in a civil case where a jury found he assaulted Nikita Hand in a Dublin hotel. The meeting will take place in private, and the panel’s decision on whether to allow the appeal will be announced later. The judges' panel includes Ms Justice Elizabeth Dunne, Ms Justice Iseult O’Malley, and Mr Justice Séamus Woulfe, who will only permit the appeal if they find it raises a matter of public importance or is in the interests of justice.Last July, the Court of Appeal (CoA) dismissed McGregor’s appeal against the High Court civil jury’s finding that he assaulted Ms Hand at the Beacon Hotel on December 9th, 2018. The Court of Appeal also upheld the jury’s decision to award Ms Hand €250,000 in damages and ruled that McGregor must pay her legal costs.Since the Court of Appeal ruling, Conor McGregor has hired Mulholland Law to represent him in his application to the Supreme Court. The same firm is also acting for James Lawrence, who is seeking an appeal related to legal costs in the same case. Both applications will be considered by the court on Thursday.Mulholland Law filed the applications in September. In a statement at the time, it said McGregor and Lawrence were “deeply disappointed” by the lower court decisions.Mr Mulholland said McGregor’s application focuses on his right to silence, which he “properly exercised on occasions.” McGregor had replied “no comment” when questioned by gardai about Ms Hand’s allegations.During his CoA appeal, McGregor tried to introduce new evidence to challenge parts of Ms Hand’s story, including how she got her bruises. The new statements were later withdrawn. The CoA then allowed Ms Hand’s lawyers to refer some material to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Gardai later investigated and questioned two people, who were released without charge. A file is now being sent to the DPP for review.The UFC superstar is rumored to be back in the ring in June 2026 for a White House event. For now, the former UFC champion will await the Supreme Court’s decision, a verdict that could redefine his career and reputation.Also Read: Christian Lee opens up about brutal side of MMA ahead of ONE 173 rematch with Turkish fighter Alibeg Rasulov","Three supreme court judges will meet on thursday to review conor mcgregor's application for a further appeal in a civil case.

Sued for a repost? MAGA disowns Kash Patel, stands with Elijah









Right-wing podcaster Candace Owens has now called for FBI director Kash Patel's resignation after his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins sued Elijah Schaffer for $5 million. Schaffer, a MAGA podcaster, reposted a thread on the viral conspiracy theory that Wilkins is a Mossad agent and she honeytrapped Kash Patel. Schaffer did not add anything on his part to the viral thread but posted a photo of Patel with his girlfriend.Schaffer became the third MAGA operative to have been sued by Kash Patel's girlfriend -- the other two being Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent, and Sam Paker , an influencer. Wilkins repeatedly dismissed these conspiracy theories about her and asserted that she has no connection with Israel, never been there, and she has been dating Kash Patel before Patel became the FBI director.As the conspiracy theory is being churned by MAGA insiders, it is clear that Patel has been isolated inside MAGA. And now, Candace has openly called for Patel's resignation. ""Kash Patel has to step down. This is excruciatingly embarrassing. He’s a teenager in love representing the Federal government,"" Candace said.Responding to the lawsuit in a post on X, Schaffer called it ""the legal equivalent of your romantic partner getting mad at you for cheating on her in her dream"".""Totally delusional and paranoid legal behavior - still can’t believe Kash is trusted w/ the FBI & sanctioned this stupidity,"" Schaffer wrote. Schaffer also appealed to Elon Musk for help reminding Musk that he once said he would pay for the legal fees of anyone sued for their free speech posts on X.Elijah Schaffer is where MAGA drew the line and pushed back on Alexis Wilkins' lawsuits. MAGA activists ranted that the FBI director has no real job but to fund his girlfriend's lawsuits against people who share some posts on social media.But Patel made it clear before that he would not allow any attack on his family. In a long post that he recently made, he also hinted that the attacks were coming from supposed allies. “The disgustingly baseless attacks against Alexis — a true patriot and the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life — are beyond pathetic. She is a rock-solid conservative and a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes. I’m so blessed she’s in my life. Attacking her isn’t just wrong — it’s cowardly and jeopardizes our safety. My love of family will always be my cornerstone, and you will never tear that down or keep me from them,"" Patel wrote a few days ago.","Elijah schaffer, a maga podcaster, reposted a thread on the viral conspiracy theory that alexis wilkins is a mossad agent and she honeytrapped kash patel.

Chael Sonnen calls out Dana White for his comments against Jon Jones

It came as a pleasant surprise to fans when Alex Pereira called out Jon Jones to return to the ring. These two martial artists have the power to set the White House octagon on fire, and everyone knows it. Except maybe UFC CEO Dana White, who is not too keen on that collaboration. Fans have been asking for this duo to grace the White House for a while, so when Pereira himself gave a shout out, it exploded.But White is still on the fence on the matter, and does not think Jon Jones is someone he can trust to be a part of such an event. His comments have not gone unnoticed, and many people have said that the CEO is taking it personally rather than professionally. Chael Sonnen is one of them, and did not hold back on his opinion.Alex Pereira recently made a simple call out, “Jon Jones. White House. Chama.” Fans who had been asking for this fight to happen, are more than ecstatic, ready to see these two people come together for a match that could be one of the defining events of this decade. But Dana White being unwilling of this collaboration is what is standing as the biggest hurdle.And Chael Sonnen had some things to say on the matter, especially to the UFC CEO.""Then you got a position when you talk about, ‘I can’t trust Jon. I can’t put him on a card.’ That’s small.""Sonnen also spoke of how evenly matched a fight between Alex Pereira and Jon Jones is.“This is completely unforeseen, that ‘Poatan’ would want this match...All of a sudden, you don’t have a weight discrepancy. You don’t even have an age discrepancy. There’s nowhere you can turn and go, ‘That doesn’t make sense.’ Oh yeah. No, it makes a lot of sense.”Whether a fight between Jon Jones and Alex Pereira will be possible or not is still a matter to be decided.

‘Deport Him…’: Team Trump Moves To Strip Mamdani Of US Citizenship After NYC Win

New York will survive, but will get worse before it gets better







Billionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai as he pledged to freeze rents because tenants' incomes have stagnated. Sternlicht who has both commercial and residential holdings in NYC said when one neighbor finds out that their neighbor is not paying, they stop paying and thus NYC will turn into Mumbai.“Over $100 million, every project in New York has to go union, and it’s super expensive. It leads to extremely expensive housing. And other developers have tried to cut deals with the unions, but they rule New York, and that’s one of the key reasons the blue states are so expensive and they’re so difficult to add supply of housing to,” Sternlicht said in an interview with CNBC Property Play, reacting to Mamdani's win.“And then the far left gets really nuts and says the tenants don’t have to pay. Well, you can’t kick them out if they don’t pay. So the neighbor finds out the neighbor isn’t paying, and they don’t pay, and the next guy doesn’t pay, and then you’re basically going to turn New York City into Mumbai,"" he said.Sternlicht said his New York team is considering leaving the city as well.“The core issues are not what he’s focusing on. We need to increase housing.That’s not going to happen easily, right? You need serious subsidies from the government if they want us to work with unions. The unions have to be more accommodative on their work laws and the wages and everything else, otherwise you can’t add economically,"" he said. Sternlicht said rent freezing is not the solution but increasing housing is.Sternlicht said he believed New York will survive but will first gets a lot worse before it gets better. “People are working really hard. Just how do we help others to do well and believe in the American dream? That’s probably a better message for a leader in the city than saying, let’s just tax everyone who’s been successful, force them to leave and then have to rely on Washington for handouts to basically keep the city going,” Sternlicht added.",Billionaire real estate investor barry sternlicht said new york will turn into mumbai under new mayor zohran mamdani's administration.

MAGA supporters were not happy and erupted online over the president’s comments.

“Maybe POTUS doesn't know we have engineers and techies who are on that unemployment line, or far under employed because the companies who hire H1Bs don't advertise to Americans. Ignorance is not becoming in a president,” one wrote.

“When a president loses faith in his own people, he forfeits the nation’s soul. To distrust your citizens while flooding the country with 600,000 students from a rival power isn’t leadership—it’s betrayal. A nation without trust cannot stand.”

“Horrific, insulting answer to the hundreds of thousands of displaced workers in tech and beyond. Meanwhile new grads sit in the unemployment line so someone from mostly 1 other country can take their place.”

“I don't know who you are lady, but you just absolutely permanently destroyed what remained of the positive image that I, and many others, had of Trump. Thanks for revealing who he really is.”

“Thanks for doing your job. It's too bad POTUS turned his back on the American people and sold us out to foreigners and big corporations.”





US President Donald Trump’s latest comments on H-1B visas stirred a row within his MAGA base, after he appeared to soften his tough stance on immigration by suggesting the US should welcome more foreign workers to the land of bald eagles.In a Fox News interview with Laura Ingraham on Tuesday, Trump said that the US is in dire need of skilled immigrant workers in key industries.“I agree, but you also have to bring this talent,” he said when asked whether H‑1B visa reform remains a top priority. He added that while he supports raising wages for American workers, the US cannot rely solely on long-term unemployed Americans for highly technical roles in manufacturing or defence.When the interviewer said there was plenty of talent in the US and no need to flood industries with thousands of foreign workers, Trump denied it without hesitation.“No, you don't. There are certain skills you don't have, and people have to learn them. You can't take people off the unemployment line and say, 'I'm going to put you into a factory where we're going to make missiles,’” Trump said.The GOP leader also argued that industries requiring specialised expertise cannot be filled by untrained or long-term unemployed workers. “You can't just say a country is coming in, going to invest $10 billion to build a plant, and take people off the unemployment line who haven't worked in five years, and they're going to start making missiles. It doesn't work that way,” he said.Trump’s remarks come after his administration implemented a $100,000 fee for new H‑1B visa applications in September.","'you don't have talent in us': donald trump’s shocking shift on h-1b visa policy debate.

Why Nalin's 'America first' stance stands out



Where this might lead







At 24, Nalin Haley is the son of Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations.The Indian-American elite was raised in the public eye and educated at Villanova University. Recently, Nalin has stirred a row due to his outspoken views on immigration and foreign-worker visas.In an interview with Fox News, Nalin made clear that there is no need for foreign worker visas: “At the end of the day, my loyalty is to America and that’s part of assimilation.” He went on to say, “We need to get rid of the foreign worker visas. We need to ban H‑1B visas. And we need to punish companies that are not putting American workers first and are putting foreigners first. It is a massive problem.”He also explained the personal reason behind the position: “My main friend group graduated with great degrees from great schools. It’s been a year and a half since graduation. Not one of them has a job.”Given his mother’s Indian-American heritage, Nalin’s stance has sparked considerable debate. While some MAGA activists have celebrated his anti-immigration position, others have pointed out his own roots as a form of hypocrisy.Nalin said: “I mean, they shouldn’t be because I’ve seen how it’s affected my friends and those around me. At the end of the day, my loyalty is to America.”Nalin’s argument focuses on assimilation and national identity. He takes a firm stance against those who think they can stay as they were, saying they need to fully embrace American culture.Nalin criticised previous approaches to immigration and said people need to ""assimilate"": “What we saw with Obama is that we had a lot of immigrants coming here, and the thought was, ‘Oh, you don’t need to change. You don’t need to have your loyalty to America. You could be who you are’. No, you need to assimilate. And you need to act like an American and support American values and support American workers and American people. ”Nalin is not currently in elected office; however, his views align with a strand of American political discourse that favours tightening legal immigration, prioritising American workers over H‑1B visa holders, and reassessing corporate reliance on foreign-worker visas. His remarks could influence younger conservative voices and reflect generational frustrations in the job market.","Nalin haley is the son of nikki haley, the former south carolina governor and us ambassador to the united nations.
