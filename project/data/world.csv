GUWAHATI: The 1,840km Arunachal Frontier Highway project, to be launched by PM Narendra Modi on Sept 22, is designed to link all major river valleys in the state, enabling Army to move swiftly between sectors, reduce response time, and improve logistics in the face of growing Chinese infrastructure near the border.The highway could also unlock the economic potential of remote border regions. The Union govt intends to invest Rs 2,205 crore across 122 villages along the eastern frontiers under its Vibrant Villages Programme, linking them via feeder roads and boosting infrastructure as part of a civilian-led response to China's militarised ""Xiaokang"" border villages.""The alignment runs at an elevation of 300 to 400 metres. The highway will be within 20 to 80km of McMahon Line,"" state PWD (highways) chief engineer CS Choutang told TOI. ""There are a lot of challenges, and we are hoping to complete project by 2028-29.""MoRTH is funding the project while BRO, NHIDCL and the state PWD will be the implementing agencies.In a post on X, the CMO said PM will also inaugurate several other projects, including the Tato-I and Heo hydroelectric plants along the proposed highway, on Sept 22.Lt Gen Rana Pratap Kalita (retd), a former GOC-in-C of Army's Eastern Command, said, ""This highway closes the gaps between multiple valleys and the forward areas.This is a major advantage from a defence point of view. If one needs to travel from Tawang to Subansiri, you currently have to go through Assam.""On China's infra build-up along the LAC, Kalita said, ""Their geography is different. That's a barren plateau. They face fewer challenges; only limiting factor is altitude. On our side, the gradients are extremely steep from foothills to the highest point, climbing from 200m to 18,000-19,000m.""","The 1,840km arunachal frontier highway project is designed to link all major river valleys in the state.

"Indian techie shot dead by US police: What cops claim, what kin allege - 10 things to know about the incident",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-student-shot-dead-by-us-police-what-cops-claim-what-kin-allege-10-things-to-know-about-the-incident/articleshow/123988190.cms,"Poll Do you think more measures are needed to protect citizens abroad? Yes, more measures required No, current measures are adequate

Here are ten things to know about the incident:

A 32-year-old man from Telangana’s Mahabubnagar district, Mohammad Nizamuddin, who had moved to the United States in 2016 to pursue higher education, was allegedly shot dead by police in Santa Clara, California on September 3. Nizamuddin had first studied at Florida College before joining a private company, where his performance earned him a promotion that eventually took him to California, according to his family’s account. His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, a retired teacher, expressed shock and grief, saying he was informed only recently about his son’s killing, which reportedly occurred weeks earlier in the United States. The family claimed they were left in the dark for nearly two weeks, learning about Nizamuddin’s death only on September 18, when a friend from Raichur, Karnataka, informed them of the tragic news. According to reports, the incident began with a quarrel among roommates over an air-conditioning issue, which escalated into a violent scuffle involving knives before neighbors called police for help. The Santa Clara Police department said its officers responded to a 911 call reporting a stabbing, encountered Nizamuddin holding a knife, and opened fire, which led to him being shot. Police chief Cory Morgan defended the officer’s actions, saying that the shooting likely prevented further harm and may have saved the life of another roommate who had already been stabbed. Nizamuddin’s relatives, however, have raised questions about the speed of the police response, alleging that no proper inquiry was conducted before shots were fired, leaving the family with unanswered concerns. His body remains in a hospital in California awaiting formalities, while his grieving family in Mahabubnagar has appealed to both the Indian government and the Telangana state government to repatriate his remains. Nizamuddin’s father and community representatives, including Majlis Bachao Tehreek leader Amjed Ullah Khan, have urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene urgently and help bring his body back to India so the family can perform last rites in their hometown.

NEW DELHI: The death of Indian techie Mohammed Nizamuddin in Santa Clara, California, has drawn strong reactions, with police describing him as an armed aggressor, his family alleging a hasty and excessive response, neighbours recalling a domestic quarrel that turned deadly, and him alleging workplace racial harassment, including ""wage-fraud, wrongful termination and obstruction of justice.Santa Clara police said they were called to a residence on September 3 after reports of a stabbing, where they found Nizamuddin allegedly armed with a knife after attacking his roommate. Officers claimed he ignored commands and appeared poised to strike again, prompting them to open fire, fatally wounding him, while his injured roommate was hospitalized and two knives were recovered from the scene.The family of Nizamuddin alleged that the shooting ""happened so quickly."" His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, said they were only informed weeks after the September 3 incident.""The account says the roommates had a quarrel -- something about the AC or something in the room -- and in the ensuing scuffle knives were involved. A neighbour phoned the police. When the police entered the room, they asked the occupants to show their hands. One boy complied; the other did not. The police then fired four rounds and the child was shot.It is extremely regrettable that, according to the reports, no proper inquiry took place and the shooting happened so quickly,"" ANI quoted a relative said.The family of the Telangana man has appealed to the external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene in the matter and help bring back Mohammad Nizamuddin's body.Indian consulate expressed condolences and assured ""all possible consular assistance."" ""We are saddened by the death of an Indian national, Mr. Mohammed Nizamuddin, in an incident involving Santa Clara Police. We are in contact with the local authorities & the family, and we will extend all possible consular assistance. Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved family in this difficult time,"" it said.He accused his employer of ""wrongfully"" terminating his employment and continued ""harassment, discrimination and intimidating behavior by the help of a racist detective and team.""""I have been a victim of racial hatred, racial discrimination, racial harassment, torture, wage-fraud, wrongful termination and obstruction of Justice,"" the post on LinkedIn read.","Mohammed nizamuddin, a 32-year-old man from telangana's mahabubnagar district, was allegedly shot dead by police in santa clara, california on september 3.

The third nuclear submarine in this class, INS Aridhman, is undergoing trials.The reactor now under development at Barc will provide a major operational advantage to newer submarines, such as greater endurance and longer submergence time.According to him, government is focusing on the design and development of nuclear submarines because of their importance in the nuclear triad; they provide a survivable and mobile platform for second-strike capability. The other two legs of the nuclear triad are the Army and the Air Force.In another development, Barc is also designing a light-water-based 200 MWe Bharat small modular reactor (SMR), a 555 MWe SMR and a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor for clean hydrogen production by integrating it with a thermochemical plant, according to Atomic Energy Commission chairman A K Mohanty’s statement at the 69th conference of the IAEA in Vienna this week.","The enhancement comes against the background of china strengthening its sea nuclear deterrent.

'Could have stayed silent': Ian Bremmer praises PM Modi for 'defying' Trump; how it had positive impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/could-have-stayed-silent-ian-bremmer-praises-pm-modi-defying-trump-how-it-had-positive-impact/articleshow/123997468.cms,"India’s oil purchase from Russia



US-Pakistan ties



From dead economy to great country



American political scientist and Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer praised PM Modi for publicly rejecting US President Donald Trump’s claim of mediating between India and Pakistan during the escalation in May following Operation Sindoor.Bremmer described the move as a rare show of resistance against Washington that stood out on the global stage, claiming that other countries would have “sucked it up and not said anything”.In an interview with ANI, Bremmer said PM Modi’s decision to openly contradict Trump was an example of personality-driven diplomacy.“There have been no consequences to the Russians for telling Trump no. And I think Modi is in that space, right? Because Modi could have easily not embarrassed Trump about the India Pakistan issue and instead Modi decided to publicly say no you had nothing to do with this and really did embarrass Trump on the global stage.”“Modi decided personally that he was going to make this public, he was going to embarrass the US president even though the US president is much more powerful than Modi is. And you know most other leaders in that position have chosen to remain silent,” he said.To stress his point, Bremmer cited UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s example who chose to be more accommodating towards Trump, even if he didn’t agree with him in private..“Some of them have even proactively talked about how amazing Trump is, how wonderful Trump is. I mean, look at Kier Starmer, who certainly doesn't like what Trump stands for, but loves the fact that he got a better deal from Trump than other countries have. He's in a very weak position,” Bremmer explained.In early August, Trump raised tariffs on India by 25% for continuing to buy Russian oil, saying the trade was helping Moscow’s war effort. This pushed the total tariff on Indian goods entering the US to 50%.Bremmer said that PM Modi’s close ties with Russia gave a direct message to the US president.“He got into Putin 's limousine just like Putin got into Trump's limousine and made it very clear as Trump was saying, ‘I'm going to increase tariffs on you because you're buying all this oil.’ Modi saying, ‘I'm going to do whatever I want with Putin and I'm not going to listen to you.’ That was a very direct message,” Bremmer said.Pointing to what he called hypocrisy over US pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil, the political scientist said, “I wouldn't talk about oil, I would talk about the Americans buying Russian uranium, billions of Russian uranium and fertilizer. So at the same time the Americans are telling you don't buy oil, the Americans are buying Russian product and and they're not suggesting that they're going to stop.”He added that India’s refusal to accept Trump’s claims had not harmed bilateral relations. “I think that was, it was noticed but it did not lead to negative consequences. In fact, it probably made Trump pay more attention to the need to engage with Modi in a friendlier way. I would say that worked.”On the broader India-US relationship, Bremmer was cautious. “I don't think the relationship is fundamentally broken. But the idea that the US is going to become India's reliable trusted great power partner is clearly not in the cards,” he said.Bremmer also warned of India’s declining trust in the United States as it inclines towards Pakistan.“I think there's less trust. I think that there is a sense in India that the US is less reliable than it used to be. Part of that is the Pakistan relationship with the United States both officially as well as unofficially and the business connections. Part of it is Trump's recklessness in diplomacy, his desire for credit and his indifference to how that may affect others that he's working with.”When asked if this was about trade or personality politics, Bremmer linked it also to Washington’s ties with Islamabad. “Well, I think it's about Pakistan too, right? I mean, the US suddenly is working more closely with Pakistan,” he said.He also criticised the Trump administration’s approach, suggesting it was driven largely by economic and business interests. “This is mostly about business...There is a kind a of lack of ethics, a kleptocratic and oligarchic impulse with the family, and a constellation of people that are around the administration, trusted by light, who are conducting a lot of business with Pakistan. And that has brought them in. I don't think it's a particular strategic shift. I think it's opportunistic, and it's about some money,” he said.Bremmer further noted that US support in Europe had already weakened. “If the Americans aren't even interested in a strong Europe, it's hard to imagine they're going to be very interested in a strong India,” he observed.Turning to regional developments, he linked the Saudi-Pakistan mutual defence pact to growing frustrations with Washington’s handling of Israel’s actions in Gaza.Talking about Trump’s changing remarks about India’s economy, Bremmer was dismissive.“Trump changes what he says about you on a dime depending on, you know, sort of how he feels in the moment. It has nothing to do with with the Indian economy.”Earlier on July 31, the US President wrote on his social media platform, “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”However, days later on September 10, he changed his stance, “I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations. I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!”","Bremmer praised pm modi for publicly rejecting us president donald trump’s claim of mediating between india and pakistan.

NEW DELHI: The Ministry of external affairs on Friday said India shares a “wide-ranging strategic partnership” with Saudi Arabia, one that has “deepened considerably” in recent years.Responding to queries on the Saudi Arabia–Pakistan defence pact, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “We expect that this strategic partnership will keep in mind mutual interests and sensitivities.”His remarks came after Riyadh and Islamabad signed a “Strategic Mutual Defense Agreement” earlier this week, triggering speculation over whether Saudi Arabia could gain access to Pakistan’s nuclear shield amid heightened tensions in the Middle East.The pact, announced on Wednesday, brings together Saudi Arabia’s financial clout and Pakistan’s military, the only nuclear-armed force in the Muslim world. Few details have been disclosed, though Saudi officials have described it as covering “all military means.” Analysts told Reuters that the deal signals declining confidence in the United States as a long-term security guarantor for Gulf states.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif maintained that nuclear weapons were “not on the radar” of the agreement, saying: “We have no intention of using this pact for any aggression. But if the parties are threatened, then obviously this arrangement will become operative.” He added the framework could be extended to other Gulf nations.

'Manmohan Singh Thanked Me For Meeting Hafiz Saeed': Yasin Malik's Bombshell Claim; BJP Slams Cong

SRINAGAR: Former J&K CM and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti wrote to home minister Amit Shah on Friday, taking up cudgels on behalf of jailed separatist Yasin Malik and seeking ""a compassionate and urgent review"" of the terror funding case against him on grounds of what she described as ""his long-standing commitment to non-violence"".""Over the years, Malik engaged in dialogue involving senior officials, intelligence personnel, and even controversial figures like Hafiz Saeed, all with the tacit consent of Indian agencies. These efforts represented a painstaking and deliberate attempt to build bridges in a deeply fractured land,"" Mehbooba said, referring to Malik's recent affidavit in Delhi high court.The PDP president, whose many controversies include her claim that J&K accepted the Indian tricolour in 1947 on certain conditions and constitutional guarantees, said she was writing to Shah ""not merely as a witness but as someone who has lived through the turbulent times of Kashmir, bearing its grief, enduring its silences, and holding on to its fragile hopes"".She claimed Malik's journey was no secret. ""In 1994, he took a courageous and rare decision to lay down arms and embrace political, non-violent means to pursue change. According to his sworn affidavits, this shift was neither unilateral nor impulsive but encouraged and facilitated through back-channel understandings with Indian agencies,"" the letter states.In his affidavit, Malik spoke of his involvement in backchannel diplomacy, including private meetings with PMs, ministers and intelligence chiefs.He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison by an NIA court on charges of receiving foreign funding and collaborating with terrorist groups. NIA has since appealed to Delhi HC to turn his life term into death penalty.""This appeal does not seek to undermine the judiciary's authority but calls for the responsible exercise of democratic instruments to honour both justice and mercy. The spirit of India, I firmly believe, lies in our capacity to show magnanimity and uphold promises made in pursuit of peace,"" Mehbooba's letter pleads.Peoples Conference chief and MLA Sajad Lone accused the ex-CM of ""hypocrisy"".

Poll Should political dialogues include discussions with controversial figures? Yes, dialogues are essential. No, it undermines the credibility.

NEW DELHI: Jailed separatist leader and Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chief Yasin Malik has claimed that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed ""gratitude"" to him after he met Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) chief and 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed in Pakistan in 2006.The separatist leader made the claim in an affidavit filed in the Delhi high court on August 25. A copy of the affidavit was shared on X by BJP leader Amit Malviya.Malik stated, ""When I returned to New Delhi from Pakistan, Special Director IB V K Joshi, as part of the debriefing exercise, met me in the hotel and requested me to immediately brief the Prime Minister. I met the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh the same evening where N K Narayan, National Security Advisor, was also present. I briefed him on my meetings and appraised him on the possibilities, where he conveyed his gratitude [to] me for my efforts, time, patience and dedication. But as luck would have it, this meeting of mine with Hafiz Saeed and other militant leader(s) of Pakistan which was initiated and executed only on the request of Special Director IB V K Joshi, were portrayed in a different context against me.""He also claimed that the 2006 meeting was not his personal initiative but took place at the request of Indian intelligence officials as part of a backchannel peace process with Pakistan.According to Malik, ""The then Special Director IB V K Joshi, had met me in New Delhi and had requested me that as I would be meeting with political leaders in Pakistan it would be very helpful if I could engage in dialogue with Prime Minister of Pakistan including Hafiz Saeed and other militant leaders of Pakistan to help our Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh in the peace process on the Kashmir issue.""Malik added, ""I was specifically requested for this meeting with Hafiz Saeed and other militant leaders of Pakistan on the pretext that militancy and peace dialogues cannot go in tandem, given the bomb blast which happened in the National Capital.""He said he agreed to the request and later met Saeed and other leaders of the United Jihad Council at a function in Pakistan.In the affidavit, Malik wrote, ""Given the request of Special Director IB V K Joshi, to strength the dialogue institute, in pursuit of peace, I met Hafiz Saeed, Lashkar-e-Taiba Chief, where he organised a function with United Jihad Council in attendance, where on the podium I conveyed and harped in unequivocal terms that as followers of Allah's Last Messenger Prophet Mohammad (PBUH), we should adhere and follow his sermons in its most purist way. ""He alleged that the 2006 meeting was shown out of context to justify invoking UAPA against him, even though he had carried out the talks openly and reported back to India's top leadership. ""It was nothing but a case of classic betrayal, where despite working to strengthen the peace table, I should ideally be seen as an apostle of peace and harmony, on the contrary after 13 years of this meeting just before the abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution of India, the entire meeting was construed out of context, distorted to meet the requirements for invocation of UAPA and re-produced to brandish me as terrorist, on behest of the current dispensation to not onlyjustify the abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution of India but also to wipe out the entire Kashmiri political leadership using the situation, and pursue their own political agenda in the state. ""The affidavit comes as the Delhi high court hears the National Investigation Agency's (NIA) appeal to enhance Malik's life term to a death sentence in a 2017 terror-funding case. The bench has asked Malik to file his reply by November 10.In 2022, Malik was sentenced to life imprisonment after pleading guilty under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The trial court had held that his case did not qualify as ""rarest of rare"" for awarding the death penalty.The NIA's case accused Malik and others, including Hafiz Saeed, Syed Salahuddin, and Shabbir Shah, of conspiring with Pakistan-based groups to fuel unrest in Kashmir.

Government says it expects Riyadh to respect mutual sensitivities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-says-it-expects-riyadh-to-respect-mutual-sensitivities/articleshow/124008786.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian government on Friday said it expects Riyadh to be mindful of mutual interests and sensitivities in keeping with the ""wide-ranging strategic partnership, which has deepened considerably in the last few years"".The statement by MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal followed media queries on the issue. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan this week formalised their almost 60-year-old defence and security cooperation through a strategic defence pact that states that any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both.Saudi officials have been quoted as saying that the pact won't stymie the kingdom's efforts to improve the relationship with India. The defence pact is seen as a fallout of Israel's aggression in the region, including its recent strikes in Doha to take out Hamas figures. India has taken note of the fact that the details of the agreement are not public yet but the reference to collective defence is in a joint statement.India maintains that it was aware of the agreement from the time it was in the works and it is currently assessing its force as a legal obligation.Given its own improving defence cooperation with Riyadh, India doesn't see any military threat from Saudi Arabia in the event of a conflict escalation with Pakistan, but concerns remain about the pact possibly resulting in a military windfall for Pakistan that could improve its ability to wage war against India.Government sources pointed to the fact that Pakistan and Saudi have a long-standing defence partnership that goes back several decades.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have a decades-long defence partnership, and while the United States provides the overall security framework, in many cases Pakistan has provided manpower and expertise in the military domain, said a source, recalling that whenever Gulf states have come under threat, whether from Arab nationalism or Iran, they have turned to Pakistan.As per Indian authorities, the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia pact only formalises the existing understandings, particularly on Pakistani support to Saudi Arabia, and that the timeline may have been accelerated by the recent attacks on Doha.Saudi Arabia had first signed a defence agreement with Pakistan in 1967 and upgraded it in 1982 through a bilateral security cooperation agreement. At one point of time, during the Iran-Iraq war, more than 15,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom.","Saudi officials have been quoted as saying that the pact won't stymie the kingdom's efforts to improve the relationship with india.

NEW DELHI: The world should learn about conflict termination from India, which ended the cross-border hostilities with Pakistan after striking it 'nice and hard' under Operation Sindoor while taking care to avoid civilian casualties, because it had achieved its main objectives, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh said on FridayCiting the ongoing long-drawn wars like Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas, the IAF chief said prolonged conflicts often result from “egos coming in between” as well as shifting objectives and goalposts.“Yes, Pakistan was on the backfoot, no doubt, but what were our objectives? Our objective was anti-terrorism. We had to strike them. We had done that. So if our objectives have been met, then why should we not terminate a conflict? Why should we carry on?” ACM Singh said, brushing aside criticism from some quarters that the May 7-10 conflict was stopped prematurely by India.“Any conflict has a lot of price which has to be paid. It will affect our preparedness for the next one. It will affect our economy. It will affect the country’s general progress. So, the world should learn from India how to start and terminate a conflict at the earliest possible opportunity,” he said, speaking at an Air Force Association (AFA) meeting here.With an unnerved Pakistan suing for peace after IAF conducted long-range precision strikes on at least eight air bases and several radar sites in Pakistan on May 10, after the initial hit on nine terror hubs on May 7, India concluded it had achieved its three objectives – political, military and psychological.The IAF chief, on his part, said, “We were given terrorist targets. We accurately struck them. When our enemies refused to stop the war and tried to attack us, then we struck them nice and hard. Many of their bases were damaged. A lot of their infrastructure, radars, control and coordination centres, their hangars, aircraft, suffered a lot of damage.”Referring to the doubts raised about the operational success of the air strikes at the JeM terror facility at Balakot in Feb 2019, ACM Singh said there was also an emphasis on getting video and other evidence during Operation Sindoor so that “we could tell our critics that this was the damage caused”.On taking care to minimise collateral damage, he said Pakistan did not even close some of its airfields like Lahore during the conflict, using civilian air traffic as a cover for launching attack and other drones against India. “But we had decided that no matter what happens, we should not harm any such aircraft, even by chance, in which there are civilians or any other non-military personnel,” ACM Singh said.He described the IAF’s Russian-origin S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile system, which was forward deployed but kept on changing its location due to high mobility to beat enemy targeting, as “a game-changer” during the conflict.“Our long-range radars and missile systems could threaten the enemy aircraft well inside their own territory. They could not operate even in their own territory. They could not even come up to the weapons release range without being threatened and those who came had to face damage,” the IAF chief said.ACM Singh last month had said that apart from the extensive damage on the ground, IAF’s air defence systems like the S-400 had shot down five Pakistani fighters and a large special mission aircraft -- either an ELINT (electronic intelligence) or an AEW&C (airborne early-warning and control) plane at a distance of over 300-km – in the air.The political leadership gave clear political directives to undertake punitive strikes, cater for escalation and create a deterrence in the Pak Army’s mind. “Full freedom was given to us,” ACM Singh said, adding the IAF, Army and Navy chiefs all sat together to jointly plan the operation along with the chief of defence staff, in addition to the national security advisor and other agencies.","The world should learn about conflict termination from india, says air chief marshal a p singh.

Pakistan's 'Lies' Shredded By Own; Lashkar Man Reveals Muridke Bombing 'Truth' I Details

Elimination of nine terror infrastructure in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor has led major Pakistan-sponsored terrorist groups, particularly Jaish-e-Muhammed and Hizbul Mujahideen, to move deep inside Pakistan, closer to the Afghanistan border. The intelligence establishment has received credible visual confirmation that the two outfits are shifting their bases to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK).JeM has been aggressively expanding its training facility - Markaz Shohada-e-Islam - at Mansehra in the Khyber region. Photographs have confirmed construction activity and an increase in logistical inflows at the site.On the other hand, Hizb, under the command of ex-SSG commando Khalid Khan, is constructing a new training facility named ""HM-313"" in Bandai, KPK. While the land was purchased in Aug 2024, construction there started only in mid-May. Boundary walls and initial training infrastructure have been completed, photographs show. The ""313"" nomenclature is a symbolic tribute to the Badr Ghazwa (a historic Islamic battle) and al-Qaida 's Brigade 313, reflecting Hizb's intent to attract global jihadi legitimacy.On Sept 25, JeM is planning a recruitment drive in Peshawar's Markaz Shaheed Maksudabad to commemorate Yusuf Azhar - Masood Azhar's brother who was killed in Operation Sindoor. It is there that a new alias for the outfit - al-Murabitun (defenders of land of Islam) similar to an al-Qaida group of Western Africa - will be announced.The decision to relocate reflects a significant tactical adaptation by the groups, which now view traditional locations as vulnerable to Indian precision strikes.KPK offers greater depth due to its geography, proximity to Afghan frontier, and existing jihadi safe havens dating back to the Afghan war, an intelligence note reads. This movement is being conducted with full knowledge and direct facilitation of Pakistan's state structures, as evidenced by overt JeM gatherings held under police protection and the tacit involvement of political-religious outfits like Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), the note added.KPK is now being repositioned as a rear command zone for JeM, while PoK continues to serve as a forward operating platform for infiltration.The intelligence establishment has flagged the Jaish-led event at Garhi Habibullah in Mansehra, where a public recruitment drive kicked off barely seven hours before the start of the India-Pakistan cricket match on Sept 14. The event, ostensibly organised as part of a Deobandi religious gathering, was in fact a coordinated mobilisation effort led jointly by JeM and JUI in the presence of Mulana Mufti Masood Ilyas Kashmiri alias Abu Mohammad, JeM's chief for KPK and Kashmir.""His presence at a public rally guarded by both JeM cadre armed with M4 rifles and local police officers, including inspector Liaqat Shah of Garhi Habibullah police station, reflects both state complicity and the boldness of JeM's revivalist strategy,"" an intelligence officer said. For over 30 minutes, Kashmiri glorified Osama bin Laden, calling him the Shohada-e-Islam and ""Prince of Arab"", directly linking JeM's ideological line with al-Qaida's legacy.","Hizbul mujahideen is building a new facility named ‘hm-313’ in bandai, kpk, photographs show.

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Kural 691

“Agalaadhu Anugaadhu Theekayvaar Polga:





Igal Vendhar Serndozhugu vaar”

Moving with the bosses is like sitting by the fireside;

Neither too close, nor too far.

In high-powered organizations, one lesson shines above all — protect the boss ’s ego. Disagree you may, but gently. Always accept the boss’s decision as final and weigh words like gold.We like to believe that careers are built on talent and hard work. But often, they are shaped by the temperament of the person we report to. Employees do not leave organisations; they leave their bosses. Bosses can wound in many ways—the one who makes your best efforts seem miniscule, the one who basks in the glow of victories but points an accusing finger at failures, the micro-manager who controls every move, and the monster manager who thrives on making others’ lives miserable.Even brilliant leaders are not exempt. Craig M Wright, an American scholar, studied the leadership styles of several geniuses such as Edison, Picasso, Henry Ford and Steve Jobs, who were masterminds and yet poor as leaders. Jobs, for instance, was allegedly obsessively controlling and prone to fits of rage. A few who worked under him have remarked that suffering soars as much as creativity under him.How then did employees survive their ire? By adapting. Some endured the storms in silence, some mastered the art of reading moods, and some simply left when the strain became too much. If this is the case with corporates—where checks and balances still exist—what about kings who held supreme power?History is filled with tales of such unchecked arrogance. Maharaja Jai Singh (1882–1937) despised defeat. Opponents in games were warned to lose, yet once during a polo match the opposite team triumphed. Furious, the Maharaja torched his horse, blaming it for the loss. On another occasion, he felt insulted at a Rolls-Royce showroom in London, and bought seven cars, shipped them to India, and used them as garbage carriers. King Farouk of Egypt (1920–1965) fared no better; he disliked the look of a railway station and ordered it to be demolished. Power, when absolute, often slid into cruelty.So how should one navigate a bully boss in the modern workplace? Experts say one should ever confront them mid-tirade. If the attack is by email, resist the urge to strike back instantly. Wait, and bring up the incident calmly in private. You may never get an apology, but your quiet reminder signals that respect cannot be trampled on. With narcissistic bosses, the path is different. Their charm is a mask that slips in time. When it does, the best course is to plan an exit, but carefully, without burning bridges.Centuries before, Thiruvalluvar anticipated these struggles in his chapter ‘Dealing with the Supremely Powerful’. His counsel is precise:·Do not compete with your boss·A bad impression is hard to erase. So try not to make any mistakes·Your boss may be friendly. Do not take liberties—never laugh out loud or whisper in his ear·Do not interrupt or question rashly·Intimacy does not mean privilegeAnd then comes his most profound metaphor, inThat, perhaps, is the timeless art. Whether in the court of kings or corporate corridors, survival rests, not in confrontation or servility, but in balance—knowing the exact distance at which one can sit, feel the warmth and not get burnt.","Bharathi bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text ‘thirukkural’ written by tamil poet and philosopher thiruvalluvar, the kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Islamic Nato? Saudi Arabia-Pakistan defence pact - what it means for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saudi-pakistan-defense-pact-saudi-pakistan-defense-pact-and-india-islamic-nato-pakistan-nuclear-weapons/articleshow/123978246.cms,"For the first time, Israel must plan for a world in which its military actions could invoke a nuclear response-not from Iran, its longtime antagonist, but from a Sunni ally of Washington.

TL; DR: Driving the news

Why it matters

This pact upends the old US-centric security architecture in the Middle East and creates new risks and alliances across three regions.

For Israel: The inclusion of Pakistan’s nuclear umbrella introduces a new deterrent against its regional military actions.

For India: The pact emboldens Pakistan, adds uncertainty in future conflicts, and risks tilting Arab support away from India.

For China: This is a quiet strategic windfall - an opportunity to deepen influence with two key allies while sidelining the US.

For the US: Washington’s credibility as a security guarantor in the Gulf is now under serious question.

Between the lines

Is this the start of an Islamic or Arab Nato?

The Saudi-Pakistan defence pact has reignited talk of a long-dreamed but elusive idea: a collective Muslim military alliance often called an Islamic or Arab Nato. For decades, this concept has surfaced in moments of crisis - and usually faded. This time, the conditions feel sharper.

The symbolism is striking. Saudi Arabia - custodian of Islam’s holiest sites - has formally bound its security to Pakistan, the only Muslim-majority nuclear state. Qatar, directly attacked, may seek similar guarantees.

Turkey, already in Nato, has long envisioned an Islamic bloc.

The Gulf mood has shifted: reliance on US protection feels increasingly hollow after Washington failed to prevent missiles from striking Doha. As the SCMP noted, Arab states now see little choice but to take “real and tangible measures” themselves.

Yet obstacles are formidable. Rivalries among Muslim states - Saudi Arabia versus Iran, Qatar versus the UAE, Turkey versus Egypt - make collective action fragile. The Economist observed that calls for an “Islamic Nato” often ring hollow given how many Arab regimes distrust Iran, one of the loudest voices pushing for such a bloc.

Still, momentum is undeniable. The idea of Gulf and wider Muslim states pooling military resources against a common external threat has more traction now than at any point since the Arab Spring.

Zoom in: Israel’s new deterrence dilemma

For the first time, Israel must plan for a world in which its military actions could invoke a nuclear response-not from Iran, its longtime antagonist, but from an ally of US.

Killed normalization prospects with Riyadh.

Galvanized Islamic unity.

Activated a defence pact with nuclear implications.

Provoking Pakistani retaliation, potentially conventional or cyber.

Drawing condemnation from a unified bloc of Arab states.

*Empowering Hamas and Hezbollah, who can claim new backing from a major Muslim coalition.

Expect Tel Aviv to:

Accelerate defence upgrades (e.g., Iron Dome, Arrow-3, David’s Sling).

Double down on ties with India and the US for strategic depth.

Exercise greater caution before any unilateral action in third-party Gulf states.

Zoom in: India’s uneasy balancing act

We have seen reports of the signing of a strategic mutual Defence pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The Government was aware that this development, which formalises a long-standing arrangement between the two countries, had been under consideration. We will study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability. The Government remains committed to protecting India's national interests and ensuring comprehensive national security in all domains. MEA on Saudi Arabia-Pakistan defence pact

Diplomatic fallout: The MEA said it will “study the implications” of the pact for national security.

Military calculus changes: With Pakistan now seen as having Arab backing, India fears a harder Pakistani posture in any future Kashmir crisis.

Material concern: Saudi money could now strengthen Pakistan’s military, indirectly or directly - via oil subsidies, weapons upgrades, or tech transfers.

Deepen defence ties with Israel (already India’s #2 arms supplier).

Accelerate military modernization - especially missile systems and border defences.

Step up diplomatic outreach in the Gulf to keep Riyadh neutral in South Asian crises.

Our relationship with India is more robust than it has ever been. We will continue to grow this relationship and seek to contribute to regional peace whichever way we can. A Saudi official to AlJazeera

The US on the sidelines-or in the crossfire?

China’s opportunity (and risk)

A stronger Gulf partner distancing from US influence.

A rising role as regional arms supplier and mediator.

Validation of China’s multipolar world strategy, with Washington increasingly sidelined.

Publicly back the pact as defensive unity.

Privately urge restraint - Beijing fears oil disruptions, instability, and escalation.

As SCMP noted, “Beijing benefits from a realignment that validates its approach - diplomacy, deterrence, and development.”

What’s next

US recalibration – Washington will likely attempt to rebuild trust with Saudi Arabia, possibly revisiting defence guarantees. At the same time, it may push Israel to avoid further unilateral escalations.

Saudi balancing act – Riyadh will try to prove the pact doesn’t undermine ties with India, while strengthening its leadership role in the Muslim world.

Pakistan’s rising profile – Expect more joint exercises, visible deployments, and louder rhetoric positioning Islamabad as protector of Muslim states.

Potential domino effect – Qatar, Turkey, or even smaller Gulf states could seek similar arrangements, edging closer to a real “Arab Nato.”

Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a sweeping strategic mutual defence agreement, declaring that an attack on either will be treated as an attack on both.The deal comes just days after Israel’s airstrike on Doha, which killed some senior Hamas leaders amid ceasefire talks - triggering outrage across Arab capitals.Pakistan, a nuclear weapons state, is now officially linked to Saudi defence, reshaping strategic equations in the Gulf and South Asia.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif signed the pact in Riyadh. Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, attended - signaling the military’s endorsement of the pact’s implications.""This agreement... strengthens joint deterrence against any aggression,"" said a joint statement from Saudi and Pakistani officials - seen as a direct response to Israel’s Qatar raid.Saudi officials insist the pact is “not aimed at any specific country.” But regional analysts agree the timing isn’t accidental.The Doha strike was a turning point. It exposed Qatar - home to a major US military base - as vulnerable.Gulf states saw Washington’s silence as complicity.Saudi Arabia, already exploring alternatives to US guarantees, acted swiftly to make permanent its defence relationship with Pakistan - long speculated, now official.Crucially, the pact is deliberately ambiguous about whether Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal is included - a gray area that adds deterrent weight without triggering international red lines.“This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means,” a senior Saudi official told Reuters.While Saudi Arabia has in recent years pursued a cautious rapprochement with Israel, including back-channel talks and limited normalization, the latest developments may put such overtures on hold.The pact with Pakistan, a country with no diplomatic relations with Israel and a history of supporting Palestinian causes, sends a message that Riyadh is willing to hedge its bets and strengthen deterrence against perceived threats, even if it means aligning with states outside the Abraham Accords framework.Israel’s military freedom of action - especially cross-border strikes - just encountered a nuclear tripwire.Israel’s strike on Doha aimed to decapitate Hamas leadership but instead:Now, any future Israeli strike in the Gulf risks:Israeli analysts called the pact a “game-changer” and warned of an “expanded threat matrix.”India faces a sharp strategic squeeze. It has deep ties to both Saudi Arabia and Israel, and a long-standing conflict with Pakistan.The concern is less about direct Saudi involvement in a South Asian conflict and more about symbolism and support. Pakistan, emboldened by Riyadh’s backing, may adopt a harder stance in future crises-whether over Kashmir, terrorism, or water rights. If Saudi financial support flows into Pakistan’s defence modernization, India may find itself facing a better-equipped adversary.This places India in an uncomfortable diplomatic position. It relies on Saudi Arabia as its third-largest oil supplier and a key investment partner. It also enjoys a deepening military relationship with Israel. The challenge now is to maintain both ties without appearing compromised or exposed.India’s likely response? Quiet hedging. Expect tighter defence cooperation with Israel, new military procurements, and back-channel diplomacy with Gulf states to ensure the pact doesn’t tilt against Indian interests.New Delhi’s likely response:The United States, once the unchallenged security guarantor of the Gulf, is watching from the margins. Its muted response to the Qatar strike and lack of visible deterrence has eroded confidence among allies.As Foreign Affairs noted earlier this year, “the US has become both too present and too absent-willing to support military campaigns, but unwilling to restrain them.”The result? Gulf states are hedging. A mutual defence pact with a nuclear partner like Pakistan isn’t just about deterrence; it’s a declaration of independence from a security order many now see as broken.Washington now faces the unenviable task of holding together relationships with Israel, Saudi Arabia, India, and Pakistan-each of which sees the others with growing suspicion.China may be the quietest but biggest strategic winner here. It is already Pakistan’s closest partner (via CPEC) and has deepened ties with Riyadh through Belt and Road, energy deals, and arms sales.Beijing’s gainsChina’s playbook:Several scenarios loom:The longer the Israel-Palestine conflict drags on, the more likely this pact will solidify into the nucleus of a larger coalition.(With inputs from agencies)","Saudi-pakistan defence pact reignited talk of a collective muslim military alliance often called an islamic or arab nato. For the first time, israel must plan for a world in which its military actions could invoke a nuclear response from a sunni ally of washington. Saudi arabia and pakistan have signed a sweeping strategic mutual defence agreement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123978609,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76882,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
