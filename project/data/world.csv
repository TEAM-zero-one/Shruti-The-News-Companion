Why did the 4.0-magnitude earthquake in Delhi-NCR feel so strong?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-did-the-4-0-magnitude-earthquake-in-delhi-ncr-feel-so-strong/articleshow/118315557.cms,"Why did the tremors feel so strong?



Epicentre within Delhi: Since the earthquake originated beneath the city, seismic waves had less distance to travel, making the tremors feel more intense.

Shallow depth: Earthquakes that occur closer to the Earth's surface generate stronger shaking compared to deeper quakes of similar magnitude.

Urban infrastructure: High-rise buildings in Delhi, Noida, and Ghaziabad sway more due to their height, amplifying the sensation of shaking.

Soil composition: Soft alluvial soil in some areas of Delhi can amplify seismic waves, further intensifying the tremors.

Why did the earthquake occur?

NEW DELHI: Residents of Delhi-NCR and several parts of northern India were jolted awake early Monday morning as strong tremors shook high-rise buildings, prompting many to rush outdoors. The earthquake, measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale, struck at 5:36 AM IST with its epicentre located within Delhi's Dhaula Kuan, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).Though a 4.0-magnitude quake is considered moderate, its impact felt stronger than usual because of its shallow depth and close proximity to densely populated areas. Earthquakes with epicentres within a city result in more intense shaking since seismic waves travel a shorter distance before reaching structures, amplifying the tremors.Delhi, which falls in Seismic Zone IV , is prone to moderate-to-strong earthquakes, making localised tremors more pronounced as the. Experts noted that buildings, particularly high-rises, sway more due to their design, increasing the perceived intensity of shaking.Authorities have reported no major damage or casualties, but the sudden tremors sparked concern among residents. Seismologists continue to monitor aftershocks and have advised citizens to stay informed about earthquake preparedness measures.See how close were you from the epicenter: Dhaula Kuan Delhi sits near active fault lines, including the Delhi-Hardwar Ridge and the Mahendragarh-Dehradun fault, making it prone to moderate seismic activity. The tremors were caused by tectonic plate movement along one of these fault lines, where stress builds up over time and is eventually released as an earthquake.","Residents of delhi-ncr and northern india were jolted awake early monday morning as strong tremors shook high-rise buildings.

smear campaign

GUWAHATI/NEW DELHI: The row over alleged Pakistani links of Gaurav Gogoi 's wife escalated on Sunday with the Congress MP saying he would initiate legal proceedings in the matter and Assam govt asking state police to register a case against Ali Tauqeer Sheikh , an advisor of the Pakistan Planning Commission , for his alleged attempts to interfere in domestic matters of the state.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier said a police case was likely to be registered to probe the allegations of Pakistani links of Gogoi's wife Elizabeth Colburn, who is a British national, but the cabinet on Sunday refrained from ordering a case against her.Apart from his engagement with the Pakistani govt, Sheikh also founded Lead Pakistan, a non-profit organisation working on climate change, Sarma said, claiming that Elizabeth was an integral part of Lead Pakistan during her time in Islamabad. tnnIn recent days, multiple news reports, social media posts, and other information in the public domain have surfaced regarding certain comments made by Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh aimed at disrupting communal harmony in Assam,"" Himanta Biswa Sarma told the media.He added that a perusal of his social media activity included exhaustive commentary on India's internal affairs and parliamentary matters, raising serious concerns about Sheikh's intention to compromise and damage India's interests.Responding to BJP's allegations, Congress's Jairam Ramesh said, "" Assam CM and BJP have begun an atrocious smear campaign targeting my colleague Gaurav Gogoi. This is character assassination of the worst type. Legal action is being initiated right away.""Ramesh alleged that the smear campaign was because Gogoi won the Jorhat Lok Sabha seat in 2024 in spite of the Assam chief minister and other ministers camping in Jorhat and campaigning against him. ""It is also because the Jorhat MP has been in the forefront, revealing the blatant corruption and black deeds of the Assam CM,"" he added.Sarma has been targeting Gogoi over the past few days and alleged that the former had ISI links. He has accused Gogoi of ""leading young individuals to the Pakistan embassy for brainwashing and radicalisation"", and also questioned his wife's refusal to take Indian citizenship for the past 12 years.He also alleged that Gogoi had raised questions in Parliament on sensitive defence matters after his marriage with the British citizen, a charge termed by the opposition leader as ""false accusation"".",Assam cm himanta biswa sarma had earlier said a police case was likely to be registered to probe the allegations of pakistani links of gaurav gogoi's wife elizabeth colburn.

NEW DELHI: Former chief election commissioner (CEC) SY Quraishi dismissed claims that a US agency funded efforts to raise voter turnout in India, calling the reports ""baseless"" and ""malicious."" His response follows an announcement by the US department of government efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk , which claimed to have cancelled $21 million in funding for voter participation initiatives in India.Quraishi clarified that during his tenure as CEC in 2012, the Election Commission of India (ECI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES). However, he said that this agreement did not involve any financial commitments. ""The report in a section of media about an MoU by ECI in 2012, when I was CEC, for funding of certain million dollars by a US agency for raising voter turnout in India does not have an iota of fact,"" Quraishi wrote on X.He further explained that the MoU was similar to agreements signed with several other international election management bodies to facilitate training at the ECI's Indian Institute of Electoral Democracy and Electoral Management (IIIDEM). ""There was no financing or even promise of finance involved in the MoU, forget X or Y amount. The MoU in fact made it clear in black and white that there would be no financial and legal obligation of any kind on either side,"" he said, adding that this stipulation was explicitly mentioned at two different places in the document to avoid any ambiguity.Quraishi reiterated that any claims of US funding for voter participation in India were entirely false. ""Any mention of funds in connection with this MoU is completely false and malicious,"" he wrote.DOGE, which was established under the Trump administration to oversee and cut government spending, recently announced a list of cancelled expenditures, including $21 million for ""voter turnout in India."" The department claimed that US taxpayer dollars had been allocated to various international projects, including election-related activities in Moldova, Bangladesh, Nepal, and other regions, all of which have now been scrapped.Reacting to DOGE’s announcement, BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya alleged that such funding amounted to ""external interference"" in India's electoral process. ""$21M for voter turnout? This definitely is external interference in India’s electoral process. Who gains from this?

However, there was no official confirmation on the number of deaths.

Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Donald Trump administration announced on Sunday a series of expenditure cuts, including the cancellation of $21 million intended for ""voter turnout in India."" BJP responded, alleging ""external interference in India's electoral process.""Sharing a post on X, the official DOGE handle outlined the list stating that, ""US taxpayer dollars were going to be spent on the following items, all of which have been cancelled.”It also canceled several other US spending, including $ 29 million allocated for ""strengthening the political landscape in Bangladesh"" and $ 10 million for ""Mozambique voluntary medical male circumcision,"" aimed at saving US taxpayer money.BJP's Amit Malviya took to X, responding to the announcement, stating that the $21 million allocated for voter turnout in India amounts to external interference in the country’s electoral process and questioned who would benefit from it.“$486M to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening,’ including $22M for ‘inclusive and participatory political process’ in Moldova and $21M for voter turnout in India,” Malviya wrote in a post on X.“$21M for voter turnout?

Established during the Trump administration, DOGE was tasked with eliminating “wasteful” government spending.

Poll How Do You Feel About the Changes in the US Visa Renewal Process? It Could Make the Process More Organized in the Long Run It Makes the Process More Difficult for Applicants

NEW DELHI: Renewing the same class of US visa could now mean a long wait for many applicants in India. Uncle Sam has returned to its pre-Covid policy of allowing travellers to renew their visa without appearing at the embassy/consulate for an interview if their previous same-class visa is still valid or expired within the last 12 months.In Nov 2022, when the wait time for B1/B2 (business and tourism visa ) interview had crossed 999 days (touching almost three years) in India, the US increased the eligibility for same class drop box visa renewal — which does not require interview — from 12 months to 48 months. Since then the waiting period for B1/B2 interview has less than halved, it is currently over 440 days in Delhi & Mumbai; 436 in Chennai; 429 in Hyderabad and 415 in Kolkata.With such a long waiting, the reduction of drop box eligibility for renewal will mean more people again seeking appointments for same class visa renewal and further prolonging the queue. Asked in this backdrop if it planned to take any step in India to reduce the waiting, the US embassy said it had “anything additional”.Anil Kalsi, Travel Agents Federation of India VP, said: “This makes travel difficult for people who were banking on renewal. Since it’s announced and is already in effect, a lot of people have been caught unawares. There are anyway no interview dates available (in India) without a long waiting period. Some time should have been provided before the change took effect.”Repeat travellers to the US may, under some circumstances, renew their visas without appearing at the embassy or consulate for an interview. The visa waiver checklist for applicants, except those 14 years of age and 80 & above includes: “(is) a citizen of India/Bhutan or a lawful resident of India/Bhutan.(Has) a previous U.S. visa in the same class as the visa for which wish to apply and (the) prior visa in the same visa class is still valid or expired within the last 12 months. Most recent visa was issued on or after my 14th birthday,” according to a US Govt website.While India-US travel is reaching new highs post Covid, the travel industry says it remains way below potential due to two factors — long visa interview wait times and few direct flights due to US airlines not using Russian airspace. A record number of Indians travelled to the US last calendar year, more than CY 2023’s figure of 17.6 lakh which had overtaken the pre-Covid 2019 high of 14.7 lakh.

India attempts to promote Bimstec, which excludes Pakistan

Foreign minister S Jaishankar met Bangladesh foreign adviser Touhid Hossain on the sidelines of Indian Ocean Conference in Muscat on Sunday amid tense bilateral ties over the presence of ousted ex-PM Sheikh Hasina in India since last August.While Jaishankar said the conversation was focused on the bilateral relationship and cooperation under Bimstec , a Bangladesh readout said Hossain requested India to consider a huddle of Saarc standing committee that hasn't met since the 2016 Uri attack when India decided to block the process because of Pakistan's support to cross-border terror.Sunday's talks come ahead of a possible meeting between PM Modi and Bangladesh chief adviser Md Yunus on the margins of Bimstec summit in Thailand on April 3-4.If it happens, it would be the first bilateral meeting between the two after Yunus assumed office. Both Modi and Yunus are likely to attend the Bimstec summit in person. Modi had discussed concerns related to Bangladesh in the meeting with Trump last week.In his meeting with Jaishankar, Hossain also called for talks for renewal of Ganges Water Treaty , adding both sides recognised the challenges in the relationship and the need for joint efforts to address those.According to Dhaka, ahead of talks between border forces this week, it was hoped that various border related issues would be discussed and resolved during the meeting. Both sides recognised the challenges the two neighbours are facing in terms of bilateral relations and discussed the necessity to work together to address those, it said in its statement on the Jaishankar-Hossain meeting. Jaishankar also met his counterparts from other Bimstec member-states like Nepal and Bhutan in Muscat. India has sought to promote the inter-regional Bimstec, which excludes Pakistan and counts Thailand as a member, as a more relevant forum for regional cooperation and connectivity, as Saarc remains practically defunct.The mention of Bimstec in Jaishankar's post is important also because Bangladesh will officially take over as the chair of the group from Thailand at the summit.""As the chair, Bangladesh will have the opportunity to lead Bimstec, take initiatives for cooperation in different sectors by working together in tandem with all the member states and this will be an opportunity for Bangladesh to re-demonstrate its commitment to the world,"" said Bimstec secretary-general I M Pandey last week.Jaishankar is learnt to have conveyed India's desire for a constructive and mutually beneficial relationship with Bangladesh in a positive atmosphere.",S jaishankar met bangladesh foreign adviser touhid hossain on sunday.

"Shashi Tharoor praises PM Modi's US visit, 'something good has been achieved'; Congress says 'views are personal'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-tharoor-praises-pm-modis-us-visit-something-good-has-been-achieved-congress-says-views-are-personal/articleshow/118280251.cms,"'Does not reflect opinion of party'

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor offered a rare moment of praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his recent visit to the United States. Tharoor acknowledged key achievements from PM Modi ’s visit, particularly on trade negotiations and defence cooperation. He welcomed the trade deal discussions and expressed optimism over India’s diplomatic engagements.However, his remarks prompted a clarification from the Congress party , which said that individual opinions do not reflect the party’s official stance.He stressed that when someone in the government does the right thing, it should be recognised, irrespective of who's in power.“For 16 years, I have been in politics. My attitude has been that when somebody in the government, whether it’s our government or some other party’s government, does the right thing or does something well, one should acknowledge and praise it, and when they do something badly, one should criticise it.”“If I were to praise all the time, no one would take me seriously. If I were to criticise all the time, no one would take me seriously either… There’s got to be some give and take in democracy,” the Congress MP said.Tharoor also welcomed the progress on trade talks between India and the US, saying that an agreement had been reached to conduct negotiations over the next nine months. “It’s far better than Washington hastily and unilaterally imposing some tariffs on us, which could have damaged and hurt our exports. It seems to me that something good has been achieved, and I applaud that as an Indian,” he said.On illegal immigration, he questioned whether Modi had raised concerns over the treatment of Indian nationals deported from the US. “There are some questions that still remain… Why did the question of the way in which those illegal immigrants were returned to India not get addressed? Did PM Modi raise it behind closed doors?”He further elaborated, “The only thing missing from what Prime Minister Modi said was the question of the manner in which those people were treated and sent back. I think otherwise his stand was absolutely correct. These are misled youth who have been encouraged or induced to migrate illegally, and they should be taken back. If they are Indian citizens, they belong in our country, we take them back. But I hope that something was said behind closed doors, not perhaps in the press conference, but inside privately, that this manner of doing it—the handcuffs, the insults, the mistreatment, the military aircraft—all that should be avoided in future.”On Trump calling PM Modi a better negotiator than himself, the Congress MP called it an ""astonishing"" acknowledgment. He noted that Trump, known for branding himself as a master dealmaker, rarely compliments others, especially in areas he considers his expertise.""I think calling Mr. Modi a better negotiator than himself is astonishing because Mr. Trump takes pride in being this sort of art of the deal that is his strength. And his admirers, including yesterday the defense secretary of the US, had said that Mr. Trump is the greatest negotiator in the world.""""And here Mr. Trump says Mr. Modi is better than him. So I think we are looking at a very high degree of praise from a man who is not known for saying praiseworthy things. So this is good news,"" Tharoor said.Following Tharoor’s comments, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh took to social media to clarify the party’s position without directly naming Tharoor. In a post on X, he wrote, “The Indian National Congress is our country’s ONLY political party where there is absolute freedom of speech as well as freedom after speech. Members give their views on issues which are, on occasion, their own and do not reflect the opinion of the party as a collective entity. It is the party’s stance that is paramount.”","'does not reflect opinion of party' says congress general secretary jairam ramesh.

French President Emmanuel Macron has convened an emergency meeting of European leaders to discuss the implications of US President Donald Trump 's actions, according to European officials.The meeting, scheduled for Monday in Paris, was revealed by Polish foreign minister Radosław Sikorski at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. Two European Union officials confirmed the development to Politico.""I'm very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris,"" Sikorski said, emphasising that the discussions will address Trump’s recent moves ""in a very serious fashion.""Sikorski also compared Trump's approach to foreign policy to a Russian military strategy known as razvedka boyem—or ""reconnaissance through battle""—where a leader pushes boundaries to test reactions before adjusting positions. ""You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position. And we need to respond,"" he added.Trump's impact on Nato and European security has been a recurring concern among EU leaders. While Sikorski has previously acknowledged Trump's calls for European nations to increase their defence spending , he has also been vocal about the broader risks the US president poses to global stability .Macron, however, has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump. Following Trump's re-election in November, the French leader expressed a willingness to collaborate with him again. ""Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity,"" Macron posted on X.Trump's December visit to Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral further underscored Macron’s diplomatic approach.
