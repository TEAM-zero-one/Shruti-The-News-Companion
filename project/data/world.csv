"‘Serial borrower from the IMF’: India mocks Pakistan at UN; rebuts Islamabad's Kashmir, Indus Water Treaty claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/serial-borrower-from-the-imf-india-mocks-pakistan-at-un-rebuts-islamabads-kashmir-indus-water-treaty-claims/articleshow/122848510.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday stepped up its attack against Pakistan at the United Nations after Islamabad raised the Kashmir issue and the ongoing dispute over the Indus Waters.Marking the 80th anniversary of the UN, India's ambassador Parvathaneni Harish said that states violating the principle of ""good neighbourliness"" by fomenting cross-border terrorism ""must bear a serious cost. """"There should also be a serious cost to states that violate the spirit of good neighbourliness and international relations by fomenting cross-border terrorism. Recently, consequent to the gruesome terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, on 22 April 2025 that led to the killing of 26 innocent tourists, and based on the Council statement of 25 April—where members of the Security Council underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers, and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice,"" Harish said.""India launched Operation Sindoor targeting terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, which was focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature, aimed at achieving its primary objectives. A cessation of military activities was directly concluded at the request of Pakistan,"" he added.Harish drew a stark contrast between the two countries and accused Pakistan of being plagued by terrorism and economic instability.""I am constrained also to respond to the remarks made by the representative of Pakistan. The Indian subcontinent offers a stark contrast in terms of progress, prosperity, and development models. On the one hand, there is India—a mature democracy, a surging economy, and a pluralistic and inclusive society. At the other extreme is Pakistan—steeped in fanaticism and terrorism, and a serial borrower from the IMF,"" Harish said.""As we debate promoting international peace and security, it is essential to recognize that there are some fundamental principles which need to be universally respected. One of them is zero tolerance for terrorism. It ill behoves a member of the Council to offer homilies while indulging in practices that are unacceptable to the international community,"" he added.This came after Pakistan's deputy prime minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar raised the dispute between India and Pakistan over the Indus Waters Treaty, which New Delhi placed into abeyance after the Pahalgam terror attack in April.""Jammu and Kashmir remains one of the oldest disputes on the agenda of the UN Security Council. It is an internationally recognized disputed territory, the final disposition of which is to be made in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people. No cosmetic measures can serve as a substitute for the fundamental and inalienable right of self-determination of the Kashmiris, as guaranteed by the relevant Security Council resolutions,"" Ishaq Dar said.""A 65-year-old Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan is a noteworthy example of dialogue and diplomacy working to peacefully arrive at a water-sharing arrangement between two neighbours. The treaty has withstood periods of trials and tribulations in bilateral relations. It is most unfortunate and regrettable that India has chosen to illegally and unilaterally hold this treaty in abeyance on baseless grounds, with the intention of withholding the flow of water to 240 million people of Pakistan, who rely on it for their livelihood and survival,"" he added.","India stepped up its attack against pakistan at the united nations after islamabad raised the kashmir issue and the ongoing dispute over the indus waters.

NEW DELHI: As Rajya Sabha met Tuesday morning - the second day of Parliament's monsoon session - the effect of Jagdeep Dhankhar's departure weighed heavily in the Upper House. The VP is also the Rajya Sabha chairman.Dhankhar, usually, would not miss chairing RS proceedings at the beginning of the day, but on Tuesday, all eyes were on deputy chairman Harivansh as he strode into the House as the clock struck 11. He greeted MPs with a zealous 'Vanakkam' and started the business of the day by calling the first speaker of zero hour.However, proceedings were disrupted following vociferous protests from opposition MPs who trooped into the well when the chair denied admission of a dozen notices to discuss issues ranging from Dhankhar's ""unexpected and unprecedented"" resignation, special revision of electoral rolls in Bihar, Pahalgam terror attack to Operation Sindoor. RS transacted no business during the day amid repeated adjournments.Similar scenes were witnessed in Lok Sabha which saw almost no business amid opposition protests.The corridors of Parliament were abuzz with speculation over Dhankhar's resignation. When TOI spoke to some MPs - governing and opposition - they said they were baffled by the development.Congress president and LoP in RS Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""He has resigned on his own, and therefore, we don't have to say anything on that because humko khushi bhi nahin hai, gham bhi nahin hai (we are neither happy nor sad).""

NEW DELHI: Election to the vice-president's office must be held ""as soon as possible"" in the event of a vacancy caused by the death, resignation or removal of the incumbent, according to Article 63(2) of the Constitution. In the normal course, however, such an election must be held before expiration of term of the incumbent.A person who is elected to fill such vice-presidential vacancy caused by death, resignation or removal shall have a full term of five years.As per Article 66 of the Constitution, the vice-president is to be elected by an electoral college comprising members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The election follows the system of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote. In this system, the elector has to mark preferences against the names of the candidates. Preference can be marked in figures only and not in words. The elector can mark as many preferences as the number of candidates. While the marking of first preference is compulsory for the ballot paper to be valid, other preferences are optional.All MPs must vote by secret ballot.Election Commission conducts the election to the office of vice-president in accordance with Article 324 of the Constitution, read with Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952, and the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Rules, 1974.The current electoral college for election of the vice-president comprises 542 Lok Sabha members and 240 Rajya Sabha members. The value of vote of each MP is the same, that is, one.The election process will get underway with announcement of poll schedule by EC, followed by issue of the notification, after which candidates - who must be citizens of India, over 35 years of age and qualified for election to Rajya Sabha - can file their nominations. The returning officer for the election may be secretary general of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, and is appointed by EC in consultation with the central govt.Each nomination must be subscribed by at least 20 electors as proposers and 20 electors as seconders. A security deposit of Rs 15,000 is required to be made along with the nomination paper.Polling for a vice-presidential election is taken on Parliament premises only.For marking the vote, the poll panel will supply particular pens to electors in the polling station. Voting by using any other pen shall lead to invalidation of the vote at the time of counting.Political parties cannot issue any whip to their MPs in the matter of voting in the vice-presidential election.During counting, the number of first preference votes secured by each candidate is ascertained and added up. The total is divided by two and one is added to the quotient disregarding any remainder. The resulting number is the quota sufficient for a candidate to secure his return at the election. If at the end of the first or any subsequent count, the total number of votes credited to any candidate is equal to, or greater than the quota, that candidate is declared elected.","Election to vice-president's office must be held ""as soon as possible"" in the event of a vacancy caused by the death, resignation or removal of the incumbent.

A shock exit

Poll Do you think Jagdeep Dhankhar’s resignation will have a major political impact? Yes, it could shift the dynamics No, it’s unlikely to change much

Dhankhar caught govt unawares on by allowing notice against Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: It was business as usual till around 4pm for Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar. He presided over the opening day of the monsoon session of Rajya Sabha and attended a meeting of the business advisory committee of the House. At 3.53pm, a govt statement said the VP would be visiting Jaipur on Wednesday.Such a trip, while Parliament is in session, would have raised eyebrows. A few hours later, Dhankhar dropped a bombshell, abruptly announcing his resignation with immediate effect two years before his tumultous term was to end. ""To prioritise health care and abide by medical advice, I hereby resign as Vice-President of India, effective immediately, in accordance with Article 67(a) of the Constitution,"" he wrote in his letter to President Droupadi Murmu The move immediately set off speculation about the real trigger, with many wondering as to the nature of the medical condition that necessitated his quitting the constitutional position, second only to the President in protocol.Few were convinced about the health explanation, particularly given that those who visited him in recent months detected signs that he was less than happy, even as he made it a point to swear by the present political leadership.He underwent a cardiac procedure at AIIMS in March after he complained of uneasiness. On June 25, he had fainted while delivering a speech at Nainital. But he seemed to be in fine fettle on Monday, making his trademark interventions and betraying no sign of the graveness he invoked to explain his exit.Dhankhar, 74, assumed office in Aug 2022 and his tenure was till 2027.Jagdeep Dhankhar is the only vice president to quit while not in contention for presidentship. R Venkatraman, S D Sharma and K R Naryanan had resigned after becoming President, while V V Giri had quit to contest as an Independent for President. Bhairon Singh Shekhwat had stepped down on moral grounds after losing to Pratibha Patil in the presidential contest.In his resignation letter, Dhankhar thanked President Droupadi Murmu, PM Narendra Modi, the council of ministers, and all MPs for extending support to him during his tenure. ""I extend my deepest gratitude to the President of India for her unwavering support and the soothing wonderful working relationship we maintained during my tenure. I express my deep gratitude to the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. Prime Minister's cooperation and support have been invaluable, and I have learned much during my time in office,"" he said in his letter.But the development came as a surprise to many in govt, although a few admitted to have noticed signs of restiveness in the voluble former Supreme Court lawyer.The inaugural day also saw the VP allowing submission of motion for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma of Allahabad high court: something that would equip him with the same say as the Lok Sabha Speaker in picking the three members of inquiry panel that would go into charges against the judge. This was perhaps the first such instance when the two Houses moved in parallel for removal of a judge. Significantly, the opposition was allowed to submit the motion a day after govt had announced at the all-party meeting on Sunday that LS would make the first move against the HC judge. Many saw this through the prism of the lawyer's interest in matters legal; especially his criticism of judiciary, but it struck many as unusual.The governing party had also seemed surprised when he allowed LoP in RS Mallikarjun Kharge to speak at length on the alleged security lapse that enabled the terrorists at Pahalgam to conduct their deadly carnage and US President Donald Trump's claims to have dragged India to the negotiation table during Operation Sindoor. Treasury benches felt that as the chairman, Dhankhar should have allowed Kharge to have his say only during the debate that is set to happen.But none of it seemed to qualify to be a trigger for his announcement. The timing: the inaugural day of a session when opposition aspires to put govt under pressure, could not be comforting for the governing coalition. To many, it seemed to be meant to embarrass govt. Opposition, which relentlessly attacked Dhankhar for alleged partisanship and twice came close to moving no-confidence motions against him, appears to have already smelt an opportunity and would like to cash in on it.The resignation seemed just as dramatic as BJP leadership's original decision to elevate him to the position. The decision to appoint him as West Bengal governor was seen as too generous for the new entrant to BJP who had once served as minister of state in the short-lived V P Singh govt. Despite the surprise, there is near unanimity in political circles that Dhankhar is not going to hang up his boots anytime soon. Those who have been interacting with him speak about a fresh innings: this time as a farmer representative belonging to Jat community who has served in the second most important constitutional position.","Dhankhar caught govt unawares on by allowing notice against justice varma.

NEW DELHI: The`tanks in the air’ for the Army are finally here. Three of the six long-delayed Apache AH-64 attack helicopters, contracted under the Rs 5,691 crore deal with the US in Feb 2020, arrived in India on Tuesday.The three Apache gunships were transported on board a gigantic Antonov-124 aircraft to the Hindon airbase, on the outskirts of New Delhi, at 10 am. The heavy-duty choppers will now be flown to Jodhpur, where the Army had raised an Apache squadron in March last year to cater for the western front with Pakistan.The next three Apaches, which are armed with Stinger air-to-air missiles, Hellfire Longbow air-to-ground missiles, guns and rockets, will be delivered by Nov, as earlier reported by TOI.“The arrival of the first batch of the Apache helicopters for the Army is a significant step towards strengthening India’s defence capabilities. These advanced helicopters will enhance the Army Aviation Corps’ operational effectiveness, especially in challenging terrains,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.The six Apaches for the Army, which were delayed due to supply chain problems faced by Boeing, will add to the 22 such choppers inducted by IAF under the Rs 13,952 crore deal with the US in Sept 2015.One of those choppers was badly damaged after a hard landing near Khardung La in Ladakh on April 4 last year.Also Read: India to tie-up with France for next-generation fighter jet engine?

The Army and the IAF are also slated to induct 156 indigenous Prachand light combat helicopters, which are capable of offensive operations in high-altitude areas like Siachen Glacier and eastern Ladakh, under a mega Rs 62,700 crore contract inked with Hindustan Aeronautics in March. The Army will get 90 of them, the IAF 66.The Army Aviation Corps (AAC) is slowly but steadily bolstering its strike, surveillance and airlift capabilities, with plans underway to also induct 126 light utility helicopters as well as additional Dhruv advanced light helicopters.

NEW DELHI: The Congress party on Tuesday questioned Jagdeep Dhankhar's sudden resignation from the Vice President post, saying the reasons are ""far deeper"" than the health concerns he mentioned in his letter to President Droupadi Murmu.The grand old party also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's brief message on social media, calling it a ""non-post"" that only adds to the mystery surrounding the abrupt decision.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said in his post on X, ""PM's non-post on X regarding Shri Jagdeep Dhankar’s forced resignation has only added to the mystery of his abrupt exit. Surely the PM could have been a bit more gracious — he is, after all, the supreme master of hypocrisy.""He added, ""The kisanputra is being denied even a dignified farewell.""Prime Minister Modi had earlier posted on X: ""Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar Ji has got many opportunities to serve our country in various capacities, including as the Vice President of India. Wishing him good health.""The Congress also urged the government to come forward with a full explanation for the resignation.Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Tankha expressed surprise, saying Dhankhar appeared cheerful while presiding over the House just a day earlier.“While presiding over Rajya Sabha yesterday he was his good jolly self!! Did the way he proactively handled the 2 impeachment motions (Justice Yadav & Verma) yesterday the last straw!!” he posted on X.Later, speaking to reporters, Tankha added, ""It's very unexpected. It shouldn't have happened the way it has happened. There is an issue because he is healthy. He was in a jovial mood. However, something happened in the afternoon. Ministers didn't appear for his meeting. He might have felt insulted.""Congress general secretary K C Venugopal also said the government must explain why the vice president suddenly stepped down.Jairam Ramesh further explained that Dhankhar chaired the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the Rajya Sabha at 12:30 PM on Monday, which was attended by several members, including Union ministers J P Nadda and Kiren Rijiju.However, when the BAC reassembled at 4:30 PM under Dhankhar’s chairmanship, both Nadda and Rijiju were absent. “It waited for Shri Nadda and Shri Rijiju to arrive. They never came. Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar was not personally informed that the two senior Ministers were not attending. Rightly he took umbrage and rescheduled the BAC for today at 1 PM,” Ramesh posted.""So something very serious happened yesterday between 1pm and 4:30pm to account for the deliberate absence of Nadda and Rijiju from the second BAC,"" he added.Ramesh said Dhankhar’s decision to resign was unprecedented. ""Now in a truly unprecedented move, Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar has resigned. He has given health reasons for doing so. Those should be respected. But it is also a fact that there are far deeper reasons for his resignation.""He also praised Dhankhar for standing up on key issues. ""While always lauding the post-2014 India, he spoke fearlessly for the welfare of farmers, forcefully against what he called ‘ahankar (arrogance)’ in public life, and strongly on judicial accountability and restraint,"" Ramesh said.""To the extent possible under the current G2 ruling regime, he tried to accommodate the Opposition. He was a stickler for norms, proprieties, and protocol, which he believed were being consistently disregarded in both his capacities,"" he added.""Jagdeep Dhankar’s resignation speaks highly of him. It also speaks poorly of those who had got him elected as vice president in the first instance,"" Ramesh said.The Congress had earlier appealed to Prime Minister Modi to convince Dhankhar to reconsider. ""We wish him the best of health but also request him to reconsider his decision. We also expect the Prime Minister to get Mr Dhankhar to change his mind. This will be in the nation’s interest,"" Ramesh said.He added that farmers in particular would be relieved if Dhankhar decided to stay on.Dhankhar, 74, took office as vice president in August 2022 and had over two years remaining in his term. He submitted his resignation to President Droupadi Murmu on Monday evening, citing health reasons and stepping down with immediate effect.Ramesh, who was with him earlier in the day, said in a post on Monday night, ""The sudden resignation of the Vice President and Chairman of the Rajya Sabha is as shocking as it is inexplicable. I was with him alongside a number of other MPs till around 5 PM today and had spoken to him over the phone at 7:30 PM.""""No doubt Mr Dhankhar has to give topmost priority to his health. But clearly there is far more to his totally unexpected resignation than meets the eye,"" he said, while adding that this was not the time for speculation.He also revealed that Dhankhar had called for a BAC meeting at 1 PM on Tuesday and was expected to make major announcements related to the judiciary.","The congress party questioned jagdeep dhankhar's sudden resignation from the vice president post.

NEW DELHI: The auxiliary power unit (APU) located in the tail section of an Air India Airbus A321 (TV-TVG) caught fire at Delhi airport when passengers were disembarking from the aircraft after its arrival from Hong Kong on Tuesday. The aircraft, which had about 170 people on board, was damaged. Luckily passengers and crew were unhurt. The airline has reported this to the regulator. Sources say this could be due to a maintenance issue.An AI spokesperson said: “Flight AI 315, operating from Hong Kong to Delhi on July 22, 2025, experienced an APU fire shortly after it had landed and parked at the gate. The incident occurred while passengers had begun disembarking, and the APU was automatically shut down as per system design. There was some damage to the aircraft, however, passengers and crew members disembarked normally, and are safe. The aircraft has been grounded for further investigations and the regulator has been duly notified. ”According to aviation website Skybrary, APU allows an aircraft to operate autonomously without reliance on ground support equipment such as a ground power unit, an external air-conditioning unit or a high pressure air start cart.“The APU is a small jet engine which is normally located in the tail cone of the aircraft but, in some cases, is located in an engine nacelle or in the wheel well. The APU can be started utilising only the aircraft battery(s) and, once running, will provide electrical power to aircraft systems as well as bleed air for AC and for engine start,” the website says.There have been instances of APU failure of APU fire both on ground and inflight globally. In June 2016, the cabin of a fully loaded Airbus A330 of a foreign airline on ground at London Heathrow was engulfed with smoke and an emergency evacuation had to be initiated. Investigation found that the smoke had been caused when an APU seal failed and hot oil entered the bleed air supply.Also Read: Runway scare: 3 tyres burst, engine damaged as Air India flight veers off course during landing at Mumbai airport In July 2013, passengers still boarding an Air France Boeing 777-300 at Paris CDG felt a burning smell and then thin smoke in the cabin.

NEW DELHI: With the sudden resignation of Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday, the race to elect his successor is set to begin. The Constitution mandates that such a vacancy must be filled ""as soon as possible,"" typically within six months.In the interim, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh will preside over the Upper House. However, this stopgap arrangement is limited to parliamentary functions and does not confer the title or powers of an acting Vice President.Importantly, the successor will not simply complete the remainder of Dhankhar's tenure but will begin a full five-year term upon assuming office.The Vice President of India also serves as the ex-officio chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, making this transition particularly relevant ahead of the next parliamentary session.The vice president is elected by members of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, including nominated members of the Upper House. And currently, the NDA holds a comfortable edge.The current combined strength of the two Houses stands at 786, factoring in six vacancies - one in Lok Sabha (Basirhat, West Bengal) and five in Rajya Sabha (four from Jammu and Kashmir and one from Punjab, where AAP MP Sanjeev Arora stepped down after winning a state assembly bypoll last month).To win, a candidate must secure at least 394 votes, assuming full turnout.The BJP-led NDA is well positioned. It commands the support of 293 MPs in the 542-member Lok Sabha and 129 MPs in the Rajya Sabha (effective strength: 240), including likely backing from nominated members. This gives the ruling alliance a projected total of 422 votes—well above the required majority.Under Article 68(2) of the Constitution, an election to fill a vacancy in the office of the vice president due to resignation, death, removal, or otherwise must be held ""as soon as possible."" The person elected will serve a full five-year term from the date of assuming office.The vice presidential election follows the system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote and is conducted via secret ballot, as laid down in Article 66(1). Electors rank candidates in order of preference.The vice president is the second-highest constitutional authority in India and also serves as ex-officio chairperson of the Rajya Sabha. While the tenure is five years, the incumbent continues until a successor takes office.Dhankhar, who took office in August 2022, resigned abruptly on Monday citing health reasons. His resignation letter was submitted to President Droupadi Murmu and took effect immediately.(With PTI inputs)","Vice president jagdeep dhankhar resigned abruptly on monday citing health reasons.

NEW DELHI: Parliament on Tuesday witnessed a strong opposition offensive against the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, with members across party lines forcing a washout of proceedings in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, and holding a sit-in in the Parliament complex.INDIA bloc members Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav, Kanimozhi, TR Baalu, Misa Bharti, Manoj Jha, Kalyan Banerjee, KC Venugopal and a host of other MPs gathered at the main gate of the Parliament building, where they raised slogans against the SIR and demanded that it be scrapped.At the meeting of the INDIA bloc in the chamber of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, the opposition decided to take up the issue in the two Houses to ensure that the urgent concern of RJD was not overshadowed by the controversy over Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor in the opening days of the Monsoon session.The issue figured prominently in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha that failed to transact any business. The opposition has listed Election Commission's electoral rolls review in poll-bound Bihar as its top priority alongside the terror attack for discussion. Congress whip Manickam Tagore said, ""In the first half, LoP (in LS) Rahul Gandhi wanted to speak but he was not allowed, just like Monday.

NEW DELHI: The first truly supersonic fighters to be inducted by the Indian Air Force from Russia in 1963 but plagued by an alarmingly high crash rate in later years, the MiG-21s will fly for the last time in Indian skies this Sept.The IAF is now left with only two MiG-21 'Bison' squadrons, totalling 36 fighters, at the Nal airbase in Rajasthan. The ceremonial farewell for the MiG-21s, after over six decades in service, which saw the old warhorses take part in all major conflicts, will take place at Chandigarh on Sept 19.After the first lot of MiG-21s were inducted from Russia, the single-engine jets were produced by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited in large numbers and also underwent upgrades later. The highly-unforgiving and ageing MiG-21s, however, continued to lack modern systems with built-in safety mechanisms.Huge delays in the production of the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, which were supposed to replace the virtually obsolete MiG-21s, means that the IAF will now be left with just 29 fighter squadrons. This when the IAF authorised 42.5 squadrons for the collusive challenge from China and Pakistan.TOI had earlier reported the two remaining MiG-21 squadrons will be retired this year after the IAF repeatedly deferred the phasing out of the delta-wing jets due to the depletion in the number of its fighter squadrons. The MiG-21 jets and the Cheetah/Chetak helicopters, which number around 350 in the armed forces, in particular, should have been retired at least a couple of decades ago.Of the 872 MiG-21s progressively inducted by IAF, over 400 were lost in accidents since 1971-72. Crashes of different MiG variants, the bulk of them being MiG-21s, have killed well over 200 pilots and 50 civilians on the ground over the decades. The MiG-21s, however, did play a stellar role especially during the 1965 and 1971 wars.","The first truly supersonic fighters to be inducted by the indian air force from russia in 1963.

NEW DELHI: Before he surprised political circles by announcing his resignation, Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar alarmed Rashtrapati Bhavan officials by turning up to meet President Droupadi Murmu without an appointment.The protocol-driven President's secretariat has not had to deal with such unexpected developments in a long time. Not surprisingly, the unscheduled arrival of the constitutional functionary at 9pm caused a flutter in the sedate office, with the ADC rushing to the military secretary to break the news of Dhankhar's presence in the premises.After the hastily-arranged meeting with Murmu, Dhankhar, as required under the Constitution, submitted his resignation to her. He broke the news to the public on X at 9.25pm.Dhankhar's unannounced visit was another indication of the sudden trigger that led to his resignation, as the day had been business as usual with no hint of the late-evening drama.Home ministry notified Dhankhar's resignation on Tuesday. In a gazette notification signed by home secretary Govind Mohan, MHA said, ""Resignation of Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar, Vice-President of India, is hereby published for general information.""In another development, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh called on Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Tuesday.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: It is said there are no permanent friends or foes in politics. This was proved true once again when the surprise exit of Jagdeep Dhankhar as Vice-President on health grounds on Monday turned many of his sworn critics into well-wishers. This even as most of the NDA leaders - with whom Dhankhar had worked closely since he took office in August 2022 - refrained from making any comments.The opposition, which had moved an impeachment motion against Dhankhar in December last year - accusing him of being partisan and acting like a government spokesperson, questioned the government over his sudden exit and even called for reinstatement of the former VP in ""nation's interest.""The Congress , which called Dhankhar's abrupt exit ""forced resignation"", had words of praise for the former Vice-President. However, Congress chief Kharge refrained from commenting on the resignation and said ""Only he knows the reason. We have nothing to say on this. Either the government knows or he knows. ""Here is what Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in his reaction on Dhankhar's resignation:Now, contrast this with what the Congress had said about the former Vice-President in December last year over Dhankhar's frequent runs-ins with the opposition members.This attack then was led by Kharge.Little wonder, the BJP has been quick to take digs at opposition's ""concerns"". BJP MP Nishikant Dubey took a jibe at the opposition for expressing shock over Dhankhar's resignation.""Opposition is playing the role of Kader Khan in the film,"" Dubey posted on X while citing a news report from December last year where the opposition parties moved to impeach Dhankhar from the Vice President's office and accused him of being ""partisan"".But while the opposition's ""change of heart"" can be debated, the big question that remains is why did Dhankhar quit in a rush? The opposition claims health was not the real reason and there was more to it than meets the eye.Urging the government to speak up, Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi said: ""This is very sad, and whatever happened is not normal. A akhad (stubborn) person like him, who used to come to the Parliament even when sick, citing health reasons for resignation, doesn't seem normal. The government should speak on it. It is silent and it indicates that everything is not normal.""Congress MP Karti Chidambaram demanded transparency from the government.""I don't believe that Vice President is in such precarious health that he can't discharge his functions anymore. This looks like one of those Soviet style resignations when, in those days, high-ranking officials were asked to go citing medical reasons. However, in India, which is an open democracy, we need to have far greater transparency. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Hopefully, in the coming days, we will have some transparency,"" Chidambaram told ANI.And while the ""worried"" opposition had nice words to say about Dhankhar, the usual effusive praise that is showered on an occupant of a high office on his or her departure was conspicuously missing from the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance's side. Barring Prime Minister Modi, who put out a brief post, most of the leading government figures refrained from offering any comment.""Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar Ji has got many opportunities to serve our country in various capacities, including as the Vice President of India. Wishing him good health,"" the Prime Minister said on X.Jairam Ramesh reacted sharply to PM Modi 's post and said: ""PM's non-post on X regarding Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar's forced resignation has only added to the mystery of his abrupt exit. Surely the PM could have been a bit more gracious -- he is, after all, the supreme master of hypocrisy. The kisanputra is being denied even a dignified farewell.""And while speculations will continue on Dhankhar's exit, it is interesting to see how the opposition, once at the receiving end of the former Vice-President, is now heaping praises on him.",The opposition had moved an impeachment motion against dhankhar in december last year - accusing him of being partisan.

Calgary Flames hold firm as Toronto Maple Leafs trade talks for Nazem Kadri stall

Toronto Maple Leafs remain interested in Nazem Kadri trade but face uphill battle with Calgary Flames

FAQs:

1. What is Nazem Kadri’s net worth in 2025?

2.

Who is Nazem Kadri’s wife?

The Toronto Maple Leafs have been actively exploring trade options this offseason to strengthen their roster following Mitch Marner’s departure. One of their top targets has reportedly been Calgary Flames center Nazem Kadri. While Kadri could be an ideal replacement in the lineup, trade talks between the two sides have failed to progress, with Calgary holding firm on its demands and Toronto lacking the assets to make a compelling offer.According to SportsNet’s Nick Kypreos, the Maple Leafs have made multiple attempts this summer to bring Nazem Kadri back to Toronto. However, the Calgary Flames have rebuffed every proposal so far, indicating they are not willing to part with their star center unless the offer is significantly in their favor.Kadri, who recorded 35 goals and 32 assists last season, continues to be a key leader on and off the ice for Calgary. His offensive consistency and veteran presence make him an integral piece of the Flames’ core. That value has translated into a high asking price, one that the Maple Leafs have yet to meet.While Toronto remains interested in a reunion with Kadri, their limited pool of tradable assets is proving to be a major roadblock in negotiations.With Marner gone, the pressure is on general manager Brad Treliving to find a high-impact replacement, but Calgary’s unwillingness to budge has complicated matters.For Toronto, acquiring Kadri would provide an immediate boost at center and bring back a familiar face who played a significant part in the team's previous playoff runs. However, the Flames appear content to keep their top scorer unless they receive an offer they can’t refuse.Toronto’s current cap situation and asset pool make it difficult to put together an enticing package.
