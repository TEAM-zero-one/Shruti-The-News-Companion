'Republic Day 2026 Flypast Will Be IAF's Tribute To Operation Sindoor': Says Wing Commander Deshwal

New Delhi: From Bactrian camels to Zanskar ponies, a rare contingent of “animal soldiers” will for the first time be seen marching down Kartavya Path joining the 6,050 military personnel during the 90-minute Republic Day parade on Monday.They will be under the command of Captain Harshita Yadav, daughter of a retired IAF officer, and from the first batch of Indian Army’s Remount & Veterinary Corps.Speaking to TOI, she said, “This contingent is very uniquely curated. There are two Bactrian camels from Ladakh, four Zanskar ponies, four raptors (specially-trained birds of prey), 10 military dogs, mostly indigenously-bred. They are all Army soldiers and have different operational roles.”Perfectly adapted to extreme cold, thin air and altitudes above 15,000 feet, the Bactrian camels, which are recently inducted in Army operations, can carry a load of up to 250 kg and traverse long distances in the cold deserts.She said the Indian Army has been using indigenously-bred dogs for quite some time and they are trained basically for two purposes — detection (explosives, mine detection, tracking, search and avalanche rescue) and protection (assault on enemies).“Training of birds like kites or any animal involves neuroscience. Once you understand the science behind these animals and the training part, then these are highly trainable,” Captain Harshita said.IAF Air Commodore Manish Sabharwal, during a Republic Day press preview on Friday, said the S-400 air defence system, which shot down multiple Pakistan aircraft and also a spy plane from a distance of over 300 km deep inside Pakistan, which is a “documented kill”, will also be showcased at the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) tableau during the parade for the first time.The tableau will showcase India's victory in Operation Sindoor last year and the jointness of the three services displayed during the decisive action. One side will feature lethal military weapons that proved crucial during the operation. The other side will depict the destruction of the infrastructure on the side of Pakistan.Major General Navraj Dhillon, Chief of Staff, Delhi Area, said Lt Gen Bhavnish Kumar, GOC, Delhi Area, will head the parade for the fourth time.Battalion, Shaktibaan regiment, drone shakti and robotic mules to take part in the parade for the first time, along with Ladakh Scouts,” he said. He said the Army will feature the debut of a Battle Array Formation showcasing synchronised manoeuvres alongside tanks, missile systems, drones and armoured platforms. The defence assets that will be showcased during the parade will include BrahMos, Akash missile system, Medium Range Surface-To-Air Missile (MRSAM) system, Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS), Dhanush artillery gun, Shaktiban and a static display of some drones.The parade will also see the debut of the Shaktiban Regiment, which has been set up in the artillery. The newly-raised regiment will be equipped with a drone, counter-drone and loiter munition. Eighteen marching contingents and 13 bands will take part in the parade.Akash weapon system and MRSAM system are being fielded in this year's parade. Universal Rocket Launcher System URLS 'Suryastra', which can carry out surface-to-surface strikes up to 300 km, is being showcased for the first time in the parade, Maj Gen Dhillon said.As European Council president Antonio Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will be the chief guests, a small EU contingent, comprising an officer of the colonel rank, will lead the delegation. Following him in their contingent will be four flag-bearers.A senior military official said women’s participation is also in big numbers. CRPF’s Assistant Commandant Simran Bala will be the first woman officer to lead an all-male contingent at the parade.Captain Samira, a fourth-generation army officer, is the commander of an Army tableau depicting the success of Op Sindoor. She told TOI the tableau will display the indigenously developed military assets and weapon systems used during the Pakistan conflict and will also highlight Atmanirbhar Bharat.DRDO will showcase some of its path-breaking innovations for national security during the parade. Apart from displaying long-range anti-ship hypersonic missile (LR-AShM), DRDO will have a tableau 'naval technologies for combat submarines'.A formation flying named “Operation Sindoor” comprising Rafale, Su-30, Jaguar and MiG-29 combat jets will feature in the IAF's R-Day flypast that will serve as a powerful symbol of the dominance it established during the four-day hostilities with Pakistan last May. A total of 29 aircraft, including 16 fighters, nine helicopters and four transport planes, will be part of the flypast.A total of 30 tableaux to roll down Kartavya Path and 150 years of Vande Mataram will be the theme of the parade.","A rare contingent of ‘animal soldiers’ will for the first time be seen joining the 6,050 military personnel during the 90-minute republic day parade on monday.

Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says in an interview with Alpyu Singh that free and fair elections in her country are impossible under Muhammad Yunus’ interim govt and that India deserves a reliable neighbour. Excerpts:

Tarique Rahman

has assumed office as

Bangladesh Nationalist Party

chairman recently. How do you look at his return?

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss

A lot of people are questioning whether an election could actually take place in Feb? If so, how will

Awami League

take part, considering that there is a ban on your party?

As atrocities against minorities continue in Bangladesh, India's external affairs ministry reacted by saying there is a disturbing pattern in all this. What do you think is reason behind these recurring attacks?

How can India help in restoring peace in Bangladesh?

What do you think is the future of India-Bangladesh bilateral relations?

The people of Bangladesh should remember that Tarique Rahman has lived in exile in London for years, far removed from the daily realities faced by ordinary citizens. He fled the country because of his role in abetting his late mother, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, in the embezzlement of public funds. This is not a matter of political disagreement, but of accountability and integrity.BNP leadership has consistently aligned itself with extremist elements when it suits its short-term interests, even at the cost of national stability... it has chosen exclusion, intimidation, and opportunism. Bangladesh deserves leadership that governs from within the country, respects pluralism, and is accountable to the people, not figures who seek power through alliances with radical forces while remaining safely abroad.The question is not whether elections will take place but whether these will be elections in any meaningful or legitimate sense... At present, Bangladesh is ruled by an unelected regime that has appointed itself the authority to rewrite our country's constitution and amend our legislation to ban the nation's most widely supported party from participating in elections.Over half the voters in Bangladesh have confidence in Awami League and would vote for us if Awami League were allowed to participate.It is precisely this fear that has led them to ban us.A govt's most basic duty is to protect its citizens. The interim govt has not only failed in this responsibility, it has actively emboldened this repression. Under Yunus, extremist groups that my govt worked hard to contain have been empowered and elevated to positions of authority. These criminals, many of whom belong to known terrorist orgs, have been allowed to spread a hardline ideology that threatens to remove any trace of diversity from our country and carry out deplorable acts of violence against peaceful Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Ahmadi Muslims with total impunity. The current climate is the direct result of the appeasement of fundamentalist forces.India has rightly condemned the human rights abuses and political repression that have become all too common under the Yunus regime. They are watching in dismay right now as Bangladesh descends into lawlessness, as minority groups face daily acts of violence, as political imprisonments become the norm, and as harmful, hostile rhetoric emanates from Dhaka. India understands that prosperity of our two nations is tightly linked.n India is Bangladesh's closest friend and longest-standing ally, a relationship built through geography, history and cooperation. Yunus has done considerable damage to this relationship through his empowerment of extremist groups who freely target religious minorities with impunity and his willingness to allow mobs to besiege Indian diplomatic premises and threaten representatives. This is recklessness by an administration with neither the experience nor the mandate to dictate Bangladesh's foreign policy.India deserves a reliable partner in Bangladesh, one that can maintain stability and honour its commitments. We must return to being the friend our neighbours knew they could trust.","Ousted bangladesh pm sheikh hasina says free and fair elections in her country are impossible under muhammad yunus’ interim govt.

Indian seafarers are most abandoned in the world again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-seafarers-are-most-abandoned-in-the-world-again/articleshow/127319128.cms,"Representative image: ANI

LONDON: Indian seafarers are the most abandoned in the world for the third year running.A total of 1,125 Indian seafarers were abandoned on ships in 2025 out of a total of 6,223 seafarers abandoned across 410 ships worldwide, making 2025 the worst year on record for seafarer abandonment.The number of Indian seafarers abandoned has gone up 25% compared to 2024, when 899 were abandoned. In 2023, it was 401. After Indians, the next highest cohort to be abandoned in 2025 were Filipinos (539).India is the third-biggest supplier of seafarers in the world, after the Philippines and China.Worldwide the total number of seafarers abandoned has increased by 32% and ship abandonments are up 31% compared to 2024, according to the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), headquartered in London.ITF data shows that seafarers were owed a total of $25.8 million in 2025 as a consequence of abandonment. From this, the ITF has recovered and returned $16.5 million to seafarers.The two countries where most ship abandonments took place were Türkiye and the UAE.Seafarer abandonment is defined as failing to cover the cost of a seafarer’s repatriation; leaving a seafarer without maintenance; or severing ties with a seafarer, including failing to pay wages for at least two months.“It’s nothing short of a disgrace that, yet again, we are seeing record numbers of seafarers abandoned by unscrupulous ship owners,” said David Heindel, chair of the ITF seafarers’ section.An Indian seafarer abandoned with three Indian crew on the “Eleen Armonia”, off the coast of Nigeria, since June, without pay, said: “I can’t sleep from stress, and if this continues I don’t know how it will affect my health. I joined this vessel quickly because the assignment meant I could spend Christmas and New Year with my new daughter and family. I have now missed these and an important family event. As seafarers, it feels really shameful that we’re treated this way. ”Last Sept India’s Directorate General of Shipping blacklisted 86 vessels linked to recurrent Indian seafarer abuse.Three hundred and thirty-seven ship abandonments in 2025 were on vessels sailing under flags of convenience — flags of a country other than the country of ownership. These flags are commonly used by shadow fleets (carrying sanctioned goods) to hide the identity of the real ship owner and are associated with poor safety standards and working conditions.","India is the third-biggest supplier of seafarers in the world, after the philippines and china.

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss

Hasina lists 5 demands

First, restore democracy by removing the illegal Yunus administration. Second, put an end to the daily acts of violence we are seeing on our streets. Third, deliver an ironclad guarantee ensuring the safety of religious minority groups, women and girls, and the most vulnerable in our society. Fourth, end politically motivated acts of lawfare used to intimidate, silence, and jail journalists and members of the Bangladesh Awami League and opposition political parties. Fifth, invite the United Nations to conduct a new and truly impartial investigation into the events of the past year.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh’s exiled former prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday launched a sharp attack on the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus , calling for the overthrow of “foreign-serving puppet regime” to restore democracy and constitutional rule in the country.In an audio message played at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of South Asia in New Delhi, Hasina accused the Yunus-led administration of pushing Bangladesh into an era of terror, lawlessness and democratic exile.She urged the people of Bangladesh to unite against what she termed a “foreign-serving puppet regime” and appealed for the revival of democratic institutions.""In this grave hour, the entire nation must rise united and galvanized by the spirit of our great Liberation War. To overthrow the foreign-serving puppet regime of this national enemy at any cost, the brave sons and daughters of Bangladesh must defend and restore the Constitution written in the blood of martyrs, reclaim our independence, safeguard our sovereignty, and revive our democracy,"" Hasina said.Setting the tone of her address, Hasina painted a grim picture of present-day Bangladesh, linking the political turmoil to her removal from office following mass protests nearly a year and a half ago.“Bangladesh stands today at the edge of an abyss, a nation battered and bleeding, navigating one of the most perilous chapters in its history,” she said, invoking the legacy of the Liberation War and her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. “The entire country has become a vast prison, an execution ground, a valley of death.”Hasina alleged that since August 5, 2024, when she was forced out, democracy had effectively been driven into exile.Directly targeting the interim chief adviser, she said, “Everywhere one hears only the cries of people struggling to survive amid destruction. A desperate plea for life. Heart-rending screams for relief. The murderous fascist Yunus, a usurer, a money launderer, a plunderer, and a corrupt, power-hungry traitor, has bled our nation dry with his all-consuming paradigms, staining the soul of our motherland.""""On August 5, 2024, in a meticulously engineered conspiracy, the national enemy, the murderous fascist Yunus, and his anti-state militant accomplices forcibly ousted me, though I am the people's representative directly elected. From that day forward, the nation has been plunged into an age of terror, merciless, relentless, and suffocating. Democracy is now in exile,” ousted PM added.Hasina said her Awami League was putting forward a five-point demand aimed at national reconciliation and democratic revival.These include the removal of “illegal Yunus administration,” an end to violence on the streets, guarantees for the safety of religious minorities, women and vulnerable groups, a halt to politically motivated legal investigation against journalists and opposition leaders and an impartial United Nations probe into events over the past year.""The Awami League calls for the following actions to help unify Bangladesh and banish the divisive actions of the past twelve months. We urge Muhammad Yunus to stop ignoring his own people and do what needs to be done in order to heal our country by following five crucial steps we believe will lead to a better and stronger Bangladesh,"" she said.Hasina was removed from power in August 2024 amid widespread protests, after which an interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge. Bangladesh is also scheduled to conduct polls in February this year.While the Yunus administration has pledged to hold free and fair elections, its decision to ban the Awami League has drawn criticism and raised concerns about political inclusivity. The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have historically dominated the country’s politics.","Sheikh hasina was removed from power in august 2024 amid widespread protests.

The statement was shared on X by Washington’s ambassador to New Delhi, Sergio Gor.In the letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump wrote, “It is my great honour to invite you, as Prime Minister of the Republic of India, to join me in a critically historic and magnificent effort to solidify peace in the Middle East and, at the same time, to embark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict!”The countries represented on the Board of Peace includes Bahrain, Morocco, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Uzbekistan and Mongolia.The number of participants was lower than what US officials had indicated earlier.

India Named Global Growth Engine By IMF, BJP Says Global Data Exposes Rahul Gandhi's Claim

BJP hits back

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Friday renewed his “dead economy” attack on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , citing the impact of steep US tariffs on India’s textile sector. He held him accountable, alleging official inaction amid job losses and growing uncertainty for exporters.“50% US tariffs and uncertainty are badly hurting India’s textile exporters. Job losses, factory shutdowns and reduced orders are a reality of our ‘Dead Economy’,” Gandhi wrote in a post on X.Targeting PM Modi, Gandhi accused the government of failing to respond to the crisis despite the scale of the impact.“Mr Modi has offered no relief or even spoken about tariffs, even though more than 4.5 crore jobs and lakhs of businesses are at stake. Modi ji, you are accountable; please direct your attention to this matter!,” the leader of opposition further wrote.Earlier, echoing US President Donald Trump ’s sharp criticism of India’s economy, Gandhi had said the Indian economy was “dead” and blamed the PM Modi government’s policies for the situation.He accused the Centre of damaging growth through decisions such as demonetisation, a flawed GST rollout and what he termed the collapse of MSMEs and job creation, remarks that had drawn strong political reactions.In a post on X last year, Gandhi said, “Economy is dead. Modi killed it”. He also listed the key reasons behind the decline: the “Adani-Modi partnership,” demonetisation, a flawed GST, a failed “Assemble in India” initiative, the wiping out of MSMEs, and distress in the farming sector.Speaking to reporters at the time, Gandhi claimed that the economic slowdown was evident to everyone except the Prime Minister and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.“Everybody knows this except PM Modi and the Finance Minister. It is a dead economy. I am glad that the US President has stated facts,” he said, alleging that government policies had destroyed jobs and hurt small businesses.Trump had earlier taken a swipe at India and Russia on his Truth Social platform. He wrote, ""I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India — their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together.""Reacting to Gandhi’s claims, the BJP rejected allegations of job losses and factory shutdowns. Union minister Giriraj Singh said that the industry was expanding, not declining and accused the Congress leader of spreading misinformation.Also read: 'Maha Yuddh in Maha Panchayat?'

“The textile and garment industries have not shut down; the only shutdown is in the minds of those spreading negativity about India. From April to December 2024, exports were Rs 95,000 crore, and from April to December 2025, they rose to Rs 1,02,000 crore. So, which shutdown are they talking about? Which exports have fallen? Those spreading confusion are misleading people. During the previous government, stitching machines, whether for garments or leather products, were not manufactured in India, and 40 lakh machines had to be imported. .. In the fabric-to-garment sector, one machine provides employment to 1.7 people. So with 2 crore machines today, at least 3 crore people are employed in this sector alone. Over the past 11 years, we have created employment for 5 crore people in the textile sector. This is not a shutdown. Visit industrial hubs in Odisha, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and across the country, and you will see investments worth Rs 60,000 crore. Stop spreading false claims about a shutdown, the industry is thriving; it is only his (Rahul Gandhi) mindset that is in a shutdown,” Singh said.","Congress leader and leader of opposition in lok sabha rahul gandhi renewed his “dead economy’ attack on the prime minister narendra modi.

'Netaji’s Strategic Realism Matters More Today As World Fragments', Says CDS Anil Chauhan At JNU

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said his govt was following Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's vision of a strong India as a weak nation could not achieve its goals. He added that the country now knew how to build, manage and use power.In a video address to a programme in Andaman and Nicobar Islands on Parakram Diwas, which commemorates Netaji's birth anniversary, Modi said due to the insecurities of those who came to office after independence - a swipe at Jawaharlal Nehru and his successors from Congress - the glorious history of the islands, which were briefly under the control of Bose's Indian National Army during the World War II, were not preserved as they wanted to credit only one family for independence.His govt has taken corrective measures, he added. Home minister Amit Shah lauded Netaji's ""unwavering determination to liberate India"" through his long and fraught journey across different countries and said every youth should read about his life to strengthen their resolve to protect the nation.""Netaji declared an independent India in 1943 by hoisting the tricolour in Andaman and Nicobar Islands,"" he said in a post. In his remarks, Modi said India was making its defence sector self-reliant in line with Bose's vision.India struck its enemies in their homes during Op Sindoor, he said in reference to the military strikes on terror sites in Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack, and destroyed them, he said, emphasising his govt's deft use of power to achieve its goals and the expansion of its defence production.""In their political self-interest, the nation's history was neglected,"" he said, noting that the islands continued to be knowns by the names of British officers before his govt made the correction. Port Blair was now 'Shri Vijaypuram', a name that reminded us of Netaji's victory, he said, recalling that 21 islands of Andamans were named after 21 Param Vir Chakra awardees in 2023.At a presser, BJP slammed Congress for trying to erase Bose's contribution from history in its long tenure in office and said he played the most decisive role in the country's independence. Nehru dismissed Bose's party Forward Bloc as a negative group against Congress and imbued with fascism and communalism, BJP's Sudhanshu Trivedi said, citing comments of B R Ambedkar and others to claim that Bose's campaign had ensured that the colonial rulers were not sure about the loyalty of Indian soldiers.","Pm narendra modi said his govt was following netaji subhas chandra bose's vision of a strong india. He added that the country now knew how to build, manage and use power. Modi said due to the insecurities of those who came to office after independence - a swipe at jawaharlal nehru and his successors from congress.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127343272,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-473192,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

JAMMU: Security forces shot dead a Pakistani terrorist belonging to the proscribed Jaish-e-Mohammad outfit in Billawar, in J&K’s Kathua district, even as Operation Trashi-I entered its sixth day on Friday, IGP Bhim Sen Tuti said.The slain ultra, Usman, was one of the most-wanted Jaish terrorists who had been active in the Udhampur-Kathua belt for the past couple of years after having infiltrated into India. “He had escaped several encounters in the past, with the latest ones on Jan 7 and Jan 13, in the forests of Kahog and Najote,” an official said.The Army’s Rising Star Corps, in an X post, stated that earlier in the day, a joint team of the Army, CRPF and J&K Police launched a counter-terrorism operation in Kathua’s Parhetar area based on intelligence inputs. While combing a house, the search party came under fire, triggering an encounter in which Usman was killed in close combat.The fire exchange lasted only a few minutes, officials said, terming the encounter a breakthrough for security forces.With three more Jaish ultras believed trapped in the region, troops continued their hunt under Operation Trashi-I, combing the forests of Sonnar, Mandral-Singhpora and adjoining areas in Chatroo belt, notwithstanding treacherous terrain and harsh weather conditions, including snowfall.Operation Trashi-I was launched on Jan 18. That night, an intense gunfight between security personnel and terrorists in Sonnar village near the LoC left eight soldiers injured. One of them, Army Special Forces Commando, Havildar Gajendra Singh, succumbed Jan 19 — the first security force death in a counter-terrorism operation in the Union Territory in 2026.On Jan 20, the cordon was strengthened with the help of aerial surveillance and sniffer dogs, following which, the troops busted a well-concealed terrorist hideout and recovered large quantities of rations, utensils, and consumables. Three-four locals from Sonnar village were detained for questioning, as officials suspected that running such a setup would not have been possible without local help from overground workers.On Jan 21, additional forces were rushed to the operation site to fortify the cordon and block possible escape routes. Amid increased vigil ahead of Republic Day, joint teams of security forces conducted door-to-door searches in localities with a high concentration of Burmese (Rohingyas) and Bangladesh nationals in Bhatindi-Narwal-Rajiv Nagar areas on the outskirts of Jammu, as well as in Rajouri, Poonch, Samba, Kathua, Udhampur and Doda districts as a precautionary measure.After a three-day lull, fresh contact was established with terrorists on Thursday in Kishtwar’s Singhpora. Heavy fire was exchanged between both sides before the ultras managed to escape further into the woods. Meanwhile, in Jammu’s Akhnoor sector, security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation following the alleged sighting of terror suspects in Sumah locality the night before.Operation Trashi-I is the third this year in Jammu division, following clashes earlier this month in Kahog and Najote forests of Billawar in Kathua, south of Pir Panjal range.Kishtwar, a remote district east of the Chenab and south of Kashmir Valley, saw intensified counter-terrorism efforts in 2025 as forces tracked Pakistan-based terrorists through steep terrain and thick forests. At least six gun battles were reported there over seven months. On May 22, an Army trooper was killed and two others wounded in Chatroo. Weeks earlier, three Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were shot dead in the same area.Security officials said Kishtwar sits astride a traditional infiltration corridor, with terrorists crossing from Pakistan via Kathua and moving through Udhampur and Doda before heading towards Kashmir valley, using forest cover to evade detection.","The slain ultra, usman, was one of the most-wanted jaish terrorists.

As Trump's Tariffs Bite, PM Modi Invites Brazil President In Strategic Push For Global South Unity

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi spoke to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday and reviewed progress in the India-Brazil strategic partnership, while also underlining the significance of bilateral cooperation for the Global South.

He is also expected to take part in the AI summit during his visit.In the 45-minute conversation, the leaders pledged to work together for UNSC reforms and reaffirmed their commitment to peace in Gaza and to multilateralism.""Glad to speak with President Lula.

'Bibi, Stop Taking Credit': Trump Humiliates Israeli PM At Davos; Calls Out Israeli Iron Dome 'Lie'

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States is set to receive around $600 billion in tariff revenue, adding that the figure is expected to be “much more than that” next year.Trump made the remarks while addressing the World Economic Forum (WEF) Summit in Davos, where he also highlighted what he described as an unprecedented surge in investments flowing into the country.Linking the rise in investment to the November 5 election outcome, Trump said it had brought clarity about his administration’s tariff policy. “We're doing numbers in terms of people investing in the United States as we've never had before,” he said, adding that tariffs were aimed at protecting the country, which he claimed had been taken advantage of for years.Trump noted that the estimated $600 billion in tariff revenue does not include investments by countries and companies setting up operations in the US. “We'll have, I'd say, $600 billion worth of tariff money coming in. And I think we're going to have maybe more than that. By next year, it'll be much more than that,” he said.Highlighting corporate investments, Trump said Apple is spending $650 billion in the US, calling it a major commitment, and added that Toyota has also announced plans to invest in the country, according to news agency ANI.Recalling a meeting in Japan, he said Toyota’s leadership had confirmed the investment plans as part of a broader trend of global companies expanding their US footprint.Calling the developments “amazing,” Trump said, “We've never had anything like it or close,” adding that no other country was witnessing similar investment momentum.He claimed that from an investment perspective, people were in “great shape” and many investors were making substantial money.In Davos, Trump also waived tariffs planned on European allies following what he described as a framework deal over Greenland, though no details of the agreement were disclosed.",Us president donald trump on thursday said the united states is set to receive around $600 billion in tariff revenue next year.

About Trump’s Board of Peace





US President Donald Trump has reacted cautiously but positively to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suggestion that he could use frozen Russian assets to pay for entry into Trump’s proposed “Board of Peace”.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One while returning from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Thursday, Trump said he was open to the idea if the funds were Putin’s own.Asked whether he would allow Putin to use frozen Russian assets for the contribution, Trump said, “I don't know about that. I mean, I've heard that.” After the reporter clarified that the comment came from Putin himself, Trump responded, “Very interesting. But he said he's going to use his money. His money. I think that's fine.”Trump added that Putin had indicated he would contribute $1 billion to join the Board of Peace.“He's going to join the Board of Peace and he's going to make a contribution of a billion dollars by using his money. I mean, if he's using his money, that's great. I think it's important to have everybody,” Trump said.Earlier, Putin suggested that Russia could contribute $1 billion from Russian assets currently frozen in the United States to Trump’s Board of Peace.He also said frozen funds could later be used to rebuild Ukrainian regions after a peace treaty is signed.Putin said the proposal had been discussed with Washington and would be taken up during talks with Trump’s envoys in Moscow.Also read: Ahead of Russia-Ukraine-US talks, Kremlin lays down ‘very important condition’ — what is it

FBI says Ryan Wedding, former Olympian-turned alleged drug kingpin, arrested: reports

Ryan Wedding's criminal charges and Olympic background explained

Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding has been arrested after years as a fugitive, ending a major international manhunt led by US law enforcement. Ryan Wedding, a Canadian national and former Olympian, was taken into custody after being listed on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted fugitives list with a reward of up to $15 million. Authorities allege that Ryan Wedding was running a large transnational criminal enterprise involving cocaine trafficking, murder, and attempted murder. Investigators said the operation spanned the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Colombia. Officials previously claimed the network generated more than $1 billion annually in illegal drug proceeds, making Ryan Wedding one of the most dangerous fugitives sought by US authorities.Law enforcement sources had long believed Ryan Wedding was hiding in Mexico under the protection of the Sinaloa cartel. His arrest, first reported by NBC and later confirmed by CNN, marks a significant breakthrough after years of cross-border investigations involving multiple agencies. Before the criminal allegations, Ryan Wedding represented Canada at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Competing in the men’s parallel giant slalom snowboarding event, Ryan Wedding finished 24th in the world and was once regarded as a high-level international athlete.According to US prosecutors, Ryan Wedding was indicted on charges that include leading a criminal enterprise, trafficking large quantities of cocaine, and ordering acts of violence to protect the drug operation. Investigators allege that Ryan Wedding used intimidation and murder to maintain control over trafficking routes and associates. Former US Attorney General Pam Bondi previously stated that Ryan Wedding’s organization played a major role in fueling international drug trafficking and violence. Officials described the scale of the operation as rare, even among major organized crime cases.The arrest of Ryan Wedding stunned many sports fans who remembered his Olympic career. Ryan Wedding’s transition from elite athlete to FBI fugitive is being described as one of the most dramatic downfalls involving a former Olympian. Authorities have not yet disclosed where Ryan Wedding was arrested or when extradition proceedings will begin. Ryan Wedding is expected to face federal charges in the United States, where a conviction could result in life imprisonment. The case remains active as investigators continue to gather evidence and prepare for court proceedings.","Ryan wedding, a canadian national and former olympian, was taken into custody after being listed on the fbi’s ten most wanted fugitives list.
