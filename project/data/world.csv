Freedom of religion & right to privacy interlinked: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/freedom-of-religion-right-to-privacy-interlinked-sc/articleshow/124798188.cms,"‘Individual’s Autonomy Supreme In Choices Of Faith And Belief’

NEW DELHI: Anti-conversion laws framed by various states, validity of which are being examined by Supreme Court, will have to pass privacy test as the court in a recent verdict linked right to freedom of religion with right to privacy ""in the sense of non-interference from State"".While quashing multiple FIRs filed under Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra had noted right to privacy & right to freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion - under Article 25 the Constitution - are interlinked and had to be examined.Referring to a nine-judge SC bench's verdict on right to privacy, it said this court underlined that Article 25 encapsulates within it the ability to choose a faith and the subsequent freedom to express or not to express such a choice.""In other words, Article 25 carries with it the facets of privacy rights, whereby a person has the intrinsic right to freedom of conscience and also the choice to express it to the world at large. This court highlighted that although Part III of the Constitution does not have a separate article declaring privacy as a fundamental right, yet the broader scheme of Part III portrays and contains in it the various aspects of privacy, Article 25 being one of them,"" it said.The court categorically noted that ""freedom of conscience as ensured under Article 25 falls within the zone of purely private thought process"". It was also emphasised that privacy is a condition precedent for the rights under Article 25 to come into being. ""This court also read privacy rights in other rights pertaining to religious belief under Articles 26 and 28, respectively,"" the bench said.It also drew a similarity on how choosing one's partner is a legitimate constitutional right in which consent of family or community or clan is not necessary once two adults agree to enter into wedlock.Referring to another SC verdict, the bench said, ""It held that the right to marry a person of one's choice is integral to Article 21 of the Constitution as an expression of one's right to life. It categorically held that the intimacies of marriage, including the choices which individuals make on whether to marry, or whom to marry, form one of the rights from a bouquet of rights of right to privacy, and most importantly, transcend the control of the State. """"The court, while observing that the Constitution guarantees the right to practice, profess and propagate religion, held that an individual's autonomy is supreme in choices of faith and belief which are intrinsic in matters of marriage. The court prohibited the State as well as the law from controlling the choice of choosing a partner or even limiting or regulating the ability to decide on such matters,"" it said.","Supreme court quashes multiple firs filed under uttar pradesh prohibition of unlawful conversion of religion act. Justices j b pardiwala and manoj misra noted right to privacy & right to freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion - under article 25 the constitution - are interlinked.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124798196,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-36536,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
EAM: UNSC member shielding barbaric Pahalgam attackers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eam-unsc-member-shielding-barbaric-pahalgam-attackers/articleshow/124798115.cms,"S Jaishankar

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar Friday raised the issue of Pakistan 's support to the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack, while highlighting the challenge that UN faces from terrorism . Speaking on United Nations Day, Jaishankar also said all was not well with the organisation as its decision-making neither reflected its membership nor addressed global priorities.Without naming Pakistan, the minister said a member of UN Security Council had openly protected the group that claimed responsibility for the April 22 attack.Pakistan is currently a non-permanent member of UNSC and had worked with China to dilute council condemnation of the attack. Islamabad also managed to omit from the statement a mention of The Resistance Front, a proxy of the Pakistan-based LeT, which twice claimed responsibility for Pahalgam.Jaishankar said few examples were more telling about the challenges facing UN than its response to terrorism. ""When a sitting security council member openly protects the very organisation that claims responsibility for the barbaric terror attack such as at Pahalgam, what does it do to the credibility of multilateralism,"" asked Jaishankar.He also slammed efforts to draw an equivalence between India and Pakistan after Operation Sindoor that targeted terrorist headquarters and camps in Pakistan and PoK.""Similarly, if victims and perpetrators of terrorism are equated in the name of global strategy, how much more cynical can the world get? When self-proclaimed terrorists are shielded from the sanctioning process, what does it say for the sincerity of those involved?"" he said.The minister said UN debates had become increasingly polarised and any meaningful reform obstructed using the reform process itself. However, Jaishankar also stressed that commitment to multilateralism must remain strong as the world could not abandon hope. ""Howsoever flawed, United Nations must be supported in this time of crisis. Our faith in international cooperation must be reiterated and indeed renewed. It is in that spirit that we all meet to mark this occasion and seek to build a better world,"" he said.",S jaishankar said a member of un security council had openly protected the group that claimed responsibility for the april 22 attack.

‘US Controlled Pak Nuclear Arsenal’: Ex-CIA Agent’s Bombshell, Says ‘Pak Can’t Win Against India’

'US expected India to strike back after 2002, 2008 terror attacks'



Former CIA officer John Kiriakou has revealed that the United States provided millions of dollars to Pakistan under former President Pervez Musharraf , in effect “purchasing” his cooperation.He also claimed that Musharraf handed over control of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal to the US. ""When I was stationed in Pakistan in 2002, I was told unofficially that the Pentagon controlled the Pakistani nuclear arsenal, that Musharraf had turned control over to the United States because he was afraid of exactly what you just described (nuclear weapons falling into terrorist hands),"" Kiriakou told news agency ANI.Kiriakou also revealed that the US refrained from targeting Abdul Qadeer Khan, the architect of Pakistan's atomic bomb, after “direct intervention” by the Saudi government.""A colleague of mine was dealing with A Q Khan,"" Kiriakou said, as quoted by the ANI. ""If we had taken the Israeli approach, we would have just killed him. He was easy enough to find. We knew where he lived. We knew how he spent his day. But he also had the support of the Saudi government. And the Saudis came to us and said, 'Please leave him alone. Please. We like A Q Khan. We're working with A.Q. Khan. We're close to the Pakistanis...They named Faisalabad after King Faisal. Just leave him alone.""Kiriakou called this diplomatic pressure a major US policy failure, describing it as a ""mistake"" by Washington. ""This was a mistake that the US government made, not confronting A Q Khan head-on,"" he said.Khan was born in Bhopal in 1936, moved to Pakistan with his family in 1952 after Partition, and died in Islamabad in 2021 at the age of 85.Kiriakou said the US had expected India to retaliate after the 2001 Parliament attack and 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, but it did not. ""At the CIA we called the Indian policy strategic patience. The Indian government would have been perfectly within its rights to respond by striking Pakistan and they didn't. And I remember at the White House people were saying, wow, the Indians are really exhibiting a very mature foreign policy here. We expected the Indians to, to strike back and they didn't. And that kept the world from what might have been a nuclear exchange. Right? But India's gotten to the point where they can't risk strategic patience being misunderstood as weakness. And so they had to respond,"" he said.He added that Musharraf allowed the US to operate freely. ""Our relations with the Pakistani government were very, very good. It was General Pervez Musharraf at the time. And look, let's be honest here. The United States loves working with dictators. Because then you don't have to worry about public opinion and you don't have to worry about the media anymore. And so we essentially just purchased Musharraf.""Kiriakou said Musharraf allowed the US to operate freely. ""We gave millions and millions and millions of dollars in aid, whether it was military aid or economic development aid. And we would meet with Musharraf regularly, several times a week. And essentially he would let us do whatever we wanted to do. Yes. But Musharraf also had his own people that he needed to deal with,"" he said.He added that Musharraf maintained the support of the military while pretending to cooperate with the US on counterterrorism, but continued activities against India. ""He had to keep the military happy. And the military didn't care about Al-Qaeda. They cared about India. And so in order to keep the military happy and keep some of the extremists happy, he had to allow them to continue this dual life of pretending to cooperate with the Americans on counterterrorism while committing terror against India,"" Kiriakou said.","Former cia officer john kiriakou has revealed that the united states provided millions of dollars to pakistan under former president pervez musharraf.

'

'Pakistan committed terrorism in India — and nobody stopped it'

'Pentagon once controlled Pakistan’s nukes'

'US-Saudi ties are transactional — oil for weapons'

NEW DELHI: Former CIA officer John Kiriakou has said that Pakistan ""cannot win a conventional war against India"" and needs to realise that nothing good will come out of fighting with India.In an interview with ANI, Kiriakou, who served 15 years in the CIA, including as chief of counterterrorism operations in Pakistan said, ""Nothing, literally nothing good will come of an actual war between India and Pakistan because the Pakistanis will lose. It’s as simple as that. They’ll lose. And I’m not talking about nuclear weapons, I’m talking just about a conventional war.""He added that Islamabad must ""come to a policy conclusion"" that provoking India only hurts its own interests.India has repeatedly maintained that it will not tolerate Pakistan’s nuclear blackmail and will respond firmly to any act of terrorism. Over the years, New Delhi has demonstrated this stance through decisive military actions — from the surgical strikes on terror launchpads across the LoC in 2016, to the Balakot airstrikes in 2019, and most recently, Operation Sindoor in May this year.Kiriakou claimed that during his tenure, the US pumped ""millions and millions of dollars"" into Pakistan under then-President Pervez Musharraf, effectively ""buying"" his cooperation.""Our relations with the Pakistani government were very, very good. It was General Pervez Musharraf at the time. And look, let's be honest here. The United States loves working with dictators. Because then you don't have to worry about public opinion and you don't have to worry about the media anymore.And so we essentially just purchased Musharraf,"" he told ANI.""We gave millions and millions and millions of dollars in aid, whether it was military aid or economic development aid.

And the military didn't care about Al-Qaeda. They cared about India. And so in order to keep the military happy and keep some of the extremists happy, he had to allow them to continue this dual life of pretending to cooperate with the Americans on counterterrorism while committing terror against India,"" he revealed.Kiriakou alleged that Washington effectively ""bought"" Pakistan’s intelligence and military establishment with cash.""The US threw millions of dollars at Pakistan under Musharraf. We paid tens of millions in cash to Pakistan’s ISI"" he said, adding that corruption ran deep in the country while ""leaders like Benazir Bhutto lived lavishly abroad as common people starved.""Kiriakou said Pakistan’s support for terrorism against India was an ""open secret"" even during the 2001 Parliament attack and 2008 Mumbai attacks.Reflecting on the 2008 Mumbai attacks, he said, ""I don't think this is Al-Qaeda. I think this is the Pakistani-supported Kashmiri groups. That turned out to be exactly the case. The bigger story was that Pakistan was committing terrorism in India and nobody did anything about it.""Recounting his time in Pakistan in 2002, Kiriakou said he was told unofficially that the Pentagon had control over Islamabad’s nuclear arsenal at the time. ""Musharraf had turned control over to the United States. But over the last 23 years, Pakistan has insisted that’s not true — that their generals control the nukes,"" he said.However, he expressed concern about who truly holds power in Pakistan today, saying that political instability and the military’s influence make the country ""dangerously unpredictable.""Kiriakou on the US-Saudi relationship bluntly said that, ""Our foreign policy in Saudi Arabia really is as simple as we buy their oil and they buy our weapons. That's it."" According to him, ""almost the entire Saudi military is Pakistanis. It's the Pakistanis that protect Saudi Arabia on the ground.""Reflecting on global shifts, Kiriakou also noted that, ""We’re sitting on an ocean of oil. We don’t need the Saudis anymore. They’re hedging their bets, improving ties with China and India. The world is transforming before our eyes.""Kiriakou, who famously blew the whistle on the CIA’s torture program in 2007, said he spent 23 months in prison but remains unapologetic. He said he has ""no regrets, no remorse"" and ""did the right thing"".","Former cia officer john kiriakou has said that pakistan ""cannot win a conventional war against india"" he added that islamabad must ""come to a policy conclusion"" that provoking india only hurts its own interests.

SRINAGAR: BJP sprang a surprise on National Conference Friday in J&K's first Rajya Sabha election since the abrogation of Article 370 , clinching one of the four seats at stake with 32 votes – four more than its current strength of 28 in the assembly.BJP candidate Sat Sharma's victory came amid allegations of cross-voting by the governing party, which had secured ally Congress's backing and the opposition PDP's conditional support for the election. Supporters of BJP and NC were briefly locked in a confrontation outside the assembly after the results were declared.While NC's victorious trio – Choudhary Mohammad Ramzan, Sajad Ahmad Kichloo and Shammi Oberoi – were expected to win the election at a canter, Sharma's triumph led People's Conference legislator Sajad Lone to label it a ""fixed match"". Lone abstained from voting.""Why did NC poll extra votes for candidate 3? They didn't need to. They polled 31 votes for candidate 3 when 29 would have sufficed. Even 28. That's because BJP was fighting for seat 4. Who cross-voted? Whose votes were rejected? And who was hand-in-glove?"" he said.Sharma, who heads the J&K unit of BJP, thanked all legislators who supported him. On the extra votes he received, the newly elected RS member said he had reached out to everyone, irrespective of party affiliation, and ""appealed to their inner conscience"" to vote for a candidate who would work for the greater good.""They listened to their conscience and voted for me,"" he said.CM Omar Abdullah ruled out cross-voting by anyone from his party. ""All of NC's votes were intact across the four elections, as endorsed by our election agent after seeing each polling slip. So, where did the extra votes of BJP come from? Who were the MLAs who deliberately invalidated their votes by marking a wrong preference number while voting?"" he said.""Do they have the guts to put their hands up and own up to helping BJP after promising us their votes? What pressure or inducement helped them make this choice? Let's see if any of BJP's secret team own up to selling their souls.""Sharma's rival, NC's Imran Nabi Dar, accused BJP of horse-trading.

Otherwise, we will expose them.""","Bjp candidate sat sharma's victory came amid allegations of cross-voting by the governing party.

Wrong. WHO has denied ever making such a recommendation and cautions against using a metric used to facilitate inter-country comparison as a benchmark for health human resource planning at the national level.The head of WHO's hea-lth workforce unit, Dr Giorgio Cometto, told TOI: ""WHO does not have a blanket recommendation of 1 doctor/1,000 population. This is a factoid that is not backed up by any WHO document or reference, but unfortunately, it is quoted quite often.""Govts have used the 1:1000 doctor-population ratio to calculate doctor shortage and to push for increasing MBBS seats in existing medical colleges and opening new colleges, even if many of these are poorly equipped.Cometto pointed out that every country ought to consider its unique epidemiology, demography, finances and health system setup in planning for the workforce it will need to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Other public health experts, too, have said the same thing while pointing to the extreme skew in distribution of doctors among states and between rural and urban areas, none of which are being addressed by blanket expansion of medical colleges.WHO uses a threshold of 4.45 doctors, nurses and midwives per 1,000 population, based on the minimum density of health workers generally associated with attaining a median level of coverage of essential SDG services. But this does not reflect the heterogeneity of countries in terms of baseline conditions and health system needs, said Cometto.Medical historian Dr Kiran Kumbhar, who had published an essay on his quest to track the root of this ""invented figure"", found that the earliest official reference was in Medical Council of India's ""Vision 2015"" report in March 2011. It doesn't cite WHO, merely says ""after detailed inputs from various working groups"", there was consensus that ""targeted doctor-population ratio would be 1:1000"".According to Kumbhar, it is the 14-member High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage for India that called 1:1000 a ""WHO norm"" in its report released in Oct 2011. it is citing data from a WHO report, which in turn is citing data from a 2004 report put together by a group of global health experts. The 2004 report observed that countries with fewer than 2.5 healthcare professionals per 1,000 population failed to achieve 80% coverage rate for deliveries by skilled birth attendants or for measles immunisation.","Who cautions against using a metric used to facilitate inter-country comparison as a benchmark for health human resource planning at the national level.

The people of Jammu and Kashmir exercise their fundamental rights in accordance with India’s time-tested democratic traditions and constitutional framework.We, of course, know that these are concepts alien to Pakistan,” he said.Harish outlined India’s vision rooted in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — the idea of the world as one family — which he said defines the country’s global outlook. “This is not only an outlook that anchors our worldview, but also the reason why India has consistently advocated for justice, dignity, opportunity and prosperity for all societies and peoples. It is also the reason why India places its faith in multilateralism, international partnerships and cooperation,” he said.Reflecting on the UN’s role since its inception, the ambassador said the organisation had become a “beacon of hope” for peace and decolonisation but now faces questions about its “relevance, legitimacy, credibility, and efficacy.”“The theme of this debate gains great salience at a time when the world’s largest multilateral organisation – the United Nations – faces questions related to relevance, legitimacy, credibility, and efficacy,” he noted.He added, “This organisation was founded in the aftermath of the Second World War as a beacon of hope for international peace and security. It advanced decolonisation; it has been instrumental in the emergence of new nation-states in the Global South; it drew up ambitious markers for economic growth, social development, and prosperity; it focused our minds on global challenges such as pandemics, countering terrorism and climate change. ”October 24 marks the anniversary of the entry into force of the UN Charter in 1945, after its ratification by a majority of signatories, including the five permanent members of the Security Council.","India’s permanent representative to the united nations, parvathaneni harish, on friday called upon pakistan to end the “grave and ongoing human rights violations” in areas “illegally occupied by it,” particularly in jammu and kashmir.

"Collegium preserves judiciary’s autonomy, say CJI B R Gavai, Justice Kant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collegium-preserves-judiciarys-autonomy-say-cji-b-r-gavai-justice-kant/articleshow/124772986.cms,"NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, on Thursday stoutly defended the much-criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges and said it has helped the judiciary preserve its autonomy and independence in administration of justice.CJI Gavai was speaking at Royal Institute of Management in Thimphu, Bhutan, while Justice Kant was addressing Sri Lankan Supreme Court in Colombo. The CJI cited SC’s 2015 judgment striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission and said granting primary control over judicial appointments to the executive would imperil the independence and autonomy of the judiciary.Justice Kant said the judiciary’s dominant role in appointment of judges to HCs and SC is a compelling “illustration of the doctrine of separation of powers”. The judiciary’s independence and autonomy help it to go beyond simple resolution of disputes or defending constitutional boundaries; it has allowed constitutional courts actively “shape the democratic imagination of a society and to function as architects of democratic life”, he held.Justice Kant said that if separation of powers is the framework of India’s constitutional democracy, then judicial review — Article 32 (a person can approach SC directly over violation of fundamental rights) and Article 226 (a person can file a writ petition in an HC) — is the sustaining force of democracy.The ambit of judicial review extends to constitutional functionaries like EC, Lok Sabha speaker and governors, as well as legislative assemblies. “No act of governance is beyond the purview of judicial oversight,” he stressed.“This expansive power of review is a cornerstone of India’s constitutional democracy and a part of our basic structure, affirming that legality and constitutionality are fundamental preconditions to the exercise of public power,” Justice Kant said.In what reflects the judiciary’s transformative potential to give voice to the voiceless, Justice Kant said, judicial interpretation has resulted in expanding the scope of fundamental rights, leading to legislative action.CJI Gavai said that apart from the broad and purposive interpretation of Article 21 (right to life), SC has consistently held the state accountable for safeguarding and promoting the rights of citizens, compelling govts to translate constitutional guarantees into tangible actions.Public interest litigation (PIL) has evolved as an instrument for protecting human rights and the rights of marginalised and vulnerable communities like bonded labour, undertrial prisoners, migrant workers, manual scavengers, sex workers and pavement dwellers. SC has also brought in electoral reforms by acting on PILs, the CJI said.Justice Kant disagreed with criticism that judicial activism often results in encroachment of the turfs of legislature and executive, and said, “When courts act to empower the powerless, grounded in constitutional text and moral clarity, they do not usurp democracy, they deepen it.”Both the CJI and Justice Kant referred to SC’s landmark 13-judge judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973 that established the doctrine of ‘basic structure of the Constitution’. “That judgment transformed the judiciary from a mere interpreter of the Constitution into its guardian,” Justice Kant said.","Cji b r gavai and justice surya kant, the next cji, stoutly defended the much-criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges.

"PM Modi to attend Asean summit virtually, Congress takes a swipe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-attend-asean-summit-virtually-congress-takes-a-swipe/articleshow/124772222.cms,"PM Modi Confirmed to Give ASEAN Summit a Miss, Avoids Trump Again: Here’s The Real Reason Why

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi spoke to his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim and conveyed that he will virtually attend India-Asean summit Sunday, scotching speculation of a meeting with US President Donald Trump on the margins of Asean and East Asia summits in Kuala Lumpur.The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections but it also spares him the discomfiture of running into the mercurial president in the middle of a US-India trade deadlock and growing differences over Pakistan-related issues.According to Ibrahim, Modi told him he would attend virtually “given Deepavali festival was still being celebrated in India at that time”. “I respect the decision and extend my Deepavali greetings to him and all the people of India,” said Ibrahim on X. In his own post on the same platform, Modi congratulated Ibrahim on Malaysia’s Asean chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits.“Look forward to deepening of Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Modi. MEA later said in a statement that foreign minister S Jaishankar will represent Modi at East Asia Summit on Oct 27.In their conversation late on Wednesday, Ibrahim said India remains an important partner of Malaysia in trade and investment, technology, education and regional security sectors.Meanwhile, Congress on Thursday said the PM decided against visiting Malaysia to avoid “being cornered by Trump” and asked if this was the reason Modi did not travel to Egypt for Gaza peace summit helmed by Trump a few days back.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said Modi posting messages in praise of Trump on social media is one thing but to be seen hobnobbing in person with a man who has “claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and has claimed five times that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia” is another matter which “is far too risky for him”.",The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by modi might be preoccupation with bihar assembly elections.

GBMES will provide round-the-clock electronic intelligence of enemy emitters. HMVs, in turn, will significantly improve logistical support in diverse geographical terrains,” the official said.Apart from LPDs, the Navy will also get 30mm surface guns at a cost of Rs 1,200 crore for low-intensity maritime operations and anti-piracy roles; advanced light-weight torpedoes for anti-submarine warfare; electro-optical infra-red search and track systems; and smart ammunition for 76mm super rapid gun mounts on warships.","The biggest project to get the “acceptance of necessity’ (aon) was for the construction of four large amphibious warfare ships or “landing platform docks (lpds) another mega project to be cleared was the acquisition of a large number of surface-to-air missiles for the s-400 triumf air defence systems for over rs 10,000 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124770554,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-717429,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Gisele Bündchen’s shocking confession on The Tonight Show

Reflecting on the struggles behind the supermodel image





Supermodel Gisele Bündchen has spent decades dazzling the fashion world, but behind the glamour lies a lesser-known story of survival. During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in March 2024, the 43-year-old model opened up about a harrowing moment from her early career that nearly cost her life, an icy photoshoot gone wrong in Iceland more than two decades ago.While playing the segment “True Confessions,” Bündchen stunned both Jimmy Fallon and fellow guest Wayne Brady with a revelation that sounded almost too wild to be true. “I did a photo shoot on a fake iceberg in Iceland and I almost fell off into the ocean,” she admitted, referring to a late-’90s campaign for Lanvin’s Oxygene fragrance.The model went on to explain that the set was surrounded by real icebergs and freezing waters. “I would’ve been dead in seconds because you know what happens inside of the freezing water of the icebergs? [In] seconds you’re dead — dead!” she said. Despite the life-threatening conditions, Bündchen had to maintain her composure, posing elegantly in a slip dress while the crew, safely aboard a boat, wore heavy jackets and life vests. Fallon, initially skeptical, asked, “Wait, you almost died?” to which the supermodel confirmed, yes, the story was entirely true.That terrifying shoot was just one chapter in Bündchen’s extraordinary yet demanding career. Around the same time, she was dealing with anxiety, depression, and panic attacks brought on by the relentless pressures of the modeling industry. During a 2024 appearance on The View, she opened up about the “long journey” to recovery, crediting a naturopath’s advice for changing her life.“I wanted to feel better, I didn’t know what to do, so I found this amazing naturopath and he said to me, ‘Gisele, we have to change your diet,’” she shared. Through meditation, yoga, and breath work, she eventually found balance, transforming not only her body but her mindset.Today, as she promotes her wellness cookbook Nourish, Gisele Bündchen stands as proof that even the most glamorous icons have faced icy waters, both literally and metaphorically and found the strength to rise above them.Also Read: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen leaves fans speechless after revealing her secret to conquering anxiety naturally",Supermodel gisele bundchen shared a harrowing experience from her early career.
