Heat-related deaths up 23% globally since 1990s: Lancet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heat-related-deaths-up-23-globally-since-1990s-lancet/articleshow/124886275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Failure to curb the warming effects of climate change has seen the rate of heat-related deaths surge 23% since the 1990s, reaching an estimated 5,46,000 yearly deaths globally on average between 2012-21, according to Lancet Countdown Report on Health and Climate Change.Air pollution from wildfire smoke (PM 2.5) was linked to a record 1,54,000 deaths in 2024 alone, said the report. Underlining how the continued over-reliance on fossil fuels and failure to adapt to climate change is being paid for in people's lives, health and livelihoods, the report said the air pollution resulting from the continued burning of fossil fuels has resulted in a staggering 2.5 million deaths globally every year.It also said the global average transmission potential of dengue has risen by up to 49% since the 1950s, and linked even such a rise in India during 2015-24, compared to 1951-1960, to climate change.On India, the report, released Wednesday, said there were over 17,18,000 deaths attributable to anthropogenic air pollution (PM2.5) in 2022, an increase of 38% since 2010, whereas fossil fuels (coal and liquid gas) contributed to 7,52,000 (44%) of the deaths while coal alone accounted for 3,94,000 deaths, primarily from its use in power plants (2,98,000 deaths).It added the use of petrol for road transportation contributed to 2,69,000 deaths in India in 2022. ""In 2020-2024, wildfire smoke (PM2.5) was accountable for an annual average of 10,200 deaths in India, up by 28% from 2003-2012,"" it said.""In 2022, household air pollution due to the use of polluting fuels in India was associated with 113 deaths per 1,00,000. Mortality rates associated with household air pollution were higher in rural than urban areas...""India has, however, contested such findings, saying there is no conclusive data available to establish a direct correlation of death exclusively with air pollution. ""Air pollution is one of the many factors affecting respiratory ailments and associated diseases. Health is impacted by a number of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc. , of individuals apart from the environment,"" environment ministry has told Parliament a number of times on the question of linking deaths exclusively with air pollution.Authored by 128 experts, the report noted the continued dependence on fossil fuels also puts an unbearable strain on countries' budgets, with govts collectively spending $956 billion on net fossil fuel subsidies in 2023. ""In 2024, people in India were exposed to 19.8 heatwave days each, on average. Of these, 6.6 days of exposure would not have been expected to occur without climate change,"" said the report, while noting how it impacted labour hours and posed a moderate or higher risk of heat stress during moderate outdoor activity.It said heat exposure resulted in a loss of 247 billion potential labour hours in 2024, a record high of 419 hour per person, and 124% more than in 1990-1999, in India.","The rate of heat-related deaths has risen 23% since the 1990s, report says.

"Indian detentions on US border drop 62%, lowest in four years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-detentions-on-us-border-drop-62-lowest-in-four-years/articleshow/124885910.cms,"34,000 Caught Between Oct ’24 And Sept ’25

AHMEDABAD: US Customs and Border Protection intercepted 34,146 Indian nationals attempting illegal entry between Oct last year and this Sept, marking a 62% drop from 90,415 detentions during the previous fiscal. This constitutes the sharpest drop over the past four years in the number of Indians caught trying to enter the US illegally.Data released by the agency on Oct 28 shows Indian nationals now account for a significantly smaller share of total border detentions, compared to earlier years. In Sept, the final month of the US fiscal, authorities intercepted 1,147 Indians. In FY22, Indians accounted for 63,927 interceptions. The latest data is 47% lower.According to the report, total ""encounters"" on the US borders stood at 2.9 million in FY 2024, lower than the 3.2 million recorded in 2023, but marginally higher than the 2.7 million in 2022.Single adults made up the largest share of Indian nationals intercepted during FY25, totalling 31,480. Beside 2,552 family units, authorities detained 91 unaccompanied children and 23 minors travelling with adults.Immigration agents in north and central Gujarat, notorious for facilitating what are euphemistically called ""dunki routes"", seem to have slowed operations as families increasingly reconsider risks after the deaths of a family from Dingucha along the US-Canada border in 2022 and another near the Rio Grande in 2023.Officials identified the presence of minors at borders as an ""ongoing humanitarian concern"". The 91 unaccompanied children intercepted in FY25 reflect continued attempts by families relying on smuggling networks to send children in the hope of lenient treatment from US authorities.Migration researchers said the trend highlights both geopolitical enforcement changes and shifting aspirations. ""The American route is still viewed as a life-changing gamble. The decline in numbers does not mean the desire has ended - only that the risks have become clearer and costlier,"" a senior immigration official said.Employment stagnation in India, higher education aspirations and dollar-remittance dreams continue to draw aspirants, albeit with increased caution. The decline in detentions also reflects stricter border enforcement by US authorities, growing awareness about risks in migration-prone states like Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana, and changing smuggling patterns, officials said.","34,000 caught between oct ’24 and sept ’25 trying to enter us illegally.

Hurricane Melissa: ‘Unstoppable force’ batters Jamaica; Cuba on edge as storm nears – 10 key points,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hurricane-melissa-unstoppable-force-batters-jamaica-cuba-on-edge-as-storm-nears-10-key-points/articleshow/124887738.cms,"10 key points about Hurricane Melissa



Record-breaking storm slams Jamaica



Cuba braces for impact: ‘May God have mercy on us’



Tens of thousands displaced across Jamaica



‘A beast of a storm’: Meteorologists stunned by intensity



Cuban evacuations on a massive scale



Storm surge and flash flood warnings for Cuba



Families in the UK anxiously await news



Power outages and hospital evacuations in Jamaica



Seven deaths across the Caribbean so far



Scientists link intensification to climate change







Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, has left a trail of destruction across Jamaica and is now heading north-northeast toward Cuba. The storm, which made landfall in Jamaica as a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane, brought winds of up to 185 mph (295 kph), massive flooding and landslides, and caused extensive damage to infrastructure. Officials are warning that the recovery process will be slow, with thousands displaced and major hospitals damaged.Prime Minister Andrew Holness said the scale of devastation was unlike anything Jamaica had ever experienced. “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,” he said. “The question now is the speed of recovery. That’s the challenge.”As Melissa approaches Cuba, authorities have evacuated over 735,000 residents, bracing for destructive winds, torrential rain, and storm surges as high as 12 feet. Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez has urged people to “be alert, show solidarity, and not forget discipline in the face of this threat.”Hurricane Melissa came ashore near New Hope, Jamaica, as a powerful Category 5 storm — tying records for the strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall. With 185 mph winds and a central pressure of 892 millibars, Melissa equalled the intensity of the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and 2019’s Hurricane Dorian.The storm ripped roofs off homes, uprooted trees, and sent boulders crashing down roads. Prime Minister Holness described the impact as “devastating,” noting widespread damage to hospitals, homes, and businesses. Officials have confirmed at least three deaths in Jamaica, with many areas still unreachable due to blocked roads and flooding.In Santiago de Cuba and Holguín, residents are preparing for the storm’s arrival. “May God have mercy on us, because it’s coming with a lot of strength,” said Diamon Mendoza, a local resident. Elderly citizens, families with children, and farmers have sought refuge in community shelters or the homes of neighbours. State television showed people securing livestock and crops ahead of the hurricane’s landfall, expected early Wednesday.More than 800 shelters were opened before Melissa’s arrival, housing about 15,000 people. Many families remained stranded as floodwaters rose in western Jamaica, particularly in the parishes of St Elizabeth and Westmoreland. “Roofs were flying off,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “We are hoping and praying that the situation will ease so that some attempt can be made to get to those persons. ” Roughly 540,000 customers, or 77% of the island, were left without power.Experts described Melissa’s behaviour as “extraordinary.” The storm underwent *extreme rapid intensification*, strengthening by about 70 mph in 24 hours — far exceeding typical expectations. “It’s been a remarkable, just a beast of a storm,” said hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University. Despite passing near Jamaica’s mountains, Melissa retained its power, fuelled by abnormally warm ocean waters — 2°C hotter than average. Climate scientists said such superheated waters, driven by global warming, made the storm 500 to 700 times more likely to reach such strength.As Melissa bears down on eastern Cuba, more than 735,000 people have been evacuated, according to President Díaz-Canel. The government has focused on moving residents from coastal and mountainous regions, where flash floods and landslides pose major threats. In Holguín province alone, over 200,000 residents were relocated. “It will be a very difficult night for all of Cuba, but we will recover,” the president said, urging citizens to remain disciplined and resilient.Meteorologists warn that Cuba’s southeastern coast could experience storm surges between 8 and 12 feet above normal tides, accompanied by large, destructive waves. Rainfall of 10 to 20 inches, with localised totals up to 25 inches in mountainous regions, could trigger catastrophic flash flooding. CNN meteorologist Briana Waxman cautioned that Melissa’s clearer eye suggests it is reorganising — potentially regaining Category 4 strength just before landfall.Members of the Jamaican diaspora are desperately seeking updates from loved ones back home. Ambrosine Townsend, who lives in Kent, said she had been unable to contact her sister in Long Bay since Sunday afternoon. “Even though I trust her, I tried to persuade her to leave,” she said. “Because I know that things can change.” Many families in the UK and US have faced days of silence as communications remain down across much of Jamaica.Several hospitals were severely damaged during the storm, forcing emergency evacuations. One major facility lost power entirely, and 75 patients had to be moved to safer locations. Emergency services struggled to operate amid the chaos, with communications cut and floodwaters blocking key routes. “We have boats, helicopters, you name it,” said McKenzie. “The government is ready for rescues as soon as it’s safe. ”At least seven people have died across the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing. While Jamaica braces for a full damage assessment, officials fear the toll could rise as rescue teams reach isolated areas. UN agencies and NGOs have pre-positioned food, medicine, and relief supplies to support recovery efforts once conditions allow.Meteorologists say Melissa’s power underscores a troubling trend. Thirteen Category 5 storms have formed in the Atlantic since 2016 — more than any other 10-year period in recorded history. “We’re seeing a direct connection between warmer waters and rapid intensification,” said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist for Climate Central. “When these storms go over extremely warm water, it is more fuel for them to explode. ”(With inputs from agencies)","Hurricane melissa is one of the strongest atlantic hurricanes on record.

8th Pay Commission : Top things to know about Cabinet decision





In a big cheer for central government employees, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission.The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel.In January 2025, the Government announced the formation of the 8th Central Pay Commission to review and propose revisions to the salaries and benefits of Central Government employees.According to the Cabinet release, the 8th Central Pay Commission Commission will function as a temporary entity, consisting of a Chairperson, one Part-Time Member, and one Member-Secretary. Its recommendations are due within 18 months of its establishment, with the possibility of submitting interim reports when specific recommendations are finalised.The 8th Pay Commission, led by former Supreme Court justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, will deliver a preliminary report to the government.Professor Pulak Ghosh from IIM Bangalore has been appointed as a part-time commissioner, whilst Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain will serve as the Member Secretary.When questioned about the implementation timing of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations, I&B Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""The specific date will be decided once the interim report comes in... But, mostly it should be January 1, 2026.""The 8th Central Pay Commission's deliberations will consider:i. The economic conditions in the country and the need for fiscal prudence;ii. The need to ensure that adequate resources are available for developmental expenditure and welfare measures;iii. The unfunded cost of non-contributory pension schemes;iv. The likely impact of the recommendations on the finances of the State Governments which usually adopt the recommendations with some modifications; andv. The prevailing emolument structure, benefits and working conditions available to employees of Central Public Sector Undertakings and private sector.Terms of Reference (TOR) serves as a framework document for a pay commission, establishing guidelines and parameters for preparing its report. It includes essential definitions, terms and conditions that guide the commission's work.The Terms of Reference is drafted by a Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM), with final approval from the Cabinet Committee under the Finance Ministry. The JCM includes union representatives from various ministries. From its 60 members, 12 are chosen for the standing committee. These selected members engage in discussions about TOR subjects with secretary-level government officials. The finalised TOR is then submitted for Cabinet approval.The significance of TOR lies in its function as a main reference document when a pay commission develops its recommendations.According to a TOI report, The government has kept the terms of reference undisclosed, yet the committee's primary responsibility involves examining the financial implications of non-contributory pension programmes.The central government's decision to transition from the National Pension System to Unified Pension Scheme for pre-2004 recruits lacks clarity on pension payment obligations.This absence of estimated liabilities has resulted in no budgetary allocations. Additionally, any increase in employee remuneration and benefits will inevitably lead to enhanced pension commitments.Central Pay Commissions are established periodically to assess and recommend changes to emoluments, retirement benefits and service conditions for Central Government employees.These recommendations are typically implemented on a ten-year cycle. Following this pattern, the 8th Central Pay Commission's recommendations would take effect from January 1, 2026.The 7th Pay Commission was established in February 2014, with its proposals taking effect from January 1, 2016.Central government staff receive dearness allowance (DA) to offset inflation's impact on their actual salary value. This DA rate undergoes regular revision every six months, with adjustments linked to inflation levels.","8th central pay commission's proposals will impact the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and 69 lakh retired personnel. The 8th pay commission, led by former supreme court justice ranjana prakash desai, will deliver a preliminary report to the government.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124870076,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-45664,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

U.S. Navy F/A-18 And Seahawk Crash In South China Sea As Trump Calls For 'FREE' Indo-Pacific





A US Navy helicopter and a fighter jet crashed separately during routine operations over the South China Sea on Sunday, with no fatalities reported. The incidents coincided with US President Donald Trump’s visit to the region for the Asean Summit in Kuala Lumpur.According to the US Navy’s Pacific Fleet, the first crash involved an MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter that “went down in the waters of South China Sea while conducting routine operations from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz.” All three crew members aboard were rescued by search and rescue teams, the statement said.Roughly 30 minutes later, a Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet also crashed into the South China Sea “while conducting routine operations” from the same carrier. Both crew members successfully ejected and were safely recovered, the US navy confirmed.The US navy said on social media Sunday evening that the MH-60R Seahawk, assigned to the “Battle Cats” of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (HSM) 73, went down around 2:45pm local time. “Search-and-rescue crews rescued three crew members,” the statement said.At 3:15pm, an F/A-18F Super Hornet assigned to the “Fighting Redcocks” of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 22 also went down while conducting routine operations from the USS Nimitz.“All personnel involved are safe and in stable condition,” the US navy said. “The cause of both incidents is currently under investigation.”The crashes took place as US President Trump embarked on a diplomatic tour across Asia, where he is scheduled to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping for discussions centered on trade. Relations between Washington and Beijing have been tense in recent weeks after both sides imposed new economic measures on each other.These incidents follow the loss of two Super Hornet jets in the Red Sea earlier this spring. Each F/A-18 fighter jet costs over $60 million, according to the Navy. CNN reported that the USS Nimitz -- among the world’s largest warships -- is the oldest US aircraft carrier in service and is set for retirement next year.Earlier this year, two US warplanes also fell off the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier while operating in the Middle East.",Mh-60r sea hawk helicopter and f/a-18f super hornet fighter jet crash in south china sea.

Cardi B takes aim at Donald Trump and calls out voter regret





Cardi B has never been one to sugarcoat her opinions, and her latest viral moment proves she still has her finger firmly on the pulse of everyday financial struggles. The chart-topping rapper took to Instagram Live and delivered a fiery breakdown of what she sees as the clearest sign that the economy is spiraling: even luxury-loving sex workers are cutting their rates to survive.In true Cardi B fashion, her commentary was bold, blunt and packed with humor. But beneath her delivery was a message about how rising costs and shrinking wages are affecting people across the country.“You know how you know that the economy is bad? Because not even the prostitutes is getting fly. Where have you seen a hoe with a good Chanel bag?” she said, incredulous in her Instagram live. She continued roasting the situation with her signature flair, adding, “B*tches was buying Chanel bags like they was f**king female rappers… The h*es was selling p***y for $10,000. Now the bitches is going for $2,500. ‘Cause the f**king economy is bad. ”Her point: when a high-demand industry known for extravagant spending pulls back, everyone should be paying attention.Economists typically rely on charts and job reports to tell the story of financial downturns. Cardi B?

Trump’s Top Lawyer Sparks Outrage After Confusing Two of America’s Most Sacred Documents





A Trump acolyte of Sikh faith is getting roasted by her MAGA bros after standing up for immigrant truckers who are the receiving end of nativist fury in America.Harmeet Dhillon, a California Attorney who heads the civil rights division in the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, is finding out that being part of the MAGAsphere does not provide any cover against racist rage-baits – an experience other Indian-American Trump loyalists like Kash Patel Vivek Ramaswamy , and Dinesh D’Souza, are also facing. A recent Diwali message from Patel, a die-hard Trump loyalist, drew floods of vitriol, including calls to ""go back to India,"" ""go back home and worship your sand demons. ""Following reports of immigrant Sikh drivers facing racial profiling after two members of the community were involved in fatal accident, Dhillon attacked her Democrat-run home state of California for its “absurd coddling of illegal aliens,” by issuing commercial drivers license without adequate checks, but urged Americans not to discriminate against all immigrant drivers.“Those responsible for these tragedies must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law…Unfortunately, in the fog of outrage, some are using these tragedies as an opportunity to attack law-abiding Sikhs and Indian-origin drivers, simply because of who they are,” she wrote in a post on X.“It is illegal under federal law to discriminate against individuals or attack or violently threaten them because of their race, color, religion, or national origin. The @CivilRights will aggressively prosecute or pursue justice against those engaged in such discrimination,” she warned.Blowback from MAGA nativists was swift, with scores of scorching smackdowns. “Indian appointee protecting Indian immigrants stealing jobs from Americans.Who could have seen that coming?” wrote one troll. “ Another chimed in, “I, for one, am shocked that an indian is threatening to wield her power against Americans on behalf of her co-ethnics. You are Indian, and you ran cover for your India bros.”A long-time Republican, Dhillon has been long known for work on discrimination against Sikhs and other South Asians, including her past association with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an organization anathema to the MAGA diehards.Although she has since gravitated to the Trump orbit, she, like some of her fellow Indian-Americans are feeling the nativist MAGA burn that does not spare people of color. At the same time, they are also facing ridicule from the so-called “Radical Left” which is taunting them for “not being white enough.”The twin fatal trucking accidents involving Sikh drivers though has brought out the beast from the MAGA belly. Even though the American Trucking Association (ATA) estimates a current driver shortage of 60,000 that could go up to 160,000 by 2030 if unaddressed, MAGA activists are arguing that the U.S has sufficient number of native-born truckers, and immigrant drivers are simply undercutting the wages of native drivers – the same argument made on the H1B front, where Corporate America is saying the U.S does not have enough skilled tech workers and MAGA nativists are saying that is a false claim by tech companies seeking to cut costs with immigrant guest workers.According to the ATA, the shortage of truckers is driven by fewer native-born Americans taking to long-haul driving because of ""lifestyle challenges"" ( long hours, time away from family, tough conditions etc). The median age of American truckers is 46, and without immigrants drivers, replacement levels will not keep pace with retirements. The Association has warned, among other things, of potential supply chain disruptions, higher shipping costs passed to consumers, and overworked drivers risking safety.But for now MAGA has driven those concerns off the road, ratcheting up a campaign against immigrant drivers on the basis of two accidents involving Sikh drivers -- from the 5000 fatal accidents annually in America.","Harmeet dhillon, a california attorney who heads the civil rights division in the trump administration’s department of justice, is finding out that being part of the magasphere does not provide any cover against racist rage-baits.

Bill Gates calls for shift in climate aid





Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates recently said that if given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, he will choose the latter option. In a memo released today, October 28, Gates said that the world’s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, specifically in the world’s poorest countries. “I’ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don’t understand the suffering that exists today,” he told reporters.Gates emphasized that climate change is a serious problem. However, it alone won’t be the end of civilization adding that scientific innovation may likely curb it. Gates stated that it’s instead time for a “strategic pivot” in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.The memo comes a month before the United Nations climate change conference in Brazil. During a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release of the 17-page memo, Gates said “If you think climate is not important, you won’t agree with the memo.If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo. It’s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who’s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries. ”Bill Gates believes the world’s progress in clean energy has outpaced expectations, thanks to faster innovation and the rise of artificial intelligence. He said affordable solar and wind energy are now replacing coal, oil, and gas plants, helping prevent worst-case climate scenarios.However, Gates warned that funding to help poorer nations cope with climate change is shrinking, as wealthy countries — led by the United States — reduce their foreign aid budgets. “Gavi, a public-private partnership started by my foundation that buys vaccines, will have 25% less money for the next five years compared to the past five years,” Gates said. “Gavi can save a life for a little more than $1,000.”He stressed that vaccines are even more vital in a warming world because “children who aren’t dying of measles or whooping cough will be more likely to survive when a heat wave hits or a drought threatens the local food supply.”Gates pointed to research by the University of Chicago Climate Impact Lab showing that projected deaths from climate change fall by more than 50% when accounting for future economic growth. “Health and prosperity are the best defense against climate change,” he said.Under these conditions, Gates argued that development aid should be spent where it can have the biggest impact. “If you have something that gets rid of 10,000 tons of emissions, that you’re spending several million dollars on,” he said, “that just doesn’t make the cut.”","Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist bill gates recently said that if given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, he will choose the latter option.

Is Israel-Gaza heading towards another war?







US President Donald Trump on Wednesday on Air Force One said ""nothing"" would jeopardise the ceasefire in Gaza, but added Israel ""should hit back"" if its soldiers were killed.Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israel carried out three strikes on Tuesday despite the ongoing ceasefire, killing 30 people, after the Israeli military accused Hamas of attacking its troops and violating the US-brokered truce, Reuters reported.""As I understand it, they took out an Israeli soldier,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""So the Israelis hit back and they should hit back. When that happens, they should hit back,"" he added.""Nothing is going to jeopardize"" the ceasefire, Trump said. ""You have to understand Hamas is a very small part of peace in the Middle East, and they have to behave.""""If they (Hamas) are good, they are going to be happy and if they are not good, they are going to be terminated, their lives will be terminated,"" Trump said.""Nobody knows what happened to the Israeli soldier but they say it was sniper fire. And it was retribution for that, and I think they have a right to do that.""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered ""powerful strikes"" on Gaza, his office said, as Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Hamas of attacking Israeli troops in Gaza.""Hamas's attack today on IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers in Gaza is a crossing of a bright red line, to which the IDF will respond with great force,"" Katz said in a statement.Renewed violence between Israel and Hamas has strained the fragile ceasefire in the Gaza Strip amid deepening mistrust over the return of hostage remains, a key element of the truce agreement.Israel accused Hamas of reneging by not returning them, but the Palestinian Islamist group said it would take time to locate the remains amid Gaza’s war-ravaged ruins, according to AFP.Hamas later said it would delay Tuesday’s handover, adding that Israeli “escalation will hinder the search, excavation, and recovery of the bodies”. In a further statement on Telegram, Hamas’s armed wing said it had found the bodies of two hostages on Tuesday. It did not say when it would hand them over.Hamas had come under mounting pressure after it returned on Monday partial remains of a previously recovered captive, which Israel said was a breach of the truce.Hamas had said the remains were the 16th of 28 hostage bodies it had agreed to return under the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on October 10. But Israeli forensic examination determined Hamas had in fact handed over partial remains of a hostage whose body had already been brought back to Israel around two years ago, according to Netanyahu’s office.Israeli govt spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian accused Hamas of staging the discovery of the remains. ""I can confirm to you today that Hamas dug a hole in the ground yesterday, placed the partial remains... inside of it, covered it back up with dirt, and handed it over to the Red Cross,"" she told journalists.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the govt to “act decisively against these violations” and accused Hamas of knowing the location of the missing hostages.Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem rejected claims the group knows where the remaining bodies are, arguing that Israel’s bombardment during the two-year war had left locations unrecognisable.""The movement is determined to hand over the bodies of the Israeli captives as soon as possible once they are located,"" he told AFP.Hamas has already returned all 20 living hostages as agreed in the ceasefire deal.After the violation of the ceasefire, it seems that the situation which was becoming normal for Israel and Gaza is now slowly turning back to the original term.Israel have already started to attack Gaza and as witnessed in history Hamas may also retaliate.However both Trump and Vice President JD Vance said that this will not affect the ceasefire. US Vice President JD Vance said the ceasefire was holding despite Tuesday's ""skirmishes"".""That doesn't mean that there aren't going to be little skirmishes,"" said the vice president, one of several top US officials to rush to Israel last week to shore up the fragile ceasefire brokered by President Donald Trump.""We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an IDF soldier. We expect the Israelis are going to respond -- but I think the president's peace is going to hold,"" he added.The ceasefire, brokered by President Donald Trump’s administration on 10 October, has so far failed to stop intermittent violence. According to Gaza’s health ministry, at least 68,531 people have been killed since the war began in October 2023, when Hamas’s attack on Israel left 1,221 dead and over 250 taken hostage.","Ceasefire tensions rise over hostage remains dispute.

Eyewitness recounts the terrifying fall at PPG Paints Arena



Growing safety concerns across Pittsburgh’s major sports venues



A chilling eyewitness account has emerged after a fan suffered a severe fall during the Pittsburgh Penguins game at PPG Paints Arena on Monday night. The individual, who plummeted from the upper level, remains in critical condition. Emergency services quickly transported the fan to a nearby hospital as horrified spectators watched in disbelief. The new report has now raised deeper concerns about fan safety at major Pittsburgh sports venues.According to a new report, the fan appeared to lose balance moments before the fall. “He was like, teetering a little bit, and then he fell forward. Somehow, he just kept sailing over the seats, and I think his head hit the Plexiglass, or safety glass, and shattered it,” said an anonymous eyewitness who spoke to a local news outlet. The witness’s description paints a vivid picture of the horrifying seconds that unfolded inside the packed arena.This tragic event took place while the Pittsburgh Penguins were hosting their Monday night game, casting a dark shadow over what was meant to be an exciting evening of hockey. While officials have yet to release the victim’s identity, fans and community members have expressed deep concern online, offering prayers for the individual’s recovery.The PPG Paints Arena incident isn’t isolated. Just two nights earlier, a man working at Acrisure Stadium fell nearly 50 feet while installing production equipment. He was stabilized at the scene and remains hospitalized in critical condition. Earlier this year, 20-year-old fan Kavan Murkwood also fell over the outfield wall at PNC Park while celebrating a Pittsburgh Pirates play. Despite sustaining multiple fractures, Murkwood made a strong recovery and even threw the ceremonial first pitch in September.With three serious falls in less than two months across PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium, and now PPG Paints Arena, questions about safety protocols are mounting. Pittsburgh’s sports community is calling for immediate reviews of fan and worker safety measures to prevent future tragedies.As investigations continue, one thing is clear — these incidents have rattled the city’s sports culture, reminding everyone that safety must come before spectacle.Also Read: Sidney Crosby ejected in shocking overtime call as Penguins lose to Flyers in controversial shootout finish","A pittsburgh penguins fan suffered a severe fall at ppg paints arena on monday night.

Trump’s trade deals: Japan charms with $490 bn deal but South Korea in doubt; what's the holdup?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-trade-deals-japan-charms-with-490-bn-deal-but-south-korea-in-doubt-whats-the-holdup/articleshow/124887262.cms,"Japan signs the deal—Why is Seoul cautious?

Ties gone cold?









After wrapping up a visit to Japan that delivered $490 billion in investment commitments, US President Donald Trump is heading into a more complicated negotiation in South Korea, where a trade agreement remains out of reach.Trump will be meeting South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Wednesday in Gyeongju, the historic host city of this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. The talks come as both governments acknowledge that discussions have slowed over a central demand from Trump, which is that South Korea invest $350 billion in the United States.Officials in Seoul have argued that the scale and method of investment Washington wants could harm their domestic economy and are urging a structure based on loans and loan guarantees, rather than an upfront cash commitment. They further added that a currency swap line would be necessary to manage capital movement into the US.Oh Hyunjoo, a deputy national security director, said progress has been slower than expected.“We haven’t yet been able to reach an agreement on matters such as the structure of investments, their formats and how the profits will be distributed,” she told AP Monday.The debate threatens to overshadow Trump’s time in South Korea, particularly in contrast to his stop in Japan, where the atmosphere appeared more harmonious.As part of an earlier trade agreement, Japan had pledged $550 billion in investment. During a dinner with Japanese business leaders in Tokyo, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that commitments had reached up to $490 billion.Trump also spent time with Japan’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, joining her aboard an aircraft carrier to address US troops and unveiling Japanese-backed energy and technology projects in America.However, the road ahead of the South Korea meeting is remarkably different. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, speaking aboard Air Force One, declined to present an imminent deal, saying only, “Just a lot of details to work out,” though he noted both sides were close.Until a trade deal is finalised, South Korea is subject to a 25% tariff on automobiles shipped to the United States, notably higher than the 15% tariff applied to Japanese and European vehicles. The higher tariff continues to disadvantage companies including Hyundai and Kia.Trump and Lee began their strategic relationship on a positive note when Lee entered office in June, with a warm White House meeting in August.However, the ties have since strained, particularly after the US immigration raid in September at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, where more than 300 South Koreans were detained and deported. The incident fuelled anger in Seoul and raised questions over future corporate investment in America.Lee warned that without visa improvements, companies may withdraw or reconsider plans.“If that’s not possible, then establishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies,” he said.“They will wonder whether they should even do it.”South Korea’s foreign ministry later said the US had agreed to allow South Korean workers to use short-term visas or a visa waiver programme to support industrial projects in America.Trump, when asked about the raid, distanced himself from the decision, “I was opposed to getting them out,” he said, adding that improved visa rules would make it easier for companies to bring in skilled workers.Trump’s visit, alongside trade discussions, also included sensitive diplomatic engagements. On Thursday, he is expected to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping, with both countries signalling readiness to ease tensions after recent trade disagreements.He added that he would extend his trip with South Korea as his final scheduled stop, if there was a chance for the two to talk. The leaders had last met during Trump’s first term, though their discussions produced no agreement on North Korea’s nuclear programme.","Us president donald trump will meet south korean president lee jae myung on wednesday in gyeongju.

Setback for Trump: US Judge extends ban on firing of federal staff amid shutdown; unions hail ‘big win’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/setback-for-trump-us-judge-extends-ban-on-firing-of-federal-staff-amid-shutdown-unions-hail-big-win/articleshow/124886562.cms,"Donald Trump (file - AP)





A federal judge has extended an order preventing the Trump administration from laying off thousands of federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown - a decision hailed by labor unions as a major victory for workers.US district judge Susan Illston in San Francisco on Tuesday converted her earlier temporary restraining order (TRO) into a preliminary injunction, barring the administration from issuing reduction-in-force (RIF) notices until the federal government reopens, according to CNBC.The order comes amid the second-longest government shutdown in US history, triggered by a funding lapse. The American federation of state, county and municipal employees (AFSCME) and the American federation of government employees (AFGE) had jointly filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration’s reported plans to terminate federal workers during the closure.“Today’s ruling is another victory for federal workers and our ongoing efforts to protect their jobs from an administration hellbent on illegally firing them,” AFSCME President Lee Saunders said in a statement. AFGE called the ruling a “big win for federal workers!”The Trump administration had reportedly issued about 4,000 RIF notices on October 10 and projected the number could exceed 10,000, CNBC reported, citing White House budget director Russell Vought.Vought, a key architect of the conservative policy blueprint Project 2025, had described the shutdown as an opportunity to downsize what President Donald Trump called “Democrat Agencies.”Judge Illston, while imposing the initial TRO on October 15, had criticized the mid-shutdown layoffs as “unprecedented in our country’s history.”Calling the injunction a crucial safeguard for public servants, Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which represents AFSCME, said: “Our team is honored to represent the civil servants who are fighting back against President Trump’s dangerous agenda, and to have won this crucial injunction that will help stop federal workers from continuing to be targeted and harassed by this administration during the shutdown. ”The unions have also expanded their lawsuit to cover several additional agencies and officials since the shutdown began.",A federal judge has extended an order preventing the trump administration from laying off thousands of federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown.
