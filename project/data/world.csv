Cyprus honours PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Cyprus, the first by an Indian PM in 23 years, is being viewed in Nicosia as a diplomatic signal to Turkey, which has occupied one-third of the island since 1974 and had backed Pakistan during Operation Sindoor last month.PM Modi's trip, the first abroad since the recent Pakistan crisis, is seen as particularly meaningful in this context.PM Modi is visiting Cyprus at the invitation of President Nicos Christodoulides and is being accompanied by a large delegation of around 100 officials.His stop in Cyprus is part of a three-nation tour that includes Canada for the G-7 Summit, and the first-ever visit to Croatia by an Indian Prime Minister.The Cyprus visit is significant for multiple strategic, diplomatic, economic, and geopolitical reasons, reflecting the growing importance of Cyprus in India's broader regional and global outlook.This visit marks the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Cyprus in more than two decades, signaling a renewed focus on strengthening bilateral ties and strategic partnership.Despite historical ties between the two countries, visits by Indian Prime Ministers have been rare.Only two such visits to Cyprus have taken place in the past 40 years, by Indira Gandhi in 1982 and Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2002.The visit is seen as a calculated move to counter the growing Turkey-Pakistan axis, especially since Turkey has deepened ties with Pakistan, including support during India's Operation Sindoor.Cyprus has a long-standing conflict with Turkey, stemming from the 1974 Turkish invasion and the ongoing division of the island. Turkey’s recognition only of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) contrasts with Cyprus’s EU membership and its Western alliances.By visiting Cyprus and potentially touring the UN-controlled buffer zone (Green Line), PM Modi is sending a clear message of solidarity with Cyprus against Turkish expansionism.This counters the growing Turkey-Pakistan axis and supports India's broader strategy to isolate Pakistan diplomatically. Cyprus's firm backing of India's positions on Kashmir, terrorism, and UNSC reforms further cements this alignment. The visit thus strengthens India’s Mediterranean strategy by aligning with a key regional player opposed to Turkey’s assertiveness.India has expressed concerns over Turkey's position and actions during the conflict, which led to a public backlash and boycott of Turkish goods in India.Cyprus, in contrast, has backed India on the issue of terrorism.After the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Cyprus condemned the act and said it would raise the issue of cross-border terrorism by Pakistan at the European Union level.Cyprus's location in the eastern Mediterranean, close to Turkey and Syria, and its status as an EU member despite being geographically in Asia, make it strategically important for India's Mediterranean outreach and connectivity with Europe.One of the biggest banks in Cyprus, Eurobank, has recently announced that it is opening a representative office in Mumbai to help make Cyprus a gateway for Indian businesses entering the European Union and promote the interconnection of capital and businesses between Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.The island’s advanced financial services sector, favorable tax regime, and established shipping industry make it an ideal hub for Indian companies seeking to access European markets.Cyprus forms part of the energy corridor that will connect India with Europe and strengthen East-West connectivity through the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC).PM Modi's visit aims to anchor Cyprus more firmly in this strategic economic corridor.With Cyprus set to hold the rotating presidency of the EU Council in 2026, PM Modi's visit helps pave the way for deeper India-EU collaboration on trade, security, and global governance issues, leveraging Cyprus's influence within the EU.Moreover, the visit aligns with India’s broader push for a free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU by the end of 2025. Cyprus, as an EU member, can play a pivotal role in advocating for India’s interests within the bloc.Cyprus is a significant source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in India, supported by the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between the two countries.During the visit, PM Modi addressed a business roundtable in Limassol, emphasising India’s commitment to deepening economic ties. He highlighted India’s economic trajectory, projecting that it will soon become the world’s third-largest economy, and invited Cypriot businesses to invest in sectors like innovation, energy, technology, and digital infrastructure.Cyprus is a key player in Eastern Mediterranean natural gas exploration, an area of regional tension due to Turkish drilling. India’s interest in diversifying its energy sources makes Cyprus strategically important for potential energy partnerships.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on Monday conferred with the Grand Cross of the Order of Makarios III of Cyprus, the country's highest civilian honour.""Humbled to receive the 'Grand Cross of the Order of Makarios III' of Cyprus. I dedicate it to the friendship between our nations,"" the prime minister said after receiving the award.Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides conferred the award on the prime minister.The Order of Makarios III is the senior order of knighthood awarded by the country named after the first President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios III.Dedicating the award to the 1.4 billion people of India, Modi said it was an award to the trusted India-Cyprus friendship.""I am confident that in the time to come, our active partnership will touch new heights. Together, we will not only strengthen the progress of our two nations but also contribute towards building a peaceful and secure world,"" the prime minister said.","Pm modi is visiting cyprus at the invitation of president nicos christodoulides. His stop in cyprus is part of a three-nation tour that includes canada for the g-7 summit. Visit is seen as a calculated move to counter the growing turkey-pakistan axis, especially since turkey has deepened ties with pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121873704,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1037197,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

‘BIG Attack’ On U.S. Consulate In Iraq; HUGE Explosion Caught On Camera Near Mission In Erbil

As tensions between Israel and Iran reach a boiling point, Indian students studying in Iran are growing increasingly desperate for help, urging the Indian government to evacuate them before the situation deteriorates further.A series of aerial attacks on Iranian cities near residential areas has made the situation tense and jarring for students who have enrolled in different medical universities across the country. Several Indian students, mostly from Jammu and Kashmir prefer Iranian medical programmes mostly for their affordability.“One blast happened just 5 kilometres from our hostel. Over 350 Indian students are enrolled here. We’re terrified”, said Imtisal Mohidin, a third-year MBBS student at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran. “We were jolted awake by explosions at around 2:30 am on Friday and rushed to the basement. Since then, we haven’t been able to sleep.”A first-year student at Kerman University of Medical Sciences describes the distressing situation in Iran.“We heard gunshots today. We’ve been told to stock up on drinking water,” said Faizan, who hails from Srinagar.“My parents call me 10 times a day. The internet is barely working. We came here to study, but now our only concern is survival.With flights suspended and Iranian airspace under restrictions, the students say returning home is their only hope for safety.Responding to the mounting concern, the Indian Embassy in Tehran has advised all nationals and persons of Indian origin to stay indoors and follow verified communication channels, including a dedicated Telegram group for updates.Imtisal, a 22-year-old MBBS student in his third year at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, noted that his university alone has more than 350 Indian students enrolled. “The embassy is in touch and has shared helpline numbers, but we’re really scared. We’re asking the Indian government to bring us back before anything worse happens,” he added.A statement from the Ministry of External Affairs confirmed that the embassy is closely monitoring developments and in contact with affected students. “The safety and well-being of Indian students is our priority. Some are being shifted to safer areas within Iran with the embassy’s help. Other options are also being looked into,” the statement said.",Fear grips indian students in iran as israel-iran conflict escalates.

What's on the agenda?



Why PM Modi's visit matters?



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Kananaskis, Canada, on Tuesday to attend the 51st G7 Summit. This is PM Modi's first visit to Canada in ten years. The discussions with world leaders at the summit will focus on major global topics like energy security, technology and innovation.PM Modi reached Canada from Cyprus. He is on a three-nation tour and was invited to the summit by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The G7 meeting, scheduled for June 16-17, is the sixth consecutive time PM Modi is participating in the summit.During his 23-hour stay, PM Modi will speak at the G7 Outreach Session on Tuesday. He will also hold several bilateral meetings, including with Canadian PM Carney, before leaving for Croatia on Tuesday evening.The ministry of external affairs had earlier said, ""At the Summit, the Prime Minister will exchange views with leaders of G-7 countries, other invited outreach countries and Heads of International Organisations on crucial global issues, including energy security, technology and innovation, particularly the AI-energy nexus and Quantum-related issues.""The summit comes a little over a month after India's Operation Sindoor , which targeted terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The operation followed the April 22 Pahalgam attacks.Canadian PM Carney’s invitation to PM Modi is being seen as an indication that Canada’s new government wants to improve relations with India. Ties between the two countries had worsened after the killing of pro-Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023.In October last year, India withdrew its high commissioner and five other diplomats after Canada linked them to the Nijjar case. India also expelled Canadian diplomats. India had said the Justin Trudeau government was letting pro-Khalistani groups operate from Canada.Carney became prime minister in March this year after Trudeau stepped down. He is an economist and entered politics recently.After Trudeau’s exit, India said it hoped to rebuild relations with Canada based on ""mutual trust and sensitivity.""In recent months, security officials from both countries resumed contact. There have also been talks about appointing new high commissioners.The ministry of external affairs said last week that India sees the upcoming meeting between PM Modi and Carney on the sidelines of the G7 Summit as a chance to exchange views and “explore pathways” to reset ties.During PM Modi’s previous visit to Canada in 2015, the two countries upgraded their relationship to a strategic partnership.Canada has a large Indian diaspora. About 4.5 per cent of Canada’s population is of Indian origin, including around 1.8 million people of Indian descent. The Sikh population is around 770,000. Additionally, nearly 1 million Non-Resident Indians (NRI) live in Canada as students, skilled professionals, or temporary workers.Indian students have been the largest group of international students in Canada. In 2022, they made up 41 per cent of the international student population. However, Canada’s recent immigration policies have affected both Indian students’ prospects and the finances of Canadian universities.",Pm modi reached canada from cyprus.

Why it matters

This is no longer a proxy conflict. Israel has directly struck inside Iran, and Iran has retaliated with direct missile fire on Israeli population centers. The scale, speed, and ferocity of the strikes mark a dangerous new phase with no clear off-ramp - and Iran’s regime is facing pressure on all fronts: militarily, economically, diplomatically and domestically.

It’s the worst direct confrontation between Iran and Israel in history. The war could spiral into a broader Middle East conflagration, upend global oil markets, and collapse already-stalled nuclear diplomacy.

Energy implications: Crude oil surged 13% on Friday - the biggest intraday gain since Russia invaded Ukraine. While oil briefly hit $78 per barrel, experts warn prices could soar past $100 if Iran disrupts the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-fifth of global oil flows.

The big picture

Iran now faces a triad of perilous choices

Escalate - risking full-scale war with Israel and possible US involvement. Contain the conflict - aiming for limited, sustained strikes while avoiding American red lines. Negotiate - possibly with US mediation - to halt the fighting and restore nuclear talks, though trust is virtually nonexistent.

Between the lines

Zoom in

Its economy is ravaged by years of sanctions.

Inflation hovers around 40%.

Blackouts and gas shortages are becoming the norm.

And the rial continues to plummet, stoking anger in a young, restless population.

Israel vs Iran

The ultimate test for Khamenei

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader and political survivor for over three decades, is now confronting what may be the defining crisis of his rule.

In a sign of how far Israel was willing to push, a US official told the Associated Press that President Donald Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei.

Since taking power in 1989 after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Khamenei has survived sanctions, internal unrest, and international isolation.

But the current conflict with Israel is different: it directly challenges not only the regional influence he has carefully built but also the internal balance of power in Tehran. The stakes are now existential.

At 86, Khamenei’s advanced age has already fueled speculation about succession, a process clouded by secrecy and rival factions within the regime. “Khamenei is at the twilight of his rule, at the age 86, and already much of the daily command of the regime is not up to him but to various factions who are vying for the future,” said Arash Azizi, senior fellow at Boston University. “This process was already underway and the current war only accelerates it,” he told AFP.

And with Israel not ruling out future attempts on his life, the supreme leader’s next moves will shape not just Iran’s response, but the future of the system he’s spent a lifetime defending.

What they’re saying

“Israel's fight is not against the Iranian people,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video. “Our fight is against the murderous Islamic regime that oppresses and impoverishes you.”

Trump said Sunday: “We will have PEACE, soon… But sometimes they have to fight it out.”

“This is for the sake of our children and grandchildren,” said Yoram Suki, whose apartment was destroyed in Petah Tikva.

Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi: “Once these Israeli] attacks come to a stop, we will naturally reciprocate.”

Iran has thousands of ballistic missiles so I think Iranian leaders will use most of those missiles and kill a few thousand of Americans before they engage in a surrender. Iran’s hope was a peaceful resolution. The Americans didn’t want to have it, they wanted war and I think that’s what they’re going to get. Fouad Izadi, an academic at Tehran University , told Bloomberg

What to watch

What’s next

Israel is pushing hard to rally Western support to destroy Iran’s nuclear capacity. But analysts say Israel would need US military assistance to breach Iran’s deepest, most protected sites.

The US role remains murky: President Donald Trump has both urged de-escalation and praised Israel’s offensive. He’s also confirmed vetoing an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei, calling it a red line.

Iran’s Gulf-Arab neighbors-countries it’s reconnected with over the past two years-are alarmed by Israel’s moves and want no part in the conflict, say senior regional officials. While Iran has the missile capability to hit oil facilities and infrastructure across the region, it’s not likely to risk damaging those newly rebuilt ties. It understands that these neighbors fear getting caught in the crossfire and are pressing Trump to cool things down.

The G7 summit in Canada is now dominated by discussions on how to prevent further escalation. “This issue will be very high on the agenda,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Reality check





Iran unleashed a wave of over 100 missiles on Israeli cities early Monday, killing five and injuring more than 100 - striking Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Petah Tikva. The attack followed Israel’s surprise air campaign that bombarded Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure, killing at least 224 people - many of them civilians - and decimating the upper ranks of the Revolutionary Guard.The tit-for-tat marks the fourth straight day of open warfare between the regional archrivals and shows no signs of de-escalation.Each carries enormous risks for Iran’s clerical leadership. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei must weigh strategic retaliation against the very real prospect of regime collapse or American firepower.The Israeli strikes have been more devastating and targeted than many in Tehran expected.Israel claims it has killed high-ranking commanders and destroyed key uranium enrichment facilities. The shock of the attacks has set off panic among Tehran residents, particularly in the north, where middle-class Iranians are fleeing to rural areas or Caspian towns.“We just don’t know where to go or what to do,’’ said Parisa, a gym owner in northern Tehran. “The highways are locked. People are saying something bad is going to happen in Tehran tonight.”As per a Bloomberg report, Iran’s domestic situation is fragile:Just days before the Israeli strikes, anti-government protests were already flaring over water shortages and job losses.Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said it employed a “new method” in Monday’s missile barrage that overwhelmed Israeli air defenses, including the Iron Dome, allowing strikes to penetrate deeper than before. The damage was visible: residential buildings collapsed, fires erupted, and even the US Embassy in Tel Aviv sustained minor damage.If Iran escalates further - for example, by activating Hezbollah in Lebanon or shutting the Strait of Hormuz - it could trigger US military involvement, upending Trump’s desire to stay out.A senior US official confirmed that Trump was aware of the Israeli strike plan in advance but refused to participate, preferring to maintain the ability to mediate a ceasefire.While Iran can likely sustain limited strikes on Israel for weeks, it is constrained. It cannot match Israel’s precision airpower or resupply at the pace that Israel can - especially with US backing.A prolonged war would deepen its economic pain, risk regime legitimacy, and possibly spur a new wave of protests.(With inputs from agencies)","Iran now faces a triad of perilous choices: escalate - risking full-scale war with israel and possible us involvement.

NEW DELHI: With Israel and Iran teetering on the brink of a full-blown war, PM Narendra Modi on Monday said resolving issues through dialogue and restoring stability was the cry of humanity. Speaking alongside Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides in Nicosia, Modi reiterated his message that this isn't the era of war.Modi's visit to Cyprus - the first by an Indian PM in 23 years - saw the two sides discussing efforts to scale up cooperation in defence, security and connectivity with focus on IMEEC, with the PM strongly backing sovereignty and territorial integrity of the eastern Mediterranean country that is not recognised by Turkiye, a Pakistan ally.""We both have expressed concern about the ongoing conflicts in West Asia and Europe. Their negative impact is not limited to that region alone. We both believe that this is not the era of war,"" Modi said after his talks with the Cypriot president.Modi thanked Cyprus for its continued support to India's fight against cross-border terrorism and announced a new mechanism for real-time information exchange to counter terrorism, drug and arms smuggling.The president reiterated Cyprus's strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack, backing India's sovereignty and territorial integrity.In a show of solidarity with Cyprus, Modi visited the Green Line - a UN-controlled buffer zone that separates Northern Cyprus, an area occupied by Turkish forces in 1974, from the Republic of Cyprus - along with Christodoulides. This is significant in the context of Turkiye's continued support to Pakistan that saw Ankara helping Islamabad militarily during the recent India-Pakistan conflict. Turkish President Recep Erdogan himself later said Turkiye would continue to stand by Pakistan, though ""good times and bad"".Modi also reiterated India's traditional support for Cyprus's unity and for a peaceful resolution of the Cyprus Question based on UN Security Council resolutions and international law. Several of these resolutions call for the withdrawal of Turkish forces from the island of Cyprus.""India reiterated its unwavering and consistent support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and unity of the Republic of Cyprus. In this regard, both sides emphasised the need to avoid unilateral actions as essential for creating a conducive environment for the resumption of meaningful negotiations,"" said a joint statement.Modi said the two sides would prepare a roadmap to give a strategic direction to the partnership for the next five years.On the issue of terrorism, both sides reiterated in a joint statement their zero-tolerance approach to terrorism, rejecting any justification for such acts, under any circumstances. ""They emphasised that those responsible for the attacks should be held accountable,"" said the statement, while condemning the Pahalgam attack.","Modi's visit to cyprus - the first by an indian pm in 23 years - saw the two sides discussing efforts to scale up cooperation in defence, security and connectivity.

A growing sense of fear and panic has taken hold across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Israel continues to vow further military strikes. Amid threats of new airstrikes, many Iranians are fleeing major cities in search of safety, with traffic jams clogging roads leading north toward the Caspian Sea.On Monday, the Israeli military issued a chilling warning, urging residents of Tehran to evacuate ""immediately.""""In the coming hours, the Israeli military will operate in the area, as it has in recent days throughout Tehran, to strike military infrastructure of the Iranian regime,"" the post read.A resident of Saadat Abad, an affluent neighbourhood in north Tehran that has reportedly been struck in recent days, described a night filled with explosions. ""Some were so powerful that the building shook,"" the resident told CNN anonymously, citing safety concerns. They described a chaotic scene as smoke poured into nearby buildings, and families rushed to the ground floors, struggling to calm frightened children.Iran's capital is ill-prepared for aerial conflict. Unlike Israeli cities equipped with modern bomb shelters, Tehran must rely on improvised options, basements, tunnels, and shelters dating back to the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.""There weren't any shelters built in Tehran,"" said Mehdi Chamran, chairman of Tehran's city council. ""People went into basements. The metro could be used in an extreme crisis, but we would need to shut the system down.""Despite the looming threat, much of daily life continues. Grocery store shelves remain stocked, and events go ahead as planned. But long lines for fuel have become common, with gas rationed and capped at 25 litres per customer. Some ATMs are limiting cash withdrawals, residents say, adding to the tension.Cities beyond the capital are also showing signs of distress. In Shiraz, in south-central Iran, residents are lining up for gasoline and stockpiling essentials like water and diapers. Images show cars loaded with families and supplies heading toward rural areas.Nighttime in Tehran, however, tells a different story. Streets fall eerily quiet, many shops remain shuttered, and those who haven't left are increasingly reluctant to go to work.The situation follows a series of Israeli strikes on Iranian military infrastructure, including nuclear facilities in Natanz and Isfahan, which have heightened international concerns.","Israel threatens more strikes on tehran.

US president Donald Trump on Monday urged people in Tehran to evacuate the city ""immediately,"" warning once again that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. Trump will also leave the summit on Monday night, as he wants to focus on developments between Israel and Iran.""Iran should have signed the 'deal' I told them to sign. What a shame, and a waste of human life,"" Trump wrote. ""Simply stated, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!""According to CNN, a government official at the G7 summit in the Canadian Rockies said that A White House official said president Donald Trump’s call for Iranians to “immediately evacuate Tehran” highlights the urgent need for Iran to enter diplomatic talks, as its ongoing conflict with Israel shows no sign of easing. He said that Trump was receiving regular updates from secretary of state Marco Rubio and other senior officials. Earlier on Monday, Vice president JD Vance, joint chiefs of staff chairman Dan Caine, and several top aides were seen assembling at the White House.Trump's comments came hours after an Israeli airstrike reportedly hit Iran's state broadcaster headquarters. Meanwhile, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog has confirmed major damage to Iran’s largest uranium enrichment facility.Iran has called on the United States to intervene and help bring an end to the aerial attacks, which have escalated over the past few days.Trump, however, has chosen not to join other G7 leaders in a joint appeal for de-escalation. The summit, hosted by Canada and focused on global economic issues, was largely overtaken by the fallout from Israel’s recent major military strike on Iran.Earlier in the day, Trump said a diplomatic deal with Iran to end the conflict could happen soon after he leaves the G7 summit. “I think Iran is basically at the negotiating table and wants to make a deal. As soon as I leave here, we’re going to be doing something,” he said at the summit.","Us president donald trump on monday urged people in tehran to evacuate the city ""immediately,"" warning once again that iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.

NEW DELHI: The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Monday condemned the bloody terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, declaring that it would be stepping up its scrutiny of how effectively countries are combating terror financing.“Terrorist attacks kill, maim and inspire fear around the world. The FATF notes with grave concern and condemns the brutal terrorist attack in Pahalgam on 22 April 2025. This, and other recent attacks, could not occur without money and the means to move funds between terrorist supporters,” the global watchdog said in a statement, according to news agency PTI.The FATF's remarks come as India continues to highlight Pakistan’s alleged role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism and diverting international financial aid towards arms procurement. Sources suggested to PTI that Pakistan's activities warrant a fresh push to bring the country back into FATF’s ""grey list"".On April 22, Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 civilians in Kashmir's Pahalgam. New Delhi has repeatedly highlighted how Pakistan has been offering safe haven to designated terrorists. The claim gained further traction when senior Pakistani military officials reportedly attended the funerals of terrorists killed in Indian military strikes on May 7.In preparation for the upcoming Asia Pacific Group (APG) meeting on August 25 and the FATF plenary and working group sessions on October 20, India is compiling a detailed dossier on Pakistan’s alleged violations and lapses under FATF’s anti-money laundering and terror financing guidelines. India has planned to formally press for Pakistan’s grey listing at these meetings.At present, 24 countries are under FATF’s “grey list,” which flags nations under increased monitoring due to strategic weaknesses in combating money laundering, terror financing, and proliferation financing.Grey-listed countries are required to quickly address these vulnerabilities under FATF’s close watch.Pakistan’s association with the grey list has been long and intermittent. First added to the list in February 2008, Pakistan was removed in June 2010, only to return in February 2012. It was dropped again in February 2015 but was re-listed in June 2018 and remained under scrutiny until October 2022, when FATF removed Pakistan but advised continued cooperation with the Asia Pacific Group to strengthen its anti-money laundering and counter-terror financing systems.The FATF, which serves as the international standard-setter for fighting money laundering and terror financing, stated in its statement that it is working alongside over 200 jurisdictions to bolster counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) frameworks worldwide, using financial intelligence as a key weapon to break terror funding chains.""In addition to setting out the framework for combating terrorist financing, the FATF has enhanced its focus on the effectiveness of measures countries have put in place. That is how, through our mutual evaluations, we have identified gaps that need to be addressed,"" the FATF said.For more than a decade, the watchdog has been working to help countries stay ahead of terrorist financing threats, including the exploitation of social media platforms, crowdfunding, and digital assets.""The FATF will soon release a comprehensive analysis of terrorist financing, compiling cases provided by our global network. It will also host a webinar to help public and private sectors understand the risks and stay alert to emerging threats,"" the statement added.At the recent ‘No Money for Terror Conference’ in Munich, FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo stressed the importance of global cooperation, saying: ""No single company, authority, or country can combat this challenge alone. We must be unified against the scourge of global terrorism. Because terrorists need to succeed only once to achieve their goal, while we have to succeed every time to prevent it.""","The financial action task force (fatf) condemned the bloody terror attack in pahalgam on april 22.

Basmati rice

Basmati rice prices, which saw an increase of 15-20% in the past two months due to higher exports, are expected to decrease in the upcoming weeks as exports to Iran may decline amidst its ongoing conflict with Israel.According to the Agricultural and Processed Foods Export Development Agency (APEDA), Iran ranks as the third-largest purchaser of Indian basmati rice, following Saudi Arabia and Iraq. During 2024-25, India's basmati rice exports to Iran were valued at ₹6,374 crores, representing 12.6% of India's total basmati exports for that period.Major importing nations from West Asia and Iran had enhanced their purchases after Indian Basmati rice prices had fallen to ₹75-90/kg, leading to an upward price movement.""The export prices have come down from $950-1000/tonne about a month ago to $900-950/tonne,"" said Rajesh Jain Paharia, an exporter of Basmati rice according to an ET report.""Prices have corrected, as freight is expected to go up due and transshipment issues,"" said Paharia.""Prices of Indian Basmati rice had reached their bottom by April as the global export demand was less due to multiple factors.

In a social media exchange in May 2024, a Twitter user responded to a post by Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticizing Boeing ’s management style. The user Gunther Eagleman @GuntherEagleman replied pointedly to the post saying:Musk responded to the user in a joking tone:the user further replied.But, the online conversation took a dark turn when another user followed up with:While Elon Musk did not publicly respond to this last comment, the thread has resurfaced after an Air India Dreamliner 787-8 aircraft crashed minutes after taking off from Ahmedabad airport on June 12. The deadly crash killed 241 of 242 people onboard the London-bound flight.In the original tweet, Elon Musk highlighted Boeing’s $4.2 billion investment in the Starliner spacecraft, contrasting it with SpaceX ’s (owned by Elon Musk) $2.6 billion for the Dragon 2, which completed four years earlier despite a near-complete redesign.He said: “Although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner. Note, the crew capsule design of Dragon 2 has almost nothing in common with Dragon 1. Too many non‑technical managers at Boeing.”The resurfaced conversation has gained further urgency after a recent report claimed that the Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was one of the same 787 Dreamliners that late Boeing whistleblower John Barnett had warned regulators about. Barnett, a former quality manager worked at Boeing for over 30 years. He had alleged serious flaws in the manufacturing of the 787 jets, citingat the company’s South Carolina plant. He claimed that Boeing prioritized speed over safety and even said he refused to fly on the Dreamliner. Barnett was found dead in March 2024 from an apparent suicide, shortly after testifying in a legal case against Boeing — a death that sparked widespread conspiracy theories. He is one of several whistleblowers whose warnings have resurfaced in light of recent safety incidents.The June 12 plane crash is being termed as one of the deadliest air disasters in decades. The total toll rose to 279 people killed, including 241 onboard the flight and 38 others on the ground. The lone survivor, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh said even he could not explain how he survived. ""Initially, I too thought that I was about to die, but then I opened my eyes and realised that I was still alive,"" Ramesh told national broadcaster DD News from his hospital bed.Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has directed all Boeing Dreamliner 787/9 fleet of Air India equipped with Genx engines to undergo additional maintenance and safety checks with immediate effect in coordination with the concerned regional DGCA offices.",Tesla ceo elon musk criticized boeing's management style in a may 2024 tweet.
