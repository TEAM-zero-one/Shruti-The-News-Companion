It was set up on Nov 3, 1961. Claims being made by the US President are typically nonsensical to say the least.

""... $21 million dollars for voter turnout in India? Why do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday went hammer and tongs at the Congress party after US President Donald Trump acknowledged India's 2024 Lok Sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"".Hours after Trump criticised the Biden dispensation's decision to disburse $21 million towards "" voter turnout efforts "" in India, the BJP IT department head Amit Malviya posted multiple clips of PM Modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.During the poll campaign in the summer elections last year, PM Modi was seen lashing out at the Congress over the ""external influence"".""Nowadays influential people around the world have united to remove Modi but there is the blessing of(women power)(maternal power)... it's yourprotective shield) that Modi keeps working despite facing challenges,"" PM Modi said while addressing a rally in Karnataka's Chikkaballapur in April ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.In another rally at Chhattisgarh's Sarguja, PM Modi said: ""Congresspeople and some influential people in the world lose their cool...if India grows in power, it would spoil the game of some influential people. Today, if India becomes self-reliant...some influential people would lose their jobs.""""Therefore, they want a weak government of Congress and the INDI alliance. The government with issues of infighting, which practices corruption. The history of Congress suggests that can destroy the nation for the greed of power,"" he added.In a television interview PM Modi said: ""The entire world trying to influence India's election, which they shouldn't do. They aren't giving their opinion or comment but influencing it. But they won't be able to influence it.""Further accusing Rahul Gandhi of ""urging foreign powers to intervene in India’s internal affairs"", BJP shared a clip from his visit to London in 2023 and said: ""He has aligned himself with global networks seeking to undermine India’s strategic and geopolitical interests, acting as a tool for foreign agencies.""Earlier, Trump once again questioned the United States' decision to allocate $21 million for voter turnout efforts in India. Speaking at the FII PRIORITY Summit in Miami, he said, ""$21 million for voter turnout, why do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected.""""We have got to tell the Indian Government. Because when we hear that Russia spent about two thousand dollars in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for two thousand dollars. This is a total breakthrough,"" he added.Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also attacked the Congress party for ""resorting to conspiracies"" and ""maligning India's democracy"".""When people don’t vote for them (Congress), they resort to conspiracies, using foreign money to influence India’s elections. They malign India’s democracy, and we strongly condemn this. This blatant attempt at foreign interference in India’s democratic process is a matter of great shame,"" Prasad said.BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan called Trump's statement a ""smoking gun"" which ""exposes"" the dangerous role of a foreign hand.""President Trump's statement is a smoking gun which shockingly exposes the dangerous role of a foreign hand interfering and influencing the outcome of the Indian elections, but the million dollar question, rather the 21 million dollar question, is which were the Indian hands who were at cahoots with the foreign hands, receiving foreign funds to undermine Indian's democracy and destabilise India's statement..."" said BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan.On Wednesday, Trump also questioned the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that New Delhi is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"".This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.","Us president donald trump acknowledged india's 2024 lok sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"" the bjp it department head amit malviya posted multiple clips of pm modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118416406,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-707576,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Indian Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi recently opened up about his multi-religious upbringing and illustrious military career.In an exclusive interview with ANI, he shared his thoughts on being multi-religious, citing his exposure to diverse faiths during his time in the 18th battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir rifles .This regiment uniquely had a mosque, gurdwara, Durga Mata temple, and Mahakal temple all under one roof, fostering an environment of interfaith harmony.When asked about his recent visit to Mahakaleshwar Temple in Madhya Pradesh's Ujjain with defence minister Rajnath Singh, the Army chief said, ""I am multi-religious. I have been commissioned into the 18th battalion, the Jammu and Kashmir rifles, where you have a Masjid, Gurdwara, Durga Mata, and Mahakal, all under one roof.""General Dwivedi recounted how his subedar major, a Maulvi, would perform Durga Mata Puja without any issues, demonstrating the regiment's spirit of mutual respect. When asked about his own spiritual journey, general Dwivedi said after taking over, he first sought blessings from his unit, Bhakti Dhaam, where he received blessings from his Maulvi, Pandit, and Granthi.""My subedar major, who may be a Maulvi, is able to do Durga Mata Puja, which is not an issue at all. Now, if you see, have I visited any Mashoor (famous) place, Golden Temple or Mahakaal or Vaishno Devi, in the initial stages? No. The first thing I went to was to my unit, Bhakti Dham. And once I got the blessings there from my Maulvi, my Pandit, my Granthi, thereafter I started going to all the places,"" said the Army chief.General Dwivedi recalled how his father would tell him stories of freedom fighters and World War II heroes, inspiring him to join the army.In a candid revelation, Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi shared the story of how his childhood experiences shaped his decision to join the Indian Army.One particular memory that stood out was when his uncle would bring home copies with photographs of soldiers. These images sparked a sense of curiosity and admiration in young Dwivedi. As he grew older, he began to explore various career options, considering medicine and engineering, just like his brothers.However, the allure of the Army ultimately won him over. General Dwivedi recalled how he initially wanted to become an intelligence officer, but after gaining more exposure, he decided to join the Army first and then explore opportunities in intelligence.""I remember my uncle when he used to ask him, So the copy which he used to bring used to have a soldier's photo. Okay. My father used to always give me the story of freedom fighters or the story of World War II, where we won Vera, who escaped as a pilot. I remember. So all these stories I used to keep reading. And my one brother was a doctor. So I said, no, this is closed. My second brother was an engineer. I said, this is closed. Okay. So third was the army, which was there. I wanted to become an intelligence officer if I can say that. But when I went to school and saw everything, then I said, okay, let me join the Army first, thereafter look at intelligence,"" the Army chief said.He also shared his experience of flying the LCA with air marshal AP Singh during Aero India 2025, praising Singh's leadership and straightforward qualities. He recalled that air marshal Singh was a standout individual even during their National Defence Academy (NDA) days, earning the respect and admiration of his peers.In a nostalgic reflection, Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi reminisced about his school days, when he and his peers would admire all three services - the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He shared that it was simply fate that led him to join the Army.""See, when we were in school, we used to look at all three services. We used to love all three, if I can say that. It just so happened that I came into the army. Let me tell you about AP first. As far as AP is concerned, from NDA days, he is a gold torch. And he is, everybody has a natural liking towards him. He is a man who can collect people together. He is a natural leader. And he takes ownership of a crowd. But he is a very straightforward man. So, I say in the lighter moment, he should have been in the infantry,"" said the Army chief.The Army chief highlighted Air Marshal Singh's ability to bring people together, his natural leadership skills, and his willingness to take ownership of responsibilities. General Dwivedi jokingly added that Air Marshal Singh's straightforward nature and team-bonding skills would have made him an excellent fit for the infantry.""He's so straightforward. And such a team-bonding man, he should have been infantry,"" he added.This lighthearted exchange reflects the camaraderie and mutual respect between General Dwivedi and Air Marshal Singh, underscoring the strong bonds formed during their early days at the NDA.The Army chief’s remarks provide insight into his personal life and military journey, emphasising the significance of respecting all religions and the principles of teamwork and leadership.As the 30th Chief of the Army Staff, he brings extensive experience, having held key positions such as Northern Army Commander and Director General of Infantry.","Indian army chief general upendra dwivedi recently opened up about his multi-religious upbringing and illustrious military career.

Juan Soto Swaps No. 22 —Because Nothing Says ""Thanks"" Like a Brand-New Ride!



In Major League Baseball, not only do the headlines rot by numbers, but occasionally, beautiful gestures of friendship off the field become the break. Such is the case when the newest megastar in town, Juan Soto of the Mets, not only received the iconic No. 22 jersey long worn by third baseman Brett Baty , but also followed up with a lavish thank-you gift.Boulevard drama starts here, Juan Soto has worn 22 for his whole life as far as the eye can see, a good seven years to be precise-probably he would have to feel a bit awkward wearing it for the Mets. The brawniest star around- if any- Baty was with those coveted numbers. So Soto being the good, responsible teammate worked out a deal for the newer, blacked-out Chevy Tahoe worth $60,000. That is right, according to NY Post, an $60K - $90k SUV with ""Thanks for #22"" written on the rear windshield.The Mets made sure to capture the feel-good moment when they shared a video on Instagram of Baty's utter surprise as the shocked star was shown the incredible surprise gift. After being so shocked, his jaw hanging at the sight of the beautifully wrapped vehicle with a giant red bow across the hood, he muttered, ""This is sick, bro"" to no one in particular. Soto, the ever-sweet soul, said, ""I wanted to give you something nice,"" and reconfirmed that baseball is more than just numbers.In the video, Soto spoke about how much No. 22 means to him after having worn it for the entirety of his career. ""I really appreciate this number,"" he said nostalgically. ""This is the first one I ever wore."" Clearly, the gesture held great meaning for both players, turning a spontaneous gesture into the fabric of their growing friendship and respect.Baty's rise to prominence as one of the most exciting young players on the Mets thoroughly validates his shining promise on the diamond now, though he has just bagged a shiny new set of wheels for a load. Soto pretty much cemented his place as one of the most charitable stars in the game-not only through setting records but by putting together one of the warmest moments of the season.","Mets third baseman brett baty has worn the no. 22 jersey for seven years. Juan soto, a teammate of baty's, decided to give him a new car. The gift was worth between $60k and $90k.

“MAGA stands for trying to erase trans people from existence, MAGA stands for resegregation and racism,” says former punter of the Minnesota Vikings, Chris Kluwe

Hi, my name is Chris Kluwe, a 15-year HB resident. I’m here to speak out against both the plaque and the current city council. As the community made clear at the library commission meeting last Tuesday, everyone is in favor of a plaque to celebrate at the library.

But the vast, vast majority are against it, including a MAGA acrostic. Unfortunately, it’s clear that this council does not listen. So, instead, I’m gonna take my time to say what MAGA has stood for these past three weeks.

MAGA stands for trying to erase trans people from existence. MAGA stands for resegregation and racism. MAGA stands for censorship and book bans. MAGA stands for firing air traffic controllers while planes are crashing. MAGA stands for firing the people overseeing our nuclear arsenal. MAGA stands for firing military veterans and those serving them at the VA, including canceling research on veteran suicide.

MAGA stands for cutting funds to education, including for disabled children. MAGA is profoundly corrupt, unmistakably anti-democracy, and most importantly, MAGA is explicitly a Nazi movement. You may have replaced a swastika with a red hat, but that is what it is. I will now engage in the time-honored American tradition of peaceful

civil disobedience

NEW YORK: Six US prison workers accused of beating to death a handcuffed Black inmate were indicted Thursday on second-degree murder charges , in a case that has sparked outrage.Robert Brooks's death at New York's Marcy Correctional Facility in December 2024 was caught on the officers' bodycams.The footage showed several officers restraining a man, whose hands were cuffed behind him for at least part of the attack, with one uniformed officer kicking him during a struggle.As the inmate sat up, visibly wounded, an officer put on a surgical glove and grabbed him again by the collar and, with the help of a colleague, slammed him against a wall.The footage was released by New York Attorney General Letitia James who called the scenes ""shocking and disturbing.""Three others were charged with involuntary manslaughter for failing to prevent the death of Brooks, who was serving a 12-year sentence for assault at Marcy Prison, located near the Canadian border.A 10th prison worker was charged with allegedly cleaning up the scene and attempting to conceal evidence.The accused acted with ""depraved indifference to human life, recklessly engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby caused the death of Robert Brooks,"" the indictment issued by special prosecutor William Fitzpatrick said.New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had given the order to ""immediately begin the termination process for 14 individuals who were involved in the fatal attack on an incarcerated individual at Marcy Correctional Facility.""""This action comes after I directed an internal review of the circumstances that lead to this individual's death,"" she said.The United States is regularly rocked by violence committed by law enforcement officers.In 2020, the murder of George Floyd, a Black man who was suffocated under a police officer's knee, sparked a huge wave of anti-racism protests across the country.",Robert brooks's death at new york's marcy correctional facility in december 2024 was caught on the officers' bodycams. Three others were charged with involuntary manslaughter for failing to prevent the death of brooks.

At the FII Priority Summit in Miami on Thursday, US President Donald Trump warned that "" World War III is not so far away"" but said that his leadership would prevent it. He also added that if former President Joe Biden's administration had continued, the world would already be in conflict.""There’s no profit for anyone in having World War III, and you're not so far away from it,"" Trump said. ""If we would've had this administration for another year, you would've been in a war three, and now it's not going to happen.""Trump pointed out that while the US would avoid involvement in ongoing conflicts, his administration would work to prevent them. ""We’re going to stop people from these stupid, never-ending wars. We’re not going to partake in them ourselves, but we’ll be stronger and more powerful than anybody by far,"" he stated, adding that he doesn’t expect the US to face war.Quoting Elon Musk in a post on X, Trump wrote, ""Elon Musk: The President's instincts on Ukraine are absolutely right. It is really sad that so many parents have lost their sons, and so many sons their fathers in this pointless war.""On Wednesday, Trump criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, claiming that the US has spent $200 billion more than Europe while receiving no return on investment. He questioned Europe's financial contributions, accusing Zelenskyy of convincing the US to invest heavily in a war he believes cannot be won. Trump also labelled Zelenskyy a dictator for governing without elections.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion dollars, to go into a war that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a war that he, without the US and ‘TRUMP,’ will never be able to settle.""","Us president donald trump warned that "" world war iii is not so far away"" but said that his leadership would prevent it.

Stock market recommendations:The Index has been consolidating with high volatility over the past four sessions, trading in a broad range of 22,700-23,050, forming a base after the recent sharp decline. On Thursday, the index formed a small bull candle, highlighting stock-specific actions amid consolidation.Looking ahead, we anticipate the index to continue building this base. During this phase, dips toward the 22,800–22,700 range should be considered buying opportunities. A breakout above 23,050 would open the door for further upside, potentially reaching the 20-day EMA, currently around 23,250. However, volatility is expected to remain high due to ongoing concerns over US tariff-related issues. A breakdown below the 22,700-support level could trigger further declines toward 22,500-22,400.During the current week, the market breadth indicator shows extreme pessimism, with the percentage of stocks above the 50 SMA and 200 SMA within the Nifty 500 Universe entering a bearish extreme zone with readings of 07 & 13 respectively. Historically, such readings have marked a shift in downward momentum, often leading to a durable bottom in the weeks that follow. As a result, investors should focus on accumulating quality stocks on dips, supported by strong earnings.Additionally, silver linings in the current corrective phase include a cooling of the US Dollar index, which is on the verge of breaking down below 106.5, and a potential easing of geopolitical tensions, both of which could provide stability and support a pullback rally in the coming weeks.Over the past month, Bank Nifty has outperformed Nifty, consolidating within a range. Last week, the index formed a base around the support zone of 48,500–48,300, which aligns with the bullish gap from January 28, 2025, and the 80% retracement of the recent uptrend (47,844–50,641).We expect the index to continue consolidating over the next few weeks within a broad range of 50,600–48,000. The last six weeks of base formation near the lower band of a two-year rising channel suggest the index is likely to resolve higher. We anticipate Bank Nifty to move toward 51,600, the 61.8% retracement of the previous decline (53,888–47,844), with 48,000 providing immediate support. Volatility remains elevated due to ongoing US tariff-related concerns.The stock is witnessing buying demand after forming base at the key support area of 225-235 thus offers fresh entry opportunity with a favorable risk-reward set up. The key support of 225-235 is the confluence of the 100 weeks EMA and the previous multiple lows of CY24.Among the oscillators, the daily RSI has recently generated a buy signal thus validates positive bias. We expect the stock to head higher towards 473 in the coming weeks being 61.8% retracement of previous major decline (526-410).The stock after recent sharp decline is witnessing buying demand from the support area of 320-330 being the confluence of previous breakout area of May 2024 and falling trendline support joining lows of August & November 2024.The stock on Thursday session has generated a breakout above last three sessions range signaling resumption of up move. We expect the stock to head higher towards 365 levels in the coming weeks being the confluence of previous swing high and 50 days EMA.","According to bajaj broking research, ongc and crompton greaves consumer electricals are the top stock picks for today.

The list has not been finalsed, however, it has been conveyed to Republican members of Congress, not Democrats.""I may have heard a rumor, but I'm not going to speculate on rumors,"" Senate armed service committee chair Roger Wicker told Fox.""No one has approached me about such a list other than people asking me questions,"" he added.This comes as Hegseth was scheduled to travel to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to conduct a media interview, but the trip was postponed until Tuesday.Some officials have taken the postponement to be another sign that firings could be imminent as ate Friday is often the time that firings are announced in Washington.During her tenure, Franchetti commanded two aircraft carrier strike groups in the Pacific and served as the commander of US Naval Forces Korea. She also held key roles as the deputy chief of naval operations for warfighting development and as the director for strategy, plans, and policy on the Joint Staff. As head of the Navy's 6th Fleet, Franchetti led the Navy’s response to Syrian President Bashar al Assad's use of chemical weapons.Admiral Michael Gilday, former Chief of Naval Operations, praised Franchetti upon her nomination by then-President Joe Biden in July 2023, calling her a “warfighter with combat experience,” an “operational leader,” and an “innovator.” He also highlighted her skills as a team builder, trailblazer, and a testament to personal and professional resilience, noting her embodiment of the American dream and the values of service and sacrifice.Meanwhile, Hegseth, known for his outspoken views, has publicly claimed that women should not serve in combat roles.Earlier, during his appearance on the Shawn Ryan Show podcast, he argued that women in combat “hasn’t made us more effective, hasn’t made us more lethal, and has made fighting more complicated.” He later clarified his comments, explaining they had been “misconstrued,” and reaffirmed his support for women in the military, acknowledging that some of the best warriors are women.In another development, Joint Chiefs Chairman CQ Brown is rumored to be on the list for upcoming changes. When asked whether he would fire Brown on his first day in office, Hegseth responded, ""I look forward to working with him,"" with Brown standing next to him at the time.",Us president donald trump's newly appointed defence secretary pete hegseth is circulating 'handful of names' of top military general to congressional republicans he is interested in firing.

Kash Patel, Trump’s Pick for FBI Director, Is Confirmed by Senate

Who is Kash Patel?



The Senate confirmed Kash Patel , an Indian-origin FBI director , on Thursday (US time). The nominee received 51 votes in favor while 49 were against his confirmation.After the confirmation, Kash Patel took his account on X and said that his mission as Director is clear, ""let good cops be cops—and rebuild trust in the FBI.""He gave warning to those who tries to harm American, ""We will hunt you down in every corner of this planet.""Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joined all 47 Democrats in voting no on Patel’s nomination.Earlier, Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced that she would vote against the confirmation of Kash Patel.""In this context, there is a compelling need for an FBI Director who is decidedly apolitical. While Patel has had 16 years of dedicated public service, his time over the past four years has been characterized by high profile and aggressive political activity. Patel has made numerous poltically charges statements in his book and elsewhere discrediting the work of the FBI, the very institution he has been nominated to lead. These statements, in conjunction with the questionnaire sent to thousands of FBI employees, cast doubt on Mr. Patel's ability to advance the FBI's law enforcement mission in a way that is free from the appearance of political motivation,"" Collins said in her statement.""While I strongly support efforts to ensure all federal employees perform their responsibilities ethically and in accordance with the law, Mr. Patel's recent political profile undermines his ability to serve in the apolitical role of Director of the FBI.”""Therefore, I will vote against his nomination.""Meanwhile, Alaska Sen Lisa Murkowski defended her stance and said that Kash Patel had the opportunity to push back on the administration’s decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.Patel, a Trump loyalist and vocal critic of the agency, would take charge during a period of significant upheaval. Recent developments include the Justice Department's removal of senior FBI officials and an unusual request for identifying thousands of agents involved in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot investigations.As FBI directors serve 10-year terms to maintain independence, Patel replaced Christopher Wray, who resigned before Trump's return to office. Patel previously served as a federal defender and Justice Department counterterrorism prosecutor, gaining Trump's attention through his critical analysis of the FBI's Russia investigation whilst working for the House Intelligence Committee.Kash Patel, a native of Garden City, New York, was born to parents from Gujarat, India. His family's journey began in the early 1970s when they left Uganda due to ethnic discrimination and settled in Canada. They later relocated to the USA after his father accepted a position as a financial officer in an aviation firm.Despite speculation about a private Hindu marriage ceremony, Patel remains single. Whilst his professional achievements are well-known, particularly his firm position on Russia and allegiance to former President Donald Trump, he maintains privacy regarding his personal affairs.His academic credentials include a History and Criminal Justice degree from the University of Richmond, complemented by a JD from Pace University School of Law.He has worked as the Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council (NSC). Patel was in charge of executing many of President Donald Trump’s top priorities, including “eliminating ISIS and Al-Qa’ida leadership such as al-Baghdadi and Qasem al-Rimi, and the safe repatriation of numerous American hostages,” says the US Defence Department.According to the US Department of Defence, Patel “served as the former Chief of Staff to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller and is responsible for leading the Secretary’s mission at the Department, including his executive staff and providing counsel to the Secretary on all matters concerning the Department’s operations.”","Kash patel, an indian-origin fbi director, was confirmed by the senate on thursday.

Leland Dudek: Who is Leland Dudek? Pro-DOGE ‘anti-fraud expert’ takes over as SSA chief after Michelle King’s exit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-leland-dudek-pro-doge-anti-fraud-expert-takes-over-as-ssa-chief-after-michelle-kings-exit/articleshow/118404751.cms,"Who is Leland Dudek?

Dudek’s vision for SSA

Michelle King’s departure

Concerns over data access

Leland Dudek , a longtime ' anti-fraud expert ' at the Social Security Administration (SSA), has been appointed as the agency’s acting chief following the sudden departure of Michelle King . His appointment comes amid growing debate over Elon Musk ’s department of government efficiency ( DOGE ) and its efforts to access sensitive social security data.Dudek, who previously led the SSA’s fraud investigation office, has spent his career working to combat fraud within the agency. However, his cooperation with DOGE nearly cost him his job. In a now-deleted post by The Daily Wire., Dudek revealed that he had been placed on administrative leave for working with DOGE officials to identify inefficiencies within SSA.“At 4.30pm EST, my boss called me to tell me I had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation,” he wrote on his LinkedIn. “They want to fire me for cooperating with DOGE.”Just days later, the tables turned. Instead of being dismissed, Dudek was reinstated and given a major promotion, taking over King’s role as acting commissioner.The LinkedIn post read: “I confess. I helped DOGE understand SSA. I mailed myself publicly accessible documents and explained them to DOGE. I confess. I moved contractor money around to add data science resources to my anti-fraud team. I confess. I asked where the fat was and is in our contracts so we can make the right tough choices.”“I confess. I bullied agency executives, shared executive contact information, and circumvented the chain of command to connect DOGE with the people who get stuff done,” the post continued. “Everything I have ever done is in service to our country, our beneficiaries, and our agency.”Dudek has vowed to lead SSA with transparency. In an email to staff, he emphasised his commitment to protecting the agency’s integrity. Meanwhile, critics fear that his appointment signals greater DOGE influence over social security data.Republican lawmakers have welcomed the leadership change, with Senator Mike Lee’s spokesperson, Billy Gribbin, stating, “There are many good civil servants who have been quietly frustrated for years with politically-motivated mismanagement… Put them in charge, hand them scalpels and flamethrowers.”Dudek will serve as acting commissioner until Trump’s nominee, Frank Bisignano, is confirmed by the Senate. His appointment marks a significant shift in the agency’s direction, with debates raging over whether his leadership will enhance anti-fraud efforts or compromise the security of millions of Americans’ private data.Michelle King’s resignation has raised significant questions, with reports suggesting she was pushed out after resisting DOGE’s attempts to access the SSA’s Enterprise Data Warehouse, a hub containing sensitive information on millions of Americans. According to Nancy Altman, president of advocacy group Social Security Works, King stood her ground against DOGE’s efforts.“She was standing in the way and they moved her out of the way,” Altman was quoted as saying CBS News. “They put someone in who presumably they thought would cooperate with them and give them the keys to all our personal data.”The White House has not provided a reason for King’s departure, but her exit follows a pattern of high-ranking officials resigning or being removed amid concerns about DOGE’s expanding reach.DOGE, created under Trump’s administration and heavily influenced by his adviser Elon Musk, has been accused of overreach, with reports suggesting it has already accessed Treasury payment systems and is seeking entry into Internal Revenue Service (IRS) databases. Altman warned that SSA’s data contains highly sensitive records, including information on nearly every American with a Social Security number.“There is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is,” Altman told The Associated Press. “If there is an evil intent to punish perceived enemies, someone could erase your earnings record, making it impossible to collect the Social Security and Medicare benefits you have earned.”",Leland dudek has been appointed as the agency’s acting chief following the sudden departure of michelle king.
