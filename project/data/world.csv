Should India Worry As Pakistan, China & Afghanistan Hold Trilateral Talks In Beijing? | Explained

Why it matters for India?



Should Afghanistan's inclusion concern India?



Pakistan and China have agreed to extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan in an effort to deepen the trilateral cooperation between the three nations. The move has been consistently opposed by India since it involves constructions through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).This is the first trilateral meeting between the three since Operation Sindoor, India's offensive against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK post Pahalgam attack.The three nations that share borders with India also reaffirmed their commitment towards ""regional peace, stability, and development"".""Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan stand together for regional peace, stability, and development,"" Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar, who is on a three-day visit to China, said.""They discussed enhancing diplomatic engagement, strengthening communications, and taking practical steps to boost trade, infrastructure, and development as key drivers of shared prosperity. They agreed to deepen Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation and extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan,"" PTI reported quoting Pakistan's foreign office (FO) statement.India and Pakistan have recently retreated from the brink of war after the two nations launched military actions against each other.New Delhi has always raised concerns over the terror infrastructure being funded by Pakistan, especially in PoK, allegedly leading to Pahalgam terror attack. This led India to launch Operation Sindoor targeting nine terror sites in the neighbouring nation and PoK.China, meanwhile, expressed support for its ""all-weather friend"" during the operation and its foreign minister remained in constant touch with the Pakistani counterpart. Moreover, Pakistan's use of Chinese weaponry in its retaliation came as no surprise, considering that China accounts for 82% of Islamabad’s defence imports.India has, in the past, strongly condemned China and Pakistan for encouraging participation of third countries in CPEC projects.""We have seen reports on encouraging proposed participation of third countries in so-called CPEC projects. Any such actions by any party directly infringe on India's sovereignty and territorial integrity. India firmly and consistently opposes projects in the so-called CPEC, which are in Indian territory that has been illegally occupied by Pakistan,"" MEA had said in 2022.Meanwhile, Afghanistan's inclusion comes at a time when the Taliban government condemned Pahalgam terror attack and rejected the Pakistan army’s claims that India had launched missile strikes on Afghan territory.This led to the first political engagement between India and the Taliban, as the two expressed appreciation for Kabul’s unequivocal condemnation of the April 22 terror attack that killed 26 people.As India already has border issues with China and Pakistan, Afghanistan's solidarity with the two might prove to be hazardous.","Pakistan and china agree to extend the china-pakistan economic corridor to afghanistan.

NEW DELHI: Communist Party of India (CPI) leader D Raja on Tuesday claimed that it is ""unacceptable"" for the government to brief foreign countries on Operation Sindoor while keeping the Indians ""in dark"", as calls grow for a special session of Parliament to discuss the matter.The CPI general secretary took to X claiming that, ""the government's decision to send all-party delegations to key countries, including UNSC members, after Operation Sindoor has been marked by opacity and exclusion.""""It is unacceptable that foreign governments will be briefed while India’s own Parliament and people remain in the dark,"" he posted on X.Raja also pointed out that no political party was consulted or informed about the purpose and mandate of these delegations.""Political parties were neither consulted nor briefed, and there is no clarity on the mandate of these delegations,"" he noted.He further echoed the opposition parties, including Congress’s demand for a special session of Parliament to discuss Operation Sindoor, launched after the Pahalgam attack.Highlighting the arrest of an Ashoka University professor over a social media post on the operation, Raja alleged the government was suppressing dissent and evading accountability.The CPI leader shared a series of posts saying that,""Since the Pahalgam attack, the nation has responded with unity against terror. Yet, the BJP has chosen to exploit the moment to deepen divisions, score political points, and suppress dissent.

This stands in direct contrast to the Foreign Secretary's reported statement before a parliamentary panel that both sides used conventional warfare,"" Raja said, questioning why there’s been no official denial or condemnation.""Will the government answer these questions, or India’s national security dialogue will remain hostage to Donald Trump’s monologues?"" he further questioned.Raja also trained guns on the BJP-led government's foreign policy, stating that ""BJP’s 11 years of foreign policy posturing have yielded little. Despite all the photo ops and the hype around G20, no major nation has stood unequivocally with India.""""Before reaching out to the world, the government must first respect its own people and institutions,"" he said, calling for transparency and democratic accountability. ""India deserves transparency, unity, and dignity not arrogance, opacity, and suppression,"" he added.His remarks came after the Centre announced the names of seven all-party delegations that will travel to key world capitals to highlight India’s counter-terrorism efforts following Operation Sindoor.

Mystery shrouds the sudden hospitalization of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) co-founder Amir Hamza on Tuesday.The details reaching here suggest that the 66-year-old editor of Lashkar's magazines was critically injured at his house and had to be admitted at a military hospital in Lahore under ISI 's security cover. The incident comes three days after Abu Saifullah , a high-ranking Lashkar operative and key recruiter, was gunned down by unidentified gunmen in Pakistan.Terror sympathisers on pro-Lashkar's Telegram channels were rattled on Tuesday evening, asking members to stay strong during the ""crisis"", while insisting it was an ""accident"".Hamza, who belongs to Gujranwala city in Pakistan's Punjab province, was declared a global terrorist by the US in Aug 2012. The top LeT ideologue was referred to as 'Afghan Mujahideen' and was close to Hafiz Saeed and Abdul Rehman Makki, both UN-designated terrorists belonging to Lashkar, who had appointed him on the jihadi outfit's central committee.Before he moved to handling Lashkar's propaganda, Hamza was an active terrorist who was active in India in the early 2000s. He and Saifullah were part of the group behind the 2005 attack on the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru. He was, however, pulled out of violent jihad and assigned to the propaganda division which he would soon head.Also read: Top LeT terrorist Abu Saiullah, behind 3 major attacks on India, eliminated in Pakistan's Sindh ""He also headed publication division of Lashkar and wrote books like Qafila Da'wat aur Shahadat (Caravan of Proselytizing and Martydom), Shahrah-e-Bahisht (The road to paradise),"" said a source.In 2018, Saeed had him form another outfit named Jaish-e-Manqafa in the wake of a ban on Lashkar and Jamat-ud-Dawah. The move had fuelled rumours of a rift in Lashkar's top brass but turned out to be a feint.According to US Treasury department, Hamza, a member of LeT's central advisory committee, actively maintained Lashkar's relationships with other groups under the direction of its emir Hafiz Muhammad Saeed.""Hamza has led an LeT-associated charity and was also an officer and member of a Lashkar's university trust that was led by Saeed.

NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies dismantled a high-stakes espionage ring in a meticulously planned three-month-long covert operation, dealing a significant blow to ISI's attempts to carry out a terrorist strike in the national capital. The operation culminated in the arrest of two highly trained individuals, including Ansarul Miya Ansari , a Pakistani operative tasked with gathering sensitive information about Indian armed forces, sources said.The probe also points a finger of suspicion at some staffers of Pak High Commission in Delhi. It's suspected that ISI officers Muzammil and Ehsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish who had been cultivating Indian Youtubers and influencers were in on the plot.The operation kicked off with a vague tip in Jan that a spy had been dispatched by ISI to collect sensitive documents/pictures/Google coordinates and was to arrive in Delhi via Nepal. The sleuths then developed the tip which revealed that an attack in Delhi was being planned and classified information about the armed forces was to be used to plan a terror attack.Despite the high stakes, intelligence officials had to wait till mid-Feb to make headway.The ISI agent had arrived in Delhi and had collected confidential military documents, sources said. The trap was set, and on Feb 15, Ansari was apprehended in central Delhi with sensitive documents while he was on his way back to Pakistan via Nepal.The operation, sources said, was a masterclass in espionage craft, with the agency officials staying one step ahead of the spy at every turn. ""Our men were making efforts to collect information about Pak-backed terror outfits active in different parts of India and sleeper cells providing logistic support to them. After some grenade attacks outside police establishments in Punjab were carried out by ISI-backed terrorist outfit Babbar Khalsa Internation (BKI), the agency suspected a larger plot to threaten public safety in north-western India,"" said the source.""In view of this, proactive steps were taken to prevent any such planning of terror attack in Delhi-NCR. Sources were activated which culminated in the tip about this suspect's travel plans.""Ansari was subsequently handed over to the police who then booked him for possessing and attempting to supply confidential documents related to the Indian Armed Forces to his Pakistani handlers. An FIR under the Officials Secrets Act was registered.The investigation also uncovered the role of Akhlaque Azam, a resident of Ranchi, who was providing logistic support to Ansarul in India. The two were in constant communication with their Pakistani handlers, and their conversations were laced with suspicion and intrigue, sources said. Azam was subsequently arrested in March.The analysis of their mobile devices uncovered suspicious conversations between both the arrested accused and their Pakistani handlers, which suggested a larger conspiracy. A few days ago, a chargesheet was filed in court against the two suspects even as further investigation is underway to identify more individuals involved in the conspiracy.But who was Ansari? A deep dive into his background revealed a complex web of deceit and radicalisation. During interrogation, Ansari revealed that he originally belonged to Nepal but had been living and working as a taxi driver in Qatar since 2008, where he was recruited by an ISI operative. Money was the first incentive and the brainwashing about the 'bigger cause' followed. He was asked to go to Pakistan and meet his handler in Rawalpindi.""In June 2024, he visited Pakistan for a month, where he was introduced to high-ranking officials of the Pakistani Army and radicalised by discussing issues like the Babri Masjid demolition and the implementation of CAA/NRC in India. Ansari was also trained in espionage and tasked with procuring secret documents from Delhi,"" a report filed in court reads.The trial is about commence shortly with the court having taken cognisance of the chargesheet. The two arrested men are lodged in high security wing of Tihar jail. A special watch is being kept over them so that they may not attempt to brainwash other inmates, sources said.

In return, it would want the trading bloc to offer easier access to Indian garments, pharmaceuticals, steel and oil products.The interim agreement will not be limited to tariffs and may also include issues such as intellectual property rights (IPRs), govt procurement, and non-tariff barriers, a senior official said. A few years ago, India had entered into an interim pact with Australia, although it had worked out a comprehensive free trade agreement with the UK.Sources indicated that the proposed pact with Oman, which is stuck mainly on the issue of petrochemicals, may also be finalised soon as govt broadens its trade engagement to push exports, both of goods and services.India and EU have agreed to conclude the agreement in two phases on account of the uncertain global trade environment, sources said.In recent months, the talks have received a fillip, thanks to the signals coming from the highest levels. EU too is seen to be more accommodative of India's position on several counts, something it was unwilling to do earlier.","Negotiators from both sides are working overtime to finalise the trade pact.

NEW DELHI: Turkiye-based Celebi Airport Services Pvt Ltd submitted before Delhi HC Wednesday that Bureau of Civil Aviation Security withdrew the firm's security clearance without any prior notice or opportunity for a hearing, thereby disregarding the regulations governing the sector as well as the principles of natural justice.The company also insisted that its workforce was Indian, and offered to replace Turkish staff, if that was a concern.Govt had revoked the security clearance of Celebi, which handles operations at nine major airports in India, citing concerns over national security following Turkiye 's support to Pakistan during Op Sindoor.Citing the Aircraft (Security) Rules-2023, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for Celebi, argued before a bench of Justice Sachin Dutta that granting a hearing is a statutory requirement. Govt is not entitled to create exceptions to the rules it has made, he said.According to rule 12 of the Aircraft (Security) Rules, govt can suspend a company's security clearance for up to one year or cancel it entirely, after providing a hearing opportunity and documenting the reasons.

India seeks US duty cuts for labour-intensive sectors

NEW DELHI: India hopes to revert to the pre-April 2 status for its exports, especially in the labour intensive sectors, as part of the bilateral trade deal with US in return for concessions for American imports, including farm products.""Talks are moving positively. Before July 8, we are looking at concluding an interim deal ahead of the first tranche. It will include goods, non-tariff barriers, some areas of services like digital. We're trying that 26% additional duty and 10% baseline tariff shouldn't be there for India,"" an official said.While the reciprocal tariffs were suspended for 90 days, the 10% baseline duty on all countries is in place, making exports uncompetitive. A full-fledged trade deal, which involves coverage of 85-90% of products from both sides, referred to as ""substantial coverage"", is unlikely till Trump administration gets a green light from Congress for reducing levies below the most-favoured nation rates applicable to all countries. tnnIt can, however, remove the reciprocal tariffs imposed on countries, including India.Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal and a team of Indian negotiators is currently in the US holding detailed discussions on a bilateral trade agreement that was agreed to by Trump and PM Narendra Modi by Fall (Sept-Oct). Govt was earlier seeking an ""early tranche"" before the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs ends, but officials indicated that talks have been progressing well.""Good discussions with secretary @HowardLutnick towards expediting the first tranche of India-US bilateral trade agreement,"" Goyal posted on social media on Tuesday after meeting the US commerce secretary.Govt is seeking duty concessions for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather goods, gems and jewellery, plastics, chemicals, shrimps, oil seeds and some Indian fruits. The US has been demanding duty cuts for its automobiles, especially electric vehicles such as Tesla, whiskey, wine, petrochemicals, dairy, and farm goods, including genetically modified crops.While India is open to lowering customs duty for farm products, it is unlikely to allow genetically-modified products to enter the country. If the US-UK trade deal is a pointer, Washington offered concessions on some 100-odd products while managing to extract duty cuts for around 2,500 American goods as well as commitments for more aircraft and other purchases.To ward off tariffs, India too may have to give more than it can get, including more LNG, fertiliser and defence purchases, experts have argued.","India hopes to revert to pre-april 2 status for its exports, especially in the labour intensive sectors.

'Sleepless night': PM Modi's 'Tharoor' swipe at Congress

Repeat 'offender'?

NEW DELHI: For several times in the last few months we have heard the Congress ""distance"" itself from Shashi Tharoor 's remarks. But now, in an interesting turn of events, it appears that Shashi Tharoor is ""distancing"" himself from the Congress.The gap between Congress and Tharoor, that first appeared on the surface in February this year when the Thiruvananthapuram MP openly praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit, seems to have widened in the last few days. The government's move to nominate Tharoor for its global diplomatic outreach post Operation Sindoor, bypassing the Congress leadership, has perhaps brought the differences to a tipping point.Congress veteran P J Kurien's recent remark: ""If people suspect Tharoor is leaning towards the BJP, no one can blame them for thinking so"" sums up the visible strain in the relationship. It has raised the obvious question: Is Tharoor on his way out of the Congress?Well, we may not have a clear answer to this question right now. But there are enough hints to suggest that Congress and Tharoor are drifting apart.Here's what they had to say about each other after the latest round of stand-off trigerred by the government's nomination move.Tharoor, when asked about not being nominated by the party, said, ""My party leadership is entitled to its opinion of my abilities or lack thereof, and I think that is really for them to explain. I have absolutely no comment to make on that. I am honoured to have been entrusted with the responsibility, and I will fulfil that responsibility just as I have fulfilled every responsibility entrusted to me in my rather long working life, whether at the United Nations or in the Congress Party. ""When asked if the party was trying to insult him by releasing the names suggested by it for the delegation, Tharoor said that he cannot be insulted so easily. ""I know my worth,"" he asserted.Tharoor also echoed the government line and said ""To my mind, this has nothing to do with party politics. It's all to do with what our country has been through in recent times and the need for us to present a united front. It is a good reflection of national unity at a time when unity is important.""The Congress, unhappy with Tharoor's ready acceptance of the responsibility ignoring the party stand, said: ""There is a difference between being in the Congress and being of the Congress. The Congress is like the mighty Ganga, which has many tributaries… Some of them dry up and some get polluted.""That Shashi Tharoor and the Congress were not on the same page on several issues in the last few months was an open secret. There were several instances when Tharoor praised PM Modi 's policies without bothering much about the party line.""PM Modi's US visit has yielded some positive outcomes for the Indian people. I welcome the fact that there is now an agreement to have a negotiation for the next 9 months on trade and tariffs. It's far better than Washington hastily and unilaterally imposing some tariffs on us, which could have damaged and hurt our exports. It seems to me that something good has been achieved, and I applaud that as an Indian. We can't always speak only in terms of party interests. I am not a party spokesman. I am an MP elected by all the people of Thiruvananthapuram, and on that basis, I speak as a responsible stakeholder in Indian democracy.""""India's diplomatic approach had given the Prime Minister a unique position to hug both the president of Ukraine and the president of Moscow two weeks apart and be accepted in both places. I am still wiping the egg off my face because I was one person in the parliamentary debate who actually criticised the Indian position at the time back in February 2022.""""India’s vaccine diplomacy during the Covid pandemic stands out from amid the horrors of that time as a powerful example of international leadership rooted in responsibility and solidarity. By delivering made-in-India vaccines to over 100 nations, India demonstrated its capacity to extend a helping hand when it mattered most. ""This initiative during the dark days of the Covid pandemic reinforced India’s standing as a force for good in the world, reflecting its humanitarian spirit and adding to the allure of its soft power. It carried the values of compassion, cooperation, and global partnership to the world, building goodwill, strengthening diplomatic ties, and elevating India’s global stature.""""Obviously, there was no full proof intelligence. There was some failure... But we have got the example of Israel, the world's best intelligence services according to everybody, which were taken by surprise on October 7, just two years ago. It seems to me, just as Israel is waiting till the end of the war before they demand accountability, similarly, I think we too should see the present crisis through and then demand accountability from the government. No country can ever have a foolproof 100 per cent intelligence.'Clearly, Tharoor's praise for PM Modi and his policies was not an one-off transgression, but a sustained campaign to perhaps send across some message to the Congress leadership. When pointed out that his remarks were at variance with the party's stand, Tharoor strongly defended his position.""For 16 years, I have been in politics. My attitude has been that when somebody in the government, whether it’s our government or some other party’s government, does the right thing or does something well, one should acknowledge and praise it, and when they do something badly, one should criticise it,"" Tharoor said in February when objections were raised to his praise for PM Modi's US trip.The differences between Congress and Tharoor were so obvious that Prime Minister Modi took swipes at the grand-old-party when he shared stage with the Thiruvananthapuram MP at a function in Kerala.In his address during the public event, PM Modi had said, ""I want to tell Chief Minister (Pinarayi Vijayan), you are a strong pillar of INDI alliance, Shashi Tharoor is also sitting here. Today's event is going to disturb the sleep of many.""When the translator failed to deliver the exact translation of Prime Minister's message from Hindi to Malayalam, PM Modi said, ""The message has gone wherever it has to go.""Interestingly, this is not the first time that Tharoor has landed in trouble with the Congress over his praise for PM Modi. In February 2015, Tharoor had called PM Modi ""master communicator at work.""""In the Prime Minister, we are all seeing a master communicator at work. The Prime Minister is very effective in speech-making, comes up with slogans, sound bites, photo ops in quite an unparalleled way,"" Tharoor had then said.Tharoor's repeated praise for Modi then had prompted Kerala Congress to remind him that he had been elected on a Congress ticket. The state unit had then warned Tharoor of disciplinary action if he kept on lauding Modi's initiatives.When Kerala Congress objected to Tharoor's endorsement of PM Modi's ""Swachh Bharat"" campaign, Tharoor had said that it did not mean that he even remotely endorsed the BJP's ""core Hindutva"" agenda and that he continued to be a ""proud Congressman"".""I am astonished that anyone would suggest that I am pro-BJP. I have a 30-year paper trail of published writings on my idea of India and my profound belief in India's pluralism,"" Tharoor had then said in a Facebook comment.""Being receptive to specific statements or actions of BJP leaders does not remotely imply acceptance of the party's core Hindutva agenda. The PM pitched his appeal as a non-political one and I received it in that spirit. I am a proud Congressman and a proud Indian. In short, not pro-BJP, just pro-India,"" the former UN diplomat had said.In 2015, Tharoor was clearly defensive about his views and statements which were at variance with the party. 10 years later, he appears to be aggressive about his stand and has justified his views. So, the question is: ""Is Shashi Tharoor now forcing his way out of the Congress?"" Well, we will have to wait and see how this saga unfolds.","Congress veteran p j kurien's recent remark: ""if people suspect tharoor is leaning towards the bjp, no one can blame them for thinking so"" sums up the visible strain in the relationship. There are enough hints to suggest that congress and throor are drifting apart. ""to my mind, this has nothing to do with party politics.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121321736,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-45454,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Official warnings and government response

Social media buzz and public reaction





A Japanese manga artist known for her unsettlingly accurate predictions has sparked widespread concern, leading to a surge in travel cancellations to Japan., often called, has captured global attention for her chilling predictions, including a major disaster anticipated for July 2025. With a track record that reportedly includes predictions of the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the death of iconic figures, Tatsuki’s latest prediction has left travellers reconsidering their plans, citing fear, anxiety, and a desire to avoid potential danger.The impact of her warning is already being felt in the travel industry, with agencies reporting significant drops in bookings as the feared date approaches. Airlines, hotels, and tour operators are bracing for continued losses. Here, you can explore Tatsuki's predictions, her history of accurate foresight, and the response from concerned travellers seeking reassurance or alternative destinations.Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, known for her eerily accurate predictions about global events. Tatsuki first gained attention in 1999 with the release of her booka compilation of visions she claims to have experienced over the years.While the book initially received little mainstream attention, several of Tatsuki’s predictions have reportedly come true, earning her a devoted following in Japan and beyond.Some of her most notable forecasts are catastrophic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan’s northern Tohoku region. This disaster, which claimed over 18,000 lives and triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis, occurred in the same month and year Tatsuki had predicted. Her book also allegedly foresaw the 1995 Kobe earthquake and the death of legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, adding to her reputation as a modern-day seer.In a revised edition ofpublished in 2021, Tatsuki issued a stark warning about a potentially catastrophic event set to strike in July 2025. According to CNN and other media reports, Tatsuki’s prophecy describes a massive undersea rupture forming between Japan and the Philippines, capable of generating tsunamis three times the height of those seen during the 2011 Tohoku disaster.Her prediction includes unsettling imagery of Japan’s oceans “boiling,” which some interpret as a possible reference to an underwater volcanic eruption or a massive seismic event. The epicenter of this anticipated disaster is drawn as a diamond-shaped region connecting Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Northern Mariana Islands – a part of the Pacific known for its intense geological activity.Reports indicate that Tatsuki’s prophecy has already started to influence travel behavior, particularly among tourists planning to visit Japan in the coming months. According to Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG, bookings to Japan dropped by as much as 50 percent during the recent Easter break, a trend expected to continue as the feared date draws closer.Speaking to CNN, CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, noted that concerns over Tatsuki’s prediction have been compounded by recent advisories from the Chinese embassy in Tokyo. In a statement issued in April 2025, the embassy warned Chinese nationals in Japan to remain vigilant against potential natural disasters, further fueling anxiety among travelers.The Chinese government’s warning was reportedly prompted by a series of recent seismic events and increased volcanic activity around Japan’s coastline. The South China Morning Post reported that the advisory urged residents and tourists to “take extra precautions against natural disasters,” a statement that many interpreted as an indirect acknowledgment of the growing fears surrounding Tatsuki’s prediction.Japanese authorities, however, have been more reserved in their response, focusing on reassuring the public about the country’s extensive disaster preparedness infrastructure. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has not issued any specific alerts related to the July 2025 timeframe, emphasizing that its seismic monitoring systems remain among the most advanced in the world.Social media platforms have become hotbeds of speculation and debate, with the hashtag #July2025Prediction trending across multiple countries. Some users have expressed deep concern, while others have dismissed the claims as mere coincidence or sensationalism. Online forums dedicated to earthquake preparedness have also seen a surge in activity, with members sharing safety tips and evacuation plans in case of a worst-case scenario.","New baba vanga's predictions spark mass trip cancellations among travellers in july 2025.

Top stock market recommendations:Nifty had an inside bar formation after closing at a four day closing low on Tuesday. With 24800 breached with heavy volumes earlier this week, the same is now likely to act as resistance for sell on rise on Nifty as the index is now open to hit 214300 / 24100 on downside. After a 3300+ point rally from its April panic low to May high’s the index has barely retraced 450 odd points from its recent highs. With the price action seen from the start of this week, it is fair for the index to retest 200 DMA support on downside which currently reads below 24100.Bank Nifty has broken from its 6 week rising trendline in Tuesday’s closing trades. This puts the index back on track to retest its polarity support of its original 5 year rising trendline. Targets for this breakdown hint for a 1000-1200 odd point breakdown from Tuesday’s closing.A follow up move on downside breaking Tuesday’s low yesterday also confirms the same.After a 22% rally from its recent low, Bosch is showing signs of exhaustion. With price action seen on Tuesday, the stock has closed below its previous week’s high as well as at a 4 day low. A 6% to 8% cool off is expected to play out given the heat up seen on the stock.Computer Age Management Services (CAMS) has given a sloping trendline breakout on Friday last week, while the price on Tuesday is more of a pullback on the breakout seen on charts of CAMS. This pullback is likely to act as a buy on dip for an upside of 4200 odd.Flag breakout on the daily chart is seen on charts of ONGC, with the neckline being crossed in last week’s trade.

What is ‘No Tax on Tips’ act passed by the US republican senate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-no-tax-on-tips-act-passed-by-the-us-republican-senate/articleshow/121312742.cms,"AP file photo

Rubio Screams, Turns Mic Off During Senate Fight; Murray’s Exchange Makes US State Secy Lose It

‘No tax on tip’, what is it?

Why is the ‘unanimous consent’ important?





The Republican senate of the US has unanimously passed the “no tax on tips” bill on Tuesday. Surprisingly, the “no tax on tips” provision has received unanimous bipartisan acceptance. The proposed bill rule aims to remove federal income taxes on tips.It was initially introduced by Republican senator Ted Cruz in January, with democratic co-sponsors Nevada senators Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto. The act postulates that workers in the bottom 60 per cent of the income distribution would have an average tax cut of US$ 1,260 if tips are to be excluded from income taxes.This proposed law would allow a tax deduction of up to US$ 25,000 for cash tips that employees declare to their employers for payroll tax withholding. A large share of restaurant workers, bartenders, hotel staffers, barbers, salon workers, tour guides, delivery and Uber drivers are likely to benefit from this.The national restaurant association, a powerful trade group that is against the minimum wage for workers, has shown assent for the proposed bill.While certain interest groups and labour economists have come against the idea of “no tax on tips”As the NYT News Service reported, Erika Polmar, executive director of the independent restaurant coalition, said, ""The Fair Labor Standards Act specifies that you can only receive tips if you are customer facing, so that means cooks, dishwashers, porters and bussers, in some cases, are all not receiving tips,"".Polmar argues that servers are going to get a substantial tax credit, while cooks will be excluded, and restaurants will find it difficult to increase minimum wages to make up that difference.As NBC reported, Senator Jacky Rosen proposed the bill in the senate for an “unanimous consent” request on Tuesday. This entails the bill being blocked by any senator. This procedure is duly followed for more mundane matters, unlike tax bills, for which a much more complex protocol is stuck to. The legislation was passed as the other 99 present senators did not object to Rosen’s proposal.Rosen stated, “ Nevada has more tipped workers per capita than any other state. So this bill would mean immediate financial relief for countless hard-working families”.The US tax code has always been filled with loopholes that benefit certain types of incomes or businesses over others, leading to several Washington-based think tanks opposing this proposed bill as a tax-exemption effort.","The republican senate of the us has unanimously passed the “no tax on tips” bill on tuesday.

The White House has finally reacted to President Donald Trump’s controversial post about Taylor Swift



President Donald Trump has constantly been making controversial comments about Taylor Swift



Taylor Swift and the newly elected President Donald Trump have been in the news for their contrasting political opinions for a couple of years now. While Taylor Swift publicly supported Donald Trump’s opponent, Kamala Harris, last year, President Trump has often dragged the pop star into many controversies. Recently, President Donald Trump made a pretty derogatory post on Truth Social about Taylor Swift and the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt recently reacted to it.As White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt took questions from the media, Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked her about President Donald Trump’s recent post about the billionaire pop star.Hearing this, Karoline Leavitt laughed at the question and said, ""Look, he is speaking about Taylor Swift's political views and how perhaps it has impacted the support of the American public for her work. And I will leave it at that.""Shockingly, this is not the first time that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt spoke about Taylor Swift. Last year, when President Donald Trump was still campaigning, Karoline Leavitt held the post of Trump National Press Secretary.At that point, Taylor Swift was more in favour of Joe Biden and Karoline Leavitt had reacted to it and said, “This woman has made a career off of writing songs about picking the wrong guy.We should not trust her to pick the wrong guy in this presidential election.”This has sparked major outrage in 2024 but Taylor Swift had not reacted to this even back then.For the unversed, President Donald Trump made a post on Truth Social recently that read as, ""Has anyone noticed that, since I said 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer 'HOT?'”This is not the first time that President Donald Trump made a derogatory post about the billionaire pop star. President Donald Trump made similar posts when he attended the Super Bowl LIX which Taylor Swift had also attended.A few weeks ago, the Super Bowl LIX champions, the Philadelphia Eagles, visited the White House, where President Donald Trump again made a few controversial comments on Taylor Swift.The billionaire pop star and Kansas City Chiefs’ Travis Kelce’s girlfriend, Taylor Swift, has maintained her silence and has not reacted to any of the controversial comments made by President Donald Trump.Taylor Swift was last spotted around a week ago when she was out on a date with Travis Kelce as the two celebrated Mother’s Day with their families. The pop star has also been pulled into Blake Lively’s legal drama with Justin Baldoni, but she has made no public statements about it and has maintained her silence.Also Read: “This could potentially destroy her career”: Taylor Swift is reportedly “overcome with anxiety” as she’s dragged back into the Justin Baldoni–Blake Lively legal drama",President donald trump made a derogatory post on truth social about taylor swift.
