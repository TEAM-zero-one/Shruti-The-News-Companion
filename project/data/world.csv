A precise response, not a war cry



The Pahalgam attack and its intent



A united Indian voice to the world



NEW DELHI: In a strong and clear message to global community, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday explained how India gave a firm but measured response after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack . Speaking at Indian Consulate in New York, Tharoor said India chose to ""hit hard and hit smart"", targeting only specific terrorist camps in Pakistan, without escalating the situation into a larger conflict.India launched its counterterror strikes on May 7 in Pakistan and PoK under Operation Sindoor , as a strong response to Pahalgam massacre.Tharoor is leading an all-party delegation visiting several countries in Americas to highlight India’s united stand against terrorism. Their first stop in New York was the 9/11 Memorial.Tharoor said it was an emotional moment, especially in light of the recent attack in Pahalgam.“It was obviously a very moving moment for us,” he said, “but it was also meant to send a strong message. We are here in a city which is bearing still the scars of that savage terrorist attack in the wake of yet another terrorist attack in our own country.”He added that the visit is about standing in solidarity and reminding the world that terrorism is a global threat that must be faced together.“We came both as a reminder that this is a shared problem, but also out of a spirit of solidarity with the victims... It’s a global problem, it’s a scourge and we must all fight it unitedly.”Though he is part of the Opposition, Tharoor supported the central government’s swift action after the Pahalgam attack.“I don’t work for the government, as you know. I work for an opposition party, but I myself authored an op-ed in one of India’s leading papers, within a couple of days saying that the time had come to hit hard and hit smart and I’m pleased to say that’s exactly what India did.”He explained that India struck nine known terror bases, including Lashkar-e-Taiba ’s base in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammad’s headquarters in Bahawalpur. These groups have long been linked to attacks on India and other countries.“India sent a clear message that it was not going to take terror lying down... by delivering very precisely, calculated, calibrated strikes... this was not meant to be the opening salvo in a protracted war but just an act of retribution.”Tharoor described the Pahalgam attack as a brutal and deliberate attempt to create communal tension in India.“It was a bunch of people going around identifying the religions of the people before them and killing them on that basis, which was clearly intended to provoke a backlash in the rest of India, since the victims were overwhelmingly Hindu.”But he praised the people of Jammu and Kashmir, from political leaders to ordinary citizens, for standing together in unity.“There was an extraordinary amount of togetherness cutting across religious and other divides that people have tried to provoke. The message is very clear that there was a malign intent... India, sadly, had no reason to doubt where it came from.”Tharoor also mentioned that a terror group called The Resistance Front (TRF), known to be linked to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, quickly claimed responsibility for the killings. Despite India presenting evidence to the United Nations in previous years, the group was still not officially condemned in recent UN statements - largely due to opposition from Pakistan and China.""Sadly Pakistan chose to follow its usual path of denial, in fact, Pakistan with the help of China succeeded in removing the reference to TRF from the press statement drafted in the Security Council of the UN two days later.”The all-party delegation includes MPs from different political backgrounds -- BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena, TDP, JMM, and LJP - along with former Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu. Their mission is to meet government officials, lawmakers, think tanks, media, and the public across countries.“Our idea is very much to speak to a cross section of public and political opinion... to enlarge your understanding of our thinking and our concern about what’s going on.”“We will be in every country, meeting members of the executive, meeting members of the legislature, meeting big tankers and influential foreign policy experts, and at the same time interacting with the media and public opinion.”",Congress mp shashi tharoor is leading an all-party delegation visiting several countries in americas to highlight india’s united stand against terrorism.

NEW DELHI: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( AIMIM ) MP Asaduddin Owaisi , participating in a high-level all-party delegation in Bahrain, strongly condemned the misuse of religion by terrorist groups to justify violence, saying that Islam unequivocally rejects terrorism ""These terrorist organisations have justified killings of innocent people in India and they have quoted Quranic verses out of context.

One Month Since Pahalgam Attack: How India Punished, Isolated Pakistan Since April 22 | Op Sindoor

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor outlined India’s firm but measured response to the Pahalgam terror attack on Saturday in New York. The MP is leading a multi-party delegation to five countries as part of India's global outreach against terrorism amid Operation Sindoor.While speaking at the Indian Consulate in New York, Tharoor said the attack was carried out by militants who identified victims by their religion before killing them, in what he called a clear attempt to provoke communal violence.“It was a bunch of people going around identifying the religions of the people before them and killing them on that basis, which was clearly intended to provoke a backlash in the rest of India, since the victims were overwhelmingly Hindu,” Tharoor said, adding, ""There was an extraordinary amount of togetherness cutting across religious and other divides in India that people have tried to provoke. The message is very clear that there was a malign intent. .. India, sadly, had no reason to doubt where it came from.""Tharoor emphasised that within an hour, the Resistance Front claimed responsibility. He reminded the audience that this group is linked to the proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba and had already been flagged to the UN in 2023 and 2024. “Sadly, Pakistan chose to follow its usual path of denial,” he said, noting that China supported the removal of the Resistance Front’s mention from the UN Security Council’s press statement.Describing India's response, Tharoor said, “The time had come to hit hard and hit smart and I’m pleased to say that’s exactly what India did.” He said strikes were carried out on nine known terror sites, including those linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur. “India sent a clear message that it was not going to take terror lying down,” he added.Tharoor stressed that the strikes were precise and limited in scope. “It was not meant to be the opening salvo in a protracted war but just an act of retribution,” he explained.Tharoor made it clear that while India responded firmly to terrorism, it does not seek escalation or armed conflict. He said India’s priorities lie elsewhere, focused on growth and development.“We are not interested in warfare with Pakistan. We would much rather be left alone to grow our economy and pull our people into the world they are getting ready for in the 21st century. But, the Pakistanis sadly, we might be a status quo power but they are not...they covet territory India controls, and they want to have it at any price. If they can't get it through conventional means, they are willing to get it through terrorism, and that is not acceptable. ..”Tharoor said the all-party delegation’s first stop was the 9/11 Memorial in New York, symbolising their solidarity with victims of terrorism worldwide.We came both as a reminder that this is a shared problem, but also out of a spirit of solidarity with the victims...

Amid Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigrants, the US Embassy in India has released a strong advisory warning Indian citizens that they could face a permanent ban on travelling to the US in future. ""If you remain in the United States beyond your authorized period of stay, you could be deported and could face a permanent ban on traveling to the United States in the future,"" the post read.This is applicable to Indians who are traveling to the US on their various time-bound visas like work visas, student visas, tourist visas etc which have their own authorized period of stay.Immigration is the most contentious issue of the Donald Trump administration with the president making his intent clear on the very first day in the office in his first executive order. He targeted the Citizensip Clause of the 14th Amendment that granted US citizenship to almost everyone born on American soil. While the executive order is now facing legal hurdles, the administration id deporiting illegal immigrants, arresting them, encouraging them to self-deport.All foreign nations staying the in the US for over 30 days are now required to register with the federal government -- in a new immigration rule change.Two deportation cases involving Indians became very high profile in the last few months.

Most of these cases are mild and under home care.”This comes a day after the Delhi government issued a Covid advisory, asking hospitals to ensure the availability of beds, oxygen, medicines, and vaccines.

In India, the majority of cases remain mild, with no deaths or ICU admissions linked to the latest rise in infections.Health experts have advised the public—particularly the elderly, pregnant women, and those with underlying health conditions—to resume basic precautions such as wearing masks in enclosed spaces and frequent handwashing.Doctors also recommend influenza vaccination to reduce the risk and severity of co-infections. Indian health authorities are closely monitoring a gradual increase in COVID-19 cases across several states, as regions in Asia—including Hong Kong and Singapore—report a resurgence of infections.Although nationwide case numbers remain low compared to earlier waves, cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, and Ahmedabad have reported a noticeable rise.

Pak Blocks Indigo Aircraft; Refuses Help Despite Emergency, India Fumes Over 'Inhumanity'

NEW DELHI: When IndiGo's Delhi-Srinagar flight of May 21 flew into severe turbulence and a hailstorm near Pathankot, they first tried to steer clear of the bad weather but were not allowed to do so by Lahore ATC.

They flew the aircraft manually (without autopilot) till they exited the hailstorm and declared an urgency situation. The aircraft touched down at Srinagar with everyone safe.

Noting a ""tough life"" for Short Service Commission (SSC) officers, the bench in ""layman's suggestion"" said its ""uncertainty may not be good for the armed forces.""A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh issued notice to the Centre and the IAF on Thursday, seeking their response on Pandey’s plea, news agency PTI reported. She claimed that although she ranked second in the country among expert fighter controllers and had served over 13.5 years, she was being discharged due to a 2019 policy change that denied her a permanent commission.“Our Air Force is one of the best organisations in the world. Officers are very commendable. The quality of coordination they have exhibited - I think it's unparalleled. Therefore, we always salute them. They are a big asset for the nation. They are the nation, in a way. Because of them, we are able to sleep at night,” Justice Kant said.The bench expressed concern over the uncertainty faced by SSC officers, stating that a long tenure without permanent commission needed to be addressed.“That sense of uncertainty may not be good for the armed forces. It's a layman's suggestion, because we are not experts. On minimum benchmarks, there can't be a compromise,” Justice Kant added.Representing Pandey, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy argued that her client was an expert fighter controller, who had played a key role in the Integrated Air Command and Control Systems (IACCS) deployed during Operations Sindoor and Balakot.Pandey’s case, Guruswamy said, was affected by policy shifts that gave her just a month’s notice to end her career despite her stellar service record.Appearing for the government and the IAF, additional solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati said that the officer had been found unfit by the selection board and had approached the apex court directly without first filing a representation. She also confirmed that a second selection board would now review Pandey’s case.Bhati, herself from a military background, acknowledged the difficult position of SSC officers but explained, “There are a limited number of posts. It's a very steep pyramid structure.”She noted that typically, 90–95 per cent of officers considered for permanent commission are found fit, but only a few miss out due to comparative merit.Justice Kant responded, urging a more accommodating approach, “You can have a policy of taking that many SCC officers who can be accommodated in the Permanent Commission, if they are found suitable. If you have 100 SCC officers, you should have the capacity to take 100 of them to the permanent commission.”He also emphasised that women officers have performed exceedingly well and highlighted the need for systemic capacity to retain them.The court directed that Wing Commander Pandey must not be released from service until further orders and posted the matter for hearing on August 6.However, the bench clarified that no equity would be created in the officer’s favour at this stage and that all contentions remain open.","Wing commander nikita pandey alleged discrimination in being denied permanent commission.
