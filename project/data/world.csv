Here's what Tharoor had said





NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor's recent praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ruffled some feathers in the Congress as fellow party leaders have questioned the move. Demanding an explanation for his praise, Tharoor's colleague Sandeep Dikshit went on to ask ""why are you in Congress"" and even termed him a ""hypocrite"".""Shashi Tharoor's problem is that I don't think he knows a lot about the country... If, according to you, someone is doing good for the country by going against the Congress's policies, then you should follow those policies... Why are you in Congress? Is it only because you are an MP?"" Dikshit said.""If you really feel that the BJP or PM Modi's strategies are working better than the party you are in, then you should give an explanation. If you are not giving one, you are a hypocrite,"" he added.Congress leader Supriya Shrinate had echoed similar sentiments as she said that she ""didn't find anything in the speech (of PM Modi) worth appreciating"" and she didn't ""know how he (Shashi Tharoor) found one"".""I didn't find anything in the speech (of PM Modi) worth appreciating. I think PM must answer a lot of things. He was at an event of a newspaper.

So, I didn't see any reason to appreciate him,"" she said.""I don't know how he (Shashi Tharoor) found one...I found it to be a petty speech. He criticised Congress there too. PM thinks of Congress day and night. This is amazing,"" she added.Earlier this week, Tharoor shared his experience of attending a PM Modi lecture. In a post on X, he wrote a short critical analysis of what his opinion was regarding the prime minister's speech.However, he did go on to praise the PM's address saying that it ""served as both an economic outlook and a cultural call to action, urging the nation to be restless for progress.""""The PM emphasized that India is no longer just an 'emerging market' but an 'emerging model' for the world, noting its economic resilience.

"'Unconstitutional': SC strikes down Tribunal Act, slams govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unconstitutional-sc-strikes-down-tribunal-act-slams-govt/articleshow/125447657.cms,"SC: Parl's discretion broad, not absolute

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court struck down Wednesday the Tribunal Reforms Act as unconstitutional and slammed the central govt for its repeated attempts to override SC's consistent rulings to shield the judicial independence of tribunals, which decide disputes in a gamut of regimes - taxation, environment, electricity, telecom and real estate.Days before his retirement, a CJI B R Gavai-led bench deprecated the Centre's repeated attempts to tinker with the qualifications, tenure and service conditions for chairpersons and members of the tribunals and took umbrage that within weeks of SC striking down the Tribunal Reforms Ordinance in July 2021, the govt tabled a bill in Parliament to enact the law whose provisions were identical to that of the ordinance.Censuring the govt for ""consciously attempting to annul the rulings"" by enacting a law that had ""cosmetically changed a few provisions"" of the annulled law, the bench of CJI Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said, ""The Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021 is a replica of the struck-down ordinance; old wine in a new bottle, the wine whets not the judicial palate, but the bottle merely dazzles.""The verdict means that, pending the enactment of a new law, the service conditions of tribunal presidents and members would be governed by their parent Acts.For example, ITAT Act would govern service conditions of ITAT president and members.Writing the judgment, CJI Gavai said, ""The provisions of the impugned Act cannot be sustained. They violate the constitutional principles of separation of powers and judicial independence.""The Supreme Court said the Act directly contradicts binding judicial pronouncements that have repeatedly clarified the standards governing the appointment, tenure and functioning of tribunal members. The bench said that the Act, which intended to usher in uniformity in tenure and service conditions of all tribunal members, undermined the constitutional requirements of independence and impartiality of tribunals by enabling the executive to exercise control over them.The Supreme Court said, ""Where Parliament reenacts provisions previously struck down without curing the underlying defect, the resulting legislation remains vulnerable to invalidation, not because the Court is imposing its own policy, but because the Constitution itself demands adherence to these structural safeguards.""""The Indian constitutional framework does not subscribe to parliamentary sovereignty, nor does it vest unqualified supremacy in the judiciary.""The architecture of our Constitution is firmly rooted in the principle of constitutional supremacy.""It said that when SC interprets the Constitution and pronounces upon the validity of a law, that pronouncement becomes the authoritative and binding declaration of the law.""Once the court has struck down a provision or issued binding directions after identifying a constitutional defect, Parliament cannot simply override or contradict that judicial decision by re-enacting the very same measure in a different form,"" CJI Gavai said.Supreme Court said Parliament's discretion is broad but not absolute.","Supreme court said parliament's discretion is broad but not absolute.

HYDERABAD: The bus accident early on Monday in Saudi Arabia left 45 people dead, with only one passenger - Shoeb - surviving the crash.""I spoke to Shoeb.

Announcing ex gratia of ₹5 lakh each to the kin of those who died, the govt said it would help arrange the funerals of the deceased in Saudi Arabia in accordance with religious traditions.

NEW DELHI: A group of 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter accusing leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and the Congress of trying to erode public faith in the Election Commission and other constitutional institutions.The letter, titled ""Assault on National Constitutional Authorities,"" alleged that opposition leaders were attempting to manufacture a sense of institutional breakdown through what it described as “venomous rhetoric” and “provocative but unsubstantiated accusations.”The letter said: “Some political leaders, instead of offering genuine policy alternative, resort to provocative but unsubstantiated accusations in their theatrical political strategy. After their attempts to tarnish the Indian Armed Forces by questioning their valour and accomplishments, and the Judiciary by questioning its fairness, Parliament, and its constitutional functionaries, now it is the turn of Election Commission of India to face systematic and conspiratorial attacks on its integrity and reputation.”The signatories singled out Rahul Gandhi for repeatedly alleging vote theft while, they said, failing to file a formal complaint or sworn affidavit to back his claims. They pointed to his assertions that he had “100 per cent proof” and an “atom bomb” against the Commission, alongside accusations of “treason,” and argued that such remarks came “without the prescribed sworn affidavit” required for accountability.The letter also noted that similar accusations had been amplified by Congress leaders, opposition parties and allied NGOs, including claims that the Election Commission had acted like the “B-team of the BJP.” It argued these assertions collapsed under scrutiny, pointing to the ECI’s public release of its methodology and verification done under court oversight.It said, “Moreover, several senior figures of Congress and other political parties, leftist NGOs, ideologically opinionated scholars, and a few attention seekers in other walks of life, have joined in with similarly blistering rhetoric against SIR, even declaring that the Commission has descended into complete shamelessness by acting like the ‘B-team of the BJP.’ Such fiery rhetoric may be emotionally powerful but it collapses under scrutiny, because the ECI has publicly shared its SIR methodology, overseen verification by court-sanctioned means, removed ineligible names in a compliant manner, and added new eligible voters. ”The signatories described this pattern of criticism as “impotent rage,” stating that leaders who faced electoral setbacks “lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility.”The letter said, “This pattern of behaviour reflects what might be called ‘impotent rage’ deep anger born of repeated electoral failure and frustration, without a concrete plan to reconnect with the people. When political leaders lose touch with the aspirations of ordinary citizens, they lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility. Theatrics replace analysis. Public spectacle takes the place of public service. ”Invoking the legacy of former chief election commissioners TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, the letter said, “Today, thinking of ECI, the country also remembers the likes of TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, whose unyielding leadership transformed the Election Commission into a formidable constitutional sentinel. They did not court popularity. They did not chase headlines. They enforced the rules fearlessly, impartially, relentlessly. ”Calling for transparency, legal accountability and respectful political conduct, the letter concluded by saying, “We call upon the Election Commission to continue its path of transparency and rigour. Publish complete data, defend itself through legal channels when necessary, and reject politics dressed up as victimhood. We call upon political leaders to respect the constitutional process, to compete not through baseless accusation but through policy articulation, and to accept democratic verdicts with grace. ”","272 eminent citizens accuse rahul gandhi and congress of trying to erode public faith in constitutional institutions.

PM Modi's BIG OUTREACH To India's Farmers, Launches Agri Schemes Worth ₹35,000 Crore Before Diwali

NEW DELHI: Civil society organisations and farmer groups on Tuesday expressed their concerns over the proposed amendments to the international plant genetic resources treaty, saying the changes would lead to the opening up of almost all of India’s genetic resources related to agriculture and food to seed companies of developed countries.They jointly wrote to Union ministers Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Bhupender Yadav, flagging that the move at the upcoming global forum in Peru would in effect dismantle India’s ability to determine how, when and by whom its agricultural genetic resources are accessed.The issues, including the proposed amendment, is scheduled to be discussed at the upcoming 11th session of the governing body of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) in Lima, Peru, during Nov 24-29.The organisations, led by Asha (Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture) Kisan Swaraj, demanded that the govt appoint a well experienced multilateral negotiator to attend negotiations in Lima, who can protect the nation’s interests, especially the interests of the custodians of plant genetic resources, the country’s farmers.In their letter to the ministers, the civil society groups said, ""The draft package, if adopted, will force India to share the genetic wealth with the Global North (developed countries) where the big agribusiness, big tech, multinational seed companies, biotech industry, major gene banks, and research organizations are located, but without accountability and transparency measures in place.""As these actors would be able to access all the Indian Plant Germplasm from national collections, international gene banks, and CGIAR institutions without informing the national authorities of the provider countries, and they will have to just sign a precarious Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA) adopted by the GB of the Plant Treaty.""Their letter came days after a group of scientists wrote a similar letter to Chouhan. The scientists raised objections over a proposed move to tweak provisions of benefit sharing on use of genetic resources. The scientists flagged that the current proposals to “enhance” the treaty's multilateral system are fundamentally unjust and pose an immediate, existential threat to India’s sovereign rights over its vast genetic wealth and the fundamental rights of its farmers.Genetic resources are currently shared under law for research and advancements in medicine and agriculture. It is largely believed that the full access to such resources, instead of a negotiated access, could significantly compromise the nation’s sovereign rights over its own genetic resources and override domestic legislation, like India’s Biodiversity Act.","Civil society organisations and farmer groups expressed their concerns over the proposed amendments to the international plant genetic resources treaty.

Candace Owens Makes Shocking Egyptian Planes Claim In Charlie Kirk Case

Candace Owens says flight signals, rental cars, and timing raise new questions

Operation Mocking-Plane: The Charlie Kirk Plot Thickens. | Candace Ep 266





Candace Owens says she has many serious questions about the killing of Charlie Kirk. She talked about this again in her podcast on November 17. She said she found new details that made her even more worried. Candace Owens said two Egyptian planes showed up many times near Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s wife. She said these planes showed up at places where Erika Kirk was 73 times from 2022 to September 2025. She said she found these numbers after checking the work of a woman online, whom she called a “pregnant mommy sleuth.”She said the woman was right. Candace Owens said 29 of those overlaps also had Charlie Kirk in the same place. She said both planes were also at the Provo airport on September 10, the day Charlie Kirk was shot near Utah Valley University. She said one plane took off, and the other stayed on the ground with its power on.Candace Owens said the two planes were the yellow SU-BTT and the blue SU-BND. She said these flights mostly matched Erika Kirk’s movements inside five U.S. states but also matched her travel overseas. She said one plane at the Provo airport sent out a signal from 9:05 a.m.until 10:34 a.m. on September 10. She said its signal turned on again 17 minutes after Charlie Kirk was shot at 12:40 p.m., and stayed on until 1:29 p.m.Candace Owens said she believed this signal came from data on ADS-B Exchange. She also said the flight was “transponding” at Duncan Aviation. She said she saw claims online from MJTruthUltra that Duncan Aviation gave rental cars to people linked to the Egyptian planes. She even read out the car details and asked if anyone had seen them.Candace Owens said the plane could have been doing normal maintenance. She also said the plane might have tools to make private satellite calls. She said these ideas were only her guesses.Also Read: Candace Owens sparks chaos with new Britney Spears trafficking claim as Lou Taylor link trends after Kim Kardashian video Candace Owens said Turning Point USA knew about these flights and should explain why the planes were there.

Gisele Bündchen's shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that the marriage was “like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was, “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before, “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.”Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Gisele Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it, “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are..”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams..”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Gisele Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining when a chapter ends, a new one begins..Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?","Supermodel gisele bündchen, in an old candid interview, shared insights into her marriage with tom brady, describing their split as a 'death and rebirth' she detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125033119,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60856,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Taylor Swift Reveals Favorite Track, Talks Travis Kelce And New Album “The Life Of A Showgirl”

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift’s latest track, “The Fate of Ophelia,” is sparking a fresh wave of online theories and Swifties are convinced she’s weaving real-life heartbreak into a Shakespeare-inspired narrative. The song, featured on The Life of a Showgirl, flips the tragic Ophelia storyline into one of revival, and fans immediately tie the imagery to Taylor’s emotional journey after her six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn.With lyrics that feel pointed, timing that feels deliberate, and symbolism that leans heavily into themes of rescue, rebirth, and choosing a new path, this track has become the latest cultural flashpoint as listeners dissect what Taylor may be saying between the lines.Swifties didn’t waste time pulling receipts. The lyric “dug me out of my grave” is being hailed as a symbolic nod to Travis, the man fans believe helped lift Taylor from the emotional stagnation she experienced during her long romance with Joe. And the shade? It’s there in sharpened form.When Taylor Swift sings, “All that time, I sat alone in my tower / You were just honing your powers,” listeners immediately connected it to Joe’s famously private lifestyle and his recent role in a new Hamlet film.The overlap between Ophelia, Hamlet, and Taylor’s real-life history is simply too on-the-nose for fans to ignore.What makes the moment hit even harder is how openly Swift seems to be reclaiming her narrative. Rather than turning her breakup into bitterness, she’s framing it as the final chapter of a darker era, one that allowed her to rise stronger and choose a love that fits her world rather than hides from it. Joe Alwyn, for his part, has subtly signaled he’s over the conversation, reportedly saying he’s moved on and suggesting fans do the same. But Swifties aren’t budging it.For Swift, this track feels like a mic-drop: a poetic goodbye to the past, a wink at the present, and a reminder that she’ll always turn heartbreak into art, even if some people would prefer not to be name-checked in her mythology..","Taylor swift's new song, 'the fate of ophelia,' is fueling fan theories linking it to her breakup with joe alwyn.

Candace Owens explains the roles of Tyler Robinson and Lance Twiggs





Candace Owens claims the story about the day Charlie Kirk was shot does not make sense to her. She shared her thoughts during Myron Gaines’ livestream, which was uploaded to YouTube on November 18, 2025. Owens said she has been looking into the case on her own, and from what she has seen, the clips and details shown to the public feel incomplete. She pointed out that the public has not seen the exact moment when the shot was fired, and only a short clip of a person running after the shooting was released.Owens also said that Tyler Robinson, the man accused of shooting Charlie Kirk, may not have played the role many people think. She claimed that his fingerprints were found on the gun but said they were not the only fingerprints present. She also said another person named Lance Twiggs might have had a bigger role that day. Candace Owens stressed that these are her claims based on what she has seen so far.During the livestream, Candace Owens explained what she believed happened on the day Charlie Kirk was shot. She said she thinks the whole situation looked like a planned setup with many people involved, not just one person acting alone.Myron Gaines asked her why she thought the story felt wrong, and she said there were gaps that did not add up.Owens said that in her view, Tyler Robinson’s only real link to the case was that his fingerprints were found on the gun. She said his prints were not the only prints and claimed that this detail was not openly talked about.She also said that she does not believe Robinson stepped onto the campus that day. According to her, his “job” was only to pick up clothes and drop them near a Dairy Queen and then near a cemetery.She then discussed Lance Twiggs, who she said was the partner of the accused shooter. Owens claimed Twiggs was “much more involved.” She said she did not think he fired the shot, but she believed he had a deeper part in the plan.Candace Owens also pointed to a TMZ video from September 13. The video showed a person walking toward Utah Valley University hours before the shooting. The person wore a maroon shirt, black cap, light shorts, and sneakers. Owens said this person was not Robinson but Lance Twiggs. She said the body in the video did not match Robinson and used this to support her claim that different people had different roles.Candace Owens said these details made her believe the shooting used patsies who were each given small tasks so the plan looked bigger and more confusing.Also Read: Candace Owens Brings Attention To YouTuber Claim Of TPUSA Financial Delay Before Charlie Kirk Shooting","Candace owens claims the story about the day charlie kirk was shot does not make sense to her.

Shedeur Sanders' house was robbed while he played his first NFL snaps



Shedeur Sanders’ first regular season appearance in the NFL became unforgettable for reasons far beyond football. While he stepped onto the field for the Cleveland Browns and took over in the second half against the Baltimore Ravens, three masked suspects slipped into his Medina County home. Police confirmed that the intruders stole close to two hundred thousand dollars in property during the short window Sanders was at the stadium. The crime added a jarring twist to a milestone day for the rookie quarterback.Officials said the burglary began at 6:46 p.m., a time that lined up with the early moments of the Browns’ 23 to 16 loss. Sanders’ debut came after Dillon Gabriel entered concussion protocol at halftime. Sanders finished 4 of 16 for 47 yards with an interception and two sacks. Hours later, he learned his home had been targeted.The Medina County Sheriff’s Office released a detailed statement on Tuesday that described how the break-in unfolded. The department said, ""On November 16, 2025, at approximately 6:46 pm three suspects entered the residence of Cleveland Browns football player Shedeur Sanders. Surveillance cameras in the residence were able to capture video footage of the suspects as they entered and exited different portions of the home.The suspects were wearing masks and gloves and can be seen exiting the residence at approximately 6:58 pm with various property belonging to Mr. Sanders. It is estimated that approximately $200,000 in property was stolen. The Medina County Sheriff's Office is currently investigating the incident.""Investigators added that the burglary lasted only twelve minutes. No arrests have been made, but the sheriff’s office is urging anyone with information to contact Captain Eric Bors. The footage has become a key part of the active investigation.Sanders, 23, is now one of several athletes targeted in what law enforcement believes may be a wider pattern. Recent break-ins involving Joe Burrow, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Bobby Portis Jr. and Mike Conley appear connected to a burglary ring under FBI review. Officials have warned athletes to avoid sharing their locations online, since many crimes happened when players were known to be away.In Sanders’ case, the incident happened during a home game, making the crime even bolder. Despite the shock, he is expected to start for Cleveland in Week 12 against the Raiders.Also Read: Drake Maye challenges Cam Newton’s claim that Patriots’ surprising 2025 campaign is just ‘fool’s gold’","Shedeur sanders' house was robbed while he played his first nfl snaps.

Dana White’s long-term plan surfaces with UFC 324’s first official fight



Paramount Plus deal reshapes expectations for Dana White’s 2026 rollout



The UFC’s shift into its Paramount Plus era has taken a clearer shape after months of speculation about the promotion’s 2026 schedule. With only a handful of events left on the ESPN contract, fans had been left guessing about how Dana White would open the new broadcast partnership.Now that picture has sharpened. UFC 324, set for January 24 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, will launch the new era with a confirmed light heavyweight matchup and the promise of a major card built for a global streaming audience.The announcement comes at a time when the organization is preparing for a massive transition. With Paramount’s $7.7 billion deal set to redefine how the UFC delivers its pay-per-views and international programming, even a single fight reveal draws attention.The first confirmed bout of 2026 will reportedly see Modestas Bukauskas take on Nikita Krylov in a matchup that sets an early tone for the Paramount era (per MMA Fighting). Bukauskas has rebuilt his career since returning to the promotion in 2023, stacking four consecutive wins and delivering highlight finishes. That run includes the knockout of Paul Craig in Paris that effectively ended Craig’s career. A victory in January would push Bukauskas into the light heavyweight top 15 and solidify his resurgence.Krylov arrives in a far more urgent place. The veteran has dropped two straight, suffering back-to-back knockout losses to Bogdan Guskov and Dominick Reyes. His experience and durability have long made him a tough assignment, but he enters UFC 324 needing to stop the slide. The matchup gives both fighters something significant to fight for as the new broadcast deal begins to take shape.White confirmed earlier this year that every UFC event beginning in 2026 will stream on Paramount Plus, with select cards appearing on CBS. The partnership has already expanded to include Latin America and Australia, creating a worldwide launch moment in January. That has raised expectations for UFC 324.Matchmaking for the card has only just begun. When asked whether lightweight champion Ilia Topuria could appear on the first Paramount card, White left the door open, saying, “We literally — today, matchmaking was today,” before adding, “It’s a possibility.”Also Read: Netflix scramble revealed as Jake Paul weighed three unexpected replacement fighters leaked by top boxing insider",Ufc 324 is set for january 24 at t-mobile arena in las vegas.
