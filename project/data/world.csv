"India, US ink new defence framework for 10 years; aim to deepen cooperation in all domains",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-us-ink-new-defence-framework-for-10-years-aim-to-deepen-cooperation-in-all-domains/articleshow/125007676.cms,"Rajnath Singh, Pete Hegseth Sign 10-Year India-US Defence Pact To Strengthen Indo-Pacific Security

Defence to remain major pillar of relations with US: Rajnath





India and the US inked on Friday an expansive new defence framework to strengthen their strategic partnership over the next 10 years. This comes amid indications that a trade deal is also in the works to douse the raging tariff tensions between the two countries.The 'Framework for the US-India Major Defence Partnership', inked during a meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his American counterpart Pete Hegseth on the sidelines of the Asean meet in Kuala Lumpur, supplants and builds on the one inked in June 2015.The 2025 framework aims to further transform the defence partnership by providing ""a unified vision and policy direction"" to deepen cooperation in all domains, including defence-industrial collaboration, military interoperability across land, air, sea, space and cyberspace, as well as maritime domain awareness, over the next 10 years.Officials told TOI that the intent is to ""recalibrate"" the partnership in line with ""a renewed consensus to effectively address the emerging security challenges and priorities in the region, including imperatives for deterrence, stability and safeguarding a free and open Indo-Pacific"".Defence and military cooperation over the last two decades has been the cornerstone of the overall bilateral ties, which have taken a major hit since President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on New Delhi earlier this year and due to his continuing insistence that he had brokered the ceasefire between India and Pakistan by leveraging trade deals.The upward trajectory of the defence ties, however, was evident at the Singh-Hegseth meeting. ""The framework will usher in a new era in our already strong defence partnership. It is a signal of our growing strategic convergence and will herald a new decade of partnership. Defence will remain the major pillar of our bilateral relations,"" Singh said.Hegseth, in turn, said, ""The framework advances our defence partnership, a cornerstone for regional stability and deterrence. We're enhancing our coordination, information-sharing and tech cooperation. Our defence ties have never been stronger.""India, of course, remains concerned about the signalling by the Trump administration that its Indo-Pacific strategy to counter an aggressive China is no longer a top priority, even as de-escalation in the US-China trade war took place on Thursday.Both Singh and Hegseth, however, reiterated their commitment to a free, open and rules-bound Indo-Pacific at the meeting. While Singh said the bilateral partnership was ""critical"" to ensure the region remains free from coercion, Hegseth said the US was committed to working closely with India to ensure the same.At a separate meeting with Chinese defence minister Admiral Dong Jun, Hegseth stressed the importance of ""maintaining a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific"" while voicing concerns about China's activities in the South China Sea, around Taiwan, and vis-a-vis allies and partners of the US in the Indo-Pacific. ""US does not seek conflict. It will continue to stoutly defend its interests and ensure it has the capabilities in the region to do so,"" he posted on X.The US, of course, is eyeing more lucrative Indian defence deals, having bagged contracts worth over $25 billion since just 2007. India, for instance, is slated to receive 31 armed MQ-9B Predator high-altitude long-endurance drones, ordered from the US for $3.8 billion in Oct last year, in the 2029-30 timeframe. India is also set to order another 113 GE-F404 turbofan jet engines from US firm General Electric for $1 billion to power the indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters. The delivery of 99 such engines, ordered in Aug 2021 by Hindustan Aeronautics for $716 million, recently began after a two-year delay.","Rajnath singh, pete hegseth sign 10-year india-us defence pact to strengthen indo-pacific security.

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday called for a ban on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), linking it to what he described as widespread law and order problems in the country. “It is my personal opinion, it should be done,” Kharge said when asked whether the RSS should be banned, adding that “most of the issues and law and order problems are arising because of the BJP-RSS. ”Referring to the Congress’ role in India’s freedom struggle, Kharge said, “People today comment on a party whose members sacrificed their lives for the country. But if we say something about the RSS, we are directly attacked.” Citing Sardar Patel’s letter to Syama Prasad Mookerjee dated 4 February 1948, he added, “The way the RSS expressed joy over Mahatma Gandhi’s death had worsened the situation, leaving the government with no choice but to act against it. Reports confirmed that the activities of the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha created an atmosphere that led to Gandhi’s assassination.”Speaking at a press conference in Delhi, Kharge accused the Modi government of rewriting history and distorting the legacy of national icons. “On 9th July 2024, the Modi government lifted the 58-year-old ban on government employees participating in RSS activities. We demand that this lifting be set aside.The organisation was banned by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,” he said.Kharge criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for what he described as attempts to distort history.“Recently, references to Mahatma Gandhi, Godse, the RSS, and the 2002 Gujarat riots have been removed from NCERT books. Erasing the truth from textbooks is not right—it reveals their intentions. They always try to turn lies into truth. Our Prime Minister is an expert in this, and his followers are walking the same path. Sardar Patel had banned the RSS to protect secularism,” he said.Responding to PM Modi’s remarks on Sardar Patel’s role in uniting Kashmir, Kharge said the Prime Minister was trying to create a false divide between Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru. “They always tried to portray a rift between Nehru and Patel when they had great ties and both had praised each other,” Kharge said, adding that Patel had called Nehru “an ideal for the country.”","Congress president mallikarjun kharge calls for a ban on the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh.

NEW DELHI: India backed Afghanistan's announcement that it will build a dam on the Kunar river, saying it stands ready to support Afghanistan in sustainable water management, including on hydroelectric projects. Amidst Afghanistan-Pakistan tensions, the govt also reiterated its position that it is fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.On the dam issue, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said there's a history of cooperation between India and Afghanistan on such issues, including the Salma Dam in Herat province.Afghanistan last week announced plans to begin construction of a dam on the Kunar river that flows into Pakistan's northwestern region, raising concerns in Islamabad about likely restriction on the flow of water into the country.

Pakistan seems to think that it has the right to practice cross-border terrorism with impunity.Its neighbors find it unacceptable.

They don’t have any locus standi to speak on matters which are internal to India,” said the MEA spokesperson.The OIC general secretariat had released a statement Monday in which it reiterated “full solidarity with the people of J&K in their legitimate quest for the right to self-determination”.Amidst India’s strained relationship with Turkiye, MEA S Jaishankar reiterated New Delhi’s “unwavering” support for the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Republic of Cyprus, which does not have diplomatic ties with Ankara, in line with relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. In a meeting with his visiting counterpart Constantinos Kombos, the minister also appreciated Cyprus’s consistent support on issues of core interest to India, especially in the battle against cross-border terrorism and India’s bid to become a permanent member of the security council.","Afghanistan last week announced plans to begin construction of a dam on the kunar river that flows into pakistan's northwestern region.

Offset throws direct shade at Cardi B and Stefon Diggs in “No Sweat” from Haunted by Fame

Cardi B steps forward with Stefon Diggs amid the chaos

Offset turned Halloween into more than just a night of tricks and treats — it became a full-blown lyrical ambush. The rapper shocked fans by dropping his surprise album Haunted by Fame on October 31, and one track in particular, “No Sweat,” instantly lit up the internet. The song’s aggressive tone and pointed lyrics seemed aimed straight at his estranged wife, Cardi B, and her boyfriend, NFL wide receiver Stefon Diggs.This latest release feels like Offset’s most personal outburst since the couple’s public split. Known for turning pain into performance, the former Migos star poured raw emotion into every bar. Yet, one explosive line stood out from the rest — a brutal basketball-themed metaphor that fans quickly decoded as a direct jab at Cardi’s new relationship.On “No Sweat,” Offset delivers a verse that left no room for guessing: “How the f* you leave Jordan for Rodman? / You a fool if you think that I’m hurt.” The reference to NBA legends Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman instantly caught attention, with fans interpreting Offset as the “Jordan” in the comparison — disciplined, accomplished, and steady — and Diggs as “Rodman,” wild and unpredictable. The lyric set social media ablaze within hours, with thousands of fans dissecting its meaning and debating its intent.Offset didn’t stop there. He followed up with another sting: “You ain’t happy, I know how it work / How you married and still givin’ birth? / Get some help, bitch, you goin’ berserk.” The timing of these lines raised eyebrows, coming months after Cardi filed for divorce in July 2024. She later accused Offset of dragging out the process, claiming he demanded she cover his tax debts before finalizing the split.While Offset aired his frustrations through music, Cardi B appeared unbothered. The Grammy winner confirmed she’s expecting her fourth child — her first with Stefon Diggs — and made it clear she’s moved on. She shares three children with Offset: Kulture, 7, Wave, 4, and Blossom, 13 months.Offset’s Haunted by Fame proves that their story is far from over. The music may change, but the emotions behind it keep fueling hip-hop’s most headline-grabbing feud.Also Read: Brotherhood over Rivalry: Jordan Love and Aaron Rodgers’ post-game exchange steals spotlight after Packers beat Steelers","Cardi b and offset split in july 2024.

Buckingham Palace Hit By Epstein Storm: UK Royals Clash Over; King Charles Strips Andrew

What happened

What is next for Andrew





King Charles III, on Thursday, has stripped his brother Andrew of his ‘prince’ title and has ordered him to vacate his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge.The move follows weeks of mounting pressure and public scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said, as cited by AP. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”The announcement came amid mounting outrage after Virginia Giuffre, a key accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, reiterated her sexual assault allegations against Prince Andrew, claims that he continues to deny.The claims were detailed in her posthumously published memoir, where she recounts how Epstein allegedly trafficked her to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including twice when she was just 17.Andrew, 65, has consistently denied Giuffre’s allegations but withdrew from royal duties following a widely criticised BBC interview in November 2019, where he sought to defend himself against her claims.Also read: A look at Prince Andrew's former roles and crown perks he’s losing In 2022, he reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement after Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against him in New York. Though Andrew made no admission of guilt, he expressed regret for Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.In a 2019 BBC interview, Andrew said he had known British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of media tycoon and former MP Robert Maxwell, since her university days.It was Maxwell who introduced him to her then-partner, Jeffrey Epstein, in 1999. The three maintained a close friendship, even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.Andrew is also alleged to have personally invited Epstein and Maxwell to Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish estate, that same year, as cited by The Independent.In June this year, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a New York court for her role in recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.In a separate development, reports this week also revealed that Prince Andrew had hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge during his daughter Beatrice’s birthday celebrations in 2006, just two months after a US arrest warrant was issued for Epstein over the sexual assault of a minor, as cited by the BBC.Andrew is expected to relocate to a property on the King’s private Sandringham estate in Norfolk, with the move to be privately funded by King Charles.His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also vacate Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements.Formal notice to surrender the lease at Royal Lodge was issued on Thursday, and Andrew’s move to Sandringham is expected to take place “as soon as practicable.” He will receive a private allowance from the King, while any additional income will be his own responsibility, as reported by The Guardian.Also read: King Charles boots Prince Andrew out of Windsor home, strips all titles over Epstein links Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will keep their royal titles, and he remains eighth in line to the throne.It marks the most dramatic royal exit since 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. The couple were granted the titles Duke and Duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in exile.In contrast, Prince Harry, despite stepping back from royal duties, moving to California, and his ongoing rift with the family, still retains his title as Prince and Duke of Sussex.","King charles iii strips prince andrew of his 'prince' title and orders him to vacate his windsor residence, royal lodge.

JD Vance-Usha Vance rumors







Vice President JD Vance came under a lot of fire Thursday after he sided with Christianity and expressed his wish that his Hindu wife Usha Vance who, according to JD is not a very religious person, embrace Christianity. JD Vance converted to Catholicism in August 2019, long after JD Vance's marriage to Usha Vance.It was a major MAGA implosion moment as social media users started 'shipping' JD Vance with Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk -- politically and also romantically.A few weeks ago, MAGA commentators floated the idea of a Vance-Kirk ticket for 2028 -- JD Vance being the presidential candidate and Erika Kirk, the VP candidate. JD Vance is currently the top choice for the 2028 presidential candidate, apart from Marco Rubio. But in the past few weeks, support for Vance-Kirk grew louder for Vance-Rubio. But after Vance addressed the Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi, the chatter took a different turn and many MAGA supporters insinuated that JD Vance will divorce Usha Vance and will remarry Erika Kirk before his 2028 run because they argued that JD Vance knows America will not accept a 'Hindu First Lady'.The photo of Erika Kirk and JD Vance hugging invited criticism for Erika Kirk as well as she was accused of cosying up with JD Vance on the stage.Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently made some comments about JD Vance and his relationship with Usha Vance saying that Usha is scared of him. ""I think the little Manchurian candidate, JD Vance, wants to be president more than anything else,"" Psaki said. ""I always wonder what's going on in the mind of his wife. Like, are you OK? Please blink four times. We'll come over here. We'll save you,"" Jen Psaki said.""And that he's willing to do anything to get there. And your whole iteration you just outlined, I mean, he's scarier in certain ways in some ways. And he's young and ambitious and agile in the sense that he's a chameleon who makes himself whatever he thinks the audience wants to hear from him,"" Psaki said.JD Vance said the comments are disgraceful, but the Second Lady can speak for herself. ""I am very lucky to have a wonderful wife. I hope that my wife feels the same about me. We will keep on serving the country together,"" JD Vance recently said when he was in Israel with his wife.","Jd vance converted to catholicism in august 2019, long after jd vance's marriage to usha vance.

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold



Also Read |





For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The asian arowana (scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

British racing world unites in grief over Tommie Jakes’ tragic death

The racing world is heartbroken after 19-year-old jockey Tommie Jakes was found dead at his home near Newmarket on October 30, 2025, just hours after his last race. Tommie was seen as one of the brightest young stars in horse racing and rode for top trainer George Boughey. He got his first win at age 16 and had become a well-known face in the weighing room.The Injured Jockeys Fund (IJF) and the Professional Jockeys Association (PJA) shared in a joint statement: “It is with deep sadness that we report the death of licensed apprentice jockey Tommie Jakes, 19, who tragically died at home this morning near Newmarket.”Tommie Jakes’ career began early and shined fast. He won his first race in March 2023 at Lingfield when he was only 16, riding Suzi’s Connoisseur for trainer Jane Chapple-Hyam. Since then, he had 59 wins from more than 500 rides, including 19 victories this year alone, according to Sky Sports. His hard work and cheerful spirit made him a favorite among his peers.George Boughey, his trainer, described Tommie Jakes as “a wonderful young man, talented, funny, and respected by everyone in the yard.” The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) Acting CEO Brant Dunshea said, “We are devastated. Tommie was a gifted young rider with the world ahead of him.”His final ride came at Nottingham, where he finished seventh on a 125-1 long shot, only hours before his sudden passing.Tributes flooded social media as jockeys, trainers, and fans shared their shock and sadness. Racing venues across the UK held a minute’s silence in his honor.Trainer Ismail Mohammed’s assistant, Jose Santos, told TalkSport: “We’re really shocked. It’s hard to believe. I feel completely empty. He never showed any signs of problems. He was always smiling.”Also Read: Texas Longhorns Superfan Scott Wilson Dies At 74 After Never Missing A Game In 25 Years Fellow jockeys called him “a joy to be around” and “one of the kindest people in the weighing room.” Many described him as humble and full of energy.

FBI swoops in after 'pumpkin day' clue





Possible connection to ISIS

Political reaction









A potential ISIS-inspired attack in Michigan was foiled just hours before Halloween, after FBI arrested multiple suspects allegedly plotting a “pumpkin day” assault, reports CNN.The operation was carried out early Friday, preventing what director Kash Patel described as a “violent attack” planned for the holiday weekend.The plan was uncovered after months of online surveillance of a chatroom where several men allegedly discussed carrying out an ISIS-inspired attack in US. According to officials, an undercover FBI operative had been inserted into the group during the early stages of planning.The suspects had recently gone to a shooting range armed with AK-47s and other weapons, practising tactical reloads and firing dozens of rounds. That was when investigators intercepted a spooky reference to “pumpkin day” — believed to be a coded term for Halloween. This led the FBI to act immediately.“This morning the FBI thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend,” FBI Director Kash Patel said on X.“Thanks to the men and women of FBI and law enforcement everywhere standing guard 24/7 and crushing our mission to defend the homeland.”Raids were conducted in the Detroit suburbs, where heavily armed FBI and Michigan State Police teams stormed at least three homes. Investigators seized several legally owned firearms, computers and mobile devices as part of their operation.“This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” according to CNN’s chief law enforcement analyst John Miller, citing briefings from officials.At least two suspects have been arrested, while three others are being questioned. Among them, one was identified as a 16-year-old juvenile. The group had allegedly debated the timing of their attack, with some members pushing to strike on Halloween, while others argued they needed more time to prepare.Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she had been briefed on the arrests and thanked authorities for their swift action. “This morning, I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” Whitmer posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed operations in Dearborn and Inkster, saying, “There is no current threat to public safety.” The Dearborn Police Department also reassured residents that there was “no threat to the community.”Investigators are now probing any links between the arrested individuals and 19-year-old former Michigan Army National Guardsman Ammar Said, who was detained in May for plotting an ISIS-inspired attack on a US Army facility in Warren, Michigan.Officials described the Michigan cell as “home-grown radicals” with possible overseas connections, and credited close surveillance and quick coordination for preventing what could have been a Halloween tragedy.","Fbi swoops in after 'pumpkin day' clue in online chatroom.

Kash Patel pays reimbursement in advance: FBI









The FBI responded to the allegation that director Kash Patel flew on a $60M FBI jet to attend his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins' performance in Pennsylvania, and said he broke no rules while he did that. The allegation came from a former FBI agent-turned-podcaster Kyle Seraphin who commented about Patel flying around the country during the ongoing government shutdown.“We’re in the middle of government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy heads,” Seraphin said. “And this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?”This is not the first time that Kash Patel 's use of FBI jets for personal reasons came under fire. This time, the FBI issued a detailed statement comparing Kash Patel's travels with his predecessors, like Chris Wray and James Comey.The FBI director is not allowed to travel in commercial planes and they are only supposed to travel in government planes. Following the established rules, Director Patel pays a reimbursement in advance, Ben Williamson, assistant director for public affairs at FBI, said.Williamson detailed the steps Kash Patel personally takes to minimize spending. When Patel flies, he chooses to take a government airfield instead of airport like DCA (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) as the government option is 2.5X cheaper.Williamson said Chris Wray, James Comey, for example, never did that and they mostly used DCA.""Kash himself has significantly limited personal travel - but he’s allowed to take personal time on occasion to see family, friends or his longtime girlfriend. He doesn’t do it often. He works far more full weekends than he does otherwise.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Meta Q3 results





President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill has resulted in a $16 billion hit for Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta. Meta Platforms has taken a near $16 billion one-off charge in the third quarter (Q3) related to President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said that the bill had led the business to take a non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion. Meta said that excluding this, its third-quarter net income would have increased by $15.93 billion to $18.64 billion, compared with the reported net income of $2.71 billion. The expense crashed Meta's third-quarter profit.Incidentally, this is the same bill that Elon Musk and President TrumpThe implementation of Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act led to “the recognition of a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of the U.S. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax,” Meta said. Meta also said, “We expect a significant reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years due to the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. ”The markets didn't seem pleased with $16 billion charge taken by Meta, as the company's stock fell sharply lower on Wall Street, though briefly.The shares fell $53.60, or 7 per cent, to $698.99 in after-hours trading on Wall Street but recovered to close at $751.67, up less than 1 per cent.“We had a strong quarter for our business and our community,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said in announcing the results. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses. If we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history.”The company ended the quarter with $44.45 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Meta’s headcount was 78,450 employees as of September 30, up 8% year-over-year.As for quarterly guidance, Meta said that it anticipates fourth quarter total revenue to be $56 billion-$59 billion and full-year 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be $70 billion-$72 billion.","Mark zuckerberg unveils three new meta ai smart glasses.

'This is no way to treat US representative': Nancy Mace accused of cursing at TSA officers; congresswoman denies allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-is-no-way-to-treat-us-representative-nancy-mace-accused-of-cursing-at-tsa-officers-congresswoman-denies-allegations/articleshow/125008806.cms,"Nancy Mace refutes claims, calls it 'fake'





Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) on Friday reportedly cursed at police officers and Transportation Security Administration personnel at Charleston International Airport, calling them “f***ing incompetent” and demanding treatment she believed befitted a member of Congress, according to an incident report.The episode took place this week when officers from the Charleston County Aviation Authority Police Department arrived at the ticketing curb at 6.30 am and, finding no sign of the congresswoman, located her around 7 am at a trusted traveller checkpoint.The report says Mace began shouting at officers, insisting “this is no way to treat a US representative” as she was escorted to her gate.“The entire walk to gate B-8 she was cursing and complaining and often doing the same into her phone,” an officer wrote.“After standing in the vicinity of B-8 for several minutes with her continuing her tirade, she finally boarded the aircraft.”Mace called the reports fake news. On X, Mace shared a video of her arrival and challenged media accounts, writing “for the FAKE NEWS: This is the entrance ALL Members of Congress use at the airport. Are you going to write that Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott use the same entrance or no? Or no?”A spokesperson for Mace, Cameron Morabito, told Newsweek via email, “Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you’re leading the race for Governor.We are forced to take the Congresswoman’s safety extremely seriously. After the world watched Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the threats against her have only intensified. Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicise this reality is both dangerous and reckless. ”Mace also criticised The Post & Courier of Charleston, accusing the paper of getting the story “wrong” and asserting, “Once again, The Post and Courier gets it wrong.All federally elected officials including Senators Scott and Graham use the same Crew Member Access Point at airports. That’s the federal security protocol. Maybe check your facts next time.”She further accused her fellow gubernatorial candidate Alan Wilson of “spying on me at the airport” and wrote, “I wish Alan Wilson spent as much time prosecuting p*dophiles as he does spying on me at the airport.”The episode also comes as airport security and TSA personnel face heightened pressure amid the ongoing govt shutdown, which has strained staffing and operations.It remains unclear whether TSA or airport police will take any disciplinary action related to the confrontation. According to a Trafalgar Group poll published earlier this month, Mace trailed Lieutenant Governor Pamela Evette in the South Carolina gubernatorial primary with 15.8 percent to Evette’s 19.9 percent.Attorney General Alan Wilson secured 12.4 percent, Representative Ralph Norman 9.3 percent and State Senator Josh Kimbrell 1.3 percent. More than 40 percent of voters remained undecided. TSA supervisor Johnny Lynch told Fits News he planned to file a report with his superiors about Mace’s “unacceptable behaviour.”","Nancy mace (r-s.c.) reportedly cursed at police officers and tsa personnel at charleston international airport, calling them “f***ing incompetent” and demanding treatment she believed befitted a member of congress.

Russia has, in recent months, used a cruise missile against Ukraine that led US President Donald Trump to withdraw from a key nuclear arms control pact with Moscow back in 2019.The 9M729 missile, reportedly developed in secret, prompted the United States to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty during Donald Trump’s first term.Signed in 1987 by-then US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev near the end of the Cold War, the INF Treaty banned all ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.The agreement aimed to reduce the concentration of potentially nuclear-armed weapons deployed by Russia and Nato across Europe, as cited by the Kyiv Independent.Russia has launched the 9M729 missile at Ukraine 23 times since August and had previously fired it twice in 2022, a senior Ukrainian official said, as cited by Reuters.Washington has accused Russia of violating the treaty by developing the 9M729 missile, which it says can travel well beyond the 500 km (310 miles) limit, a claim that Moscow has denied.According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Missile Threat project, the missile is capable of carrying either a nuclear or conventional warhead and has a range of up to 2,500 km. One such missile fired by Russia on October 5 flew more than 1,200 km before striking Ukraine, a military official said, as cited by Reuters.""Russia's use of the INF-banned 9M729 against Ukraine in the past months demonstrates (President Vladimir) Putin's disrespect to the United States and President Trump's diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine,"" Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine's foreign minister, said in written remarks to Reuters.Images from the aftermath of a Russian strike on October 5 showed debris from a residential building hit in the Ukrainian village of Lapaiivka, where four people were killed.The village lies more than 600 km from Russian territory, and the fragments included two missile parts, one of them a tube with wiring, both marked 9M729, as reported by Reuters.Meanwhile, Russia has tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile last week and announced on Wednesday that it had also conducted a test of its nuclear-powered Poseidon torpedo.Trump on Friday also reaffirmed plans to resume nuclear testing, days after announcing that he had instructed the Pentagon to restart weapons tests.","The 9m729 missile, reportedly developed in secret, prompted the united states to withdraw from the intermediate-range nuclear forces (inf) treaty during donald trump’s first term.
