US Supreme Court ruling: Treasury has enough funds if Trump’s tariffs are struck down; when refunds could begin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-supreme-court-ruling-treasury-has-enough-funds-if-trumps-tariffs-are-struck-down-when-refunds-could-begin/articleshow/126448985.cms,"'No Call From PM Modi': Trump Aide Lutnick's Shocker On India-US Trade Deal Amid Tariff Threats

If the US Supreme Court rules against President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs, the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for the tariff refunds, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said. The timeline of payments, however, might extend to weeks or even a year, he told Reuters.In an interview, Bessent said he doubted the court would rule against Trump's tariffs, but suggested that any refunds could become a “corporate boondoggle” for companies that passed on the costs to their customers.""It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,"" he said.""Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?""Bessent added that, in general, companies had not been passing tariffs on to consumers, stating there was ""very, very little, if any, pass-through,"" and disputed that Trump's tariffs had contributed to inflation. He noted that goods inflation had remained below headline inflation.Importers and trade lawyers had expected a Supreme Court ruling on Friday, but the court issued a decision on a different matter instead.It remains unclear when the court will rule on the tariff case, which challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.Bessent said he believed that the longer the decision is delayed, the more likely the Supreme Court will rule in Trump's favour.With nearly $774 billion in cash as of Thursday, the treasury has more than enough to cover any refunds. Treasury borrowing estimates for January-March 2026 project an end-March cash balance of around $850 billion.""We're not talking about the money all goes out in a day. Probably over weeks, months, may take over a year, right?"" Bessent told Reuters.He also indicated that Treasury budget data for calendar year 2025 would likely show a deficit reduction of $300 billion to $400 billion from 2024, providing additional capacity. The government reported a fiscal-year deficit of $1.775 trillion for 2025, which ended on 30 September.Importers have warned that recouping any tariffs paid could be difficult if the Supreme Court finds Trump's IEEPA-based duties illegal. According to Customs and Border Protection data, $133.5 billion in such tariffs had been assessed through 14 December, with the total likely approaching $150 billion, based on Reuters calculations.Bessent disputed this estimate, saying it was ""not the number"" for tariffs potentially subject to refunds. He noted that revenues from tariffs imposed under other legal authorities also existed, but did not provide a specific figure for IEEPA-based tariffs.","Treasury secretary scott bessent says the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for tariff refunds.

In Fiery UK Conclave Speech, Suhel Seth Says India Has Evolved Beyond 1947, Now Shapes Global Power

NEW DELHI: In a move to shed yet another colonial relic, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj — black prince coats (bandhgala coats) — saying that “we have to find every trace of colonialism and banish them”.TOI has learnt that govt is carrying out a larger exercise across the board to identify similar colonial hangovers — attire and ceremonial rites — such as convocation gowns and caps (robe and mortarboard) which are de rigueur at university conovations and bandhgalas officers have to mandatorily wear at formal receptions. In some states personnel attached to district collectors and mayors in some states are required to wear a certain pattern of dress.Speaking at an event to honour railway officials and the zone for their exemplary works, Vaishnaw said, “We have to get rid of all colonial mindset. We need to find each of them and remove them whether it’s in our working style or dressing style. Today (Friday) I am making the first announcement. Humare jo band gale ka kala suit angrezon chalu kiya tha, aaj se yeh railway mein formal dress nehin rahegi. (From today onwards, the black prince coats that the British introduced will no longer be a part of formal dress in railways).Officials said that PM Narendra Modi has asked ministers and top bureaucrats to identify the colonial practices and to suggest alternatives that are of Indian origins and reflect the country's culture.While the practice of convocation gowns and caps has been fading, some institutions have held on to it despite the ceremonial gear not being suited for India’s hot and humid conditions and despite protests from students and faculty. Officials said that more practices, which are not commonly known to many, may be identified during consultations.Sources did not rule out the possibility of a nudge to do away with black coats and gowns that lawyers are required to wear as per Advocates Act, 1961 continuing a tradition inherited from the British legal system where it symbolised authority, dignity, and a commitment to justice. This law formalised the British-era custom, requiring advocates to wear the black robe with a white neckband for uniformity and gravity in court.",Railway minister ashwini vaishnaw announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the british raj.

PM Modi Offers Prayers At Somnath Temple, Witnesses Grand Drone Show & Fireworks At Swabhiman Parv

PM Modi: In face of great global uncertainty, India stands out

AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT: India must remain vigilant against ""merchants of appeasement"" who are still active and hatching conspiracies to divide the country, PM Modi said Sunday while projecting Gujarat's ancient Somnath temple as a model of resistance to what he termed ""religious terrorism"".PM Modi carried the broader theme of resilience to the Vibrant Gujarat Regional Conference in Rajkot, where he assured investors that the country offers ""extraordinary certainty"" amid global turbulence.At a rally in Somnath, where the shrine was rebuilt over centuries of pillage by invaders, the PM accused unnamed historians and politicians of obfuscating what had happened. ""Those with a mindset of religious extremism tried to disguise religious terrorism as merely motivated by wealth. They even wrote books to conceal the cruel history of hatred, atrocities and terrorism,"" he said.PM Modi said the temple’s history was inseparable from the valour of protectors like Raval Kanhardev, Veer Hamirji and Vegda Bhil, who never received due recognition for thwarting a succession of attempts to destroy the shrine. “There are no parallels anywhere in the world to Somnath’s retaliation against religious terrorism.”Harking back to how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel faced hurdles after pledging to renovate Somnath and objections by some quarters to former President Rajendra Prasad’s 1951 temple visit, the PM said the “same forces” continue to pursue that agenda. “Only their methods have changed. In place of swords, they are now using vile means against India,” he said. In Rajkot, 200km from Somnath, PM Modi cited recent assessments by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and rating agencies S&P and Fitch as evidence of rising global confidence in India’s economy.S&P upgraded India’s rating outlook after 18 years, he said, while IMF has described the country as the engine of global growth. “In the face of great global uncertainty, India today stands out,” PM Modi said. “There’s political stability, continuity in policy, and the rapid expansion of the neo-middle class with rising purchasing power.” The PM pointed to sectoral shifts, saying that from importing nine of every 10 mobile phones in 2014, India now ranks second globally in manufacturing handsets.The country has also become the largest consumer of mobile data and hosts the world’s largest real-time digital payments platform through UPI, he said. It has the third-largest startup ecosystem, ranks among the top three in solar power generation and has emerged as the third-largest aviation market, PM Modi said. “This Reform Express won’t halt,” PM Modi said before reprising his Red Fort punchline, “Yehi samay hai, sahi samay hai (This time is the right time). ”","Pm modi: india must remain vigilant against ""merchants of appeasement"" who are still active and hatching conspiracies to divide the country.

'India Will Develop Even On Autopilot', Says NSA Ajit Doval As He Credits PM Modi’s Leadership

NEW DELHI: National security adviser Ajit Doval , widely referred to as India's 'spymaster or James Bond', has revealed that he does not use a mobile-phone or internet in his day-to-day work.When asked if he used mobile or internet for routine work, the NSA replied, ""It is true that I do not use internet. I also do not use a phone, except for family matters or for speaking to people in other countries, which is necessary. I manage my work that way. There are many other means of communication as well, and some additional methods have to be arranged that people are not aware of.""He said this while addressing the inaugural session of Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2026 at Bharat Mandapam here Saturday.Doval, who has been NSA since 2014, said it is important to take the right and farsighted decisions at the utmost time, particularly for the youth. However, the former IB director advised it is important to think about what ""the next two steps will be before a person takes the first step"".He said India needs to strengthen itself as ""we had a painful history of attacks and subjugation"". ""We were a very advanced civilisation.We never broke anyone's temples. We did not attack any foreigners, even when the rest of the world was weak, we did not understand the threats to our security. And, so history taught us a lesson. It is important that we remember that lesson because if the youth forget it, then it would be tragic for the country,"" the NSA said.""Revenge is not a good word, but it can be a huge force. We have to avenge our history and take this country to the point where it is great again not just in terms of border security, but economy, social development, every aspect,"" he said.The NSA spoke about the importance of decision-making in leadership and nation-building. ""One common thing between when I was young and how I am today is the ability to make decisions. Whether you realise it or not, decision-making always walks with you. Youth take small and big decisions in daily life, and as you grow, these small decisions add up to big ones,"" he said. ""Napoleon once said, 'I am not afraid of 1,000 lions led by a sheep, but I am afraid of 1,000 sheep led by a lion'. That is how important leadership is,"" he explained.Expressing confidence in India's future, Doval said, ""India will be developed. The level to which our country has been brought under PM Modi, it will soon achieve the goal of being a developed nation. The real question is - who will lead the nation towards that development? If you want to be leaders on the path of Viksit Bharat, you must start making decisions now, and those decisions should be taken with a forward-looking vision, not just for today but for the future.

Study: Aerosols making winter fog worse in north India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/study-aerosols-making-winter-fog-worse-in-north-india/articleshow/126471022.cms,".

DEHRADUN: Winter fog has long been a disruptive force in northern India, grounding flights, delaying trains and bringing daily life to a crawl across the Indo-Gangetic plain. Now, new research published in Science Advances journal reveals that air pollution is not just accompanying these fog events - it is actively making them thicker, longer-lasting and harder to disperse, reports Gaurav Talwar.The peer-reviewed study, led by researchers from IIT Madras, shows that high concentrations of aerosols - tiny particles released from vehicles, industries, biomass burning and other human activities - are ""invigorating"" fog layers over parts of northern India. Using 15 years of satellite data and high-resolution weather-chemistry simulations, the researchers uncovered a clear physical mechanism linking pollution to intensified fog.They found that during polluted conditions, fog layers over the Indo-Gangetic plain grew about 15-20% thicker, often reaching heights of 400-600 m. Crucially, this thickening happens mainly at the top of the fog layer, not at the surface.The reason lies in how aerosols interact with fog droplets - more aerosols lead to more droplets, stronger cooling, increased vertical mixing and ultimately a thicker fog layer.As per the study, satellite observations revealed that fog in polluted conditions contains larger droplets near its top - a finding that may initially seem counterintuitive. In many clouds, pollution leads to smaller droplets. But in fog, where moisture is abundant and the atmosphere is nearly saturated, the enhanced condensation and cooling at the fog top allow droplets to grow larger despite high aerosol concentrations.The study stresses controlling aerosol emissions is not only essential for cleaner air, but may also be critical for reducing the intensity and duration of winter fog in northern India.","Winter fog has long been a disruptive force in northern india, grounding flights, delaying trains and bringing daily life to a crawl.

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration

A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","Maulana masood azhar, chief of jaish-e-mohammed (jem), claims his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers.

India-US trade figures



US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made a big statement over why the India-US trade deal is not sealed yet, claiming that it was due to PM Modi not calling Trump. Speaking at the All-In Podcast, hosted by Chamath Palihapitiya, Lutnick said, ""Let's be clear, it's his deal. He's the closer. He does the deal. So I said, you got to have Modi. It's all set up. You have to have Modi...they were uncomfortable doing it.""""So Modi didn't call,"" he claimed.This statement comes after US President Donald Trump, on Thursday, approved a bill that can impose at least 500% tariffs for countries buying Russian oil, aiming to ""punish them."" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill would give US tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil.In February, leaders from both countries directed officials to begin negotiations, setting an initial goal of completing the first phase by autumn 2025. However the deal still remains stalled with India's trade with Russia remaining a major flashpoint.Back in August, US imposed additional tariffs on Indian imports to the country alleging that New Delhi's purchase of Russian oil was fueling Moscow's 'war machine' in Ukraine.Since then total tariffs on Indian goods stand at 50%, including 25% of additional tariffs and 25% of Trump's reciprocal tariffs.Since then, two nations have held many rounds of trade talks with the meeting back from December 10 to December 12, when US officials visited New Delhi. India and the US are engaged in parallel negotiations, aiming to develop a framework trade deal to address tariff issues, and focus on a comprehensive trade agreement.The proposed agreement aims to more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 from the current $191 billion.The US remained India’s largest trading partner for the fourth consecutive year in 2024–25, with bilateral trade standing at $131.84 billion, of which $86.5 billion came from Indian exports. The American market accounts for roughly 18% of India’s total goods exports, 6.22% of its imports, and 10.73% of overall merchandise trade.Exporters have highlighted the need to finalise the agreement, noting that India’s merchandise exports to the US fell for a second straight month in October, declining 8.58% to $6.3 billion, largely due to the steep tariffs imposed by Washington.","Us commerce secretary howard lutnick made a big statement over why the india-us trade deal is not sealed yet.

NEW DELHI: Indian military retaliation against the terror attack in Pahalgam led Pakistan to frantically seek US mediation to make New Delhi pause the strikes deep inside its territory.Disclosures from US FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) filings reveal that between May 7, when IAF struck headquarters of JeM, LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen, and May 10, when Pakistan director general of military operations Major General Kashif Abdullah rang up his Indian counterpart Lt General Rajiv Ghai, Islamabad had launched an urgent lobbying campaign in Washington. Pakistani diplomats, including its ambassador and defence attache, initiated over 60 points of contact - comprising meetings, calls and emails - with high-ranking US officials and media outlets to solicit international intervention. The details are part of the filings by Squire Patton Boggs, hired by Pakistan for lobbying and which, like other US lobbying firms, are mandated to share with the US Department of Justice, the details and nature of their dealings.A majority of meetings were sought between the onset of Operation Sindoor and the eventual suspension of India's military operations with requests to secure American mediation to ""somehow halt"" India's retaliatory military operations.While Pakistan tried to dismiss the impact of India's strikes, the records confirm a high-level of behind-the-scenes panic.Pakistan had hired lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs originally to help it steer away from FATF grey list. An email from its representative and former US ambassador Paul W Jones to US diplomat Elizabeth K Horst on May 14, 2025, sought a meeting with Eric (Garcetti, US ambassador to India) to ""discuss and hear his perspectives to move the relationship forward"".The email read: ""Squire Patton Boggs is a registered agent of the govt of Pakistan. We'd very much appreciate your feedback on the attached one-page outline of ways forward in US-Pakistan relationship - Did we miss anything or would anything sound off-key in Washington? Separately, do you think we could try again to schedule a meeting with Eric to discuss and hear his perspectives on how best to move the relationship forward? Finally, I'd appreciate the opportunity to speak with you or a member of your team on FATF, in order to better understand the lay of the land. ""The firm is said to have circulated documents in diplomatic circles on behalf of Pak ""appreciating constructive role played by US and President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of J&K"".

Gold February futures on MCX are trading near ₹1,37,800 after a sharp pullback from higher levels. The recent recovery attempt appears corrective in nature, with price facing strong resistance near the previous breakdown zone. Technical indicators suggest that upside momentum is losing steam, making higher levels vulnerable to fresh selling pressure. The intraday setup favors a sell-on-rise approach in the ₹1,37,800–₹1,38,000 range.Prices are trading below the short-term EMA cluster, with EMA 8 failing to sustain above EMA 21. This indicates weak short-term structure and suggests that rallies are likely to be sold into rather than extended.Gold has moved back toward the mid-Bollinger band after testing lower levels, but the upper band near ₹1,38,000 continues to act as a firm resistance. This positioning supports the view of capped upside in the near term.• Resistance Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Support Levels: ₹1,36,800 followed by ₹1,36,400Failure to sustain above pivot resistance keeps the intraday bias tilted to the downside.RSI is around 60, indicating a short-term recovery but not strong enough to confirm trend reversal. This level often precedes consolidation or pullback when price approaches resistance.MACD has shown a brief positive crossover, but histogram bars are flattening, signaling waning bullish momentum. This increases the probability of a rollover from higher levels.The recovery has been accompanied by moderate volume, while open interest remains soft, hinting that the move lacks strong long buildup and is prone to reversal.• Strategy: Sell on rise• Sell Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Stop-Loss: ₹1,39,100• Downside Target: ₹1,36,400• Bias: Bearish below ₹1,38,000; strength only above ₹1,39,100.Gold’s intraday technical structure remains vulnerable as prices trade below key moving averages and momentum indicators fail to confirm sustained strength. The resistance band near ₹1,38,000 is likely to attract selling pressure.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday announced that it has asked its key diplomatic missions in India, including the High Commission in New Delhi, to temporarily suspend visa services citing ""security concerns"".""What I have done is that I have asked our three missions (in India) to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It's a security issue,"" Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain told reporters at a media briefing.The remarks came after Bangladesh's Deputy High Commission in Kolkata overnight restricted visa services, following similar steps taken earlier in New Delhi and Agartala.However, business and work visas have been kept outside the scope of the restrictions. Bangladesh also has diplomatic missions in Mumbai and Chennai, where visa services continue to operate normally.Hossain also said Bangladesh has approached the United States seeking a reversal of a recently imposed visa bond requirement. Dhaka will pursue diplomatic channels to seek an exemption, calling the move ""certainly unfortunate and painful for us,"" PTI reported.At the same time, he noted that the US decision was ""not abnormal"", as it was not applied only to Bangladesh and several other countries were facing similar immigration-related measures.Ties between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained since the Awami League government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in violent, student-led protests in July–August 2024.Relations have since hit another roadblock following the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka, which triggered anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year's July uprising, was killed amid rising political tensions, sparking widespread unrest.Protests also broke out after the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu factory worker who was lynched in Mymensingh after being falsely accused of religious defamation.Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a protest outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday, describing the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.India too raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions and what it calls ""misleading narratives"" emerging from Bangladesh. New Delhi further urged Dhaka to bring those responsible for the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained ""vigilant about the safety of minorities.""From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus for Bangladesh's instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities and undermining ties with India.","Bangladesh has asked its key diplomatic missions in india to temporarily suspend visa services.

Message to protesters and security forces

Who is Reza Pahlavi?

Protests grip Iran





Iran’s former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi on Saturday said that he is preparing to return home. He linked the possible move to the ongoing mass protests against the country’s clerical leadership.Pahlavi, who has lived in exile in the United States for five decades, announced the move in a video message and a post on X, as demonstrations continued across Tehran and other cities.“I, too, am preparing to return to the homeland so that at the time of our national revolution’s victory, I can be beside you, the great nation of Iran. I believe that day is very near,” he wrote.His remarks came amid widespread unrest that has disrupted daily life in parts of Iran and posed one of the most serious challenges to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in years.Many demonstrators have openly called for the return of Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, who was overthrown during the 1979 Islamic Revolution.In his message, Pahlavi urged Iranians to intensify pressure on the state by targeting the economy and reclaiming public spaces. He called on workers in key sectors to stop work and join the protests.“I call upon the workers and employees of key economic sectors—especially transportation, oil, gas, and energy—to begin the process of nationwide strikes,” he said.Also Read: 1 USD = 1,400,000 IRR: Iran on edge - why this is the most dangerous uprising yet He also appealed for coordinated street action over the weekend, asking people to gather from 6 pm with national symbols and move towards the central areas of cities.“Our goal is no longer merely to be present in the streets; the goal is to prepare for the capture and holding of city centres,” Pahlavi said.Pahlavi praised those who have continued to demonstrate despite threats and crackdowns, describing recent protests as a major blow to the leadership.“My dear compatriots, through your courage and resilience, you have earned the admiration of the world,” he said. Pahlavi added that the protests were “a crushing response to the threats of the treacherous and criminal leader of the Islamic Republic.”He also addressed members of Iran’s armed and security forces who have expressed sympathy with protesters.“To the youth of Iran's Immortal Guard, and all armed and security forces who have joined the national cooperation platform, I say: Slow down and disrupt the repression machine even more so that on the appointed day, we can completely disable it,” he said.Reza Pahlavi was groomed from birth to inherit Iran’s Peacock Throne and was undergoing fighter pilot training in the United States when the 1979 revolution ended his father Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi’s rule.Forced into exile, he has since lived mainly in the US, becoming a symbolic figure for monarchists and some opposition groups, according to BBC.Now 65, Pahlavi said he does not seek to restore the monarchy by force, insisting instead on a peaceful transition and a national referendum to decide Iran’s future system of governance.“This is not about restoring the past. It’s about securing a democratic future for all Iranians,” he has said previously.Iran has been witnessing widespread protests for nearly two weeks, initially triggered by rising living costs but rapidly expanding into broader demonstrations against the clerical establishment.Large crowds have taken to the streets in Tehran and several other cities, chanting slogans against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Several human rights groups said that dozens of protesters have been killed and hundreds injured in clashes with security forces.Authorities have responded with a sweeping internet shutdown, which activists say is aimed at limiting the spread of protest footage and masking the scale of the crackdown.The unrest has drawn international attention, with Iran accusing the United States and Israel of inciting instability. Tehran has approached the United Nations Security Council, blaming foreign interference for the escalation of protests into violent acts.",Reza pahlavi has lived in exile in the united states for five decades.

NEW DELHI: A new audio recording, purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of the terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers prepared for immediate deployment.The clip surfaced at a time when Pahalgam mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba's deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistan army invited him to lead funeral prayers of its own soldiers after Operation Sindoor last May. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalise a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by Indian security forces during Operation Sindoor. Kasuri's speech was made from a school, with hundreds of children visible in the audience, while Azhar too seemingly addressed a public gathering, sources said.The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed. He asserted that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with ""martyrdom"", explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles, or foreign visas.""They only ask Allah for 1 thing: martyrdom,"" the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadres.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a ""hollow threat"" and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM's infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.""This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ""torn to pieces"", as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,"" said a source.Interestingly, Masood Azhar was not seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location. This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan.Security agencies are now closely analysing the voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","Jaish-e-mohammed admits terror chief masood azhar’s family was torn apart in operation sindoor.

Barron Watches as Melania and Trump Share an ‘Uncomfortable’ New Year’s Kiss at Mar-a-Lago

CNN 20100429 010000 Larry King Live 4-year old Barron Trump speaks with Slovenian accent





Barron Trump has spent most of his life being watched without ever really being heard. Now 19 and a sophomore at New York University, the youngest son of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump is, according to people close to the family, quietly working on how he sounds when he speaks.Celebrity journalist Rob Shuter reports that Barron has been taking elocution lessons, training focused on pronunciation and speech clarity, as part of an effort to soften the Slovenian-influenced accent he grew up with. In the Wednesday, January 7 edition of, a source close to the family said the teenager is “very focused on how he presents himself,” adding that he wants to “be confident when he speaks.”Barron’s accent has long been a quiet footnote of his childhood. Raised largely by his mother and her family, he grew up speaking multiple languages and sounded, at times, more European than American. That was on public display when he was four years old and appeared in a pre-recorded segment on Larry King Live. In the clip, a young Barron tells the host, “I like my suitcase,” speaking with a pronounced Slovenian accent. Asked by Larry King whether Barron had an accent, Melania replied, “He does,” explaining that he spent most of his time with her and spoke three languages.When King turned to Trump, the then-businessman answered simply: “I think it’s great. Anything he does is OK with me.”Those early clips resurfaced repeatedly as Barron grew older, including footage of him speaking with a pronounced Slovenian lilt, a reminder of how closely his upbringing was tied to his mother and grandparents. One family friend told Shuter that dynamic has not changed much with age. “Barron was raised primarily by his mother and his grandparents. Even as he grows older, Melania watches over him closely. She wants him to have a normal life, free from cameras and public pressure, while still giving him the tools he needs to succeed. ”People around Barron describe the speech work as deliberate and private, not a performance for public consumption. “Barron is very focused on how he presents himself now,” another source told Shuter. “He’s thoughtful, deliberate, and wants to be confident when he speaks, but he does it quietly, without drawing attention.” A second insider echoed that point, saying, “He stays away from the spotlight whenever possible. He’s very aware of his privacy, and his mother makes sure it stays that way. Melania is fiercely protective of him.”That instinct to stay out of view has followed him into adulthood. Barron is currently attending classes at NYU’s Washington campus while living in the Executive Residence at the White House, a rare arrangement that places him close to power while keeping him largely unseen. According to those who know him, his focus on speech and presentation is part of a broader effort to define himself on his own terms, separate from viral childhood moments and the political gravity surrounding his parents.Elocution lessons, which emphasise clear articulation, breath control and confident delivery, are often used to refine speech rather than erase identity. In Barron’s case, the work appears less about rejecting his roots than about navigating a future in which every word he says is likely to be noticed. For a young man raised between languages, countries and relentless attention, learning how to speak, and when, may be one of the few choices that remains entirely his own.",Barron trump is reportedly taking elocution lessons to soften his slovenian accent.
