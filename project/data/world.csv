Rupee Slides To Record Low Of 90 Per Dollar As Trade Uncertainty, Dollar Demand And Oil Costs Spike

Why it matters

Your next iPhone, fridge, or car? Costlier.

Zoom in: Why did the rupee drop?

Three main reasons:

Trade tensions with the US:

Investor exodus:

Policy shift at the RBI:

The big picture: What makes this different from earlier rupee crises?

Dollar vs Rupee History

What they’re saying

Between the lines: Life is already getting more expensive

Oil & energy:

Electronics & appliances:

Everyday inflation:

Zoom in: Families, students, and borrowers are hurting

For students abroad:

Education loans hurt more:

Borrowers and consumers:

What's next: The pressure is widespread

Is this good for exporters?

The textbook answer: Yes. The reality: It's complicated.

Winners: IT and business service firms paid in rupees but billing in dollars see better margins-though many hedge currency exposure, which limits gains.

Mixed bag: Pharma exporters benefit from the exchange rate but are squeezed by global price pressures and rising import costs of raw materials.

Losers: Textile and light manufacturing should win-but US tariffs blunt their advantage.

Silver lining: Remittance recipients are smiling

What Indian families should do now

Match currency of income and loans: If you earn in rupees, avoid dollar loans.

Hedge wisely: For tuition and foreign payments, consider forward contracts or staggered payments to limit exchange rate shocks.

Plan with a cushion: Assume the rupee could drop further. Many consultants now suggest budgeting with Rs 93–95/$ in mind for 2026 plans.

Leverage remittances smartly: Fixed deposits and short-term debt funds offer high real returns right now-worth exploring.

Diversify investments: Global mutual funds or India-focused funds heavy in export sectors (like IT or pharma) may offer better protection.

The bottom line:

(With inputs from agencies)

On Wednesday, the Indian rupee broke a historic barrier, falling below Rs 90 to the US dollar for the first time. Though the drop from Tuesday’s 89.94 may seem minor, the implications aren’t.This milestone isn’t just psychological-it signals a shift in how India’s economy is perceived, managed, and felt by its citizens.The ripple effects stretch far beyond Dalal Street or forex traders. The rupee’s weakness is now hitting the average Indian household - from their fuel bills to EMIs, tuition fees, and travel costs.Micro meets macro: Imports = inflation: India imports 90% of its oil, and also depends on overseas suppliers for electronics, fertilizers, and edible oil. A weak rupee inflates these bills.Foreign education: Students studying abroad could be shelling out Rs 5–10 lakh more annually compared to 2023, especially those paying USD tuition and living costs.Recent trade negotiations failed, and US tariffs on Indian exports-some rising by 50%-hit business confidence hard.Despite steady inflation and GDP growth, foreign investors pulled out $17 billion from Indian equities in 2025, adding pressure on the rupee.The International Monetary Fund reclassified India's exchange rate regime from ""stabilized"" to ""crawl-like."" This suggests the RBI is now guiding, not guarding, the rupee.The dollar isn’t the main villain: In 2022, a strong dollar weakened currencies across the globe. This time, the rupee is down even as the dollar remains steady.India’s war chest is full: The RBI has $690 billion in reserves-unlike the 2013 taper tantrum or the 2018 oil price shock. This creates strategic patience.Philosophy shift at RBI: Instead of fire-fighting, the central bank now aims for long-term resilience. Its goal is no longer to defend Rs 90 at all costs, but to allow natural depreciation based on fundamentals-like inflation differentials and trade shifts.“For now, the central bank may be letting the rupee weaken a little more to make exports more competitive in light of US tariffs,” said David Forrester of Crédit Agricole.Bloomberg dubbed the rupee “Asia’s worst-performing currency this year.”“If they allow the rupee to close above 90, we could see further speculative bets and the possibility of the rupee heading to 91,”Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities, told Bloomberg. The recent slide is “hard to justify on a fundamental basis,” he added.""The weak macro picture in India makes weak currency performance inevitable, there has been a slide in so many data points recently – rising trade deficits, weakening nominal GDP growth, weak FDI and foreigner selling down domestic equities, etc,"" Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors in Singapore, told Reuters.The RBI’s stance? Let it float-for now. With over $690 billion in reserves, India can act if needed, but the central bank prefers gradual adjustment to aggressive defense.The depreciation isn't academic-it’s household.India imports 90% of its crude and over 60% of its edible oils. A weaker rupee makes them costlier.Imported items-laptops, fridges, smartphones-will now come with steeper price tags.Cooking oil, LPG, and petrol will squeeze budgets further, especially for lower- and middle-income households.Tuition at $50,000/year was Rs 40 lakh at ₹80/$, but now it’s Rs 45 lakh. That’s a ₹5 lakh hike-several months’ salary for many middle-class families.A student repaying a dollar loan taken at Rs 80 now owes 12–13% more in rupee terms.A family earning Rs1.5 lakh/month may now have to dip into savings or cut essentials to meet new EMI demands of student loans.Vacations abroad? That $2,000 family trip just went from Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 1.8 lakh.Small businesses: Those reliant on imported components or foreign travel now face higher costs and tighter margins.“If your goods hit a tariff wall of 25% or 50%, it’s less helpful,” said one trade economist.India received $137–138 billion in remittances in 2024-more than double any other country.A $500 monthly remittance now brings in Rs 45,000 instead of Rs 40,000.For rural and low-income families, this extra Rs 5,000/month is real uplift-sometimes funding education, healthcare, or property investments.The rupee's fall past 90 is more than a number-it’s a marker of a new phase in India’s economic story.In letting the rupee float, policymakers are betting on long-term gains over short-term defense. But for millions of Indian families, that bet is already affecting daily life, monthly budgets, and multi-year plans.","Rupee slides to record low of 90 per dollar as trade uncertainty, dollar demand and oil costs spike.

Putin Plans Big India Reset With More Indian Goods, Deep Strategic Defence Ties In Talks With Modi

NEW DELHI: India and Russia are expected to discuss the joint development of advanced variants of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi beginning Thursday.BrahMos emerged as a pivotal weapon for the Indian armed forces during the recent four-day Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. Building on this success, India has identified the need for lighter and more versatile versions, including the BrahMos-NG, which can be fitted across the Indian Air Force’s fighter fleet and strike targets over 400 kilometres away, reported ANI, citing souces.The two sides are also likely to explore work on extended-range BrahMos systems capable of hitting targets at more than three times the missile’s current range. “These discussions are likely to take place between the two sides during the Russian President’s visit,” the sources said.BrahMos remains one of the most successful examples of Indo-Russian defence collaboration, symbolising the long-standing strategic partnership between the two nations. Ahead of the summit, the countries have also been in talks on co-developing next-generation hypersonic and long-range air-to-air missile systems.India is further expected to finalise the procurement of 280 S-400 Sudarshan Chakra air defence missiles, which were successfully deployed against multiple Pakistani targets earlier this year.The Indian armed forces have equipped the Navy and other services extensively with BrahMos missiles. The missile has also been successfully exported to the Philippines, and further sales in the Asian region are expected.With its supersonic speed and precision strike capability, the missile is extremely hard to intercept and has repeatedly demonstrated high accuracy in operational use, including during the May conflict with Pakistan.",Brahmos emerged as a pivotal weapon for the indian armed forces during the recent four-day operation sindoor against pakistan.

Pakistan Sparks Controversy With Expired Relief Claims As India Rejects Airspace Allegation Strongly

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Tuesday renewed its allegations that its relief operations for cyclone-hit Sri Lanka were being “hampered by lack of cooperation” from India, claiming that permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.“India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The special aircraft carrying Pakistan’s humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka continues to face delays for over 60 hours now awaiting flight clearance from India,” the Pakistan Foreign Office said in a post on X.It added that the “partial flight clearance issued by India last night, after 48 hours, was operationally impractical: time-bound for just a few hours and without validity for the return flight, severely hindering this urgent relief Mission for the brotherly people of Sri Lanka.”Shortly after, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them “ridiculous” and “yet another attempt to spread anti-India misinformation.”He clarified that the request for overflight clearance for the Pakistani aircraft carrying humanitarian aid was received by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad around 1:00 PM on December 1, 2025. “Given the urgency of the humanitarian assistance, the Government of India processed the request expeditiously the same day and granted overflight permission as per the proposed itinerary at 5:30 PM on December 1, 2025,” he said, in an official statement.Officials also dismissed reports in the Pakistani media claiming India had not granted overflight permission as “fake”. “Pakistani media, as usual, is indulging in propaganda and peddling fake news. These allegations are baseless and misleading. All requests for overflight or transit are processed strictly in accordance with established procedures and international norms,” one of the people said.Meanwhile, the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka faced criticism online after sharing images of the relief materials sent to the flood-hit country.In a post on X Tuesday, the High Commission uploaded photos showing stacks of packaged supplies, stating: “Relief packages from Pakistan have been successfully delivered to assist our brothers and sisters affected by the recent floods in Sri Lanka, which signifies our unwavering solidarity.” However, netizens quickly noticed what appeared to be expiry dates of October 2024 printed on some of the packages.Sri Lanka has been grappling with widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, leaving several districts isolated and severely straining the country’s disaster-response capacity. India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu to assist Sri Lanka in its recovery efforts.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed at least 410 deaths and 336 missing as of Tuesday morning due to the catastrophic floods and landslides caused by extreme weather conditions since November 16.","Pakistan claims permission to use indian airspace was being delayed.

Russia Confirms Su-57 Fighter Jets, S-400 Deal On Agenda Ahead of Vladimir Putin’s India Visit

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin will begin his first visit to India in four years with a private dinner hosted by PM Narendra Modi Thursday. The two will discuss ways to shore up the special and privileged strategic partnership with a focus on economic ties, while exchanging views on key global and regional issues. The PM is expected to reiterate India’s position seeking early end to the Russia-Ukraine war and a return to dialogue and diplomacy. Putin had hosted Modi for a private dinner during the latter’s Russia visit last year for the annual summit.Putin’s main engagements are scheduled for Friday, beginning with a visit to Rajghat, followed by a ceremonial welcome at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The leaders will hold talks at Hyderabad House for the main summit. After lunch with Modi, Putin will participate in India-Russia Business Forum. He will return to Rashtrapati Bhavan, where President Droupadi Murmu will host a banquet in his honour.Putin’s aide Yury Ushakov said a joint statement was expected to be adopted and bilateral documents would be signed across a wide range of areas, including Program for the Development of Strategic Areas of Russian-Indian Economic Cooperation until 2030.Modi last held a bilateral meeting with Putin on the margins of SCO summit this year in Tianjin, and the two have spoken by phone five times in 2024.“This visit... provides an opportunity to discuss the extensive agenda of Russian-Indian relations comprehensively.

NEW DELHI: The rebound in exports in Nov will help erase the dip seen in Oct, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said Wednesday. Although there was no mention of the exact figure, he said, “If I aggregate Oct and Nov, both months show growth in merchandise (exports) despite all the global turmoil. This only goes to show that the economy is on a strong footing.”In response to a question on the record low of the Rupee, the minister said Indian economy was on a strong footing and would continue to power up. “Growth we just saw is at 8.2% even in the second quarter, beating all estimates. We have seen the lowest ever inflation in the last few months. Foreign exchange reserves continue to be strong, and all the levers of the economy have demonstrated a great deal of positivity.”At a CII event, the minister called for strengthening supply chains and preparing for global volatility with a “twin approach,” building on areas where it holds a comparative advantage while simultaneously achieving strategic autonomy in sectors where supply-chain dependence can threaten long-term resilience.He also said the future of manufacturing lies in being nimble, with companies that innovate, invest in R&D, and build secure, efficient supply chains surviving, while “those who remain in their cocoon of low competition protected economies will gradually start fading.”","After india’s 8.2% gdp jump, piyush goyal credits reforms and predicts strong, sustained expansion.

After India’s 8.2% GDP Jump, Piyush Goyal Credits Reforms And Predicts Strong, Sustained Expansion

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Wednesday said that govt is moving to update the base year for calculating GDP to 2022-23 instead of 2010-11 and dismissed concerns over an IMF report’s reference to India’s data quality.The new base, which will also come with a revised basket to goods and services, will reflect the changes in the economy as consumption patterns have changed over the last 15 years. Data based on the new series will be released on Feb 27 with the first advance estimate based on the current base to be released on Jan 7. There will also be changes in the base year for inflation and industrial production next year.India’s economic data has come under scrutiny, and a revamp is seen to be necessary to capture the changes in the digital economy.Recently, IMF in its annual report on India gave negative remarks on quality of data & called for measures to make it more up to date.Responding to the IMF report, which was raised in Lok Sabha, Sitharaman said that the multilateral agency focused largely on India’s overall healthy economic performance.“The ratings given by IMF are part of its report on the Indian economy, which expects India’s GDP to grow at 6.5% in 2025-26.It recognises growth in the private sector, macroeconomic stability and the resilience of the Indian financial sector. These are identified as key drivers of growth. IMF also notes that inflation is well below RBI’s tolerance band and is projected to be 4.3% for the full year. The point of contention was the quality of data on which the ‘C’ grade was given. The ‘C’ grade is assigned to the National Accounts data because it is based on an outdated base year — 2011-12,” she said.She said that govt is in the process of updating the base year. “So, the data currently being used is based on the 2011-12 base year, and it is solely for this reason that we have been given a ‘C’ grade. The IMF report does not question the growth figures,” she said, rejecting opposition’s criticism.Latest data released by NSO, estimated India’s GDP to have grown by scorching 8.2% in the July-Sept quarter, after a robust 7.8% in the first three months of the financial year.",Finance minister nirmala sitharaman said that govt is moving to update the base year for calculating gdp to 2022-23 instead of 2010-11.

Over 70 IndiGo Flights Cancelled Across India as Crew Shortage Triggers Massive Disruption

IndiGo flight cuts send air fares soaring

NEW DELHI: Lakhs of passengers have been hit by massive flight delays and cancellations at India's largest airline, IndiGo, since Tuesday, primarily due to a pilot shortage.On Wednesday, over 200 flights were cancelled, after nearly over 100 cancellations daily for the past 4-5 days. Some of Wednesday's delays were up to 10 hours.DGCA has asked the airline ""to explain the unprecedented disruptions"". Govt data showed on Tuesday (Dec 2) its on-time performance, at 35%, was the lowest among all scheduled airlines in India.Flying a million passengers every three days, the impact in terms of number of flyers hit is in lakhs.The volume of public inconvenience and outcry on social media led the aviation authorities to act. Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has called the airline's senior management Thursday ""to explain the unprecedented disruptions"" and also present a plan on how they hope to get back on track in the ongoing peak travel season when India has been witnessing over five lakh daily domestic passengers. ""DGCA is investigating the situation and evaluating measures along with the airline to reduce cancellations and delays in order to minimise inconvenience being caused to passengers,"" an official said.IndiGo announced Wednesday evening it had ""initiated calibrated adjustments"", or flight cuts. ""These measures will remain in place for the next 48 hours and will allow us to normalise our operations and progressively recover our punctuality across the network,"" the airline said, acknowledging its ""operations have been significantly disrupted across the network for the past two days"".Almost 62% of the 1,232 flights IndiGo cancelled in Nov were due to ""crew constraints"". DGCA had brought into effect more humane crew flight duty norms from Nov 1 following serious complaints of fatigue by cockpit crew of Indian carriers. While this increased pilot requirement, the 62% cancellation data (for Nov) shows IndiGo is now struggling on that front. IndiGo's OTP crashed from 84.1% in Oct, 2025 to 67.7% last month. ""The date for revised FDTL norms' implementation was known. The preparation for the same was definitely not in place,"" said industry sources.IndiGo's flight cuts, and uncertainty over OTP has sent fares soaring. An economy class one-way (nonstop) Delhi-Bengaluru ticket for Friday and Saturday (Dec 5 & 6) was in the range of Rs 11,000 to Rs 43,145. Similarly, Mumbai-Kolkata was in the range of Rs 8,000 to Rs 19,000.About the delays, IndiGo blamed ""a multitude of unforeseen operational challenges, including minor technology glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system, and the implementation of updated crew rostering rules (flight duty time limitations)"", which, it said, had a negative compounding impact on operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated"".IndiGo's OTP has taken a hit for the past few weeks but things now seem to have hit the roof. Only 35% IndiGo flights (the airline operates over 2,200 daily) operated on time Tuesday (Dec 2). And Wednesday multiple airports, including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru, reported almost 200 flight cancellations by the afternoon.Harried officials across airports said Wednesday IndiGo delays and cancellations were causing major issues.","Over 70 indigo flights cancelled across india as crew shortage triggers massive disruption.

Why Cincinnati Makes Sense for Buxton

Astros’ Motive: Rotation Stability

Twins’ Return: Prospects to Support a Transition

Why the Deal Still Feels Unlikely

The Cincinnati Reds may be approaching the offseason with several areas to evaluate, but one need sits clearly above the rest: adding more power to a lineup that struggled to produce consistent thump. A new trade concept from MLB.com’s Anthony Castrovince puts forward a dramatic solution - one that involves making a push for Minnesota Twins star Byron Buxton through a multi-team blockbuster. It’s an idea built around the Reds’ pitching depth and the possibility of acquiring a dynamic, game-changing outfielder without diving into the expensive end of free agency.But the proposal isn’t limited to a simple two-team exchange. Castrovince outlines a three-team structure involving the Reds, Twins, and Houston Astros, each addressing a different roster priority. For Cincinnati, it’s about landing a high-impact bat. For Houston, it’s securing a mid-rotation arm. And for Minnesota, it’s about collecting a group of prospects to support their transition. The concept may be unlikely to materialize, yet it brings together several logical elements that make it worth exploring.Castrovince’s concept revolves around the Reds leveraging their pitching depth, the Astros reinforcing their rotation, and the Twins securing a wave of prospects.Here is how the deal would look based on the proposal:Buxton, who has spent his entire career with Minnesota, is seen as an ideal fit for a Reds club that has been searching for a dynamic bat. As Castrovince wrote, “Buxton would be perfect for a Reds team that could use its pitching depth to address a lineup in need.”One of the major selling points is Buxton’s contract. He is owed roughly $15 million annually for the next three seasons, a number that sits well below what top free-agent hitters will command on the open market. That affordability naturally increases his appeal across the league, though Buxton previously declared himself “a Minnesota Twin for life,” a statement that could complicate any trade discussions.Houston’s inclusion centers on adding right-hander Brady Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration. The Astros are facing the likely departure of Framber Valdez in free agency, leaving a gap in the middle of their rotation. Singer fits both their competitive timeline and their payroll.Castrovince noted, “Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration, does not fit a Twins team in transition but does fit an Astros team that needs an affordable mid-rotation arm.” (H/t: Sporting News)Minnesota’s role in the deal is centered on long-term roster building. The Twins would receive four prospects, two from Cincinnati and two from Houston: Tyson Lewis, Mason Neville, Walker Janek, and Cole Hrtzler. The organization is navigating a transitional phase, and a multi-prospect return aligns with their broader strategy.Even with the pieces seemingly aligned, the proposal faces a major hurdle - Buxton’s ability to veto a trade. His long-standing connection to the Twins organization and his recent comments make any potential move difficult to finalize.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could bag $30 million Milwaukee Brewers 2x All-Star to improve title odds ahead of deadline Castrovince admitted that this is likely a trade that never happens, though he added that the framework hits several logical points for all involved clubs.

Nick Yardy, Jade and Dani continue “Throuple” relationship after fake pregnancy reveal





Nicholas Hunter, better known online as Nick Yardy, is a 29-year-old YouTuber from South Florida who is famous for posting comedy skits and wild story-style videos. He has more than three million subscribers on YouTube and millions more on Instagram and TikTok. This year, he shocked the internet again, but this time it was not because of a prank or a joke. It was because of a claim that made millions of people stop and stare.In February 2025, Nicholas Hunter said he was going to be a father to two babies at the same time. He said the mothers were a 22-year-old creator named Jade and her 44-year-old mother Dani. The news exploded online and turned into one of the most confusing and talked-about stories of the year.Earlier this year in February 2025, Jade posted on social media that both she and her mother were expecting Nick Yardy’s children. She said she was carrying a girl and her mother was carrying a boy, only two weeks apart.The news spread everywhere, with people reacting in shock and disgust. Many users left comments such as “this cannot be real” and “this is upsetting,” and several news outlets, including E! News and NDTV, reported on the bizarre claim.On March 7, 2025, Yardy told MailOnline the truth. He said, “There are no babies. It’s just a skit. It’s not actually real.”He explained that his followers enjoy entertainment, and the pregnancy story was created only for views. He also said he did not expect people to believe it so strongly.Even after the confession, Jade and Dani kept posting vintage ""pregnancy"" pictures on social media despite Yardy's already public assertion that the tale was fabricated.There is no record of a genuine pregnancy or birth right now, in December 2025. Renewed coverage from the New York Post, E!, and NDTV validates the staged pregnancy with never any babies involved.Yardy, though, maintains that his love connection with both Jade and Dani is genuine and still going on.Also Read: Does Candace Owens Have Facts To Support Her Emmanuel Macron And Charlie Kirk Claim?

Ortiz walks back her “woman hater” accusations after backlash intensifies

“weird”

“insane,”

“I love the FaZe guys, I didn’t say anything… I didn’t mean nothing.”





Wendy Ortiz is now walking back a major accusation she made during a heated livestream involving FaZe Clan member Stable Ronaldo and streamer Jasontheween. The controversy erupted after Ortiz, while defending fellow streamer Nina Lin, claimed that Ronaldo and Jason were, a statement that quickly spread across Twitch and social media. Fans of the FaZe star reacted strongly, and Ortiz soon found her comments resurfacing across Reddit’s LivestreamFail and X, fueling a wave of backlash against her.The feud traces back to criticism of Nina Lin over a recent Target livestream in which she was accused of shoplifting steak. On top of that, past controversies involving Lin, including damaging Ronaldo’s car during a stream and a disturbing allegation she reportedly downplayed, led to intense reactions from the streaming community. Ortiz, who appeared intoxicated at the time, dismissed the allegations and fired at Ronaldo and Jason instead, igniting the dispute further. What began as heated defense quickly turned into a larger community drama spotlighting accountability and online reputations.As the situation escalated, Stable Ronaldo publicly responded on stream, calling Ortiz’s claims false and damaging. He announced that he would no longer collaborate with her and encouraged other FaZe members to distance themselves to prevent further baseless accusations. Ortiz doubled down briefly, calling Ronaldoandbut clips soon captured her reversing course entirely.Now, Ortiz says she never meant her comments and insists she actually loves the FaZe members.
