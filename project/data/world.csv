AHMEDABAD: A wave of despair spread across many parts of Gujarat as 33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in Ahmedabad early Thursday from Amritsar after they were deported from US. Faces covered by masks, without any luggage and a few with backpacks, they were taken to Gujarat Police vehicles stationed at the airport and whisked away to their homes.Having paid Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore to chase their 'US dreams', all they were left with were shattered dreams and mounting debts.All of them were deported under the 'catch and release' policy of Trump administration and were part of a larger group of 104 Indians who were sent back from the US this week.""My sister was handcuffed during the deportation. She hasn't talked much with us. She had gone to US on a tourist visa . We have no idea why she was deported,"" said Varun, brother of 29-year-old Khushbu Patel of Luna village in Vadodara. Many deportees, including Khushbu, chose to go incommunicado to avoid the intense social scrutiny.Of the 33 deportees, 18 were caught just as Trump took oath as the US president. They stepped on US soil on Jan 19 and 20 and walked straight into the hands of American authorities, sources said.All 18 are from north Gujarat, a region known as a hub for human smuggling operations . ""They were smuggled into US through Mexico border,"" said a source connected with human smuggling network. ""The smugglers pushed them to enter US way before Trump took the oath, fearing stricter immigration policies. But for some reason, they could not cross over in time. They were caught and marked for deportation almost immediately,"" the source added.Sources said the remaining 15 Gujaratis had been in US for periods ranging from one month to four years. They did not get permission to stay even though they sought asylum, citing political persecution. Some deportees like Jignesh Zala, a native of Gandhinagar, said illegal immigration was a traumatic experience that should never be attempted. He had crossed into US with his wife and 11-year-old twin daughters four months ago. ""We went from Delhi to Paris to Madrid to Salvador before reaching Mexico and crossing the border. We were sent back with hands and legs in cuffs. It was a traumatic experience for our entire family,"" Zala said on Thursday.","33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in ahmedabad early thursday from amritsar.

Has WWE released superstars as this week's SmackDown went on air?

There has been a report of WWE releasing multiple superstars, some of them who were upcoming on the main roster show while others who had been kept off television for too long.WWE is the ultimate destination for many aspirants who wish to make a career in the professional wrestling world. However, making it to the company and staying in it are two different things.Over the years, the fans have seen many superstars fail to make an impact on the audience and in turn, lose their place in WWE.Moreover, at times, some talents are left unutilized on the main roster despite their impactful tenure in WWE’s developmental territory, NXT. The last round of WWE releases happened back in December 2024 and it seems some more names have been added to that list in recent memory.According to reports by Fightful Select and PWInsider, WWE has released a batch of superstars, with some names coming as a shock. The first name on the list was Sonya Deville. She was the first openly gay WWE superstar and had been in the company for almost a decade.Deville was regarded for her partnership with former WWE superstar Mandy Rose. Moreover, she recently took charge of Pure Fusion Collective alongside Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark. According to the report, Deville’s contract was approaching its end, and WWE decided not to renew it.The next names were WWE Hall of Famer Paul Ellering and The Authors of Pain. The trio had a good tenure in WWE back in NXT and a brief stint on the main roster. They came back to WWE in 2023 and were aligned with Karrion Kross to form ‘The Final Testament.’ With their release, it seems that Kross would now be going alone as a solo competitor.The final releases that happened in WWE recently were Cedric Alexander and Blair Davenport . Cedric was struggling to make a name for himself for years. The only time he was involved in major storylines was during his time as part of The Hurt Business. On the other hand, Davenport was not utilized much on SmackDown after being called up to the main roster last year. Moreover, the report stated that WWE had creative plans for either of them.In a follow-up report to their release by Fightful Select, the call for the releases was made right as the February 7th edition of SmackDown went live. With a wave of WWE releases hitting the roster, it remains to be seen if there could be more names let go from the company.","Has wwe released superstars as this week's smackdown went on air?

""I think, you know, no matter who the president is, I know I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there, you know, it's the best country in the world. So, that'd be pretty cool.” Kelce's neutral comments were met with resentment from Swifties due to Trump's escalating feud with the singer, which escalated last year. The president wrote, ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT"" on Truth Social.Taylor Swift's fan base, Swifties, expressed disappointment and anger over Kelce's comments, with some calling for Swift to end her relationship with him. ""@eagles all the way on Sunday. Even more love for them now that orange lunatic will be there. Travis Kelce is an orange lover. No respect left for him. How can Swift stay with him? Every Trump lover is a maggot in my books,"" fan wrote.Another added, ""Disappointed bc in 2018 The Eagles didn't make their players go and because so many declined, Trump then uninvited the team. Considering Kelce has spoken about social justice as a white man, this is disappointing."" ""Friendly reminder that Taylor Swift said 'f**k that, I don't care' when Trump said he'd come after her. I'm sorry, but Travis Kelce could have said the same thing,"" a third noted.Donald Trump and Taylor Swift have been bickering back and forth over the years: Swift publicly endorses Democratic candidates in 2018, followed by Trump lambasting her at the time; last year saw Trump attack her amid rumors over her potential clout in 2024.Also Read: Taylor Swift bringing Swifties into the NFL, as the league reports that women constitute nearly half of the audience Swift, who followed Kelce to the home games of his team, the Chiefs, during the 2024-25 NFL season, will likely attend the final Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans as the Chiefs seek to make history by winning a record third game in a row against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Assistant foreign minister Zhao Zhiyuan on Friday summoned ambassador Miguel Humberto Lecaro Barcenas over Panama's decision to not renew the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on cooperation with China on the BRI, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Panama recently announced the termination of the MOU on the BRI, to which the Chinese side expressed deep regret, Zhao said.Under the framework of the BRI, pragmatic cooperation between China and Panama has rapidly developed across various sectors and achieved a series of fruitful results, bringing tangible benefits to Panama and its people, Zhao said.The minister said more than 150 countries actively participate in the BRI, with achievements benefiting the people of various nations, including Panama.Under the BRI, a signature initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, China has made huge investments in various countries around the world to build major infrastructure projects by extending loans.The BRI projects attracted criticism of being debt traps as many countries struggled to pay back Chinese loans.""Any attempts to reverse the course on the BRI and go against the expectations of the Chinese and Panamanian people do not align with the vital interests of Panama,"" Zhao said.He said China firmly opposes the United States wantonly undermining the China-Panama relations and discrediting and undermining cooperation under the BRI through pressure and threats, Zhao said.It is hoped that Panama will exclude external interference and make the right decision based on the overall situation of bilateral relations and the long-term interests of the two peoples, he said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio during his visit to Panama had earlier warned Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino that the US would take ""measures necessary"" if it did not take immediate steps to end China's influence and control over the Panama Canal.Mulino on Thursday announced Panama's exit from the Chinese project.""I do not know what was the intention of those who signed this agreement with China. What has it brought to Panama all these years?"" he was quoted as saying by Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.""What are the great things that this Belt and Road Initiative has brought to the country? So, no [we will not participate],"" he said.China's foreign ministry on Friday said it firmly opposed actions by the US to ""discredit and undermine"" cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative through ""pressure and coercion"".Spokesman Lin Jian said China hoped Panama would ""make the right decision"".Commenting on the US decision, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing, said: ""The US is desperately trying to counter China's influence, and because it cannot comprehensively confront it, it is doing so by attacking ... weaker links.""The huge influx of Chinese capital and investments into Panama in recent years had prompted the US to try to ""regain control"" over the Latin American economy, he told the Post.Trump's threats could pose some challenges for China, Alvin Camba, a critical materials specialist at Associated Universities Incorporated, told the Post.He said Panama's withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative could potentially trigger a ""domino effect"", leading other countries in Latin America and globally to follow suit.Camba noted that while Panama's withdrawal did not necessarily mean a diminishing of China's economic involvement in the region but it did mean the Chinese government would have ""fewer avenues to exert its influence through these initiatives"", and represented a ""setback"" for Beijing.","Panama recently announced the termination of the mou on the bri, to which the chinese side expressed deep regret.

"In 2024, US seized 19kg of fentanyl from Canada border; 9,600kg from Mexico",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-2024-us-seized-19kg-of-fentanyl-from-canada-border-9600kg-from-mexico/articleshow/118080334.cms,"TORONTO: Canada's last-minute reprieve from crushing US tariffs came after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a series of measures aimed at controlling the trafficking of fentanyl, a key reason President Donald Trump has cited for wanting to impose levies.Fentanyl has flooded North America's drug supply over the last decade, killing tens of thousands in Canada and the United States, and generating enormous profits for criminal organisations using basic chemistry skills, improvised equipment and home laboratories to produce millions of doses.(Fentanyl is synthetic, means it can be made easily and cheaply in a lab, and is about 50 to 100 times stronger than many prescription opioids.)Trump has repeatedly talked about fentanyl as a major public health threat to Americans and holds Mexico and Canada responsible for allowing the drug to enter the US. But last year, less than 1% of the fentanyl arriving in the US came from Canada.The number of organised crime groups making fentanyl in Canada keeps growing, and Canadian officials have uncovered links between Mexican drug cartels and some domestic crime groups involved in the drug's production.In the last six years, Canadian police have dismantled 47 fentanyl labs, including the largest ever last year in British Columbia, govt officials said. That lab had enough material to produce 96 million opioid doses.Last year, about 19kg of fentanyl was intercepted at the Canada-US border, compared with almost 9,600kg at the border with Mexico, where cartels mass-produce the drug, according to US Customs and Border Protection. One gram of powder fentanyl can fetch up to 240 Canadian dollars ($170) on the street, and pills can go for up to CA$40 ($28) each, according to Canadian police.Trump has said fentanyl seized at the northern border could kill 9.5 million Americans, but health experts have stayed away from defining a lethal dose of any opioid.Canadian fentanyl that arrives in the US tends to be sold on the dark web and shipped through the mail, Breton said. The issue of drug shipments in mailed packages focuses primarily on China.A trade rule known as de minimis allows companies to ship packages from China worth less than $800 without paying duties, taxes and fees, and their contents are subject to fewer inspections. Trump signed an executive order Saturday that removed the trade exemptions on those types of packages from China and Hong Kong.Canada's main drug export into the United States is MDMA, or ecstasy, according to a White House report in 2022 laying out the northern border counternarcotics strategy. In response to Trump's tariff threats, Canada said it would appoint a new ""fentanyl czar"" to oversee the country's efforts at the border.","Fentanyl has flooded north america's drug supply over the last decade, killing tens of thousands.

After Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) made headlines for recommending shutting down of USAID, DOGE became the headlines when its 25-year-old staff, Marko Elez resigned following the unearthing of his past social media posts in which he called himself a racist. Those posts were not made in his name, but a pseudonym account which was suspended in December last year when Elez started to work for DOGE.This snowballed into a major controversy as little was known about DOGE so far but now that they started visiting federal agencies, bureaucrats claimed that they are mostly youngsters with questionable background and no eligibility to question federal workers. They are all ""tech kids"" who dropped out of college.Wall Street Journal reported that Marko Elez made several problematic posts in the past like: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.”; “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity. Normalize Indian hate"" etc. Controversy over his past posts made him to resign, the Wall Street Journal said.Elon Musk ran a poll on X whether DOGE should rehire him and as the majority voters were in favor of Marko Elez, Musk said he would rehire him. But Musl admitted that Elez made some mistakes. ""To err is human,"" Musk wrote.Vice president JD Vance offered his opinion on Elon Musk's poll on Marko Elez and said he does not agree with what Elez wrote in past but he also believes that past social media activities should not ruin his life. Democrat Congressman Ro Khanna asked him whether he would seek an apology for the anti-India statement. ""Just asking for the sake of both of our kids,"" Ro Khanna wrote as their kids have Indian connection -- Ro Khanna is an Indian-American and JD Vance's wife Usha Vance has Indian origin.The 'children' part seemingly irked JD Vance and he took it as an emotional blackmail. ""I cannot overstate how much I loathe this emotional blackmail pretending to be concern. My kids, god willing, will be risk takers. They won't think constantly about whether a flippant comment or a wrong viewpoint will follow them around for the rest of their lives. They will tell stupid jokes. They will develop views that they later think are wrong or even gross. I made mistakes as a kid, and thank God I grew up in a culture that encouraged me to grow and learn and feel remorse when I screwed up and offer grace when others did,"" Vance wrote.Ro Khanna replied that he was only doing an exchange of ideas.Amid all this, journalist Katherine Long who wrote the Wall Street Journal piece on Marko Elez drew the ire of Elon Musk who called her disgusting.

Donald Trump's crypto czar David Sacks has revealed in a podcast that DOGE staff have completely changed the work culture as they are working very late. The facilities people initially did not know what to do with them as they've never seen people working so late on a Friday night, David Sacks said as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is creating ripples -- for many reasons.Sharing an anecdote about DOGE, David Sacks said he went to greet them and the room was full of young people. ""I think they all are engineers. They were wearing suits and ties. They were working really late,"" Sacks said adding that new facilities access had to be created for them.Elon Musk recently said his team DOGE is working 120 hours a week. ""Our bureaucratic opponents optimistically work 40 hours a week. That is why they are losing so fast,"" Elon Musk wrote as he made it a DOGE vs bureaucracy fight as DOGE has been asked to cut the cost.DOGE was announced after Donald Trump won the election and between November to January 20, DOGE started working secretively. The meetings used to be held in Starlink offices. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy were the two co-chiefs of the department. Ramaswamy exited DOGE to run for the governor election in Ohio. Now a complete Elon Musk show, DOGE gained prominence as they got an office in the White House. DOGE staff got access to the federal payments system. They are visiting agency offices and are asking federal employees to justify their jobs in 15 minutes. Elon Musk has already announced shutting down USAID, next on their anvil is the education department.Though DOGE has understandably many staff, four to five youngsters have gained prominence as they made those acrimonious visits to government offices. According to bureaucrats, all of them are youngsters aged between 19 to 25 years.DOGE has created a digital tracker that aims to monitor the amount of taxpayers' dollars that the departments saved. On Saturday, it showed the savings as $36.73 billion which is 1.8 per cent of their goal of two trillion that has to be achieved within 511 days.",Elon musk's doge is working overtime to meet their saving goals.

Trump's Immigration Policy Changes Could Impact Indian H-1B Visa Holders and Families,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/immigration-policy-changes-being-considered-by-trump-administration-may-hit-indians-on-green-card-queues-hard/articleshow/118013429.cms,"Poll Does Stricter U.S. Immigration Policy Violate Human Rights? No, It’s Necessary Yes, It’s Unfair

Several steps being considered by the administration of US President Donald Trump are cause for worry for thousands of Indians in the US, who are on H-1B work permits and face long green card backlog.First, the potential revocation of birthright citizenship, for which President Trump has signed an executive order, is a deeply concerning issue for Indian families on H-1B visas who are expecting children in the United States.While this policy is currently being challenged in court and remains on hold, its implementation—however unlikely—would have profound implications.One of the most significant challenges would be the increase in the number of “aging-out” children, who are not covered under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and would lose the automatic legal status that US birthright citizenship provides. There are over 200,000 young immigrants, a large number of them Indians, who went to America with their parents as dependent children and then aged-out when they turned 21, according to estimates. They have to either self-deport, despite having lived in the US for several years and grown up and attended school and college there, or become undocumented immigrants.The issue of children aging out of dependent visa status is already one of the most challenging problems for Indian professionals on H-1B visas, and any policy change revoking birthright citizenship would only exacerbate it.“This would add further complexity to an already overburdened green card backlog, disproportionately affecting H-1B holders from India. Given the existing decades-long wait times for employment-based green cards, the inability to secure US citizenship at birth could leave these children in a precarious immigration status as they reach adulthood,” Neha Mahajan , co-founder of Skilled Immigrants in America (SIIA), an organisation supporting skilled Indians stuck in long green card queues, told the Times of India.The issue of birthright citizenship is currently being challenged in the US courts, and the executive order attempting to revoke it is on hold. Given the strong constitutional precedent supporting birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment, any attempt to alter this long-standing principle is likely to face significant legal hurdles.Earlier this week, a federal judge in Seattle has indefinitely blocked President Trump’s executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship. Historically, US courts have consistently upheld birthright citizenship, making it highly probable that this issue will remain tied up in litigation for an extended period. Any definitive change would require not just executive action but a constitutional amendment or a landmark Supreme Court ruling.“For now, the legal and constitutional precedent supporting birthright citizenship remains strong. However, any change to this principle would necessitate significant legislative and judicial battles, given its far-reaching consequences on immigrant communities and the broader US economy,” Mahajan said.Currently, children born in the United States to immigrant parents—whether on work visas or otherwise—are granted automatic US citizenship, providing a crucial safeguard against the severe green card backlog that disproportionately affects Indian H-1B holders. “This backlog, with decades-long wait times, leaves many high-skilled professionals in an uncertain immigration status for most of their careers. Birthright citizenship has been one of the few stabilising factors for their families,” Mahajan said. She added that the United States’ policy of birthright citizenship has historically set it apart from other developed nations, making it a more attractive destination for global talent.Another issue that could pose challenges for Indian professionals in the US, on H-1B visas, is the move to revoke employment authorisation documents for spouses of H-1B visa holders who are on dependent H-4 visas. “The H-4 EAD was introduced through an executive order by the Barack Obama administration after years of advocacy, providing much-needed relief and economic independence to many spouses of H-1B visa holders. However, under the administration of Trump’s first term, there was a concerted effort to revoke H-4 EADs, creating uncertainty and hardship for thousands of skilled immigrant women. Thanks to relentless advocacy—by organisations like SIIA and many women who chose to raise their voices—the effort to eliminate H-4 EADs was ultimately unsuccessful,” Mahajan said.She added that the broader immigration system has become increasingly difficult to navigate for Indians in the US who are waiting on green card queues. “Even routine H-4 EAD renewals have faced delays, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to employment disruptions and financial instability for many families from India, who already face disproportionately long wait times for permanent residency.”There are also fears now among Indian professionals, on temporary work visas in the US, on reversal of the Joe Biden administration’s order on automatic extension in certain categories of work permits. “These extensions were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to streamline the renewal process and prevent unnecessary employment disruptions. Any move to revoke automatic work permit extensions would have a significant impact on Indian professionals, particularly those on H-4 EADs,” Mahajan said. The automatic extensions allowed individuals to continue working while their renewal applications were pending, eliminating the need for additional biometrics appointments—a requirement that had been introduced under the earlier Trump administration.“Traditionally, H-1B and H-4 petitions were processed together, ensuring timely approvals. However, if the Trump administration issues new guidance to separate these filings, it could lead to increased delays in work authorisation extensions. This would disproportionately impact H-4 visa holders, many of whom are highly skilled professionals contributing to the US workforce,” Mahajan said.For Indian professionals already navigating decades-long green card wait time, these likely policy changes, being considered by the Trump administration, create additional uncertainty and financial instability.",Several steps being considered by the administration of us president donald trump are cause for worry for thousands of indians in the us.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118013823,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-664928,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

President Donald Trump is not interested in sending Prince Harry out of the country, pursuing his visa case because he thinks the ex-royal already has a lot of problems with his wife Meghan Markle. Trump did not like Harry and Meghan's exit from the royal family as Trump's allegiance lies with the late Queen who Trump said liked him.In an interview with the New York Post, Donald Trump said he would not pursue the case against Prince Harry.“I don’t want to do that,” he said. “I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.”After stepping down from their royal duties, Harry and Meghan relocated to Los Angeles in 2020. After the release of Harry's memoir 'Spare' released where he admitted to having taken drugs like cocaine, cannabis and psychedelics in the past, questions were raised as to whether he mentioned this in his visa application or if he lied in his visa application because he should have been disqualified from getting a US visa.Heritage Foundation sued the Department of Homeland Security forcing to release Prince Harry's visa records. Harry won the case as the judge ruled that his visa records won't be released but it was apprehended that Donald Trump would pursue the case.Meghan Markle does not like President Trump and the feeling is mutual as Trump also, in pas, spoke negatively about Meghan. In 2022, Trump said he thinks Harry is ""whipped"". ""I'm not a fan of Meghan, I'm not a fan, and I wasn't right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose,"" Trump said at that time.Rumors were rife that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would end their marriage though later it was said that they would choose professional separation instead implying that they would concentrate on their individual work and make rare joint appearances though the California wildfires saw them together visiting relief centers.",Donald trump said he won't deport prince harry as he believed harry already has a lot of problems because of meghan markle.

A Controversy That Won’t Die

Poll Do You Think Politicians Should Speak Out More Against Hate Crimes? No, It’s a Complex Issue Yes, Silence Encourages Hate

JD Vance’s Response: Gaslighting or Genuine Belief?

The Hypocrisy: Why Wasn’t

Ramaswamy Given the Same Grace?

The Big Balls Moment: Musk’s Flippant Justification

When Black NFL players kneeled for the anthem, MAGA figures demanded permanent bans.

When liberal figures were “canceled” for offensive remarks, MAGA called for boycotts and firings.

When an Indian-American MAGA figure was removed, there was silence.

""Christ is King, not some stinky Indian idol.""

""Will there be a cow in the White House soon?""

The Takeaway: Who Gets to Be Forgiven?

Is there any true place for them in MAGA?

Are they only valued as token figures when convenient?

Would their loyalty ever be reciprocated?

The phrase “Normalize Indian Hate” was posted by Marko Elez, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee whose racist social media history resurfaced last week. The revelation sparked a massive backlash, leading to Elez’s resignation. However, Elon Musk, with backing from Vice President JD Vance , reinstated Elez after a public poll on X.Vance’s defense of Elez—despite the blatant racism—has ignited outrage, particularly among Indian-Americans. Critics point to the hypocrisy in how Elez is treated compared to Vivek Ramaswamy , the Indian-American MAGA figure who was pushed out of DOGE without fanfare or second chances.This controversy highlights a deeper, uncomfortable truth. While MAGA claims to be an inclusive, meritocratic movement, it still harbors deep-seated biases against Indian-Americans—whether they are outsiders criticizing the right or insiders trying to fit in.Vance took to X (formerly Twitter) to dismiss concerns over Elez’s racist statements. Instead of addressing why he supported the return of someone who publicly advocated hate against Indians , he attacked critics for engaging in “emotional blackmail.”""For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,"" Vance wrote. ""Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don’t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages Congressmen to act like whiny children.""Vance framed the backlash as part of a cancel culture overreach, ignoring the fact that Elez’s post explicitly targeted Indian-Americans—a group that includes his own wife and children.His dismissive stance infuriated social media users, who called him out for failing to defend his own family.Congressman Ro Khanna responded, saying, ""Are you going to tell him to apologize for saying ‘Normalize Indian hate’ before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids.""Journalist Wajahat Ali added, ""Your wife is Indian American. Your kids are Indian American. Elez said he wants to ‘normalize Indian hate.’ Have some pride, man. Have some dignity. For your family's sake, you pathetic Reek.""Another user, Divya, criticized Vance’s privilege, stating, ""Easy for JD Vance to say this when his kids are covered by 24/7 security. What about regular Indian kids who have been rendered vulnerable because of the normalization of online hatred against Indians?""A well-known activist account, ind_us_immigrnt, pointed out the hypocrisy: ""Say ‘Normalize hate against White people’ and see how the MAGA clowns react.""While Elon Musk and JD Vance rallied to defend Elez, Vivek Ramaswamy—once considered MAGA’s rising star—was swiftly removed from his role in DOGE. Elez gets a poll, a second chance, and full public backing. Ramaswamy gets silence and a quiet exit.This double standard has infuriated Indian-American conservatives, many of whom now feel betrayed by a movement they once supported. The key question remains: Why is a white staffer, who openly promoted racism, given a second chance while an Indian-American leader is pushed aside?Harshil, an Indian-American commentator, pointed out, ""While Vivek Ramaswamy was deselected for DOGE, Elez has the backing of Vance for saying ‘Normalize Indian Hate.’ Indian-Americans, this is straight to your face. No matter how much you succeed, you will always be a second-class citizen.""Musk defended Elez’s return by citing forgiveness, conducting a poll on X in which 78 percent of users voted to reinstate him.Shortly after the results, Musk tweeted, ""He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.""Trump also chimed in, telling reporters, ""I’m with the Vice President.""However, this narrative of forgiveness crumbles when contrasted with MAGA’s past actions.The flippancy of how this issue was handled was best captured by David Sacks, who mocked the situation with this exchange:""Sir, the Pentagon has failed another audit.""""Send in Big Balls.""This level of casual arrogance over racism against Indian-Americans reinforces a harsh truth. Certain groups will always be prioritized within MAGA, while others remain expendable.The ‘Pagan Problem’: MAGA’s Uneasy Relationship With Indian-AmericansIndian-Americans like Usha Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy , and Sriram Krishnan have been prominent in MAGA’s political and business circles. Yet, their presence is often met with hostility from MAGA’s nativist and evangelical factions.An e arlier TOI report captured this underlying racism , highlighting online attacks against Usha Vance.Despite these overt attacks, MAGA leaders—including JD Vance himself—have largely ignored or downplayed the bigotry coming from within their own base. The underlying message is clear. Indian-Americans may be allowed in MAGA circles, but they will never be truly embraced.This controversy exposes the inherent contradictions within MAGA’s stance on race, meritocracy, and inclusion. If you are a white conservative who posts racist remarks, you get a poll, a second chance, and the full backing of Trump, Vance, and Musk. If you are an Indian-American conservative, you are disposable. The fallout from Marko Elez’s reinstatement and JD Vance’s dismissive response has left many Indian-Americans wondering:For now, Vance, Musk, and Trump have made their priorities clear. And for Indian-Americans watching from the sidelines, the lesson is stark. MAGA’s loyalty is conditional. And it does not extend to you.","Vice president-elect j.d.

Did Ro Khanna blackmail JD Vance?



President Donald Trump was asked about the controversial exit of Marko Elez from Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency over his past social media posts in one of which he called himself 'racist' and also called for normalizing India hate. Trump said he was not aware of it but if Vice President JD Vance is in favor of rehiring the person, he is with the VP.""Well I don't know about that particular thing but if the Vice President said so..did you say that? (turning to JD), I'm with the VP,"" Trump said.Marko Elez is a 25-year-old lieutenant of Elon Musk who apparently resigned from DOGE, the Wall Street Journal reported. WSJ reported that Elez made some problematic posts on social media through a pseudonym account which was closed in December probably when he started to work for DOGE but many of those White supremacist posts were archived. WSJ said when they contacted White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt for a comment on Elez's past posts, Leavitt said Elez resigned from DOGE.His past posts included: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.”; “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity. Normalize Indian hate"" etc.Elon Musk ran a poll on X on whether to rehire him and the maximum votes were in favor of rehiring him. Even JD Vance said Elez should not be victimized for his past social media activities which became another major controversy -- as Vance is married to Indian-origin Usha Vance and he did not call out the India hate.JD Vance said he ""obviously"" disagrees with some of Elez's posts but he also thinks that past social media activity should not ruin Elez's life. Indian-origin Democrat leader Ro Khanna took offence to Vance's stand and asked him whether Vance would seek an apology from Elez for his ""normalize Indian hate"" statement.
