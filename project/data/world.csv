'Tarnished India’s reputation': BJP demands MEA to ban Mamata's future foreign visits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tarnished-indias-reputation-bjp-demands-mea-to-ban-mamatas-future-foreign-visits/articleshow/119685568.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday wrote a letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar demanding a ban on Mamata Banerjee's travel to foreign countries in the capacity of West Bengal chief minister following ""anti-India pitch"" the TMC supremo made in UK.In a letter to Jaishankar, leader of opposition in the assembly Suvendu Adhikari accused Mamata of displaying devotion and admiration for the country’s colonial rulers.""West Bengal chief minister Smt. Mamata Banerjee, who went to the UK recently, with the permission and approval of the ministry of external affairs, has brought unimaginable shame to our country, especially to the People of West Bengal. We hang our heads in utter shame as because our ""so-called representative"" has deliberately and repeatedly undermined our country on the international stage,"" the letter read.""Firstly, while meeting the business community of the UK during a business event in London, she stirred a controversy by praising the 'British Heritage' of '190-year British rule over India and Bengal'. She fondly spoke about ""emotional relation with the UK and remembered the colonial times as a blissful passage of time,"" it added.Adhikari also accused Mamata of undermining India's achievements on foreign soil after she differed with the prediction that India would become the world's first economy by 2060.""This was just not it. She then did the unthinkable. Undermining India's achievements on foreign soil. During a Q&A session at the Kellogg College, Smt. Mamata Banerjee was asked about India's economic progress, leaving behind the UK as the fifth largest economy in the world. Her scepticism regarding India's economic progress is simply treasonous,"" Adhikari said.""It is not only my opinion but a collective demand that Smt. Mamata Banerjee should not travel in future, to any foreign country, in the capacity of the chief minister of West Bengal, aided and assisted by Indian embassies and missions located overseas,"" Adhikari said.""I hope you would consider my request and conduct a thorough probe to ascertain the anti India Pitch made by Smt. Mamata Banerjee in the UK and make sure that it is not repeated in the future,"" he added.Earlier on Thursday, huge uproar erupted in the packed auditorium of Kellogg College at Oxford University as Mamata delivered her maiden speech.During a conversation Mamata disagreed with a prediction that India would become the world's largest economy by 2060""I will differ from that. There are so many things about which I should not speak here... internal and external affairs matters... I cannot disclose. I have some other opinions,"" Mamata said.She went on to explain, ""Because every country is facing trouble after Covid-19, and with the turmoil going on in the world... if an economic war-like situation is underway in the world, how do we expect that we will gain? Let us hope for the gain, we can only hope. It is our dream to see my country our best. But it depends.""During the event, CM Mamata was also interrupted suddenly by a group of protesting students, who tried to disrupt her speech by raising the issue of post-poll violence and the RG Kar College rape-murder case.",Bjp writes to external affairs minister s jaishankar demanding a ban on mamata banerjee's travel to foreign countries.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha on Friday that India is ""very closely"" tracking incidents of attacks on minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The minister said New Delhi is making its position ""well known"" but cannot change the ""fanatical and bigoted mindset"" of a neighbouring country.During the Question Hour, Jaishankar drew attention to 10 incidents of attacks on Hindus in Pakistan in February. Seven involved abduction and forced conversion, two were cases of abduction, and one incident saw ""police action"" against students celebrating Holi.""There were three incidents relating to the Sikh community in Pakistan. In one case, a Sikh family was attacked. In another case, a Sikh family was threatened because of the reopening of an old gurdwara. There was also an abduction and conversion issue with one girl from that community. There were two cases pertaining to the Ahmadiyya community. In one case, a mosque was sealed and in another case, 40 graves were desegregated and there was one case pertaining to the Christian community, where a Christian person who reportedly was mentally unstable was charged with blasphemy,"" Jaishankar informed the House.He added that India also monitors the welfare of minorities in Bangladesh. ""Like in Pakistan, we track the welfare and well-being of minorities in Bangladesh as well ... In 2024, we had 2,400 incidents relating to attacks on minorities and in 2025, 72 incidents ... I have taken it up with my counterpart there. The foreign secretary also took it up when he visited Bangladesh. This continues to be a matter of concern for our government,"" he said.Responding to a query on whether India plans to take ""tough action"" similar to Indira Gandhi’s stance against Pakistan, Jaishankar said, ""We as a government and a country cannot change the fanatical and bigoted mindset of a neighbour. Even Indira Gandhi could not do it.""On March 26, Human Rights Focus Pakistan (HRFP) released a report highlighting a sharp rise in attacks on religious minorities in the country during the first quarter of 2025. The report condemned the escalating abuses, stating that relief and justice remain elusive due to resource constraints and the influence of religious and political figures.HRFP President Naveed Walter said, ""Religious minorities in Pakistan are easier targets for attacks, murders, blasphemy charges, abductions, forced conversions, and forced marriages. The lack of attention to their suffering and neglect is even more painful.""The report cited several recent cases, including the false accusation of theft against Wasif Masih, a Christian youth from Chak Jhumra, Faisalabad, who was assaulted and publicly humiliated with black paint on his face.","S jaishankar told the lok sabha on friday that india is ""very closely"" tracking incidents of attacks on minorities in pakistan and bangladesh.

Adhikari accused Banerjee of undermining India on the international stage and bringing shame to the country during her recent visit to the United Kingdom.In his letter, Adhikari claimed that Banerjee’s remarks in London displayed ""devotion and admiration for the colonial masters,"" which he described as ""unthinkable"" for a Bengali. He cited her speech at a business event in the UK, where she said, ""I love UK because we have an emotional relation, historical relation... From the heritage point of view, ours and from yours also. 190 years, you ruled in India. You ruled Bengal... So we forget that? Always India remembers you, and Bengal also remembers you.""Adhikari condemned her remarks, saying that Bengal had been at the forefront of the independence movement, resisting British rule. He said that praising the colonial past amounted to ""public renunciation of the sacrifices made by our freedom movement revolutionaries.""The letter also criticised Banerjee for her statements at Oxford University's Kellogg College, where she appeared to ""downplay"" India’s economic growth. When a speaker highlighted that India had overtaken the UK as the world's fifth-largest economy and was projected to become the largest by 2060, Banerjee disagreed, saying, ""I will differ that.""Adhikari called her response ""simply treasonous"" and an ""embarrassment for every Bengali and Indian."" He alleged that Banerjee had ""deliberately tarnished India’s reputation on foreign soil"" and accused her of opposing the country's economic rise.The BJP leader further urged the external affairs ministry to conduct a ""thorough probe"" into her remarks and ensure she is not granted permission for official foreign visits in the future. He referenced existing guidelines that require the ministry of external affairs to approve such visits and suggested that her remarks should be considered grounds for disqualification.Banerjee's visit to the UK was marred by controversy, as she faced protests from a group of demonstrators at Kellogg College. Protesters held placards questioning her stance on election violence in West Bengal and the RG Kar College case. BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a video of the incident, criticising Banerjee for her comments on India's economic future. ""West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has a problem with India becoming the world's largest economy... This is truly shameful,"" he posted on X.Union minister Giriraj Singh also slammed Banerjee, saying, ""Hiding the truth and insulting India, both are done by Mamata Banerjee. Today, the whole world is seeing and respecting our growing economy, but unfortunately, when Mamata Banerjee and the 'tukde-tukde gang' go abroad, they insult India. This is unfortunate.""Banerjee, however, responded to hecklers during her speech, saying, ""Please don’t do politics here on this stage. That you can do with me in my state, not here."" She also defended her government regarding the RG Kar College case, stating, ""The case is sub-judice, also, it is with the Central government, not with us.""",West bengal leader of the opposition suvendu adhikari wrote to external affairs minister s jaishankar.

Freedom of speech can’t be crushed on flimsy grounds: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/freedom-of-speech-cant-be-crushed-on-flimsy-grounds-sc/articleshow/119676324.cms,"Court must zealously protect rights of citizens, including right to express: SC

NEW DELHI: Holding that right to freedom of speech and expression was an integral part of a healthy and civilised society, without which it was impossible to lead a dignified life, Supreme Court on Friday said the right of citizens to express themselves could not be trampled upon on “flimsy and fanciful grounds”. The court quashed criminal proceedings initiated by Gujarat Police against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi over his social media post with a poem, ‘Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno’.Creating another layer of protection to prevent harassment by the government or police because of spoken or written words, or by signs or visible representations and also to ensure artistic freedom, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said FIR should not be lodged blindly in a mechanical way. A preliminary inquiry should be conducted by the police to ascertain whether a prima facie case was made out or not under various provisions of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including Sections 196 and 197(1).Setting standards for assessing the impact of spoken and written words, the bench said, “When an offence punishable under Section 196 of BNS is alleged, the effect of the spoken or written words will have to be considered based on standards of reasonable, strong-minded, firm and courageous individuals and not based on the standards of people with weak and oscillating minds. The effect of the spoken or written words cannot be judged on the basis of the standards of people who always have a sense of insecurity or of those who always perceive criticism as a threat to their power or position.”New Delhi: Seventy-five years into our republic, we cannot be seen to be so shaky on our fundamentals that mere recital of a poem or, for that matter, any form of art or entertainment, such as stand-up comedy, can be alleged to lead to animosity or hatred amongst different communities,” Supreme Court said on Friday while exhorting the judiciary to be at the forefront to “zealously protect” the fundamental rights of citizens, including the right to speak and express themselves which it said was not honoured by the police and the executive in many cases.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan frowned upon Gujarat high court for not quashing criminal proceedings against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi for his poem which the court said talked about “love, non-violence and fighting against injustice”. The bench rejected the HC’s justification that it did not interfere as the probe was at an initial stage.“Courts, particularly constitutional courts, must be at the forefront to zealously protect the fundamental rights of citizens. It is the bounden duty of courts to ensure that the Constitution and the ideals of the Constitution are not trampled upon. Endeavour of the courts should always be to protect and promote fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of speech and expression, which is one of the most cherished rights a citizen can have in a liberal constitutional democracy. Courts must not be seen to regulate or stifle freedom of speech and expression. As a matter of fact, courts must remain ever vigilant to thwart any attempt to undermine the Constitution and constitutional values, including freedom of speech and expression,” the bench said.“In a healthy democracy, the views, opinions or thoughts expressed by an individual or group of individuals must be countered by expressing another point of view. Even if a large number of persons dislike the views expressed by another, the right of the person to express the views must be respected and protected. Literature, including poetry, dramas, films, stage shows including stand-up comedy, satire and art, make the lives of human beings more meaningful. Courts are duty-bound to uphold and enforce fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Sometimes, we, the judges, may not like spoken or written words. But still, it is our duty to uphold the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a). We judges are under an obligation to uphold the Constitution and respect its ideals. If the police or executive fail to honour and protect the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, it is the duty of the courts to step in and protect the fundamental rights. There is no other institution which can uphold the fundamental rights of citizens,” the bench said.It said there was no rule that when the investigation was at a nascent stage, the HC could not exercise its jurisdiction to quash an offence. “When the high court, in the given case, finds that no offence was made out on the face of it, to prevent abuse of the process of law, it can always interfere even though the investigation is at the nascent stage. There is no such blanket rule putting an embargo on the powers of the high court to quash FIR only on the ground that the investigation was at a nascent stage,” it added.","Court must zealously protect rights of citizens, including right to express: sc.

A massive 7.7-magnitude earthquake rocked Myanmar on Friday, sending shockwaves through Thailand and China, toppling buildings, and triggering widespread panic. The powerful tremor, centred near Sagaing, was followed by a strong 6.4-magnitude aftershock, shaking cities and forcing thousands to flee into the streets.In Bangkok, alarms blared as high-rise buildings swayed, while in Myanmar’s capital Naypyidaw, roads split open and structures crumbled. As emergency teams rushed to assess the damage, chilling videos surfaced of collapsing buildings and terrified residents scrambling for safety.Videos circulating on social media captured the moment an under-construction high-rise in Bangkok collapsed into a massive cloud of dust, with a crane still attached to the top of the structure. Witnesses could be heard screaming as debris rained down. Rescue workers rushed to the site near the popular Chatuchak Market, fearing that dozens of workers may have been trapped under the rubble.Footage from Bangkok also showed terrified residents evacuating high-rise buildings as water sloshed over the edges of rooftop pools. ""All of a sudden, the whole building began to move, and immediately there was screaming and panic,"" Fraser Morton, a tourist from Scotland told news agency AP. ""People were running in every direction, down escalators, and out onto the streets.""In Myanmar’s Mandalay region, a 90-year-old bridge collapsed, and sections of the highway linking Mandalay and Yangon suffered severe damage. Video clips shared online depicted cracked roads and frightened residents standing outside their homes. In Naypyidaw, the country’s capital, religious shrines were left in ruins, with parts of ancient structures crumbling to the ground. The National Museum was also affected, with ceiling panels falling as visitors rushed for safety.A team of journalists inside the capital’s main hospital reported chaotic scenes as injured victims arrived. ""The hospital has become a mass casualty area,"" said one medical worker told news agency AFP, as ambulances weaved through heavy traffic. Outside, wounded people lay on stretchers, intravenous drips hanging from makeshift stands, while relatives anxiously looked on.In Chiang Mai, Thailand’s northern tourist hub, people ran from shops and homes as the tremors hit. ""I have never felt anything like this before,"" said a 76-year-old local. ""I just grabbed what I could and ran outside.""

However, no immediate reports of casualties emerged from the region.Seismologists have warned that Myanmar, particularly along the Sagaing Fault, remains prone to powerful earthquakes. In 2016, a 6.8-magnitude quake in Bagan caused significant damage to historic temples, and Friday’s tremor has once again raised concerns over the country’s infrastructure and emergency preparedness.As rescue efforts continue in both Myanmar and Thailand, authorities are bracing for aftershocks and potential further collapses.","A 7.7-magnitude earthquake rocked myanmar on friday, sending shockwaves through thailand and china.

How does this impact Indian immigrants?

Longer wait times: Indian nationals already face some of the longest green card backlogs due to per-country caps. According to the Cato Institute, some employment-based applicants may wait decades for approval. This pause is expected to extend those delays further.

High-skilled workers at risk: Indian tech professionals, who form a large share of H-1B visa holders, are particularly vulnerable.

Uncertainty for asylum seekers: Indian asylum seekers and refugees who have already passed extensive background checks could see their legal status remain uncertain, affecting their access to work, healthcare, and other essential services.

What do experts say?

Is there a timeline for lifting the freeze?

What is the broader impact of this policy?

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications, intensifying concerns among Indian immigrants, one of the largest migrant communities in the United States. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown focused on increased scrutiny and national security checks.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that the pause is in line with two executive orders signed by Donald Trump. These orders aim to enhance immigrant screening for potential fraud, public safety threats, and national security risks.The suspension impacts immigrants applying for permanent residency, including Indian nationals. With over 2.9 million Indian immigrants in the US as of 2023, many now face prolonged delays and legal uncertainties.Laura Collins, director at the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative, told NBC News, “All these people who are approved to remain in the United States have already passed government scrutiny.” She argued that further delays are unnecessary.Azadeh Erfani from the National Immigrant Justice Center told Newsweek, “This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk.”The Trump administration has not provided any timeline for when green card processing will resume, leaving thousands of applicants uncertain about their future.This move aligns with Trump’s larger push to tighten immigration policies, including plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue the pause unfairly targets legal immigrants and creates further bureaucratic hurdles.","The trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications.
