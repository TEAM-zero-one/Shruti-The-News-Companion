NEW DELHI: Indian delegation has ramped up efforts for United Nations listing of Lashkar-e-Taiba front The Resistance Front (TRF), according to news agency PTI, which cited sources.A team from India met United Nations under-secretary-general Vladimir Voronkov of the office of counter-terrorism (UNOCT) and assistant secretary-general Natalia Gherman of the counter-terrorism committee executive directorate (CTED) to discuss strengthening counter-terrorism cooperation.The meeting comes amid deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack , for which 'The Resistance Front' (TRF) had claimed responsibility. TRF is a front for the UN-proscribed Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba.On the visit of the Indian Technical Team at UN in New York, a spokesperson told ANI, the meeting revisited commitments made under the 2022 Delhi Declaration, which was adopted by the counter-terrorism committee under India's chairmanship.They also discussed the development of non-binding guiding principles, crafted with CTED's support, to address threats from unmanned aerial systems and the exploitation of new financial technologies by terrorist networks.Voronkov and Gherman extended their condolences to the delegation over the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam. The terrorist attack prompted a sharp military escalation in the region.In response to the Pahalgam incident, the Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The operation led to the deaths of over 100 terrorists affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and Hizbul Mujahideen (HM).Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling and attempted drone strikes along the Line of Control. In a countermeasure, India launched coordinated attacks damaging radar systems, communication hubs, and airbases within Pakistani territory.The meeting in New York highlighted ongoing multilateral efforts to implement UN security council counter-terrorism resolutions and the UN global counter-terrorism strategy. Key areas of collaboration between India and the UN bodies include cybersecurity, countering terrorist travel , aiding victims of terrorism, and disrupting terror financing mechanisms.","Un, india discuss counter-terrorism measures amid tensions with pakistan after pahalgam terror attack.

Pakistan's appeal to India: Rethink suspension of Indus Waters Treaty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistans-appeal-to-india-rethink-suspension-of-indus-waters-treaty/articleshow/121171409.cms,"Pak feeling the pinch ahead of sowing season

Pak facing pinch of irregular flow ahead of sowing season

NEW DELHI: Feeling the heat of India’s decision to keep the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance, Pakistan has appealed to India to reconsider it citing the dependence of millions of people on the water being regulated by the 1960 treaty.The appeal is learnt to have been made in a letter by the secretary of Pakistan's ministry of water resources, Syed Ali Murtaza, to India’s Jal Shakti ministry secretary Debashree Mukherjee. The tone of the letter is, however, not completely placatory, with Pakistan calling India's decision “unilateral and illegal” and “equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and its economy”.Significantly, the letter, sources indicated, was likely to have been delivered during Operation Sindoor New Delhi refrained from commenting on the “appeal”. However, sources said that it was not going to have any effect on the decision the cabinet committee on security took on April 23 to put the treaty on hold as a retaliation against the killing of tourists in Pahalgam. When asked, sources in the govt referred to PM Modi’s “blood and water cannot flow together” assertion in his address to the nation on Monday.On its part, India has rejected the charge that the decision to keep the treaty in suspension was “illegal”.Sources said the treaty does provide for a reconsideration because of the change of circumstances and the threshold has been reached due to Pakistan using terrorism as a tool to hurt India.“The treaty was negotiated in a spirit of goodwill and good neighbourliness. That is why we persisted with it despite the fact that it was flawed and loaded against India. However, Pakistan’s refusal to rein in the terrorists has knocked the very premise underpinning the treaty,” said a senior source.Moreover, climate change and other ground realities also require a relook at the design of the dams and other infrastructure that are in place, and this also fulfils the criteria of “change of circumstances” in the treat, highly placed sources said, signalling India’s resolve not to reconsider.India in the past few days had undertaken flushing and desilting of reservoirs of two run-of-the-river hydropower projects — Baglihar and Salal — on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir, resulting in the obstruction and irregularity of water flow downstream.Since India after suspending the treaty is not under any obligation to share any data with Pakistan on water flow after flushing or opening of gates, the neighbouring country has been facing the pinch of irregular flow ahead of the upcoming sowing season.","Pakistan has appealed to india to reconsider the indus waters treaty.

'New normal' for Congress? Shashi Tharoor's praise for PM Modi's policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-normal-for-congress-shashi-tharoors-praise-for-pm-modis-policies/articleshow/121167193.cms,"Poll Do you believe that India's approach to conflict with Pakistan has changed under Modi's government? No, it's consistent with previous policies. Yes, it's more aggressive.

NEW DELHI: Has Shashi Tharoor set a ""new normal"" for the Congress post India's "" Operation Sindoor ""? Well, it seems so. The Thiruvananthapuram MP has been unequivocal and unwavering in his praise of the steps taken by the Narendra Modi government against Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack . So much so, the BJP leaders have cited Tharoor's strong defence of the government to school and shame the opposition, including the Congress.While the Congress has heaped praise on the armed forces over the success of ""Operation Sindoor"", it has questioned the Modi government's decision to announce sudden ceasefire, which, ironically, was first announced by US President Donald Trump . While making the ceasefire announcement, Trump also claimed that India and Pakistan had agreed to talks at a neutral venue. Later, Trump went on to claim, not once but twice, that he used trade deal as a leverage to force India and Pakistan to agree to the ceasefire. While India did not react to Trump's claim publically, the external affairs ministry made it clear that trade was never a part of any discussions with the US. India also categorically declared that it was Islamabad that had approached us for ceasefire after the May 10 strike by our armed forces which destroyed many air bases in Pakistan.The Congress raised tough questions for Prime Minister Modi in the light of these US claims. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said: ""The Prime Minister did not speak one word on the claims made by President Trump minutes before his address to the nation. Has India accepted America's mediation? Has India agreed to hold talks with Pakistan at a neutral venue? Will India now accept US demand for opening of markets in automobile, agriculture and other sectors?"" Other opposition leaders also targeted the government over US claims of playing the mediator.However, Shashi Tharoor strongly defended the Modi government and called the US President ""a politician wanting to take credit for something."" Tharoor also justified India's decision to agree to a ceasefire.""Peace is essential. I am very glad, India never wanted a long-term war. India wanted to teach terrorists a lesson, I believe that lesson has been taught. The other details are awaited,"" Tharoor said in his first recation on ceasefire.For US President Trump's claims, Tharoor had a sharp retort.""I see it as a particular politician wanting to take credit for something and I can see that the government of India probably said 'let them take the credit if they want to', but from our point of view we have made it clear that the peace followed a request from the DGMO of Pakistan who called his Indian counterpart at 3:35 pm (Saturday) and we did not take very long to say yes because we had never wanted a long war,"" Tharoor said.Clarifying that he was speaking as an individual MP, Tharoor said he did not like Trump's social media posts on the issue.""You are making equivalent the victim and the perpetrator, which is really shocking. It is completely wrong to imply that as a result of this India is going to give some sort of negotiation to Pakistan. We will never negotiate to the point of a gun, we are never going to give the satisfaction to Pakistan of feeling that by unleashing a terrorist attack in Pahalgam they have somehow earned the right to negotiate with India,"" he said.""I don't think that Mr Trump should have in any way, shape or form implied that the Kashmiri dispute has been internationalised by the American involvement. We don't even accept that there is a dispute of that nature, Kashmir is an integral part of India ... we are not interested at all in internationalising the dispute,"" he added.Earlier also Tharoor was effusive in his praise for ""Operation Sindoor"" and had said: ""The operation was well-calibrated, well-calculated, and effectively executed. I am very impressed, from the naming of the operation to how it was presented to the world. We had to respond. We could not allow Pakistani terrorists to believe that they can walk into our country, kill civilians, and get away with it. They had to be punished. At the same time, an indiscriminate action on our part could have needlessly provoked an escalation and cost us the sympathy of the world.""The Congress MP also praised the government's messaging on the issue: ""We are doing all the right things so far. The nature of Operation Sindoor was right. The messaging of the press conference in which the foreign secretary, a Kashmiri Pandit, was flanked on both sides by women officers, one of whom was a Muslim, demonstrates a narrative against the one of Hindu-Muslim hostility being spread by the Pakistanis like silly general Munir. It sends a very good message.""And when some Congress leaders spoke of 1971 war and the role of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Tharoor had this message for his party leaders.""Today's Pakistan is a different situation. Their military equipment and the damage they can do are different. Bangladesh was fighting a moral cause to actually bring people to freedom and liberation. That was a completely different story. This is a different story. We would have ended up with much longer, protracted conflicts with a lot of loss of lives on both sides. Is this the biggest priority for India today? No, it is not.""While Tharoor heaped praised on Modi government's actions against Pakistan, he did not hesitate to slam the BJP when the safrron party put out a social media post criticising the previous UPA government and said the ""petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable"".Tagging the BJP's post on X, Tharoor said, ""At a time when the nation stands united as Indians, this petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable. Our government has learned the futility of past approaches the hard way -- after inviting Pakistan to participate in the investigation of the Pathankot blasts in 2016. It is only then that it took to the path of military action, carefully calibrated and maturely conducted. This advertisement is neither appropriate nor mature. Delete it, please, @BJP4India. Jai Hind.""Tharoor, a leading opposition leader, gave the BJP enough ammunition to target the critics of the government and accuse the Congress of playing politics.""I am really surprised that Congress is not listening to what Shashi Tharoor is saying. He is a senior Congress leader and is very clear that let anybody take the credit, but India decided to have this understanding with Pakistan. We didn't want a war. It was an understanding based on our terms and conditions. But you (Congress) want to politicise everything,"" Tamil Nadu BJP vice president Narayanan Thirupathy said slamming the grand-old-party.Tharoor has been at loggerheads with the Congress over his repeated praise for PM Modi and his policies.When Tharoor had first praised Prime Minister Modi for his US visit and then lauded India's role under the PM in the Russia-Ukraine war, the Congress had reacted very sharply to his remarks.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had then laid stress on discipline and had given a stern warning to the state leaders that strong action will be taken against those making comments that go against the party's interests.The Congress has officially not reacted to Tharoor's statements but Jairam Ramesh has made it clear that ""When Mr. Tharoor speaks, it does not reflect the views of the party."" Party sources say that Tharoor has crossed the 'lakshman rekha' with his repeated comments on the India-Pakistan conflict.(With inputs from agencies)","The congress has heaped praise on the armed forces over the success of ""operation sindoor"" it has questioned the modi government's decision to announce sudden ceasefire, which, ironically, was first announced by us president donald trump.

IAEA says no report of radiation leak from any Pak facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaea-says-no-report-of-radiation-leak-from-any-pak-facility/articleshow/121171115.cms,"Representative photo

DEHRADUN: There was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Wednesday (IST), rejecting widespread reports that claimed Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills in Pakistan’s Sargodha during Operation Sindoor , triggering a radioactive incident.The clarification followed social media speculation and foreign media theories suggesting a nuclear stockpile in Pakistan had been hit during the airstrikes. Fredrik Dahl from IAEA’s press department in an email response to TOI’s query stated, “We are aware of the reports. Based on information available to the IAEA, there was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan.”The development came two days after Indian Air Force’s director general air operations, Air Marshal A K Bharti, denied that India had targeted Kirana Hills or any nuclear installation in Pakistan. When asked by the media, Bharti said, “Thank you for telling us that Kirana Hills houses nuclear installations. We didn’t know about it. We have not hit Kirana Hills and whatever is there.”The ministry of external affairs also rejected reports of a radiation leak. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, during a press briefing on Tuesday, said, “Our military action was entirely within the conventional domain. Some reports were suggesting that Pakistan’s National Command Authority would convene a meeting, but those were later denied. In fact, Pakistan’s govt representatives have officially denied this on record.”IAEA’s statement sought to dispel speculation that a radiation leak led to the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Some foreign experts on global media platforms had amplified the theories, claiming the reports were accurate. The rumours intensified after some flight tracking platforms allegedly spotted a US department of energy aircraft—used in nuclear emergencies like Fukushima—near Pakistan.Another claim that an Egyptian military aircraft landed in Pakistan carrying boron, a chemical used to contain radioactive emissions, also circulated. Both these claims were unverified and dismissed by former military officials as baseless.","There was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in pakistan, the iaea said on wednesday.

Pak inked deal with crypto company in which Trump kin has 60% stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pak-inked-deal-with-crypto-co-in-which-trump-kin-has-60-stake/articleshow/121171400.cms,"US President Donald Trump

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump’s attempt to be a broker in the conflict between India and Pakistan has the spotlight on a deal the hostile neighbour recently negotiated with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture in which the president’s family has 60% stake.The deal was signed between WLF and the hastily-launched Pakistan Crypto Council , which early last month appointed as its adviser Changzpeng Zhao (CZ) — founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance — with the ambitious objective of making Islamabad South Asia’s crypto capital.Though the Crypto Council was barely a month old, WLF sent its heavy guns, including Zachary Witkoff, son of Trump’s golf buddy Steve, to Islamabad where they were feted by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, and more crucially, army chief General Asim Munir, who just days later “cleared” the mass killing in Pahalgam of tourists who were segregated on the basis of their faith.WLF’s stakeholders include Trump’s two sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr, who, along with their brother-in law Jared Kushner, have been scouring different parts of the world for lucrative business deals and have attracted allegations of leveraging their links to the White House.Witkoff, who, like Trump, is a real estate billionaire focused on New York, is seen as the “man-to-go” in Washington DC. A regular at Mar a Lago, Trump’s golf resort in Florida, Witkoff attracted global attention when he got Israel and the UAE and Bahrain to sign Abraham Accords during the incumbent US President's first term. Trump has now tasked him with getting Russia and Ukraine to sign a peace deal.With the Trump suddenly pivoting away from his “it is for them to sort out” hands off stance towards the conflict between India and Pakistan and arrogating unto himself the role of firefighter, many seem to be wondering whether Pakistan's dramatic foray into crypto currency in partnership with WLF has already started paying dividends.","Us president donald trump’s attempt to be a broker in the conflict between india and pakistan has the spotlight on a deal the hostile neighbour recently negotiated with world liberty financial.

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday reiterated its rejection of US President Donald Trump's offer to mediate in the dispute with Pakistan over J&K, and said India had a long-standing national position that any issue pertaining to the Union Territory would be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally.""That stated policy has not changed.

May 10 was the day India pounded 8-10 airbases in Pakistan, forcing Pakistan to seek a DGMO-level dialogue.India's armed forces have denied they hit a nuclear site at Kirana Hills, debunking reports about a radioactive leak there.

In conversations with various countries, we cautioned that their subscribing to such scenarios could hurt them in their own region,'' MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.Amid repeated claims by Trump that he had mediated a ""ceasefire"", govt reiterated that the specific date, time and wording of the understanding was worked out between the DGMOs during their phone call at 3.35 pm on Saturday. The request for this call was received by MEA from the Pakistani high commission at 1237 hours, Jaiswal said. ""The Pakistani side had initial difficulties connecting the hotline for technical reasons.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday detailed how the Indian Air Force (IAF) bypassed Pakistan's China-supplied defence systems to destroy military targets in the country during Operation Sindoor . In a detailed statement, the government also confirmed that Pakistan's foiled attacks on Indian cities and military sites involved Chinese and Turkish-origin weapon systems, including PL-15 missiles and Bayraktar-style drones, all of which were successfully neutralised by Made-in-India defence technologies.The government's detailed press release mentioned that Operation Sindoor underscored not just the precision of India's military action but also its technological self-reliance, marking a milestone in the country’s defence doctrine.“Operation SINDOOR emerged as a calibrated military response to an evolving pattern of asymmetric warfare… India’s response was deliberate, precise, and strategic,” the statement read.By bypassing China-supplied defence systems, Indian fighter jets and loitering munitions struck key Pakistani military sites, including Noor Khan and Rahimyar Khan airbases, using indigenous platforms. According to the government statement, these strikes were completed in just 23 minutes.“Indian Air Force bypassed and jammed Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence systems, completing the mission in just 23 minutes, demonstrating India’s technological edge,” the government said.All strikes were executed without crossing the Line of Control or the international boundary, and no Indian assets were lost.Meanwhile, India’s multi-layered air defence successfully intercepted Pakistani attacks using a mix of legacy and modern indigenous systems:“These systems, built over the last decade with continuous government investment, proved to be force multipliers during the operation,” the statement said.Chinese missiles, Turkish drones recoveredThe government confirmed that wreckage from various foreign-supplied weapon systems used by Pakistan was recovered, including:These were deployed by Pakistan in cross-border attacks that targeted Indian military installations between May 7 and May 10.“Despite Pakistan's attempts to exploit advanced foreign-supplied weaponry, India’s indigenous air defence and electronic warfare networks remained superior,” the statement said.","The government on wednesday detailed how the indian air force (iaf) bypassed pakistan's china-supplied defence systems to destroy military targets in the country during operation sindoor.

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday asserted it circumvented Pakistan’s air defence (AD) systems of Chinese-origin to carry out the strikes against the nine terror hubs without crossing the border on May 7, and then thwarted multiple retaliatory missile and drone attacks using a robust indigenous AD network during intense hostilities last week.“The IAF bypassed and jammed Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence systems (like the HQ-9 missile batteries and radars), completing the mission in just 23 minutes on May 7, demonstrating India’s technological edge,” a new govt statement said.Despite Pakistan’s attempts to “exploit advanced foreign supplied weaponry”, ranging from Chinese-made PL-15 LR beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to Turkish-origin Byker Yiha kamikaze drones and Asisguard Songar drones, India’s AD and electronic warfare networks “remained superior”, it added.With PM Narendra Modi having drawn new red lines against Pakistan-backed terrorism, the Indian armed forces are currently on a hot standby, maintaining full operational readiness to foil any misadventure. “We are strictly adhering to the May 10 bilateral understanding to cease all cross-border military action. But Pak Army chief General Asim Munir can never be trusted,” a senior military officer told TOI.When military hostilities were fully underway for four days last week, the IAF’s fully-automated integrated air command and control system (IACCS) played a critical role during Operation Sindoor . It connects different radars to a wide array of AD weapon systems as well as the Army’s smaller Akashteer system to present a composite real-time air situation picture.The Army quickly deployed six mobile Akashteer nodes, which it had begun to induct just a few months ago under a Rs 1,982 crore inked with defence PSU Bharat Electronic (BEL) in March 2023, from J&K to Rajasthan, officials told TOI.“Ground-based defence systems integrated with Akashteer made it hell for Pakistan’s air adventures. The system performed beyond users' expectations, providing robust air defence to India during the current conflict,” BEL said in a post on `X’ on Wednesday.The major weapon systems plugged into the AD network included the long-range Russian S-400 `Triumf’ surface-to-air missile systems (380-km interception range), Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70-km), jointly developed with Israel, and the indigenous Akash systems (25-km). Then, there were Pechora missiles, L-70 low-level anti-aircraft guns, shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles (6-km) and the integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (1-2 km).“This multi-tier defence prevented Pakistan Air Force’s attacks on our airfields and logistic installations during the night of May 9 and 10. It played a crucial role in ensuring that both civilian and military infrastructure across India remains largely unaffected during the enemy’s retaliation attempts,” the govt statement said. It added that at least 10 satellites also continuously worked round-the-clock, quoting ISRO chairman V Narayanan.Before the truce, India launched offensive actions with surgical precision against nine airbases in Pakistan and PoK as well as some radar sites, including the Nur Khan, Rahimyar Khan and Sargodha airbases, which included the use of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other stand-off weapons.“All these strikes were executed without loss of Indian assets, underscoring the effectiveness of our surveillance, planning and delivery systems. The use of modern indigenous technology, from long-range drones to guided munitions made these strikes highly effective and politically calibrated,” the statement said.Operation Sindoor is not just a story of tactical success, but also a validation of India’s defence indigenization policies. From air defence systems to drones, from counter-UAS capabilities to net-centric warfare platforms, indigenous technology has delivered where it mattered, it said.“Operation Sindoor emerged as a calibrated military response to an evolving pattern of asymmetric warfare, one that increasingly targets unarmed civilians along with military personnel. India is ready, armed with its own innovations, backed by a determined state, and powered by the ingenuity of its own people,” it added.","India demonstrated tech edge by outsmarting pak’s chinese systems, govt says.

NEW DELHI: John Spencer , a military strategist who is also an urban warfare expert, has weighed in the debate on the extent of the success of ‘Operation Sindoor’, asserting that India scored a decisive victory .“After just four days of calibrated military action, it is objectively conclusive: India achieved a massive victory. Operation Sindoor met and exceeded its strategic aims — destroying terrorist infrastructure, demonstrating military superiority, restoring deterrence, and unveiling a new national security doctrine . This was not a symbolic force. It was decisive power, clearly applied,” Spencer wrote in his latest blog.Spencer currently serves as the chair of the Urban Warfare Studies at the Modern War Institute at West Point (US Military Academy), New York, and has been a part of the strategic research group at Pentagon.“India has not declared Operation Sindoor completely over. What exists now is a sensitive halt in operations — some may call it a ceasefire, but military leaders have deliberately avoided that word. From a war-fighting perspective, this is not merely a pause; it is a strategic hold following a rare and unambiguous military victory,” he says.Spencer said Operation Sindoor was “more than a retaliation, this was the unveiling of a strategic doctrine”, quoting PM Narendra Modi as saying, “terror and talks can’t go together. Water and blood can’t flow together”.He said that India’s military response to terror attacks is “overwhelming yet controlled — precise, decisive, and without hesitation. That kind of clarity is rare in modern war. In an era defined by ‘forever wars’ and cycles of violence without strategic direction, Operation Sindoor stands apart. It offers a model of limited war with clearly defined ends, matched ways and means, and a state that never relinquished the initiative”.“In an age where many modern wars spiral into open-ended occupations or political confusion, Operation Sindoor stands apart. This was a demonstration of disciplined military strategy: clear goals, aligned ways and means, and adaptive execution in the face of unpredictable escalation. India absorbed a blow, defined its objective, and achieved it — all within a contained timeframe,” he added.The controlled escalation, he said, sent a clear deterrent signal: India will respond, and it controls the pace. “India’s restraint is not weakness — it is maturity. It imposed costs, redefined thresholds, and retained escalation dominance. India didn’t just respond to an attack. It changed the strategic equation,” he adds.Spencer noted the fact that India handled this crisis without seeking international mediation, enforced its doctrine on sovereign terms, using sovereign means.","Us def strategist hails india’s ‘decisive victory’, says response showed clarity.

India’s strategic transformation

Strategic objectives achieved

A New Red Line:

Military superiority:

Restored deterrence:

Why it matters globally

NEW DELHI: John Spencer , one of the world’s foremost authorities on modern combat, has offered a stark and unqualified assessment of India's Operation Sindoor “After just four days of calibrated military action, it is objectively conclusive: India achieved a massive victory. Operation Sindoor met and exceeded its strategic aims—destroying terrorist infrastructure , demonstrating military superiority, restoring deterrence, and unveiling a new national security doctrine. This was not symbolic force. It was decisive power, clearly applied,” Spencer wrote in a post on X.A West Point scholar, author of Understanding Urban Warfare, and executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, Spencer is known for his analytical rigor. His unequivocal language-""objectively conclusive,"" ""decisive power""-carried weight beyond social media, resonating in strategic circles far beyond South Asia.His statement also cuts to the core of what Operation Sindoor represents: Not just retaliation, but redefinition. India’s airstrikes, executed with surgical precision on terror infrastructure inside Pakistan, marked the culmination of a doctrinal evolution that had been hinted at for years but never made explicit-until now.Operation Sindoor followed a brutal April 22 massacre in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, where 26 civilians were killed in an attack claimed by The Resistance Front, a Lashkar-e-Taiba offshoot. Unlike past incidents, New Delhi didn’t issue diplomatic warnings or seek multilateral condemnation. Instead, it launched warplanes, Spencer said in his post.Over four tightly coordinated days beginning May 7, India carried out nine deep-penetration strikes, neutralized a retaliatory drone swarm from Pakistan, and hit six military airbases and UAV command hubs. In parallel, India’s armed forces showcased their ability to defend airspace, deploy indigenous weapons systems, and apply multi-domain capabilities, including electronic and cyber warfare.What followed wasn’t a ceasefire. It was, in the words of Indian military officials, a “strategic pause”- an operational halt, not a concession.This measured yet forceful posture is precisely what Spencer highlighted. His post reflects a growing recognition among security experts: India is no longer content with reactive diplomacy. It is building a military doctrine rooted in calibrated force, autonomous escalation control, and refusal to be coerced by nuclear threats.As per Spencer, Operation Sindoor was not a war of conquest or vengeance but a limited campaign with clear objectives, all of which were met:India established that terrorist attacks from Pakistani soil will be treated as acts of war, setting a precedent for future responses.India’s message, backed by action, is that terror attacks backed by state actors will be treated as acts of war. As PM Modi said, “Terror and talks can’t go together. Water and blood can’t flow together.”India’s ability to strike terrorist and military targets at will, while neutralizing Pakistan’s counterattacks, underscored a stark asymmetry in capabilities.By escalating deliberately and halting short of full-scale war, India signaled its control over the conflict’s pace and scope.With Operation Sindoor, India unveiled a new national security doctrine, as articulated publicly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi: “India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.”India’s approach combined restraint with resolve. There was no attempt to occupy land or escalate into full-scale war. The goal was to inflict limited but meaningful costs on both non-state actors and the state that enables them-without opening the door to prolonged conflict.John Spencer understood this-and articulated it plainly: “This was not symbolic force.”India’s campaign comes at a time when democratic states are rethinking deterrence in an age of gray-zone threats and nuclear brinkmanship. As Israel grapples with asymmetrical warfare from Hamas and Hezbollah, as the US pivots to long-term competition with China, and as European states reconsider their military baselines post-Ukraine, the concept of “limited war with defined strategic aims” is gaining salience.Meanwhile, India’s military briefing to 70 nations the day after the strikes-including the exclusion of China and the demotion of Turkiye was no coincidence. China and Turkiye are major arms suppliers to Pakistan. It signaled that this was not just an event, but a precedent.The current pause is not an endpoint but a strategic hold. India has made clear that further provocations will trigger renewed action.","John spencer, one of the world’s foremost authorities on modern combat, has offered a stark and unqualified assessment of india's operation sindoor. “after just four days of calibrated military action, it is objectively conclusive: india achieved a massive victory,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121153584,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-520718,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Justice Bhushan Ramakrishna Gavai began his tenure as Chief Justice of India (CJI) on Wednesday by seeking blessings from his mother in the presence of President Droupadi Murmu and PM Narendra Modi at Ganatantra Mandap of Rashtrapati Bhavan, and by paying tribute to Dr B R Ambedkar at Supreme Court One of the first jobs at hand of the new CJI will be to deal with President Murmu’s reference under Article 143(1) seeking SC’s opinion on whether the apex court could fix deadlines for governors and the President for giving assent to Bills passed by assemblies.This appears to be the culmination of sharp reactions from the executive, articulated by Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar, to a timeline-fixing recent ruling by a two-judge bench led by Justice J B Pardiwala. CJI Gavai will have to constitute a Constitution bench comprising a minimum of five judges to give its opinion to the President’s 14 queries.The oath administered in Hindi by the Prez at 10.05am was solemnly affirmed by Justice Gavai, departing from the general practice of swearing in in the name of God. Dhankar, LS Speaker Om Birla, defence minister Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah and other Union ministers, along with ex-CJIs including Justice Sanjiv Khanna and judges of SC and HCs, were present.Justice Gavai is the first Buddhist and second Dalit to become CJI, the first being Justice K G Balakrishnan. The second Dalit President Ramnath Kovind, the first being K R Narayanan, was present at Justice Gavai’s oath ceremony .When he took oath, President Murmu was to his right, a fifth century statue of Buddha in Abhay mudra was behind and a grand portrait of Mahatma Gandhi adorned the high wall on his left at Ganatantra Mandap, earlier known as Durbar Hall and as Throne Room during British reign.After being sworn in as 52nd CJI, Justice Gavai touched the feet of his octogenarian mother Kamaltai, who flew in from Amravati and was seated on the front row, to seek her blessings. She was instrumental in shifting Bhushan from a Marathi medium to an English medium school to ensure he did not lag behind siblings studying in a convent school in Mumbai.From Rashtrapati Bhavan, the CJI reached SC and went straight to Dr BR Ambedkar’s statue to pay floral tributes. He also paid tributes at the statue of Mahatma Gandhi. “The first day went well,” Justice Gavai told TOI. A contingent of nearly 400 lawyers from Maharashtra had arrived to felicitate him. Unprecedentedly, there were judges from across HCs who attended his swearing in.","Justice bhushan ramakrishna gavai sworn in as 52nd chief justice of india (cji) he is the first buddhist and second dalit to become cji, the first being justice k g balakrishnan.

NEW DELHI: Indian interest in Türkiye and Azerbaijan is rapidly losing altitude after both nations openly supported Pakistan during Operation Sindoor. The backlash is most visible in tourism, with widespread cancellations and a halt in new bookings.Türkiye’s military support to Pakistan, including drone supplies used during recent attacks on Indian border regions, has sparked a wave of anger. Indian travel agencies and platforms are now grounding promotions and advising customers to avoid both destinations.“Enough is enough! Blood and bookings won’t flow together,” wrote ixigo co-founder Aloke Bajpai on X, announcing a suspension of all flights and hotel reservations to Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and China.Other platforms, including India’s largest online travel agency MakeMyTrip, have stopped short of bans but issued strong advisories discouraging non-essential travel.Bookings for Turkiye and Azerbaijan have dropped 60%, and cancellations jumped by 250% in just one week,” a MakeMyTrip spokesperson said Wednesday.Travel agents across major metros reported that public outrage is translating into decisive action. “There’s a growing perception that Indian money spent on tourism could be fuelling hostile actions against us,” said a Mumbai-based agent.RPG Group chairperson Harsh Goenka weighed in online. “Indians gave over Rs 4,000 crore last year to Turkiye and Azerbaijan through tourism... Today, both stand with Pakistan after Pahalgam. Plenty of beautiful places in India and the world. Please skip these two places.”Indian outbound travel to both countries had surged before tensions escalated. Turkiye saw nearly 3.3 lakh Indian tourists in 2024, a 21% jump from the previous year. Azerbaijan welcomed 2.4 lakh Indians — more than double its 2023 figure. Direct connectivity by airlines like IndiGo played a role in boosting interest.But fallout has been swift. EaseMyTrip estimates Indian tourists spent $350-400 million in Turkiye last year alone, with average spending per person ranging between $1,200-1,500. That flow has slowed dramatically.Travel industry groups like Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) and Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI) have stopped promoting both destinations. Refunds are being processed, with select airlines cooperating, said TAAI’s south region chairperson Devaki Thyagarajan.Digital visa platform Atlys confirmed a steep drop in Azerbaijan-bound applications, despite the country’s growing popularity as a budget-friendly alternative to Europe. “People wanted something new beyond Singapore or Thailand. Azerbaijan offered a European feel at a fraction of the price,” said Sejoe Jose of Indian Association of Tour Operators. “That interest has disappeared.”Kolkata has seen Turkiye-bound travellers fall from 200 a day to under 50. Azerbaijan’s daily footfall has dropped to single digits, said TAAI east chairman Anjani Dhanuka. MakeMyTrip and EaseMyTrip data show a 30% spike in Azerbaijan cancellations and a 22% increase for Turkiye.Agents now suggest similarly priced destinations. For couples who once chose Turkiye, where a weeklong trip cost Rs 3-4 lakh, alternatives include Russia, Hungary, Czech Republic or Germany. Azerbaijan’s budget travellers are being redirected to Vietnam, Singapore, Bali or Dubai.","Türkiye’s military support to pakistan, including drone supplies used during recent attacks on indian border regions, has sparked a wave of anger.

AMRITSAR/NEW DELHI: A BSF constable held for 22 days in Pakistan after inadvertantly crossing the Punjab border was released Wednesday morning, drawing emotional scenes in his Bengal hometown.Purnam Kumar Shaw , 40, was handed over by Pakistan Rangers to BSF officers at Attari-Wagah border near Amritsar around 10.30am, concluding days of tense diplomatic and military manoeuvring between India and Pakistan amid Operation Sindoor Shaw’s wife Rajni, who is in advanced pregnancy, said: “Every citizen prayed for my sindoor,” thanking PM Narendra Modi and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee.Officials said Shaw, part of BSF’s 182 Battalion, was in uniform and carrying his rifle when he crossed into Pakistani territory in Ferozepur on April 23 while on operational duty. “He was received in accordance with established protocols. He appeared safe and healthy,” said Dr Atul Fulzele, IF of BSF’s Punjab frontier. A medical check-up and debriefing followed.Shaw’s crossing came a day after the Pahalgam terrorist strike that claimed 26 men, mostly tourists, and heightened tensions across the border. India responded with precision strikes on terrorist and military targets in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor.Pakistani Rangers had released photos showing Shaw blindfolded and disoriented. BSF initially shared an image of Shaw with a beard, later issuing one where he appeared clean-shaven and in fresh clothes.Efforts to secure his release included multiple flag meetings and diplomatic outreach. Sources said a final meeting between BSF and Pakistani Rangers commandants paved the way for Wednesday’s handover. BSF attributed Shaw’s return to “consistent efforts through communication channels”.In a parallel and unacknowledged move, a Pakistani soldier who had crossed into Rajasthan on May 4 walked back across Wagah the same morning.In Rishra of Bengal’s Hooghly district, Shaw’s family broke down in joy. “We cannot even imagine what he faced, but he will serve the country again,” said his father Bholanath Shaw. His mother Devanti Devi handed out sweets.Shaw’s wife recounted the anxiety that gripped the family. “I ran from pillar to post. I feared war would break out and we’d lose him,” she said. Rajni had even visited BSF officers near the border for updates. CM Banerjee later phoned Rajni and confirmed that talks at DGMO-level had included her husband’s case.After BSF’s press release confirmed his return, Rajni received a brief call from Shaw. “Main bol raha hoon,” he said. Unsure at first, she asked, “Aap PK Sir hain?” before recognising his voice.The couple’s young son Aarav looked up at a kite kept on top of a cupboard. “We flew it during Holi when papa was home. We’ll fly it again together,” he said.","Purnam kumar shaw, 40, was handed over by pakistan rangers to bsf officers at attari-wagah border near amritsar around 10.30am.

The might of BrahMos

The Akash Shield

How D4 disabled enemy drones

Indo-Israeli collaborations

Import dependence

As the dust settles after Operation Sindoor, directed against Pakistan and terror actors on its soil, what is becoming clear is the resounding success of India’s nascent defence industry.It is believed India used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other precision-strike weapons to inflict damage to terror bases and military installations deep inside Pakistan. Indian armed forces also deployed indigenous Akash air defence missiles and D4 anti-drone systems to repel wave after wave of Pakistani aerial strikes, letting very little pass through.“During this operation, the credibility of our Made-in-India weapons was firmly established. The world now recognises that the time for Made-in-India defence equipment in 21st-century warfare has arrived,” PM Narendra Modi said on May 12 in his address to the nation after Operation Sindoor’s success.For the past several years, the govt has been pushing to maximise acquisition of defence equipment through indigenous sources and promote domestic manufacturing to reduce dependence on foreign-origin weapons as part of its flagship ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ programme. Parallelly, India’s defence exports reached a record high of Rs 23,622 crore in 2024-25, a 12% surge over the previous year.BrahMos (the name represents two rivers: the Indian Brahmaputra and Moskva of Russia) flies at a speed of Mach 2.8, or almost three times the speed of sound, and is considered to be one of the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missiles.It is produced by BrahMos Aerospace Pvt Ltd, a Delhi-based joint venture between Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia’s NPO Mashinostroyeniya or NPOM.BrahMos can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or land platforms. India has successfully tested all variants of BrahMos and inducted the missile system into its military years ago.In 2019, the range of this home-grown missile was enhanced up to 450km with a top official then saying, “India is now the only country in the world to integrate long-range missiles into fighter jets [Sukhoi 30]”.India recently exported these missiles to the Philippines as part of a $375 million deal signed in 2022.Efforts are also on to develop a hypersonic version of the missile, tentatively named BrahMos-II. According to the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between New Delhi and Moscow, BrahMos-II will be based on a hypersonic scramjet technology. The main purpose of such a weapon is to target deeply buried enemy nuclear bunkers and heavily protected locations; all three military services will utilise this weapon.Referring to the new BrahMos integration and testing facility that was inaugurated in Lucknow last week, former DRDO chief G Satheesh Reddy said it is capable of delivering 100-150 missiles annually. India has two more BrahMos production facilities — in Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram.Developed by DRDO and manufactured by state-run Bharat Dynamics Ltd (BDL), Akash is a short-range surface-to-air missile (SAM). It is part of India’s multi-layered air defence system, which played a decisive role in thwarting Pakistani aerial incursions into India recently.Akash is probably the first-of-its-kind system in the world that is capable of engaging four aerial targets simultaneously at a range of 25km. The new variant — Akash-NG — has an extended range of 70-80km.The missile is equipped with electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) capabilities, enabling it to penetrate enemy jamming and other evasion tactics.The Akash system is designed for mobile platforms, making it highly agile and capable of rapid deployment anywhere.While some analysts have likened India’s Akash with Israel’s famous Iron Dome missile system, there are some fundamental distinctions between the two.First, Akash is a larger platform than the Israeli one. Also, while the Iron Dome is a potent shield against short-range rockets and artillery shells, Akash is capable of intercepting missiles, combat drones as well as aircraft.India reportedly signed a deal with Armenia in 2022 to export 15 units of the Akash missile systems. Brazil and Egypt have also shown interest in this weapon.India resorted to both kinetic and non-kinetic (jamming) warfare to thwart Pakistani drone swarms. Reports suggest the DRDO-developed D-4 anti-drone system was used in the recent military operations. It can disable ordinary drones as well as unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) employing electronic jamming and spoofing techniques.D4 (Drone-Detect, Deter and Destroy) also has a laser-based kill mechanism to destroy enemy drones. It’s unclear if this hard-kill method was used in the recent conflict.This system integrates radars, RF (radio frequency) sensors, and EO/IR (electro-optical/infrared) cameras, thereby offering a multi-sensor and 360-degree approach to detect incoming drones.Multiple DRDO labs, including the Electronics & Radar Development Establishment (LRDE), Bengaluru; Defence Electronics Research Laboratory (DLRL), and the Centre for High Energy Systems and Sciences (CHESS), both in Hyderabad; and Instruments Research and Development Establishment (IRDE), Dehradun, contributed towards developing this system.Weapons jointly developed with Israel such as Barak-8 missiles and SkyStriker kamikaze drones also contributed significantly to India’s defensive and offensive actions during Operation Sindoor.Barak-8 is a medium range surface-to-air missile (MRSAM) jointly developed by DRDO and Israel Aerospace Industries. India’s military last month conducted successful tests of this air defence system.The MRSAM includes mobile launchers that can be deployed on land or on navy vessels. The missile is capable of intercepting targets of up to 70km range.In India, it is produced by BDL, Kalyani Rafael Advanced Systems (KRAS) and Tata Advanced Systems (TASL).SkyStriker is a loitering munition jointly developed by Israel’s Elbit Systems and Adani Group’s Alpha Design Technologies. Although a drone, SkyStriker can be used as a precision weapon.
