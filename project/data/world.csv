Free Trade Agreement

Extradition of Lalit Modi, Nirav Modi, and Vijay Mallya

Presence of Khalistani groups

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday landed in London for a two-day visit to the United Kingdom, marking the first leg of his two-nation tour.The Prime Minister was received a warm welcome from the members of Indian community in London.PM Modi expressed gratitude for the enthusiastic reception by the Indian community during his visit, calling their affection and commitment to India's progress ""truly heartening.""""Touched by the warm welcome from the Indian community in the UK. Their affection and passion towards India's progress is truly heartening,"" PM Modi said in a social media post on X.The Prime Minister will meet his counterpart Keir Starmer and other key leaders to discuss several issues, including the Free Trade Agreement between the two countries.In his departure statement, PM Modi said that India and the UK share a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership that has seen significant progress in recent years.""Our collaboration spans a wide range of sectors, including trade, investment, technology, innovation, defence, education, research, sustainability, health, and people-to-people ties,"" he said.According to foreign secretary Vikram Misri, PM Modi will push for the extradition of Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi, and Nirav Modi — all of whom face financial charges in India and are currently residing in the UK.""There are a few questions related to fugitives from Indian law and Indian justice in the UK. These have been a matter of discussion between both sides, and we have continued to make the case for these fugitives to be returned to India,"" Misri said.""Obviously, there is a legal process that such requests and issues go through in the other country, and we continue to follow up very closely with our partners in the UK on these matters,"" he added.The foreign secretary said the Prime Minister will also raise the issue of the presence of Khalistani groups. India has flagged this concern with British officials in the past and will continue to do so. Misri said that this issue affects not only India but also social stability in the UK.""The issue of the presence of Khalistani extremists and bodies close to these people is, again, something that we have brought to the attention of our partners in the UK. We will continue to do so,"" he said.""This is a matter of concern not only to us but should also be a concern to our partners, because it impacts social cohesion and social order in these countries as well,"" he added.During his visit, PM Modi is also expected to meet King Charles III and hold discussions with business leaders from both countries.This marks the Prime Minister’s fourth visit to the United Kingdom since assuming office. He previously visited in 2015 and 2018, and again in 2021 for the COP26 summit in Glasgow.Within the past year alone, Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Starmer have met twice — first on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, and more recently, last month in June, in Kananaskis, Canada, during the G7 Summit.","Prime minister narendra modi landed in london for a two-day visit to the united kingdom.

Jeju Air Crash: Pilots shut off wrong engine; probe finds clear evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/jeju-air-crash-pilots-shut-off-wrong-engine-probe-finds-clear-evidence/articleshow/122811341.cms,"



South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike, a source familiar with the probe said on Monday.The investigation, led by South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), has found that the left engine, which was less damaged, was shut off instead of the right engine, which had been more seriously affected by the bird strike.The source told Reuters that cockpit voice recordings, computer data, and a physical engine switch recovered from the wreckage support this conclusion.""The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so its finding will not change,"" the source said, speaking anonymously as the official report has not yet been released.The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operating a flight from Bangkok, crashed while attempting to land at Muan Airport on 29 December 2024. Of the 181 people on board, only two survived, making it the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.An examination of the recovered engines confirmed there were no defects before the bird strike and the crash, according to a government source.Investigators reportedly shared these findings with the victims' families during a private briefing on Saturday.A third source, who was present at the meeting, said the families were told the right engine had suffered greater damage, but the left, less-damaged, engine was shut down instead.The ARAIB has not officially commented on the findings. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, directed queries to ARAIB. Engine manufacturer CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France’s Safran, has not responded to requests for comment.Jeju Air said it is actively cooperating with the investigation and is awaiting the official release of the results.While a preliminary report issued in January confirmed the presence of duck remains in both engines, it did not specify the extent of damage. A scheduled media briefing on Saturday was cancelled after victims’ families objected to the report being made public, saying it unfairly focused on pilot error and failed to consider other factors.The Jeju Air flight overshot the runway during an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment. The collision caused a fire and a partial explosion, Reuters reported.Victims’ families and the pilots’ union have urged the investigation team to also examine the embankment’s role in the severity of the crash. Aviation experts believe the structure may have contributed to the high death toll.The pilots’ union has criticised ARAIB for “misleading the public” by suggesting there was no problem with the left engine, even though bird remains were found in both engines. The union accused the investigators of making the pilots scapegoats and not providing enough scientific evidence to prove the aircraft could have landed safely with just the left engine running.The union also said the investigation has so far failed to address possible organisational responsibility. A group representing the bereaved families added that the language in the planned press release made it appear as if a final conclusion had already been reached. They have called for all facts surrounding the crash to be fully examined and clarified.Under international aviation rules, a final accident report is expected within a year of the incident.","South korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the jeju air plane that crashed in december shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike.

Poll Do you think a foreign power played a key role in stopping the recent India-Pakistan conflict? Yes No

American President Donald Trump on Tuesday night once again claimed credit for helping stop the recent India-Pakistan conflict and said that it was probably going to end up in a ""nuclear war"".""We stopped wars between India and Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda,"" Trump said at a reception in the White House.""They shot down five planes and it was back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. I called them and said, 'Listen, no more trade. If you do this, you're not going to be good…' They're both powerful nuclear nations and that would have happened, and who knows where that would have ended up. And I stopped it,"" the US president added.Moreover, the Congress questioned Prime Minister Modi's silence on Trump's repeated claims, saying that he is finding time only to travel abroad and to destabilise democratic institutions at home. ""As the Modi Govt continues in its refusal to give firm dates for a debate on Pahalgam-Sindoor in Parliament and as the Modi Govt persists in its refusal to commit to a reply by the PM in the debate, President Trump reaches the silver jubilee, the quarter century mark on his claims.He has trumpeted 25 times in the last 73 days but the Prime Minister of India is totally quiet - finding time only to travel abroad and to destabilise democratic institutions at home,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.Earlier, an American diplomat told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that recent ""de-escalations"" between India and Pakistan were facilitated by the United States — a claim that echoes President Donald Trump’s repeated assertions of mediating a ceasefire between the two neighbours, though New Delhi has consistently denied any third-party role.""Across the globe, the United States continues to work with parties to disputes, wherever possible, to find peaceful solutions,"" acting US representative smbassador Dorothy Shea said at a UN Security Council open debate on ‘Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes’. The meeting was chaired by Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, as Pakistan holds the rotating presidency of the Council for July.Shea said, ""In the past three months alone, the US leadership has delivered de-escalations between Israel and Iran, between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and between India and Pakistan.""""The United States, under President Trump’s leadership, played an important role in encouraging the parties to reach these resolutions, which we applaud and support,"" she added.Meanwhile, India's permanent representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, said that India stopped the military operation at the request of Pakistan. ""On achieving its primary objectives, a cessation of military activities was directly concluded at the request of Pakistan,"" he said.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK in response to the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which killed 26 people. This led to four days of clashes between the two sides, which ended on May 10 after an understanding to stop further military actions.Since May 10, the Trump administration has repeatedly said that the US president ""helped settle"" the conflict between India and Pakistan. Trump has also claimed that he told both countries that the US would engage in ""a lot of trade"" with them if they stopped the conflict. However, New Delhi has consistently rejected these claims, saying that the decision to halt military action was made through bilateral channels, following a call initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) to his Indian counterpart.Last week, the US designated The Resistance Front as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.

NEW DELHI: The`tanks in the air’ for the Army are finally here. Three of the six long-delayed Apache AH-64 attack helicopters, contracted under the Rs 5,691 crore deal with the US in Feb 2020, arrived in India on Tuesday.The three Apache gunships were transported on board a gigantic Antonov-124 aircraft to the Hindon airbase, on the outskirts of New Delhi, at 10 am. The heavy-duty choppers will now be flown to Jodhpur, where the Army had raised an Apache squadron in March last year to cater for the western front with Pakistan.The next three Apaches, which are armed with Stinger air-to-air missiles, Hellfire Longbow air-to-ground missiles, guns and rockets, will be delivered by Nov, as earlier reported by TOI.“The arrival of the first batch of the Apache helicopters for the Army is a significant step towards strengthening India’s defence capabilities. These advanced helicopters will enhance the Army Aviation Corps’ operational effectiveness, especially in challenging terrains,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.The six Apaches for the Army, which were delayed due to supply chain problems faced by Boeing, will add to the 22 such choppers inducted by IAF under the Rs 13,952 crore deal with the US in Sept 2015.One of those choppers was badly damaged after a hard landing near Khardung La in Ladakh on April 4 last year.Also Read: India to tie-up with France for next-generation fighter jet engine?

NEW DELHI: On Friday, when PM Narendra Modi touches down in the Maldives as the first foreign leader on a state visit under President Mohamed Muizzu, it will complete a shift in equations over the last two years.Muizzu was elected to office on an ""India Out"" platform. His cabinet colleagues didn't help matters by attacking Modi.Amid concerns over India losing a key ally, the govt had maintained its cool, with Modi being the first world leader to congratulate Muizzu.

Govt had stepped in with an emergency financial aid of $400 million and currency swaps of Rs 3,000 crore, something that leaders in the Maldives have not forgotten, and the ties have become stronger.""India is a key partner in the socio-economic and infrastructure development of the Maldives, and has stood by the Maldives during our times of need,"" Muizzu had said when he had visited India in Nov last year.Apart from the critical financial support and over $450 million of trade and investment footprint, and strong flow of tourists, India has offered continued defence, maritime, and capacity-building cooperation, and there are 13 new MoUs expanding ferry services across the Maldives. The frostiness which set in after the ouster of the defeat of Ibrahim Mohamed Solih in an election where he was dubbed India's vassal, seems to have been lifted because of the restraint exercised by New Delhi.","Ties warmer, pm modi makes 1st maldives trip of muizzu era.

NEW DELHI: A ""serial borrower"" from the IMF, Pakistan is steeped in fanaticism and terrorism, said India at the UN Security Council (UNSC) as Islamabad brought up the Jammu & Kashmir issue in an open debate it organised under its July presidency of the council on peaceful settlement of disputes.The meeting ended with the unanimous adoption of a Pakistan-sponsored resolution urging member states to effectively utilise mechanisms for pacific settlement of disputes as outlined in the UN Charter Article 33, including ""negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration... or other peaceful means of their choice"". The resolution did not name J&K or any other issue.In the debate presided over by Pakistan deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, the US representative doubled down on President Donald Trump's ceasefire claims, saying that the US leadership delivered ""de-escalations between Israel and Iran, between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and between India and Pakistan"".After Dar raised issues related to J&K and New Delhi's decision to place the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, Indian ambassador P Harish responded by asserting that it ill behoves a member of the council to offer homilies while indulging in practices that are unacceptable to the international community.""The Indian sub-continent offers a stark contrast in terms of progress, prosperity and development models. On the one hand, there is India which is a mature democracy, a surging economy and a pluralistic and inclusive society.At the other extreme is Pakistan, steeped in fanaticism and terrorism, and a serial borrower from the IMF,"" said Harish, adding that zero tolerance for terrorism is one of the fundamental principles that need to be respected while promoting international peace and security.The open debate on unresolved disputes was one of the signature events that Pakistan was organising under its presidency of the council, the other being the upcoming meeting on UN-OIC cooperation. The resolution on pacific settlement of disputes was generic in nature, as it is unlikely it would have found unanimous support from the council by explicitly mentioning or talking about disputes.Pakistan had through the resolution urged full use of all Chapter VI mechanisms of the UN Charter for peaceful resolution of disputes between nations, hoping to spotlight the J&K issue. While Article 33 of the Chapter states that the parties to any dispute shall seek a solution by, among other things, mediation and arbitration, it also says the parties can seek a solution through ""other peaceful means of their own choice"". For India, its emphasis on bilateralism in line with the Simla and Lahore Declarations conforms to other peaceful means. Apart from Pakistan, Turkiye was the only country to bring up the J&K issue in its remarks in the open debate.In his remarks, Harish highlighted the fact that the Chapter begins with a recognition that it is the 'parties to a dispute' who must first of all seek a solution by peaceful means of their own choice. ""National ownership and consent of parties are central to any efforts to achieve peaceful resolution of conflicts,"" he said. Harish also said that there should be a serious cost to states who violate the spirit of good neighbourliness and international relations by fomenting cross-border terrorism, while mentioning the Pahalgam terrorist attack and its condemnation by the council that underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terrorism to justice.""India launched Operation Sindoor targeting terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), which was focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature.

NEW DELHI: In a boost to India's military capabilities close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, the crucial Mudh airfield project in the high-altitude Nyoma area in eastern Ladakh is all set to be completed by Oct.The upgrade work by (BRO) at the airfield, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, included extending and strengthening the original airstrip into a 2.7km 'rigid pavement' runway with a dispersal area and turning pads, among other things.The Rs 230 crore upgrade will allow operations by all kinds of fixed-wing aircraft like heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. ""The runway, with 46m width, is fully ready. The allied infrastructure, including the ATC complex, hangar, crash bay, watch towers, accommodation and the likes, is also more or less complete,"" an official told TOI.""Nyoma will prove crucial as a forward staging ground for troops deployed in the region and transporting supplies quickly to them. The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026, though high altitude will be a limiting factor, much like what Chinese air force faces across LAC,"" he said.China, in fact, has systematically worked over the last five years to offset terrain constraints at its airbases facing India due to high altitude and rarefied air, which limits weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.With new and extended runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities, China has managed to deploy additional jets, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones, at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports along the 3,488km LAC, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.India is trying to play catch-up. Located about 35km from LAC, Nyoma will be another operational base for IAF in Ladakh after the Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground). Nyoma was reactivated as an ALG when a medium-lift AN-32 transport aircraft first landed there in Sept 2009. The upgrade project began during the military confrontation with China that erupted after the People's Liberation Army made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.In addition to strengthening the capacity of existing airbases to handle more aircraft, India has progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Fukche and DBO in Ladakh, as well as Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, civil ALGs in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh) of LAC are also now being increasingly used for military purposes.",Mudh airfield project in the high-altitude nyoma area in eastern ladakh is all set to be completed by oct.

China welcomes India decision on tourist visas

NEW DELHI: After a five-year hiatus, and ahead of a possible visit by PM Narendra Modi to China next month for the SCO summit, India announced resumption of tourist visas for Chinese nationals. Both sides have looked to facilitate people-to-people exchanges to normalise ties. China, which has been keen to resume direct air services, welcomed the decision as a positive move.The Indian embassy in Beijing announced the decision effective July 24 on Weibo, China's microblogging site, on a day the two countries also held another round of diplomatic talks on border affairs, expressing satisfaction with the ""general prevalence of peace and tranquillity in the border areas, leading to gradual normalisation of bilateral relations"".India and China have had frequent high-level engagements since Modi's meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan last year, following the agreement to complete the disengagement of troops at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh. The decision to restart tourist visa services for Chinese nationals is the second significant step towards normalisation, after the resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.The Chinese foreign ministry said, ""This is a positive move. Easing cross-border travel serves the interests of all parties. China will maintain communication and consultation with India to further facilitate travel between the two countries.""Chinese foreign minister and special representative (SR) for boundary talks Wang Yi is expected to visit India soon for the next round of SR (special representative) talks with NSA Ajit Doval and, with the thaw in ties holding up, Modi himself is likely to visit China for the SCO summit, to be held Aug 31-Sept 1. If it happens, this will be Modi's first visit to the country in seven years.During his recent visit to China, foreign minister S Jaishankar had said, while citing the complex international situation, that as neighbouring nations and major economies, an open exchange of views and perspectives between India and China was very important.In the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination (WMCC) talks on India-China border affairs, according to an Indian readout, the two sides agreed to maintain regular exchanges and contacts on issues related to the boundary affairs at the diplomatic and military levels through established mechanisms.The focus was also on the upcoming SR talks for which Wang will be in India. ""The two sides also prepared for the next round of Special Representatives' talks on the India-China boundary question to be held in India later this year,"" the Indian readout said.Doval had travelled to China for the last round of SR boundary talks in Dec 2024.

NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement for India’s Deep Ocean Mission, Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel MATSYA-6000, designed to carry humans up to 6,000 metres (6km) below the ocean surface, by completing a critical welding process after 700 weld trials.‘Samudrayaan', a project under the Deep Ocean Mission of the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), aims to strengthen India’s capabilities in deep-sea exploration. The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), under MoES, collaborated with Isro’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) to design and fabricate the spherical crew compartment. The Deep Ocean mission will allow scientists to explore unexplored deep-sea areas, assess mineral resources like nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements, and study marine biodiversity. The mission is expected to be realised by 2026.Central to the Samudrayaan effort is the creation of a human occupied vehicle (HOV) that can withstand extreme pressure and temperature conditions on the seafloor. “At the heart of the HOV is a titanium personnel sphere, a 2,260mm diameter enclosure with 80mm thick walls, made from a high-strength alloy. Designed by VSSC, the sphere is built to endure pressure up to 600 bar and temperatures as low as -3°C,” Isro said Wednesday.One of the biggest challenges scientists faced in creating this weld lay in the properties of titanium as a metal. While titanium is known for its strength, it can be difficult to weld. The technical challenge was developing a reliable electron beam welding process capable of fusing thick (80-102 mm) titanium plates. Isro’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Bengaluru, took charge of augmenting its welding facility from a 15kW to a 40kW EBW capacity.LPSC developed the process and infrastructure for the welding process and non-destructive evaluation (NDE). While LPSC had the expertise to carry out welding up to 20mm thickness, it augmented the EBW machine from a 15kW rating to 40kW, while also making alterations to the chemical cleaning and handling equipment to accommodate the increased size and mass.Over 700 weld trials were conducted to optimise the process parameters, ensuring high quality and structural integrity. For quality assurance, Isro enhanced its X-ray radiography capability, one of the highest energy levels used in India, allowing detailed non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of the welded joints.The breakthrough came with the successful completion of the first high-penetration weld on the actual sphere hardware. This involved 80mm thick welds over a 7,100mm length, achieved in a continuous 32-minute operation, “a national first in scale and precision” as per Isro.The milestone marks a significant leap for India’s underwater exploration ambitions and brings Matsya-6000 closer to sea trials. Once complete, the vehicle will be among the very few human submersibles in the world capable of reaching such depths, opening new frontiers for deep sea science, resource exploration and technology development.","Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel matsya-6000.

Pakistan’s Debt Trouble in Numbers

Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves of $14.5 billion at end-June consist primarily of refinanced loans, rollovers and new borrowings. This situation demonstrates the country's increasing dependence on external lenders, which poses risks to economic stability, the PTI report said.

The fiscal year 2024-25 saw disbursements of $26.7 billion, which is a marginal increase from the previous fiscal period, according to combined data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Ministry of Finance.

Pakistan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs has said that of the total $26.7 billion foreign loans, roughly 13% or only $3.4 billion has been allocated for project financing.

This small allocation towards project financing is indicative of the repayment challenges plaguing Pakistan economy . The majority of foreign borrowings at present support budgetary needs and foreign exchange reserves, neither of which generate funds for debt servicing.

. The majority of foreign borrowings at present support budgetary needs and foreign exchange reserves, neither of which generate funds for debt servicing. According to the Ministry of Finance, Pakistan's current debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing requirements as a proportion of GDP have surpassed sustainable thresholds.

When gross financing requirements exceed 15% of GDP, it indicates an unsustainable position. Based on the Ministry of Finance's earlier estimates, Pakistan is expected to remain above this critical level for a minimum of three years ahead
