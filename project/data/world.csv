As Iran Burns, India Flags Risk To 9,000 Indians, MEA Sets Record Straight On Chabahar Port Exit

NEW DELHI: Several Indian nationals, returned from Iran, arriving at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi late on Friday amid escalating regional tensions.Their return follows an advisory issued by the Indian government urging citizens in Iran to leave the country due to the deteriorating security situation. The Ministry of External Affairs said it is closely monitoring developments and remains “committed to doing whatever is necessary for their well-being. ”One Indian national who returned from Iran described it as ""bad situation"" and expressed gratitude to the government for facilitating their departure. “The conditions are bad there. The Government of India is cooperating a lot, and the Embassy provided us with information on leaving Iran as early as possible...'Modi ji hai toh har cheez mumkin hai',” he said.Another returnee told ANI that conditions had worsened sharply in recent weeks. “We were there for a month. But we were only facing problems for the last one or two weeks...When we went outside, the protesters would come in front of the car. They would cause a little trouble...The internet was shut down, which is why we couldn't tell our families anything, so we were a little worried...Wecouldn't even contact the embassy,” he said.A third Indian national, a resident of Jammu and Kashmir, highlighted the risks posed by the unrest. “I am a resident of Jammu and Kashmir... The protests there were dangerous. The Indian government has made a very good effort and brought the students back...” he said.Family members of those returning gathered at the airport to welcome them home. Among them was a family awaiting the arrival of an aunt who had travelled to Iran on pilgrimage. “My wife's aunt went to Iran on a pilgrimage...Iran has always been a good friend of India and we were very confident in the Modi government, which continuously supported...We thank the government of India for making this possible. We are very happy as our family member is returning to India,” a relative said.Another man waiting for his sister-in-law thanked the authorities for coordinating the evacuation. “My sister-in-law is returning from Iran today. There was a war-like situation in Iran, and the internet was down. We were not able to contact her by any means. We were worried...We are very happy that she is returning to India safely...We thank the Government of India for making arrangements for their return to India during these difficult times,” he said.A family member of two returnees said communication had been cut off for days. “My mother and aunt are returning from Iran. We were worried because we were unable to contact her for three days...They are returning to India today,” he said.Earlier, the Indian Embassy in Tehran issued an advisory asking Indian nationals, including students, businesspeople, pilgrims and tourists, to leave Iran using available transport options, including commercial flights, citing the “evolving situation.”Separately, the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi strongly advised Indians to avoid travel to Iran until further notice. It reiterated a January 5 advisory urging those already in the country to remain cautious and avoid protests or demonstrations.The unrest began at Tehran’s Grand Bazaar on December 28 over the sharp fall in the Iranian rial and later spread nationwide. The currency’s decline followed multiple crises, including severe water shortages, power outages, rising unemployment and surging inflation.","Several indian nationals, returned from iran, arriving at indira gandhi international airport in new delhi late on friday.

NEW DELHI: Questioning the legal shield granted to serving and former chief election commissioners (CEC) and election commissioners under a new law, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa on Friday described the provision as an “extraordinary protection. ”“I am not aware of any comparable protection available to other public institutions or public servants. In a democracy, accountability is paramount, and therefore this kind of legal shield, in my view, should not exist. Even if a right decision has been taken, it must still stand the test of being defended before a court of law,” Lavasa said on the sidelines of a panel discussion on accountability for the Election Commission (EC).The Supreme Court has agreed to examine a plea challenging the immunity granted to the chief election commissioner (CEC) and election commissioners under the CEC and EC Appointment Act, 2023.The petition contends that the provision confers “unprecedented, unbridled power” on the CEC and election commissioners by granting them permanent, blanket immunity from both civil and criminal proceedings, even in cases of alleged misuse of office.Clause 16 of the law states that no court shall entertain or continue any civil or criminal proceedings against any person who is or was a chief election commissioner or an election commissioner for any act, deed or statement committed, done or spoken while acting, or purporting to act, in the discharge of official duties or functions.Lavasa, who was appointed as one of two election commissioners in January 2018, resigned in August 2020 to join the Asian Development Bank (ADB). He drew national attention in 2019 after recording a dissenting opinion in a panel decision on complaints against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then BJP president Amit Shah during the Lok Sabha election campaign.","The supreme court has agreed to examine a plea challenging the immunity granted to the chief election commissioner (cec) and election commissioners under the cec and ec appointment act, 2023.

MCX Gold has regained its bullish momentum after a short consolidation phase and is now trading around the all-time high of 143,500. With upward strength reasserting itself and minimal signs of a reversal, the rally is likely to extend to higher levels. The recent breakout reinforces the strength of the move, and the overall outlook remains positive as long as prices stay above the breakout zone.From a weekly perspective, the 139,000 level remains a key support area, marking the lower boundary of the consolidation range. Any dip toward this zone is expected to attract fresh buying interest, thereby cushioning the downside in the near term. Holding above this support strengthens the bullish structure and maintains positive momentum.Gold appears well placed to advance toward the 151,000 level in the upcoming sessions. This prospective rise is in line with the broader bullish trend and underscores the strength of prevailing market momentum. Additionally, a decisive and sustained breakout above the consolidation range resistance has attracted fresh buying interest, reinforcing positive sentiment and setting the stage for a continued upward move.Overall, Gold remains well positioned to maintain its positive bias, with the broader technical structure clearly favouring trend continuation. As long as prices stay above the crucial 139,000 support, the bullish setup remains valid. With momentum indicators and overall market sentiment continuing to be supportive, the precious metal looks well placed for further upside in the sessions ahead.MCX Silver has recorded a new all-time high this week, continuing its pattern of higher highs seen over the past several months. With little indication of a slowdown, the overall bias stays positive, and any pullbacks are likely to attract buying interest. We advise trading in line with the prevailing trend, which remains strongly bullish.Silver’s early-week rally has underscored a renewed strength in the trend, increasing the probability of further upside. As long as prices hold above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias should remain intact. The immediate key support lies around the 266,000 mark, which may offer a favourable buying opportunity. Any dip toward this zone is expected to draw fresh buying interest, aiding price stability and preserving upward momentum.On the upside, Silver appears well placed to test the 320,000 resistance in the near to medium term. This projected advance represents a continuation of the existing bullish phase and is strongly backed by healthy market momentum and supportive technical indicators. Overall, as long as prices remain securely above the 266,000 support, Silver is likely to maintain its positive trajectory, with significant room for further gains as bullish sentiment continues to strengthen.","Gold and silver prices are expected to continue hitting new highs, says abhilash koikkara, head - forex & commodities, nuvama professional clients group.

Julio Rodríguez’s visit to his rebuilt Dominican Republic home shows gratitude and responsibility



For Julio Rodríguez, the offseason is not just about rest or preparation for another demanding MLB campaign. It is also a time to reconnect with his roots and reflect on the journey that shaped him. Recently, the Seattle Mariners center fielder visited the Dominican Republic home he helped rebuild last year, choosing a moment of quiet presence over publicity. The visit was understated and personal, far removed from packed stadiums and spotlight moments.As Rodríguez continues to rise as one of baseball’s most recognizable young stars, this return offered a deeper look into the values that continue to ground him. It was not about revisiting an achievement, but about staying connected to the place and people that remain central to his identity.The house that Rodríguez reconstructed is more than just a building. It is the appreciation, perpetuation and general duty towards community that supported him during his early years. Going to the house once more, Rodriguez demonstrated that giving back is not something to do at once, but on a regular basis.Those familiar with the visit described it as calm and intentional, centered on conversation and presence rather than recognition.When asked what he wanted in return for rebuilding the home, Rodríguez offered a response that resonated far beyond the moment. “All I’m asking for is a cup of coffee.”The quote reflected humility in its purest form. It did not concern recognition or reward, but time spent together and sincere connection. Fans quickly took to the comments to express their appreciation. One supporter wrote that Rodríguez is “on his way to winning the Roberto Clemente Award” for his impact beyond baseball. Another added, “You are a pride for us Dominicans,” echoing a sentiment repeated across social media.This visit made it clearer why Rodríguez has a bigger influence than box scores as he gets ready to enter the next chapter of his MLB career. To the fans, his visit back to the Dominican Republic was not only personal, but also brought back the fact that humility and purpose still lie at the core of his story.","Julio rodríguez visited the dominican republic home he helped rebuild last year.

Anthony Joshua’s Promise Explained: The Hidden Meaning Behind AJ’s ‘My Brother’s Keeper’ Pledge

Anthony Joshua returns to training as questions grow about his boxing future

Anthony Joshua is back in the gym, and his quiet return has caught the boxing world’s attention. Just weeks after a deadly car crash in Nigeria, the former two-time heavyweight world champion shared a short but powerful message that shows where his mind is right now. The 36-year-old boxer posted new workout photos and videos, giving fans a small look into how he is coping after a deeply painful moment in his life.Joshua was a passenger in a Lexus SUV that crashed into a parked truck near Lagos, Nigeria. While he survived with minor injuries, the accident killed two of his close friends and teammates, Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele. Their funerals were held in London on January 4. Joshua had been in Nigeria on holiday and visiting family, just days after knocking out YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul. After spending several days in the hospital, he was discharged on New Year’s Eve. Since then, many fans have wondered if he will ever fight again.This week, Anthony Joshua shared images on Snapchat showing him back in the gym. In the posts, he is seen hitting pads, riding a stationary bike, working on leg exercises, and even swimming. He called the session “mental strength therapy,” a phrase that clearly shows the focus of his return.One photo also showed his time on a cardio machine, with the caption, “I am a fighter.”Joshua also shared an old image from his 2017 fight at Wembley Stadium, where he was punched by heavyweight legend Wladimir Klitschko. The post felt reflective, mixing memories of his career with his present struggle.On January 6, Anthony Joshua’s uncle Adedamola Joshua told The Punch that the boxer had privately informed his family he planned to retire. He said, “The major thing there is that he has retired from boxing… Now that he has said that he’s leaving while the ovation is highest, we are happy.” However, Mirror Fighting later reported that Joshua has not yet made a final decision.Meanwhile, the legal case linked to the crash continues. On January 2, the Ogun State Police Command confirmed that the driver, Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, was charged at the Sagamu Magistrate Court. Police spokesperson DSP Oluseyi Babaseyi told AFP, “The defendant was granted bail in the sum of five million naira with two sureties. He was remanded pending when he meets his bail condition.”Anthony Joshua also narrowly avoided death. Reports said he was first seated in the front before being asked to move to the back. Speaking to Sky Sports, his promoter Eddie Hearn said, “When the time is right, I believe he will make his decision. You’ll hear it from him. The future of Anthony Joshua will be told by Anthony Joshua.”Also Read: Anthony Joshua Net Worth In 2025: Inside His Boxing Earnings, Career, And Payday Before Jake Paul Fight","Anthony joshua is back in the gym just weeks after a tragic car crash in nigeria.

Dana White Says Conor McGregor vs Michael Chandler NOT Happening at White House, Helwani Reacts

Dana White confirms UFC White House plans do not include Conor McGregor vs Michael Chandler

UFC president Dana White has ruled out a long-rumored fight between Conor McGregor and Michael Chandler for the planned UFC White House event in June 2026. His objective was to halt speculation that had recently resurfaced around the UFC card. According to MMA Insight, Dana White addressed the matter when asked by Complex News whether McGregor vs. Michael Chandler was a realistic option to headline the event. He said the matchup was discussed a couple of years ago and is not part of the UFC’s current plans, confirming that the fight has neither been booked nor actively worked on.After the clarification, there was still buzz around Michael Chandler’s public comments. Chandler spoke about the fight during a CBS New Year’s Eve broadcast and later referenced it again in an interview with ESPN, which led many fans to believe the bout was close to being finalized despite no official announcement. Dana White’s statement now establishes the promotion’s position and indicates that the matchup is not being pursued for the June 2026 UFC White House event.Dana White confirms that as of now, McGregor has not been confirmed for the White House event, and no opponent has been assigned.McGregor also later posted on social media, “Pick who ya want!” McGregor wrote on Twitter. “The Mac sweats nothing and nobody. I’m TASTY SHOTS.” His message did not include confirmation of a fight agreement, opponent, or date tied to the event.Michael Chandler has not issued a public response following Dana White’s comment, “We’ll see if Conor’s going to come back or not,” White said. “We’ve been talking about it for a while. We’ll see how it plays out.”At this stage, the UFC has not provided a timeline for when headline bouts for the White House event will be announced. Dana White has indicated that discussions with multiple fighters are ongoing, but no agreements have been finalized.With the event still months away, the promotion has left flexibility in its planning, and the final lineup is expected to be determined closer to June 2026 once fighter availability and scheduling are confirmed.Also Read: Is Dana White’s Zuffa Boxing bad news for boxers?

Why IShowSpeed deleted his Cairo IRL stream: Full details explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/why-ishowspeed-deleted-his-cairo-irl-stream-full-details-explained/articleshow/126591585.cms,"Image Via Instagram

“Speed Does Africa”

Why IShowSpeed removed the Cairo IRL stream after going live in Egypt





IShowSpeed surprised fans after deleting his Cairo, Egypt IRL stream from YouTube just hours after it went live. The stream was part of histour extension and came right after a historic moment where Speed became the first streamer to broadcast live from inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. Because of the hype around that achievement, many viewers expected the Cairo IRL stream to be one of the biggest highlights of the tour. Instead, its sudden removal sparked confusion, speculation, and viral discussion across social media.The deletion occurred on the 16th of January 2026 and quickly sparked many questions about what exactly went wrong. Though the full Cairo VOD for the IRL does not exist anymore, the pyramid video has continued to stream and has passed the million views milestone. This sort of deletion has piqued the interest of the fans even more, given the fact that it's not the Egyptian trip in general, but the Cairo experience, that seems to have been the problem.During the Cairo stream, Speed repeatedly spoke about strict rules and heavy restrictions around filming. He mentioned that almost everything required approval, which limited his ability to move freely and interact naturally with the city.Compared to earlier stops in Africa, such as Kenya and Ethiopia, Speed appeared visibly frustrated and openly said the Cairo experience felt disappointing. These comments stood out during the livestream and may have played a role in the decision to later remove the VOD.Another major problem was fan sniping. Eventually, large crowds of people started gathering around Speed, raising safety concerns and almost forcing the stream to go off the air early. This created a lot of speculation that local authorities or organizers must have intervened, considering how strict Egypt's laws concerning public filming are. Although nothing is declared on the government's side about the pressure it exerted, according to many, it was very difficult to handle because of the crowd issues along with the filming regulations.Interestingly, there is continuity with the live pyramid stream itself being live, possibly being properly approved and moderated. In contrast, the Cairo IRL live stream features some random events with interactions with the general public and expressions of frustration, possibly enough to make them uncomfortable with keeping this live.Ultimately, there has not been any official statement by IShowSpeed to explain the deletion. Fans are, for now, putting together pieces from the livestream, social media reactions, and what remains on his channel. The Cairo IRL stream may be gone, but the conversation on it keeps growing and makes it one of the talking points of his Africa tour.Also Read: IShowSpeed makes streaming history with first-ever live stream inside Egypt’s Great Pyramid",Ishowspeed deleted his cairo irl stream from youtube just hours after it went live.

Passports are often treated as background documents, noticed only at airports or borders. Yet their strength shapes how easily people can move across the world. Global passport rankings measure this strength by counting how many destinations can be entered without arranging a visa in advance. These include visa-free access, a visa on arrival, and electronic travel authorisation. The higher the number, the fewer barriers a traveller faces. In 2026, the latest Henley Passport Index reports again show a clear gap between the most powerful passports and the rest. The countries at the top benefit from long-standing diplomatic ties, economic stability, and reciprocal agreements.According to the Henley Passport Index ranking, India's passport has become slightly more powerful in 2026, albeit it is still not among the strongest in the world. While rising up to 80th rank, Indian visitors can now enter 55 countries without seeking for a visa in advance or receiving one upon arrival. For travellers, this ranking is about actual freedom more than reputation. They have an impact on cost, planning time, and the speed with which a voyage can be completed when the need or opportunity arises.Singapore holds the top position with access to 192 destinations.This marks its third consecutive year at number one. The passport’s strength reflects the country’s strong diplomatic reach and reputation for stability. While it lost visa-free access to a small number of countries over the past year, it gained entry to Papua New Guinea, keeping its overall score high. Singapore’s role as a financial and transport hub continues to support its global mobility.Japan and South Korea share second place with access to 188 destinations. Both countries have built extensive travel agreements over decades. Their passports benefit from trust built through trade, tourism, and political alignment with many regions. Although neither sits at the very top this year, they remain among the most flexible for short-notice international travel.Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland occupy third place with scores of 186. These countries benefit from European Union agreements alongside separate bilateral arrangements. Their citizens can move easily within Europe and beyond. Stability, strong institutions, and consistent foreign policy help maintain this level of access year after year.Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and the Netherlands all rank fourth with access to 185 destinations. The grouping reflects similar travel privileges rather than shared geography alone. These passports offer broad reach across the Americas, Asia, and Africa, supported by long-established diplomatic networks.Hungary, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the United Arab Emirates sit at rank five with 184 destinations. The UAE stands out as a newer entrant to the top tier, reflecting rapid diplomatic expansion. The European countries in this group continue to benefit from EU mobility and steady international relations.Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Malta, New Zealand, and Poland share sixth place with 183 destinations. These passports combine regional access with growing global reach. New Zealand’s inclusion highlights how geographic isolation does not prevent strong travel freedom when trust and agreements are in place.Australia, Latvia, Liechtenstein, and the United Kingdom rank seventh with 182 destinations. The UK remains high despite changes to its relationship with the European Union. Its passport still offers wide access, though the pace of expansion has slowed compared with earlier years.Canada joins Iceland and Lithuania at rank eight with access to 181 destinations. Canada’s position reflects steady, rather than growing, mobility. Its passport remains strong for leisure and business travel, even if it no longer leads the rankings.Malaysia ranks ninth with access to 180 destinations. It is the only Southeast Asian country in the top ten besides Singapore. Its passport strength reflects regional agreements and growing international ties, giving its holders broad travel options.The United States rounds out the top ten with access to 179 destinations. While still powerful, its passport has slipped slightly in recent years. Visa policy and reciprocity play a role, leaving it just below several peers in global mobility.","Henley passport index 2026 reveals world's most powerful passports.

Navid Afkari’s execution after protests shows the deadly cost of dissent in Iran

Navid Afkari dreamed of wearing Iran’s colors at the Olympics. Donald Trump tried to save his life and Dana White begged publicly for mercy. Still, in September 2020, the Iranian state hanged the 27-year-old wrestler. His death shocked the sports world and sent fear through a nation already hurting.If life had been fair, Afkari would have been training, traveling, and chasing medals. Instead, he was killed by the same country he loved after joining street protests. Iranian officials said he was guilty of murder. Afkari said again and again he was innocent. Human rights groups said his trial was unfair. What happened next showed how dangerous it can be to speak up in Iran.Afkari grew up in Shiraz, a city known for poetry and culture. Wrestling is Iran’s proudest sport, and Afkari was good at it from a young age. By 17, he was in a national camp. By 23, coaches saw him as a future Olympian. To support his training, he worked as a laborer during the day and trained whenever he could. His rise made him famous, and that fame later made him a target.In 2018, Iran faced large protests over rising prices and strict rules.Afkari joined those protests. Soon after, he and his two brothers were arrested and accused of killing a security guard. Afkari said he was tortured into a false confession. Amnesty International called his trial “grossly unfair,” saying he was not allowed a proper defense.Despite global anger, the courts sentenced Afkari to death. One charge was murder. Another was “waging war against the state” for protesting. His brothers received long prison terms, with one spending around 1,000 days in solitary confinement. Afkari’s claims of torture were never properly checked.On September 12, 2020, Afkari was hanged in Shiraz. His family was not allowed a final visit. The execution was rushed. United Nations later said the killing appeared to be used as a warning during growing unrest.Before his death, Afkari recorded a message from prison. He said he had faced many opponents in wrestling, but none as unfair as the system holding him. He said he was innocent and asked people not to forget him.Iran’s power system leaves little room for protest. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has final control. Online spaces are tightly watched, and many platforms are blocked. Journalist Masih Alinejad later said Afkari became a hero after death, not because he wanted fame, but because he spoke up.Trump and White both appealed publicly. Trump posted on Twitter asking Iran to spare Afkari’s life, linking to Fox News. White released a video saying Afkari was a human being and deserved mercy. Their efforts failed.After Afkari’s death, his grave was damaged many times. According to Iran International, officials even tried to control his headstone to stop it becoming a protest site. Years later, fear still surrounds those who speak out. Afkari’s story shows how little has changed, and how high the price of protest remains.Also Read: Olympic Swimmer Ryan Lochte Moves In With Girlfriend And Her Three Kids As Blended Family Grows Amid Divorce And Custody Battle",Iran hanged wrestler navid afkari at 27 after protests ignoring pleas from donald trump and dana white.

Allen Iverson’s ultimate financial safety net

The divorce settlement bifurcated Iverson’s trust fund



What is Allen Iverson doing now?



In the high-stakes world of NBA contracts, there are flashy max deals, and then there is the absolute masterclass in foresight known as the Allen Iverson Life Line. While he was busy breaking ankles and redefining league culture in the early 2000s, Allen Iverson’s team was quietly securing a financial legacy that would outlast his playing years by decades.It is one of the most legendary financial savings stories in sports history, and as Iverson, but as he inches closer to his mid-50s, it turns out he’s about to execute the greatest fast-break in the history of sports business: a $32 million trust fund courtesy of Reebok.Back in 2001, when Iverson was at his peak with the 2000-01 MVP award, he wrote history as the shortest player (6’0”) ever to win it. The same year, he also signed the ultimate financial safety net with Reebok. Taking into consideration his reputation as a lavish spender, Iverson’s agent and Reebok structured this unique lifetime contract that would support him in his post-league life.The deal included a yearly stipend in which Reebok will pay Iverson $800,000 every year for life. A lump sum trust fund of $32 million was set aside, but Iverson couldn’t touch it until he turned 55 years old. This year, on June 7th, Iverson will turn 51, and after 4 more years, in 2030, he can finally access this money.In a game of fate, Iverson lost his entire trust fund to his wife, Tawana Turner, after violating their postnuptial agreement. But Turner, instead of taking the entire check, decided to leave 50% with Iverson that saved him from financial ruin. When the fund finally matures in 2030, Iverson will likely walk away with $16 million, while the other $16 million goes to his ex-wife.Iverson’s career and life have given him some hard lessons about money. When his financial struggles hit the headlines, the world was shocked because this was the man who once ruled the NBA.In an interview in 2025, AI sat down and talked about how popularity and money had people circling him at one point, but with depleting finances, the circle became smaller and smaller.He said, “Just because you love somebody don't mean they love you the same way,"" he said. ""I made so many mistakes trusting people that you think supposed to love you. I'm not talking about friends that you grew up with … I'm talking about even family. Money is really the root of all evil.""In late 2023, Allen Iverson was appointed as the vice president of basketball in Reebok with Shaquille O’Neal as its president. This move wasn't just ceremonial, it brought Iverson back into the fold to help relaunch the brand's basketball category for the 2025-2026 season. He also published a memoir in 2025, Misunderstood, that dived deep into his upbringing, childhood, basketball, and becoming a cultural icon.Also read: The 21-year old Anthony Black announced himself to Europe with a poster dunk in Berlin","Allen iverson has a $32 million trust fund courtesy of reebok.

xAI and Grok are ‘public nuisance’





Ashley St Clair, American writer and mother of Elon Musk’s son Romulus has sued the tech billionaire’s AI company xAI. In the lawsuit filed with the supreme court of the state of New York, Clair alleges that her explicit images were generated by AI chatbot Grok, including one in which she was underage. She further claims that the AI tool, integrated into X (formerly Twitter) – also owned by Elon Musk – promised to stop generating explicit images but continued to do so. Clair is seeking both punitive and compensatory damages from the company.The lawsuit comes days after the tech billionaire said that he will seek full custody of his one-year-old son with Clair. Responding to a user urging him for full custody, Musk wrote on X “I will be filing for full custody today, given her statements implying she might transition a one-year-old boy.”The lawsuit states that the social media company “retaliated against her, demonetising her X account and generating multitudes more images of her, including unlawful images of her in sex positions, covered in semen, virtually nude, and images of her as a child naked”.The filing further alleges that not only were the generated images nonconsensual, but “Grok and xAI also had explicit knowledge that St Clair was not consenting to the creation or dissemination of these images because of her requests for removal”.Ashley St Clair is being represented by Carrie Goldberg, a victims’ rights lawyer. In a statement to the Guardian, Goldberg said:“xAI is not a reasonably safe product and is a public nuisance. Nobody has born the brunt more than Ashley St Clair. Ashley filed suit because Grok was harassing her by creating and distributing nonconsensual, abusive, and degrading images of her and publishing them on X.“This harm flowed directly from deliberate design choices that enabled Grok to be used as a tool of harassment and humiliation. Companies should not be able to escape responsibility when the products they build predictably cause this kind of harm.
