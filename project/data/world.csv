⁠India and Qatar to celebrate Year of Culture and friendship in future

NEW DELHI: India and Qatar upgraded their ties to a strategic partnership as PM Narendra Modi held bilateral talks with the visiting Qatar Amir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, discussing ways to enhance cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and security. Qatar committed to investing $ 10 billion in India, as it announced Qatar Investment Authority will open an office in India.The leaders spoke about signing a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and agreed to double the current $ 14 billion bilateral trade in the next 5 years. Apart from the establishment of strategic partnership, 6 other deals were signed including a revised agreement for avoidance of double taxation and another for financial and economic collaboration. They also agreed agreed to expedite negotiations for the India-Qatar Bilateral Investment Treaty.Qatar is the 5th GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) country with which India has signed a strategic partnership agreement, after UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait.Modi and Al-Thani discussed the West Asia situation, reiterating their respective positions on the Gaza situation and emphasising the need for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve conflicts. Qatar is a key player in Gaza ceasefire efforts and, as US President Donald Trump proposes a takeover of the Strip, its foreign ministry said Tuesday Palestinians will decide the future of Gaza. India has also reiterated its support for the 2-state solution after Trump announced his plan to relocate Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt.The leaders unequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including cross-border terrorism and agreed to jointly combat the menace through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms.“They agreed to enhance cooperation in information and intelligence sharing, developing and exchanging experiences, best practices and technologies, capacity building and to strengthen cooperation in law enforcement, anti-money laundering, drug-trafficking, Cybercrime and other transnational crimes,’’ said the joint statement. Modi and the Amir spoke about promoting cooperation in cybersecurity, including prevention of use of cyberspace for terrorism and radicalisation.The Qatari leader had last year pardoned 85 Indian prisoners, including the 8 Indian navy veterans who had been sentenced to death for military espionage. Modi had personally thanked Al-Thani for their release during his visit to Doha last year but one of the men, Purnendu Tiwari, remains in Qatar because of a financial fraud case against him. A travel ban is said to have been imposed on him.“Regarding the Navy official who is still over there, I would like to just say his matter remains sub judice in the local courts in Qata,’’ said MEA Secretary Arun Chatterjee, who handled overseas Indian affairs. The official added that the PM appreciated the work that Amir has done for the protection and welfare of Indian citizens. Qatar is home to 800,000 Indian nationals.The official said that while talks are underway for an India- GCC FTA, India and Qatar at the bilateral level will look at the possibility of having an FTA in the future.According to the joint statement, Qatar commended the steps taken by India in ensuring a conducive environment for Foreign Direct Investment and Foreign Institutional Investment and expressed interest to explore investment opportunities in different sectors, including infrastructure, technology, manufacturing, food security and hospitality. “In this regard, the Qatar side announced a commitment to invest $ 10 billion in India,’ it said, adding Indian side also appreciated Qatar’s efforts in enhancing its investment environment and its initiatives to attract Foreign Direct Investment.“India also recognized Qatar’s growing role as a regional hub for goods and services, leveraging its strategic location, world-class infrastructure, and business-friendly policies,’’ said the statement.","Qatar committed to investing $ 10 billion in india, as it announced qatar investment authority will open an office in india.

Justice Surya Kant questioned: ""Where is the question of an individual's morality? Who on earth would like these kinds of words? You are insulting parents. This is something very dirty in his mind that has been vomited out in this kind of a programme.""

He further rebuked, ""Parents will feel ashamed, daughters and sisters will feel ashamed, your younger brother will feel ashamed, the entire society will feel ashamed.""

The bench asked, ""If this is not obscenity, then what is the standard of obscenity?""

What’s next for Allahbadia?

NEW DELHI: A crude joke on India’s Got Latent , a show hosted by comedian Samay Raina, has landed YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia—popularly known as BeerBiceps—into legal trouble. His comment about parents and sex, which went viral on February 10, sparked public outrage and multiple FIRs against him and fellow comedians Ashish Chanchlani, Jaspreet Singh, and Apoorva Makhija.Even as the Supreme Court shielded Allahbadia from immediate arrest on Tuesday, the judges did not hold back their criticism. ""This is vulgarity. You have a dirty mind,"" the bench observed, making it clear that legal immunity did not equate to moral approval.Multiple FIRs were lodged against Allahbadia across states, prompting senior advocate Abhinav Chandrachud to seek relief. The Supreme Court, while granting interim protection, made its disapproval clear.The court directed Allahbadia and his associates to halt any further shows until further orders, bluntly stating, “Stop this show business for the time being.”Chandrachud admitted he found Allahbadia’s words “disgusting” but questioned whether they warranted criminal prosecution. The bench fired back: “Does this judgment (on obscenity) give you a license to speak all kinds of vulgarity? Can he spew his depraved mind anywhere and anytime?""The case reignites the debate on free speech and comedy in India. From Kunal Kamra’s judiciary jabs to Munawar Faruqui’s jail time for alleged religious slander, comedians have repeatedly faced legal action. The court noted, “Society has self-evolved values. What are those parameters? We want to hear from the petitioner and other artists—how do you define your limits?”Allahbadia’s counsel cited threats from a former wrestler and legislator, which had made it unsafe for him to travel where FIRs were filed. The court dismissed this, saying, “If you seek cheap publicity with abusive language, someone issuing threats also wants to be popular.” However, it condemned vigilantism, asserting, “This is not a people’s court. The judicial system will take its course.”The SC ordered Allahbadia to submit his passport to Thane police and barred him from leaving India. It also sought responses from the Centre, Maharashtra, and Assam governments on clubbing the FIRs. The next hearing is set for March 3.With the SC’s fiery remarks and an ongoing legal battle, Allahbadia’s case could set a precedent for comedians and content creators navigating the boundaries of speech, humor, and public outrage in India.The uproar against Allahbadia is part of a larger pattern where comedians have frequently faced the law for their content. Over the years, stand-up acts, roasts, and even satirical tweets have landed several artists in legal trouble.Not just YouTubers and stand-up comedians, but even mainstream TV and film personalities have faced the heat.Despite the temporary relief from the Supreme Court, Allahbadia is still facing multiple FIRs. The case underscores a recurring pattern—where humorists find themselves caught between free speech and legal scrutiny.","The uproar against allahbadia is part of a larger pattern where comedians have frequently faced the law for their content.

Vijay Mallya claims in London court that Indian banks pursuing him are ‘acting in bad faith’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vijay-mallya-claims-in-london-court-that-indian-banks-pursuing-him-are-acting-in-bad-faith/articleshow/118365672.cms,"The TOI correspondent from London:

Fugitive Indian businessman Vijay Mallya ’s barrister told a London court that the banks pursuing Mallya are “acting in bad faith” and not being transparent as he made a failed attempt to adjourn Mallya’s appeal hearing against his bankruptcy order in the London high court on the first day of its hearing on Tuesday.Alastair Tomson, representing Mallya, told the court that Mallya's writ petition in the high court of Karnataka on Feb 5 could “soon” lead to “new evidence” relevant to whether the bankruptcy order should ever have been made and applied for the appeal hearing to be adjourned.Judge Sir Anthony Mann dismissed the adjournment application on the spot, questioning how long a case in India would take to reach its conclusion. “Anecdotal evidence shows me ‘soon’ in Indian courts is not necessarily soon. A lot of cases take a long time in India,” Mann said.He also did not allow late evidence from Mallya, which included the writ petition.Mallya was declared bankrupt by the insolvency and companies courtin London on July 26, 2021 for failing to clear a judgment debt of £1.05 billion (Rs 11,499 crore) determined by the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Karnataka, in 2017, which was registered in the English courts.Tomson said that Mallya believes that the State Bank of India (SBI)-led consortium pursued bankruptcy proceedings against him “in bad faith”, the banks have made recoveries which “satisfied the judgment debt twice over”, and incorrect information was given in various proceedings.He said Mallya believes the “consortium has concealed and misrepresented the details of recoveries made” and that there is “no accountability of the assets recovered.” He said they have suppressed facts and at the same time taken advantage of accruing interest, which is “unprecedented in debt recovery”. “The intent of these extortionate actions is to recover far in excess of what is due to the petitioners, which is arbitrary, unlawful and unconstitutional,” Tomson said.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made a statement in Parliament in Dec 2024 detailing banks had recovered Rs 14,131.6 crore from Mallya. This triggered Mallya to write to the chief manager of SBI on Dec 24, 2024, in which he criticised the way banks got a worldwide freeze order against him in and asserted that SBI was involved in “deception” by realising his assets whilst allowing interest on the judgment debt to accrue, Tomson said. SBI has not responded.Tony Beswetherick KC, representing the banks, opposed the adjournment and new evidence and said there is no evidence the Karnataka high court will grant the relief sought.Mallya (69) switched law firms last week and instructed Zaiwalla & Co.The chancery division of the high court is hearing three appeals combined into one hearing this week. The banks are appealing having to file an amended bankruptcy petition whilst Mallya is appealing the bankruptcy order and the amended petition.","Mallya was declared bankrupt by the insolvency and companies courtin london on july 26, 2021 for failing to clear a judgment debt of £1.05 billion (rs 11,499 crore) determined by the debt recovery tribunal, karnataka, in 2017.

Delhi Earthquake News: Why did the 4.0-magnitude earthquake in Delhi-NCR feel so strong?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-did-the-4-0-magnitude-earthquake-in-delhi-ncr-feel-so-strong/articleshow/118315557.cms,"Why did the tremors feel so strong?



Epicentre within Delhi: Since the earthquake originated beneath the city, seismic waves had less distance to travel, making the tremors feel more intense.

Shallow depth: Earthquakes that occur closer to the Earth's surface generate stronger shaking compared to deeper quakes of similar magnitude.

Urban infrastructure: High-rise buildings in Delhi, Noida, and Ghaziabad sway more due to their height, amplifying the sensation of shaking.

Soil composition: Soft alluvial soil in some areas of Delhi can amplify seismic waves, further intensifying the tremors.

Why did the earthquake occur?

How earthquake intensity changes with magnitude

NEW DELHI: Residents of Delhi-NCR and several parts of northern India were jolted awake early Monday morning as strong tremors shook high-rise buildings , prompting many to rush outside. The earthquake, measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale, struck at 5:36 AM IST with its epicentre located within Delhi's Dhaula Kuan, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).Though a 4.0-magnitude quake is considered moderate, its impact felt stronger than usual because of its shallow depth and close proximity to densely populated areas. Earthquakes with epicentres within a city result in more intense shaking since seismic waves travel a shorter distance before reaching structures, amplifying the tremors.Delhi, which falls in Seismic Zone IV , is prone to moderate-to-strong earthquakes, making localised tremors more pronounced as the. Experts noted that buildings, particularly high-rises, sway more due to their design, increasing the perceived intensity of shaking.Authorities have reported no major damage or casualties, but the sudden tremors sparked concern among residents. Seismologists continue to monitor aftershocks and have advised citizens to stay informed about earthquake preparedness measures.However, National Centre for Seismology Director OP Mishra said, ""The epicentre was at Jheel Park in Dhaula Kuan, it was a 4.0 magnitude earthquake . It was in the depth of 5 km, it is called shallow depth, hence people felt the effect. People getting panicked was natural. Seismologically, it is not new region, earthquakes have happened earlier in the region. Earlier, there was 4.6 magnitude earthquake in 6 km periphery, but it was deeper, with 10 km depth. There is a difference. It was not a plate tectonic earthquake, it was due to in situ material heterogeneity, it was due to local effect. We can expect aftershock of around 1 or 1.2 magnitude.""See how close were you from the epicenter: Dhaula Kuan Delhi sits near active fault lines, including the Delhi-Hardwar Ridge and the Mahendragarh-Dehradun fault, making it prone to moderate seismic activity. The tremors were caused by tectonic plate movement along one of these fault lines, where stress builds up over time and is eventually released as an earthquake.The intensity of an earthquake is measured on the logarithmic Richter scale, where each whole-number increase represents a tenfold increase in the amplitude of seismic waves and about 32 times more energy release. This means that even small changes in magnitude can have a dramatic impact.For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 4.0 produces 10 times stronger shaking and releases 32 times more energy than a 3.0. Similarly, a 5.0-magnitude earthquake shakes 10 times more than a 4.0 and releases 32 times more energy. By the time an earthquake reaches magnitude 6.0, the shaking is 1,000 times stronger than a 3.0, and the energy released is 32,000 times greater. This exponential increase is why a seemingly small rise in magnitude can lead to severe destruction, especially in urban areas.","The earthquake, measuring 4.0 on the richter scale, struck at 5:36 am ist. The epicentre was located within delhi's dhaula kuan, according to the national centre for seismology. No major damage or casualties have been reported, but the tremors sparked concern among residents.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118319192,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-4133549,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
'They have a lot more money': US President Donald Trump questions $21 million USAID fund for 'voter turnout' in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/they-have-a-lot-more-money-us-president-donald-trump-questions-21-million-usaid-fund-for-voter-turnout-in-india/articleshow/118368852.cms,"BJP, Congress demand probe into 'external interference' in polls



NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday asked the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that the country is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"". This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.""Why are we giving $21 million to India? They have a lot more money. They are one of the highest taxing countries in the world in terms of us; we can hardly get in there because their tariffs are so high,"" he asked while signing executive orders at Mar-a-Lago.Categorically mentioning that he had ""a lot of respect"" for PM Narendra Modi, Trump questioned the funding. ""I have a lot of respect for India and their prime minister, but giving $21 million for voter turnout?"" he said. The two leaders recently held bilateral talks where they discussed trade, illegal immigration, defence and energy, among other key sectors.The Musk-led department had last week shared a list of areas from where it had decided to revoke the US aid. One of those included -- ""$21M for voter turnout in India"" -- prompting political slugfest between the BJP and the Congress in the country.The BJP has renewed its call for an investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, former CEC SY Quraishi clarified that while the Election Commission had an understanding with USAID, no financial assistance was involved.“So, DOGE has discovered that USAID allocated $21 million for ‘voter turnout’ in India, a euphemism for paying voters to cast their votes to effect regime change. Veena Reddy was sent to India in 2021 (ominous?) as head of USAID’s Indian mission. Post Lok Sabha elections 2024 (presumably her voter turnout mission done), she returned to US. Pity because investigating agencies here could have asked her some questions about who this money was given to for applying it to voter turnout operations,” BJP MP Mahesh Jethmalani said.The Congress party has also condemned foreign interference in India's electoral process, urging the Modi government to probe USAID’s claims and take action if any wrongdoing is uncovered.","Bjp, congress demand probe into 'external interference' in polls.

NEW DELHI: A day after Gyanesh Kumar was appointed as the Chief Election Commissioner, Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would endeavour to conduct the final hearing on a bunch of petitions challenging the validity of a Parliament-enacted law that altered the composition of the SC-devised panel for the selection of the CEC and ECs. The law included a Cabinet minister in the panel, excluding the Chief Justice of India.Advocate Prashant Bhushan requested a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh to take up the hearing on the petitions, which are almost at the fag end of the list of cases scheduled to be heard on Wednesday, to be taken on priority and for issuance of instructions to that effect to the SC officials concerned. The bench declined to issue any direction but said it would hear the matters.A little later, solicitor general Tushar Mehta sought adjournment of a petition on alleged encounter killings in Assam, a case in which the petitioner is represented by Bhushan, which the bench agreed to.Bhushan said the Assam encounter case can be adjourned but the matter relating to the EC selection process cannot wait as it is very important for holding free and fair elections .A five-judge SC bench on March 2, 2023 in the Anoop Baranwal case had noticed a vacuum in parliamentary legislation on the process for selection of CEC and ECs and directed that a panel comprising the Prime Minister, the leader of the opposition and the Chief Justice of India would advise the President on appointments to the Election Commission of India. The bench said this court-crafted panel will continue to operate till Parliament enacts a law in this regard.In Dec 2023, both Houses of Parliament passed the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Officer and Terms of Office) Bill, which became a law on getting the President's assent on Dec 29, 2023. The law replaced Chief Justice of India with a Union Cabinet minister (to be nominated by the PM) in the committee.Many petitions were immediately filed before Supreme Court alleging that the law violated the spirit of the SC judgment, which was to maintain the independence of ECI. On Jan 12, 2024, a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna (now CJI) and Dipankar Datta refused to stay the operation of the legislation.The CJI has recused from hearing PILs on the ground that these are seeking CJI's inclusion in the selection panel.","Sc had refused to stay law on cec appointment.

Vance: Fact check: JD Vance's free speech attack claims debunked,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fact-check-jd-vances-free-speech-attack-claims-debunked/articleshow/118345177.cms,"US Vice President JD Vance has attacked Europe over free speech, citing several instances where people weren't allowed to express themselves online or pray in public and at home. Are the claims smoke and mirrors?During his recent visit at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, US Vice President JD Vance claimed European freedom of speech was in decline. DW's Team Fact check takes a closer look at some of his examples and provides context surrounding these cases.Claim: The Scottish government has allegedly warned citizens that praying at home could be illegal. ""The Scottish government began distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay within so-called Safe Access Zones, warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law,"" Vance said. ""Naturally, the government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime.""DW Fact check: Misleading.While it is true that Scotland introduced so-called Safe Access Zones within 200 meters (about 650 feet) of abortion clinics in September 2024 and banned ""silent prayer"" and similar pressure-building activities to keep women from going through with abortions, silent prayer at home with no distress to others is not included in the ban.However, the law does stipulate that even activities that can be seen or heard within the zone and are ""done intentionally or recklessly"" in a private place within the area (like a house) between the protected premises and the boundary of a zone could be an offense.It's a common tactic by US anti-abortion activists, so-called ""pro-lifers,"" to gather in front of abortion clinics, handing out fliers, showing photos of fetuses or using the cover of prayer to intimidate women entering the clinics to pressure them into keeping the baby.""This is shocking and shameless misinformation from Vice President JD Vance,"" said Gillian Mackay, Member of the Scottish Parliament on X, who had introduced the Safe Access Zones bill.She said that while the letter encouraged people to report anything they thought violated the law, the police would give the same encouragement for every other law in the country.""The letter was sent to households to inform them of what the zones mean for them. As we discussed in the passage of the Act, no individual behavior is criminalized. Silent prayer or praying in your own home are not illegal as stated by the VP,"" she wrote on X. ""This is simply scaremongering.""Claim: A British man was charged for silently praying in front of an abortion clinic on behalf of an unborn son he and his former girlfriend had aborted, Vance said. ""A little over two years ago, the British government charged Adam Smith-Connor, a 51-year-old physiotherapist and an army veteran, with the heinous crime of standing 50 meters from an abortion clinic and silently praying for three minutes."" He was found guilty of breaking the ""government's new buffer zones law"" and was sentenced to pay ""thousands of pounds in legal costs to the prosecution.""DW Fact check: Misleading.Adam Smith-Connor was convicted of breaching a safe zone by praying outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth in November 2022, after refusing repeated requests to leave the area. He was handed a 100-pound fine which he didn't pay, triggering a court case. Ultimately, he was given a two-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay prosecution costs to the tune of 9,000 pounds ($11,300, €10,800).The Public Spaces Protection Order was introduced outside the Bournemouth clinic in October 2022 to create buffer zones around abortion clinics to stop women from being harassed or having to pass by vigils.The son Smith-Connor said he was praying for was aborted over 20 years ago.Smith-Connor is receiving legal support from an American conservative Christian legal advocacy group that has been labeled a ""hate group."" He has appealed the decision.Claim: ""I look to Brussels, where EU commissars warn citizens that they intend to shut down social media during times of civil unrest the moment they spot what they've judged to be, quote, 'hateful content,'"" Vance said in Munich.DW Fact check: Misleading.After quick research around JD Vance's claim on EU commissars warning about shutting down social media during times of civil unrest, we found different media reports referring to the topic back in July 2023. They cited former European Commissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton , referring to the possibility of a shutdown under EU's content moderation law only ""in extreme cases"" and following due process if they didn't crack down problematic content during riots. In his statements, Breton cites and refers to the Digital Services Act ( DSA ), adopted in 2022 and fully applicable since 2024.Breton's comments were a response to French President Emmanuel Macron raising the possibility of blocking social media platforms during civil unrest in the country after the police killing of 17-year-old Nahel Mezouk in a Paris suburb. Article 19, a British human rights organization, and other organizations raised concerns over Breton's comments.But does the DSA actually allow EU Member States to shut down social media during times of unrest like JD Vance claims?The DSA regulates online intermediaries and platforms, such as social networks, content-sharing platforms and app stores and addresses issues like illegal content, transparent advertising and disinformation. According to the European Commission, the main goal of the act is ""to prevent illegal and harmful activities online and the spread of disinformation.""In its fourth chapter, under Article 51, the DSA establishes the powers of the Digital Services Coordinator, the authority designated by an EU Member State to supervise providers of intermediary services and enforce their regulation.The act states in Article 51, Section 3b that if Digital Services Coordinators consider that an infringement that is causing serious harm and entails a criminal offense involving a threat to the life or safety of persons has not been remedied, they can request a competent judicial authority to order the temporary restriction of access of recipients to the service concerned by the infringement. If this is not technically feasible, the provider's online interface on which the infringement takes place can be restricted.This measure, however, is the last of a series of mechanisms against platforms that don't comply with the EU legal framework.

"Senior EC member Gyanesh Kumar new CEC, Haryana chief secretary Vivek Joshi on panel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/senior-ec-member-gyanesh-kumar-new-cec-haryana-chief-secretary-vivek-joshi-on-panel/articleshow/118338829.cms,"NEW DELHI: Gyanesh Kumar , election commissioner since March 2024, was on Monday appointed as chief election commissioner (CEC), maintaining the convention of the seniormost election commissioner being elevated to the top post. However, for the first time, this convention was adhered to with the approval of the selection committee comprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and leader of the opposition in Lok sabha Rahul Gandhi. Vivek Joshi , a serving 1989 batch IAS officer currently posted as Haryana chief secretary, has been appointed as election commissioner, restoring the EC’s strength to a three-member body following the retirement of incumbent Rajiv Kumar . Joshi had earlier served as secretary, personnel in Govt of India, and as Registrar general of Indian and census commissioner of India. He, as RGI, was to conduct the census 2021 before it had to be postponed on account of the Covid outbreak in March 2020.Kumar, a retired 1988 batch IAS officer allocated to the Kerala cadre, has served in several key positions in his home cadre and at the centre. He retired in January last year as secretary of the ministry of cooperation. He was an additional secretary in charge of J&K division in the home ministry when Article 370 was nullified in the erstwhile state.Joshi, going purely by the seniority principle, will be CEC after Gyanesh Kumar retires on January 27, 2029 upon turning 65 years of age. Election commissioner Sukhbir Singh Sandhu’s tenure in Nirvachan sadan is due to end on July 6, 2028.Joshi, who is 58 years old, will have a tenure of 5 years until February 2030. This means that he will be CEC during the 2029 general election to the Lok sabha and also hold all the state/UT elections as election commissioner and CEC. His experience as RGI and Census commissioner is expected to come in handy during the delimitation exercise, which is to be based on the next census taken after 2026. The delimitation commission has the chief election commissioner or his nominee as an ex-officio member.LoP in Lok sabha Rahul Gandhi submitted a dissent note during the meeting of the selection committee here on Monday. He is said to have asked the government to wait until February 19, when the Supreme court is due to hear the petition challenging the current composition of the selection panel, before picking the next CEC. The demand was however declined.This is the first time since enactment of the CEC and Other ECs (Appointment, conditions of service and term of office) Act, 2023, that a CEC has been appointed by a collegium or selection committee. Both Kumar and Sandhu were appointed as election commissioners in March last year, by the selection committee as proposed by the law.The legislation followed the direction of the Supreme court to the government in March 2023 to set up a committee comprising the Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India and LoP in the Lok Sabha as members, until the Parliament enacted a law providing for a collegium process for appointment of the CEC and election commissioners.Until the SC ruling in March 2023, all appointments to the post of CEC and election commissioners were made by a simple executive order, with no say or role of the opposition. A regular law on appointment and terms of service of the three EC members was eventually enacted in December 2023, though it provides for a selection committee comprising the PM, a minister to be nominated by the PM, and LoP in Lok sabha.The Supreme Court, at the last hearing of the challenge against the composition of the selection committee, had declined to interfere with pending appointments in the CEC necessitated by the completion of incumbent Rajiv Kumar’s tenure. The matter is due to be heard next Wednesday.","Gyanesh kumar, election commissioner since march 2024, appointed as chief election commissioner (cec) vivek joshi, serving 1989 batch ias officer currently posted as haryana chief secretary, has been appointed as election commissioner.

He also said China remained the foremost security threat and economic challenge.In an interview, Pitroda, who is head of Indian Overseas Congress, said, ""What is this threat from China? I think it has been blown out of proportion at times as the US has this habit of defining an enemy. Our attitude is that of confrontation from day one and that attitude creates enemies and that attitude creates some support. To assume that China is enemy from day one is not fair; not fair to China not fair to everyone.""""India should not look at China as an enemy country, rather it should respect its growth. Confrontational attitude creates enemies and we need to change that pattern. China is not our enemy... This attitude creates support in the country. It is time to increase our communication. It is time for us to collaborate, cooperate and co-create, and not have this command and control mindset,"" said Pitroda.The counter from BJP came fast. ""All these things make clear the agenda of harming India. The 'mohabbat ki dukan' of Congress is for anti-national forces, be it George Soros or China,"" BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said.Pitroda's comments are an insult to Indian military and the sacrifices made by its personnel, invoking the Galwan clash in which 20 army personnel laid down their lives while an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died too, Trivedi said. He added that India wants good relations with every country, adding it will be, however, done by maintaining its prestige and security.Pitroda also said, ""Some nations will grow slowly; some will grow fast. The developed nations will grow faster but such countries will have an ageing population as well. On the other side, developing economies will take time to grow and will have dividend of the demography. It is always good for world leaders to meet each other and bond with each other. It is always good to have more and more foreign interactions.

What was written in OHCHR report?



Deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina blamed Bangladesh's interim government leader Muhammad Yunus for the country's ""lawlessness"" and vowed to return back to her country.During a one-on-one interaction on Zoom with widows of four policemen killed during last July’s student uprising, Hasina claimed Yunus has ""unleashed terrorists"" on its citizens, PTI news agency reported.Hasina's 16-year Awami League administration ended following a student uprising on August 5, 2024, forcing her to seek refuge in India.Hasina said, ""He (Yunus) dissolved all inquiry committees and unleashed terrorists to butcher people. They are destroying Bangladesh.""The conversation, which surfaced on social media on Tuesday, showed Hasina comforting grieving family members whilst expressing her intention to return and seek justice for the fallen officers.""I will return and avenge the deaths of our policemen,"" she declared, noting that she had narrowly escaped death during her government's collapse, attributing her survival to divine intervention ""to do something good.""""Yunus has no experience in running a government,"" the former prime minister stated, adding, ""We need to put an end to this lawlessness.""In previous social media appearances, Hasina accused Yunus of orchestrating ""a long, and well-designed plot to oust her government and grab the state power.""Meanwhile, the office of Bangladesh's interim government said on Tuesday that securing the extradition of Sheikh Hasina from India was their top priority.""This is the government's top priority,"" chief adviser Yunus' press secretary Shafiqul Alam said during a media briefing that the administration would persist in its attempts to bring Hasina back for a personal trial.During the briefing, he indicated that whilst the Bangladeshi public and political organisations would determine the future of her ""fascist"" Awami League, individuals allegedly responsible for killings, forced disappearances and other offences must face legal consequences.The spokesperson referenced the Office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights' (OHCHR) fact-finding report from the previous week, which indicated Hasina's involvement in crimes against humanity during her leadership.According to the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), he noted that following the publication of UN and human rights organisations' reports, there was increased pressure for India to return Hasina to Bangladesh.The UN human rights office (OHCHR) issued a report last week detailing the unrest in Bangladesh that resulted in approximately 1,400 fatalities. The report was titled 'Human Rights Violations and Abuses related to the Protests of July and August 2024 in Bangladesh'.The document examined events from July 1 to August 15, encompassing student protests demanding Hasina's removal and subsequent attacks on Awami League supporters and minority groups, including Hindus.The findings revealed that the Awami League administration under Hasina responded with severe measures against protesters, resulting in ""hundreds of extrajudicial killings.""Police headquarters, now substantially reorganised under the interim administration, confirmed that a minimum of 44 police personnel, including officers, lost their lives during the upheaval.The UN report indicated that 450 of the nation's 639 police stations suffered destruction or damage from mob violence during the period surrounding the Awami League government's collapse.""After Sheikh Hasina left the country on August 5 last year, revenge violence surged,"" stated the OHCHR report, noting that violent groups attacked and set fire to numerous police facilities.The UN rights office reported that in numerous instances, police personnel either abandoned their posts or received permission to leave from their commanders, whilst in other situations, officers faced mob violence resulting in their deaths.","'extradition of sheikh hasina top priority' for bangladesh's interim government.

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

US department of government efficiency head Elon Musk on Monday claimed to discover ""the biggest fraud in history"" after he found over 20 million individuals listed in the Social Security database as centenarians.In a social media post on X, Musk shared a chart showing age distribution from zero to 369 years and noted the number of 'eligible' social security numbers exceeded the US population.""According to the Social Security database, these are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to FALSE!"" Musk said.According to a report by the New York Post, the revelation was previously documented by the Social Security Administration's (SSA) oversight body. A July 2023 audit identified 18.9 million people listed as centenarians in the database, despite only 86,000 actual centenarians living in the US according to Census data.A previous March 2015 audit also found 6.5 million individuals over 112 years old with Social Security numbers but no death records, though only 35 people globally had reached that age.Both audits confirmed that virtually none received Social Security payments, despite records showing individuals born in 1886 and 1893 as living. Approximately 18.4 million hadn't received benefits or reported income for 50 years, suggesting they were deceased.The report attributes this to historical limitations: ""We believe it likely SSA did not receive or record most of the 18.9 million individuals' death information primarily because the individuals died decades ago—before the use of electronic death reporting.""Of those listed, 44,000 were receiving benefits, including 13 over age 112. Salustiano Sanchez-Blazquez, the world's oldest man at 112 - a musician, coal miner and gin rummy enthusiast from western New York - passed away shortly after the first audit commenced.The audits revealed 531 million unique Social Security numbers in circulation, with potential identity fraud cases. The 2015 audit identified roughly $3.1 billion in earnings reported using incorrect Social Security numbers.Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute noted many numbers belonged to ""illegal immigrants paying in, not fraudulent recipients taking out."" He told The Post that migrants were ""stealing identities of people who are deceased but not marked in the Social Security system.""Experts believe Musk accessed the ""Numident"" list, containing all numbers issued since 1936. A former SSA employee explained some individuals have multiple numbers, either due to fraud or as victims requiring new numbers.Other federal agencies have faced similar issues. The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation made $127 million in overpayments to a Teamsters' pension fund with nearly 3,500 deceased members during Joe Biden's presidency, later settling with the DOJ.Ida May Fuller, born in 1874, became the first US Social Security recipient in January 1940, collecting $22,888.92 until her death in 1975.SSA representatives haven't yet responded to comment requests.","Us department of government efficiency head elon musk on monday claimed to discover ""the biggest fraud in history"" after he found over 20 million individuals listed in the social security database as centenarians.

You have leadership now that’s allowed a war to go on that should have never even happened,” Trump said, never mentioning Russia’s role in launching the invasion.Trump also criticised Zelenskyy for misplacing funds the US has been giving Ukraine throughout the war.“Where is all the money that’s been given? Where is it going? And nobody, I’ve never seen an accounting of it. We give hundreds of billions of dollars. I don’t see any accounting.

The White House on Tuesday shared a video titled "" ASMR : Illegal Alien Deportation Flight"" showing immigrants in shackles boarding a deportation flight. According to CNBC News, the flight departed from Seattle.The post shared on X features various clips of officers preparing restraints, chaining deportees, detainees walking in chains, and individuals boarding a plane.The White House’s use of the term ASMR in this context drew reactions online, including from billionaire Elon Musk , who responded with: “Haha wow.”The 40-second video includes close-up shots of handcuffs being laid out, officers securing restraints, and detainees walking up steel steps to the aircraft. None of the individuals’ faces are visible. The video was originally posted by the Seattle office of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with the caption: ""REMOVAL FLIGHT. A group of undocumented aliens are flown from Seattle as part of a process to finalize return to their home countries,"" CNBC reports.Other X users also reacted to the video, with one calling its posting on the White House's official account ""based."" Another questioned, ""How much did this security theatre cost the American taxpayer?"" A third user expressed surprise, saying, ""I never thought I would hear an ASMR video of deportation.""ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, is a relaxing, tingling sensation that some people experience in response to specific sounds or visual triggers. Common ASMR triggers include soft whispering, tapping, crinkling paper, brushing sounds, and even gentle hand movements. Many people watch ASMR videos to help with relaxation, sleep, or stress relief. The sensation can create a calming effect similar to a light massage or a soothing lullaby.The White House's decision to label its deportation video as ASMR suggests that, for some, the sights and sounds of shackles and chains might evoke a similar reaction.Since taking office on January 20, President Donald Trump has increased deportations as part of his immigration policy. Thousands of undocumented immigrants have already been sent back, including over 300 Indian nationals.Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, has said the administration will continue deportations, stating that he will not rest until every “illegal criminal migrant” is “eradicated” from the country. He also noted that illegal crossings have decreased under Trump compared to the previous administration.","The white house on tuesday shared a video titled "" asmr : illegal alien deportation flight"" the 40-second video includes close-up shots of handcuffs being laid out, officers securing restraints, and detainees walking up steel steps to the aircraft.

Barron Trump: NYU college Republicans president resigns after ‘oddity on campus’ remark about Barron Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nyu-college-republicans-president-resigns-after-oddity-on-campus-remark-about-barron-trump/articleshow/118371209.cms,"The president of New York University ’s College Republicans resigned on Monday following backlash over her remarks about Barron Trump , the 18-year-old son of US President Donald Trump , New York Post reports.Kaya Walker stepped down after calling Barron “sort of like an oddity on campus” in an interview with Vanity Fair last week. She described his routine as, “He goes to class, he goes home,” and recalled a professor joking that Barron “doesn’t really belong here.”Her comments stirred a row, with the national College Republicans of America (CRA) criticising them as “inappropriate” and not reflective of the organisation’s values.In the wake of the controversy, CRA President Will Donahue invited Barron to join their ranks, saying, “Barron Trump represents the future of the conservative movement, and we would be honoured to have him join College Republicans of America.” He added, “Strong leadership is built on resilience, courage, and the humility to rise above petty hostility—qualities that Barron has already demonstrated.”Barron’s presence at NYU has drawn attention since he enrolled at the Stern School of Business last autumn. Despite being the son of a US president, he has remained mostly private, largely due to the Secret Service officers who accompany him.His commute from Trump Tower to campus in black SUVs has sparked curiosity, but he is rarely seen outside class. Unlike past celebrity students like Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen or Dylan Sprouse, Barron keeps a low profile.Some students have tried to interact with him. One recalled asking him to play basketball, saying Barron seemed interested but suggested he “wasn’t really allowed to do stuff.” Meanwhile, his movements have occasionally been shared online, with one student posting a picture of him in class and writing, “Today was wild.”According to reports, the 6'7"" Barron has been described as a “ladies’ man” by many, while others say he prefers video games and quiet hobbies. His brother, Eric Trump, once called him “the most eligible bachelor in the world.” Conservative commentators like Benny Johnson have referred to the study on him as “what real rizz is.”Walker’s resignation has put more focus on Barron’s role in conservative circles. He has not made a public statement or joined social media, but some view him as an emerging figure in the movement. With CRA backing Donald Trump before the Republican primaries and now inviting Barron, the group seems eager to bring him in.","Kaya walker stepped down after calling barron “sort of like an oddity on campus” she described his routine as, “he goes to class, he goes home,” and recalled a professor joking that barron ‘doesn’t really belong here’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118371308,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1545320,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

"Elon Musk: US judge Tanya Chutkan rejects bid to stop Elon Musk’s federal job cuts, block DOGE’s data access",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-rejects-bid-to-stop-elon-musks-federal-job-cuts-block-doges-data-access/articleshow/118370914.cms,"Legal battle over DOGE’s powers

Mass layoffs and buyout scheme

A federal judge rejected an emergency request on Tuesday to stop billionaire Elon Musk and his department of government efficiency ( DOGE ) from firing federal employees and accessing agency data.This move bolstered US President Donald Trump’s plan to cut government spending, as he called for large-scale reductions across several departments and agencies. Thousands have already lost their jobs, while many more await dismissal.Fourteen Democrat-led states sued last week, challenging Musk’s authority. But on Tuesday, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled they had not proven immediate or irreversible harm, saying this was not enough to justify blocking his actions.""Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm absent a temporary restraining order,"" Chutkan said.Chutkan is an appointee of former US President Barack Obama. She previously oversaw the now-abandoned criminal case against Trump for allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.DOGE is an independent agency led by Musk and aims to reduce government spending by cutting jobs and eliminating agencies. While Trump has maintained that agency heads are making the layoffs , critics argue that Musk wields too much power over federal operations.The 14 states claimed in their lawsuit that Musk had not been officially nominated or confirmed for a government position, yet was making key decisions on government contracts, expenditures, and staffing. They also raised concerns about DOGE gaining access to sensitive data from departments including education, labour, health and human services, energy, and transportation.Despite these concerns, Chutkan dismissed the request for a temporary restraining order. She said that uncertainty over DOGE’s actions was not enough to justify immediate court intervention. “The court is aware that DOGE’s unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for Plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents. But the ‘possibility’ that Defendants may take actions that irreparably harm Plaintiffs ‘is not enough,’” she ruled.Musk’s cost-cutting measures have already led to major disruptions, with thousands of federal employees sent home as agencies face closures. A separate legal challenge sought to block a mass buyout scheme that offered federal employees eight months’ pay if they voluntarily resigned. In an email titled ""Fork in the Road,"" more than two million government workers were warned they could either accept the buyout or risk being fired in future layoffs.The White House said over 75,000 employees have already taken the offer, but unions representing government workers have fought to block the initiative. Last week, another federal judge lifted a temporary freeze on the buyout plan, allowing it to continue.Trump’s sweeping government overhaul has faced multiple court battles, with the White House accusing “judges in liberal districts” of attempting to block the administration’s reforms. However, rulings on these cases have come from judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents, including Trump himself.","Us district judge tanya chutkan rejected a request for a temporary restraining order.
