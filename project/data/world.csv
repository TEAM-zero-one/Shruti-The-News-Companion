RBI requires banks to link all floating rate loans to an external benchmark. The repo rate cut is expected to reduce lending rates, but may compress banks' net interest margins, since the cost of funds has not declined at the same pace.","Indian bank said it will reduce its repo-linked benchmark lending rate (rblr) to 8.7% from 9.05%.

"Pakistan distances itself from ISI agent, says he is Canadian",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-distances-itself-from-isi-agent-says-he-is-canadian/articleshow/120185792.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hours before Tahawwur Rana 's arrival, Pakistan washed its hands off him saying he had ceased to be Pakistani and was a Canadian.Distancing itself from Rana, whom the ISI protected till the end, Pakistan govt's foreign office issued a statement Thursday saying they had no connection to him. ""He is a Canadian national and as per our record, he has not renewed his Pakistani documents for over two decades,"" its spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said at a briefing.The strenuous distancing is significant because the involvement of Pakistan's spy agency ISI was established by Indian agencies with the help of the confession of Ajmal Kasab , the lone Lashkar terrorist involved in the carnage to have been apprehended alive, and findings of the investigation conducted with help from foreign partners; especially the FBI.Rana, born in Pakistan in 1961, served in the Pakistan Army Medical Corps before moving to Canada in the 1990s, where he obtained citizenship. Sources in the intelligence establishment have consistently maintained that this was a routine move by the ISI to 'settle' their assets abroad to facilitate their India-centric operations.Denial has been the default first response of Pakistan govt which faced international opprobrium after the mass slaughter of innocents carried out by its assets, and which further steeled its already-formidable notoriety as the hub of jihadi terror. It had denied Kasab was a Pakistani citizen, going to the extent of identifying him as an Indian national - something which could have helped its effort to pass off the Mumbai attack as a case of homegrown terror. Kasab and others were carrying forged IDs which showed them as Hindus. As part of the camouflage, they had tied saffron strings ('kalevas') they had found on the fishing trawlerthey had commandeered.Kasab's alias was that of a Bengaluru resident, Samir Dinesh Chaudhari. The gameplan came to naught because of the expose that confirmed his identity as a Pakistani national born to Amir Kasab and Noor Illahi - both Pakistan citizens.

A special trial for a special case

The man behind the scenes

Legal journey: From Chicago to Delhi

Pakistan disowns Rana

A step closer to closure

NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough more than 15 years after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks , one of its key accused, Tahawwur Hussain Rana, has been extradited to India from the United States. The Pakistan-born Canadian national, a close associate of convicted terrorist David Coleman Headley , landed in Delhi on Thursday aboard a special flight.His extradition marks a significant diplomatic and legal milestone in India's prolonged efforts to bring the masterminds of the 2008 attacks to justice.In a detailed statement, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said it had ""successfully secured"" Rana’s extradition following years of ""sustained and concerted efforts."" Rana had been held in judicial custody in the US after proceedings were initiated under the India-US Extradition Treaty. “The extradition finally came through after Rana exhausted all legal avenues to stay the move,” the NIA added.The process had been underway for years. The District Court for the Central District of California ordered his extradition on May 16, 2023. Rana’s appeals to the Ninth Circuit Court and multiple petitions, including to the US Supreme Court, were all rejected. His final attempt—a review plea before the US Supreme Court—was dismissed on April 4, 2025, effectively clearing the path for extradition.The NIA also credited the US Department of Justice, US Sky Marshal, Indian intelligence agencies, National Security Guard (NSG), and ministries of external and home affairs for their roles in coordinating the transfer.Senior advocate Dayan Krishnan, who led India’s arguments in the US court, will now prosecute Rana in Delhi. Krishnan, a 1993 graduate of NLSIU Bengaluru and senior advocate since 2014, has previously represented India in the extradition of Ravi Shankaran and served as special prosecutor in the 2012 Delhi gangrape case. He also led the NIA team that interrogated Headley in Chicago.Krishnan will be joined by special public prosecutor Narender Mann, appointed by the Union home ministry. Mann, a seasoned criminal lawyer and Delhi University graduate, has represented the CBI in several high-profile cases including the Jain-diary Hawala case, CWG scam, and the Bofors case. His term will span three years or until the conclusion of the case, whichever comes earlier.The prosecution team will also include advocates Sanjeevi Sheshadri and Sridhar Kale, aside from NIA counsel.Also, advocate Piyush Sachdeva from Delhi Legal Services Authority will represent Rana.Rana, a former Pakistani military doctor turned Canadian citizen, ran an immigration services firm in Chicago that allegedly served as a cover for Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives. While he was convicted in the US in 2011 for supporting terrorism, he was acquitted of direct involvement in the Mumbai attacks due to jurisdictional issues.India, however, has maintained that Rana facilitated David Headley’s reconnaissance missions in Mumbai, including visits to the Taj Hotel and Chabad House.Rana’s trial began in 2018 in the US. The turning point came on May 16, 2023, when a Magistrate Judge ruled that the case was not one of double jeopardy—a principle that prevents an accused from being tried twice for the same offense. Krishnan successfully argued that Rana’s acts constituted distinct crimes under Indian law. His arguments prevailed against veteran extradition lawyer Paul Garlick QC, who represented Rana.Following this, a US District Judge rejected Rana’s appeal on August 10, 2023. His next appeal to the US Court of Appeals was denied on August 15, 2024. Ultimately, all of Rana’s petitions—including a writ of certiorari, habeas corpus petitions, and an emergency stay—were turned down by the US Supreme Court.The US Secretary of State signed Rana’s surrender warrant on February 11, 2025, leading to his final transfer.Interestingly, as the extradition proceeded, Pakistan distanced itself from Rana. “Tahawwur Rana has not renewed his Pakistani documents for over two decades. His Canadian nationality is very clear,” said Pakistani foreign ministry spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan. This comes despite Pakistan officially allowing dual citizenship with Canada.The 26/11 attacks killed 166 people and injured over 300 during a 60-hour siege across key locations in Mumbai. The carnage brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war and changed the course of global counter-terrorism policy.A senior NIA official said Rana’s extradition “is a significant development in our pursuit of justice for the 26/11 victims.” The agency has charged him under the Indian Penal Code, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and SAARC Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. A response to its Letter Rogatory to Pakistan is still awaited.While David Headley continues to serve a 35-year sentence in the US, Rana’s arrival in India may finally help uncover more about the network and planning behind the attacks—opening a long-awaited chapter in India’s search for justice.",Tahawwur hussain rana has been extradited to india from the united states.

No Yes

NEW DELHI: India has withdrawn a key trans-shipment facility granted to Bangladesh , days after the chief adviser of Bangladesh’s interim government, Muhammad Yunus , described India’s Northeast as a “landlocked” region reliant on Dhaka for access to the ocean — remarks that triggered strong diplomatic backlash.The decision, announced via a circular issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on April 8, effectively ends a 2020 arrangement that had allowed Bangladesh to route its export cargo to third countries through Indian Land Customs Stations and onward to ports and airports.“It has been decided to rescind... circular...dated June 29, 2020, as amended with immediate effect. Cargo already entered into India may be allowed to exit the Indian territory as per the procedure,” the circular mentioned.The facility had enabled smoother trade for Bangladesh to Bhutan, Nepal, and Myanmar. But Indian exporters, particularly in the apparel sector, had long objected to the arrangement. Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) Chairman Sudhir Sekhri earlier said that 20–30 Bangladeshi trucks arrived daily in Delhi, clogging cargo terminals and spiking freight costs.“Now we will have more air capacity for our cargo,” said FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai. “In the past, exporters have complained about lesser space due to the trans-shipment facility given to Bangladesh.”The move comes as global trade tensions rise, with the US recently announcing new tariffs on both India and Bangladesh.Trade experts say the cancellation will hit Bangladesh’s export logistics hard. “The previous mechanism had offered a streamlined route through India, cutting transit time and cost,” said Ajay Srivastava , founder of Global Trade Research Initiative, as quoted by PTI. “Now, without it, Bangladeshi exporters may face delays, higher costs, and uncertainty.”The geopolitical undertone became unavoidable after Yunus’ comments in Beijing, where he pitched Bangladesh as “the only guardian of the ocean” for Northeast India and invited China to deepen its economic presence in the region.“The eastern part of India, the Seven Sisters, are a landlocked region. They have no way to reach out to the ocean. This could be an extension of the Chinese economy,” Yunus had said.External affairs minister S Jaishankar swiftly countered the narrative, emphasizing India’s strategic maritime and regional links. “We have the longest coastline in the Bay of Bengal… Our North-Eastern region is emerging as a connectivity hub for BIMSTEC,” he said.With both countries being WTO members, Srivastava cautioned that India’s move may raise concerns over transit rights under WTO rules, especially for other landlocked nations like Nepal and Bhutan.","The decision effectively ends a 2020 arrangement that had allowed bangladesh to route its export cargo to third countries through indian land customs stations. The facility had enabled smoother trade for bangladesh to bhutan, nepal, and myanmar.

How India won Tahawwur Rana extradition fight: The 2 factors that turned the case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-india-won-tahawwur-rana-extradition-fight-the-2-factors-that-turned-the-case/articleshow/120150359.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Hussain Rana, one of the key masterminds behind the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks , is currently in transit to India following his extradition from the United States.Top government sources told ANI that two crucial factors helped secure his extradition: the legal rebuttal of the double jeopardy claim and India’s diplomatic efforts.The first factor was India’s legal argument against the principle of double jeopardy. Represented by a strong team of legal experts, Indian authorities convinced US officials that the protection against double jeopardy is based on the specific elements of a crime, not merely the defendant’s conduct.Since Rana has never been tried in India under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, prosecuting him under this law would not violate the double jeopardy clause.Rana’s legal team approached the US Supreme Court to halt his extradition, citing the double jeopardy defence. However, the US authorities ultimately sided with India’s interpretation, clearing the path for his transfer.The second factor was India’s diplomatic strength. Sources close to the extradition process said India’s global standing, its strong diplomatic footprint, and cordial relations with the US helped navigate legal complexities and fast-track Rana’s extradition.Rana, a Pakistani-Canadian national, was earlier convicted in the US for aiding Lashkar-e-Taiba , the terror group responsible for the 2008 attacks that left more than 174 people dead.In a related development, Delhi’s Patiala House Court has received case files from Mumbai naming Rana and David Coleman Headley as accused, following a request by the National Investigation Agency earlier this year.Rana’s arrival in India marks a key milestone in the country’s pursuit of justice for the victims of the Mumbai attacks. The Ministry of Home Affairs has appointed senior advocate Narender Mann as the special public prosecutor to lead the trial on behalf of the NIA.(With inputs from ANI)","Tahawwur hussain rana is one of the key masterminds behind the 26/11 mumbai terror attacks.

It is the diplomatic success that India gained after a long time. It is not an end thing or a big achievement; there are a lot of layers that we have to achieve. For a common man, he was a link.

However, he sustained critical injuries during a fierce gun battle with the terrorists. Struck by multiple bullets, including a fatal shot from the left, he continued to engage the attackers with precise fire, even as he rescued an injured fellow commando. In the process, he was also hit in the right arm.Talking about his son’s heroism, he said, “Sandeep is not a victim of 26/11. He was one of security personnel who went there.

NEW DELHI: Senior advocate Dayan Krishnan , who spearheaded India's case for 26/11 Mumbai attack plotter Tahawwur Rana's extradition in the United States Supreme Court, will now lead the National Investigation Agency 's (NIA) prosecution in Delhi.Rana, who worked closely with 26/11 primary plotter David Coleman Headley (also known as Daood Gilani), a US citizen, is reportedly en-route to India after the US Supreme Court rejected his review petition against extradition on April 4.Krishnan, involved with the extradition process since 2010, will work alongside Special Prosecutor Narender Mann, an experienced criminal lawyer who previously represented the Central Bureau of Investigation at the Delhi High Court.Additional legal representatives include advocates Sanjeevi Sheshadri and Sridhar Kale, along with NIA counsel, according to sources.A significant development occurred in May 2023, with Rana's trial having commenced in 2018.Rana had arranged passports for fellow jihadi, Pakistani-American David Coleman Headley, aka Dawood Gilani, to travel to India to select targets for the terror attack that was being hatched by Lashkar in collaboration with ISI, Pakistan's spy agency. Rana gloated over the deaths in Mumbai on Nov 26, 2008 and said that the jihadis responsible for it should be given Pakistan's highest posthumous military honours, according to NIA.So far only Ajmal Kasab, the sole LeT terrorist involved in 26/11 rampage who was nabbed alive, had been prosecuted.""The most important decision of his extradition came on May 16, 2023, being the first judgment by the Magistrate Judge, US District Court of Central District of California,"" said a source close to the extradition proceedings.The Magistrate Court endorsed Krishnan's position while approving the extradition, confirming that Rana's situation did not constitute double jeopardy.The proceedings featured intense legal debates between Krishnan and extradition specialist Paul Garlick QC, who defended Rana.While Garlick maintained it was double jeopardy, Krishnan contended that the crime's elements, not the accused's behaviour, determined the circumstances.Double jeopardy refers to punishing someone twice for the same crime.The court accepted the arguments presented by Krishnan, who represented India's government alongside the US department of justice.Another crucial victory came when a US District Judge dismissed Rana's appeal on August 10, 2023.After this setback, Rana approached the US Court of Appeals 9th Circuit, but faced rejection on August 15, 2024, according to the source.Rana, aged 64 and a Canadian citizen born in Pakistan, then sought help from the US Supreme Court, which denied relief on January 21, 2025.Finally, on April 4, the US Supreme Court rejected Rana's review petition, his last attempt to avoid extradition, the source noted.On November 26, 2008, ten Pakistani terrorists launched coordinated attacks in Mumbai's CST, two luxury hotels and a Jewish centre, after entering India's financial hub via the Arabian Sea. The three-day siege resulted in 166 deaths.","Tahawwur rana is reportedly en-route to india after the us supreme court rejected his review petition against extradition on april 4.

Here's a look at who he is and his link to David Coleman Headley.

Who is Tahawwur Rana?

His connection to David Coleman Headley

Role in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks

Helping Headley obtain a visa for India, despite his known terror affiliations.

Allowing Headley to use his business as a front to establish a branch in Mumbai, called Immigrant Law Centre, which served as a cover for scouting potential targets.

Facilitating and funding Headley's multiple reconnaissance trips to India between 2006 and 2008. During these trips, Headley visited key sites later attacked — including the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Chabad House, and CST railway station.

Visiting several Indian cities himself, including Delhi, Agra, Kochi, Ahmedabad, and Mumbai — in some cases with his wife — in the weeks leading up to the attacks.

According to investigators, Rana had full knowledge of Headley's mission and was in frequent telephonic contact with him during his stays in India — over 200 phone calls have been cited as evidence.

Officials say Rana was also in touch with Major Iqbal, an alleged ISI handler, who was named as one of the masterminds behind the attack.

The legal journey and extradition

What did the FBI and US courts find?

The 2008 Mumbai attacks by Lashkar-e-Taiba, in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed.

A foiled plot to attack the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten for publishing cartoons of Prophet Mohammed. The attackers had planned to behead the staff and throw their heads onto the streets of Copenhagen.

In 2011, Rana was convicted in a US court of conspiracy to support terrorism in the Denmark plot and of providing material support to Lashkar-e-Taiba. However, he was acquitted of direct involvement in the Mumbai attacks. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison by US district judge Harry Leinenweber.

What did David Headley reveal about Rana's role?

Headley testified that:

He received Lashkar's instructions in 2005 to conduct surveillance in India.

He returned to Chicago and informed Rana about the assignment.

Rana approved of the plan and allowed Headley to use First World as cover.

Rana directed staff to prepare documents and help Headley obtain a visa for India.

Headley spoke with Rana multiple times during his trips to India, including over 60 calls during one visit.

Headley's cooperation with US prosecutors was key to Rana's conviction.

What does the FBI say?

""As established at trial, Tahawwur Rana provided critical support to David Headley and other terrorists from his base in the United States, knowing they were plotting attacks overseas. I thank the many agents, analysts, and prosecutors who helped bring about today's result,"" said Lisa Monaco, assistant attorney general for national security.

""This serious prison sentence should go a long way towards convincing would-be terrorists that they can't hide behind the scenes, lend support to the violent aims of terrorist organisations, and escape detection and punishment,"" said Gary S Shapiro, acting US attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.

""It is my hope that the judge's decision today sends a message to those who plot attacks and those who provide the support to make the plots possible, both here and abroad, that you will be held accountable for your actions. Our mission, detecting and preventing terrorist acts and eliminating the enabling support provided by terrorist sympathisers, remains our top priority,"" added Cory B Nelson, FBI's special agent in charge in Chicago.

What happens next?

Officials say Rana's questioning could provide:

Fresh leads about Pakistan's state role in the attacks.

Clarity on the planning and funding of the 26/11 carnage.

Information on Rana's other associates in India and abroad.

Evidence against absconding accused like LeT chief Hafiz Saeed, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, and ISI officers.

Over 16 years after the horrific 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks that left 166 people dead and hundreds injured, a key accused in the conspiracy — Tahawwur Hussain Rana — is finally being brought to face justice in India. His extradition from the United States marks a crucial moment in the long-standing investigation into the worst terror attack on Indian soil. Rana's role in Mumbai terror attacks was earlier exposed by his childhood friend and co-conspirator David Headley. During his testimony in a Chicago court, Headley revealed that Rana helped him set up a fake immigration office in Mumbai as cover for scouting terror targets.A US court found him guilty of supporting Lashkar-e-Taiba and a terror plot in Denmark. Headley's testimony can now play a significant role in India's case as agencies prepare to question Rana for his role in 26/11.Security has been stepped up outside Delhi's Patiala House court where he is likely to appear after his extradition.Tahawwur Rana is a 64-year-old Pakistani-born Canadian national and a former medical officer in the Pakistan Army. He hails from Chichawatni in the Sahiwal district of Punjab province in Pakistan. After studying medicine in Pakistan, Rana joined the military as part of the Army's medical corps. He eventually left the armed forces and migrated to Canada, where he obtained citizenship.In the late 1990s, Rana moved to the United States and set up an immigration services business — First World Immigration Services — with offices in Chicago and other cities. This business would later become a cover for his and David Headley's alleged espionage and terror-related activities in India.Rana's name became prominently linked to the 26/11 case due to his close friendship with David Coleman Headley, the Pakistani-American terrorist who carried out detailed reconnaissance of the 26/11 targets.Headley, born to a Pakistani father and American mother, spent much of his early life in Pakistan. It was at a military school in Hasan Abdal, Punjab, where he met and befriended Rana. The two maintained their bond over the years, eventually reuniting in the United States.This friendship would later form the backbone of a deadly conspiracy. Investigators allege that Rana was not only aware of Headley's links with Pakistan-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), but actively supported his mission.According to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Rana played a significant support role in the planning and execution of the 26/11 attacks. Key allegations include:In 2009, Headley and Rana were arrested by US authorities for plotting attacks in India and Denmark. While Headley pleaded guilty and turned approver — providing a detailed account of the 26/11 conspiracy — Rana continued to deny knowledge of any terror activities.India had long sought Rana's extradition. In 2020, the NIA formally requested it, citing his involvement in the 26/11 conspiracy. After prolonged legal proceedings, a US court approved his extradition. Rana made a final appeal to the US Supreme Court, which rejected his petition, clearing the way for his handover to Indian authorities.Rana was arrested in the US in 2009. According to the FBI and US prosecutors, he provided material support to two terrorist plots:""This certainly was a dastardly plot,"" said judge Leinenweber while handing down the sentence.In his testimony during the trial, Headley said that Rana not only knew about Lashkar-e-Taiba's operations, but also supported him in setting up a front in Mumbai to carry out reconnaissance.The FBI's Chicago office and top US prosecutors have strongly condemned Rana's involvement in terror planning.Rana is expected to be produced before a special NIA court at Patiala House in Delhi. Security has been heightened in and around the court complex, with personnel from Delhi Police and paramilitary forces deployed. Tihar Jail authorities have said they are prepared to house Rana in a high-security ward, pending court directions.The NIA is expected to seek his custodial interrogation to further probe his links with terror outfits, Pakistani intelligence handlers and his role in the execution of the attacks.Tahawwur Rana’s return to India after over a decade could be a key moment in unravelling the full conspiracy behind one of the worst terror attacks in the country’s history.",Tahawwur rana was convicted in a us court of conspiracy to support terrorism in the denmark plot and of providing material support to lashkar-e-taiba. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison by us district judge harry leinenweber. Officials say rana's questioning could provide fresh leads about pakistan's state role in the attacks.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120149568,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1238151,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Addressing root causes like extremism and poverty Stronger intelligence and surveillance

NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Rana , one of the main plotters of the 2008 Mumbai attack, had contacted David Coleman Headley 231 times during his visits to India ahead of the 26/11 carnage, according to the Indian dossier on him. Rana conducted eight reconnaissance missions and the highest number of calls (66) were made during the final visit before the attack.According to the dossier, Rana and Headley, along with other operatives, had mapped other targets in India, including National Defence College and India Gate in Delhi and multiple Jewish centres, as part of their plan to carry out spectacular terror attacks. NIA's chargesheet on him details Rana, along with Headley, Hafeez Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Ilyas Kashmiri, Sajid Mir and Major Iqbal, among others, had conspired to orchestrate the attack.Investigation by both India and US confirmed that Rana's Chicago-based immigration firm - First World Immigration Services, was used as a front to facilitate Headley's entry into India. Headley and Rana had a thorough discussion about their future plans when they met in US. ""As Rana was a deserter from the army, Headley offered to provide assistance through his connection with Major Iqbal,"" reads the dossier.Backed by the ISI, Rana exploited every option available to him to thwart his extradition. He even claimed pleas of double jeopardy/double prosecution which essentially holds that a person cannot be prosecuted twice for same offence. The US court, however, rejected his contention that American judiciary had already tried and acquitted him of charges for which India wanted him. The US court said the crimes he had been charged with in India were different from those for which he was prosecuted in the US. ""For example, India's forgery charges are based in part on conduct that was not charged in the US,"" the court observed.Rana's 2013 conviction in US, where he was sentenced to 14 years in prison, was for supporting Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba and the terror plot in Denmark. Rana was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to a plot from Oct 2008 to Oct 2009 to commit murder in Denmark, including a plan to behead employees of Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten, a Danish newspaper which published a cartoon of the Prophet , and throw their heads on streets of Copenhagen, as well as providing material support, from late 2005 to Oct 2009, to Lashkar-e-Taiba.Also read: Piyush Goyal targets Congress amid Tahawwur Rana's extradition The website of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons has updated the status against Rana's name saying he wasn't in their custody as of Tuesday. Rana's register number (22829-424) read: ""Not in BOP custody as of 04/08/2025.""A team of officials drawn from Indian agencies in the US was tasked with facilitating his return. Sources said the chief investigating officer, DIG (NIA) Jaya Roy, signed off on the 'surrender warrant' Tuesday, following which swift arrangements were made to fly him to Delhi. The team left Wednesday around 6.30am, aiming to complete the journey with a brief pit stop. Incidentally, NIA is headed by Sadanand Date , a Maharashtra cadre IPS officer who, along with other colleagues, had rushed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus area on the fateful evening of Nov 26, 2008 after the terrorists struck at targets selected by, among others, Rana's partner in the massacre David Coleman Headley.Rana's interrogators, a source said, will aim to get him to divulge details about Pakistani state actors involved in the 26/11 plot, details of ISI network, as well as LeT's local collaborators and sources of funding. There also seems to be recognition that breaking down a hardened terrorist, especially one motivated by jihad, may not be easy.""He has already been probed extensively, and cracking him will not be an easy task. He would know where to mislead us and create smokescreens. This will be time-consuming,"" said a source in the know.Rana (64) is learned to have already got his contacts to engage his defence counsel. Due to security reasons, Rana may not be taken to court and his remand proceedings may be held in camera, sources said.","Tahawwur rana, one of the main plotters of the 2008 mumbai attack, had contacted david coleman headley 231 times during his visits to india ahead of the 26/11 carnage.

Rana was represented by Piyush Sachdeva, provided to him by Delhi Legal Services Authority. After the hearing, the court sent Rana to 18-day NIA custody.Rana's extradition process was nothing short of a nail-biter with fears of sabotage looming till the flight touched down at Palam airport's technical area. The home ministry and the office of NSA, along with Intelligence Bureau, constantly monitored the flight ferrying Rana, taking precautions to thwart any attempt to stop him from landing in the grasp of Indian agencies.Exercising utmost caution in extraditing Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a dummy code was generated for the chartered aircraft, a Gulfstream G550, ferrying him to India to avoid detection on public flight trackers and alleviate threats of an attack. The aircraft took off from Los Angeles in the early hours of Wednesday and landed in New Delhi around 6 pm, after a pit stop in Romania.Rana, along with his close school friend and fellow jihadi Daood Gilani aka David Coleman Headley, had left Mumbai on Nov 19, 2008, just a week before a gang of jihadi terrorists belonging to and motivated by LeT and trained by serving officers of Pakistan army landed on the Worli shore to carry out an attack in which 166 people were killed and which left the nation traumatised. The massacre marked the execution of a plan that Rana and Headley helped draw by selecting the targets to be struck.As Rana stepped on the tarmac in prison browns with NIA personnel clinging to him, he looked far from the unassuming businessman he had posed as when he checked into a Powai hotel in Mumbai in 2008. He had also visited Agra, Hapur, Kochi and other cities during this trip, supposedly to promote his immigration business, though NIA suspects the trips may have been a cover to scout for potential terror recruits for LeT.Rana, for long a strategic asset for Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistan's military intelligence complex, was placed under arrest at the airport, made to undergo a medical examination and whisked to court through a green corridor amid heavy security comprising a 20-vehicle cavalcade and SWAT commandos.On the plane back to India, Rana was seated in the middle with NSG commandos on all seats surrounding him, followed by senior NIA officials. Just after touchdown, the NIA acknowledged the assistance of US Sky Marshals who are assigned with secure transportation of federal prisoners, including inmate transfers via air.In a statement, the NIA termed Rana a key conspirator and confirmed his extradition. ""Rana was being held in judicial custody in the US pursuant to proceedings initiated under the India-US extradition treaty. The extradition finally came through after Rana exhausted all legal avenues to stay the move. The district court for the Central District of California had ordered his extradition on May 16, 2023. Rana then filed multiple litigations in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, all of which were rejected,"" it said.Extradition proceedings were initiated between the two countries after India eventually secured a surrender warrant for the wanted terrorist from the US govt.The extradition finally came through after Rana's various litigations and appeals, including an emergency application before the US Supreme Court, were rejected with the active assistance of the US department of justice's Office of International Affairs, US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, US Marshals Service, FBI's Legal Attache Office in New Delhi, and US department of state's Office of the Legal Adviser for Law Enforcement, the NIA said.For NIA investigators, the challenge will be to get Rana to reveal more than what he has already told US authorities. His interrogation will be aimed at getting to the bottom of the Mumbai attack conspiracy and exposing the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds like Hafiz Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and others in planning and remote-controlling one of the deadliest terror strikes against India.",Tahawwur hussain rana played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on mumbai.

Poet struggles to serve Taylor Swift amid tight security and elusive whereabouts

Second legal attempt hits the same wall as the first

A copyright infringement case involving global music icon Taylor Swift has reportedly hit yet another snag, as the plaintiff, Florida-based poet Kimberly Marasco , claims she’s once again unable to serve Swift with legal papers.According to Newsweek, Kimberly Marasco alleges she is facing “extreme difficulties” in locating Taylor Swift, who has been notably low-key in recent months, reportedly spending time with her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce . The two have largely stayed out of the spotlight since Kelce’s Super Bowl LIX victory in February.Marasco’s lawsuit accuses Swift, her collaborators Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, as well as Universal Music Group and Republic Records, of allegedly copying the poet’s written work across several of Swift’s most popular albums—Lover, Folklore, Midnights , and The Tortured Poets Department. The plaintiff is seeking over $30 million in damages.However, progress in the case has been delayed due to Marasco’s inability to serve Swift with official court documents—a step that must be completed before the case can proceed. The singer’s high-profile lifestyle, coupled with strong personal security and the use of trusts to hold her properties, has made tracking her location a significant challenge for the plaintiff.This is not Marasco’s first attempt to sue the 14-time Grammy Award winner. Her previous case was dismissed after she failed to serve Swift within the legally required timeframe. Now, in her second try, she’s reportedly seeking clarification from federal judge Aileen Cannon on whether all the defendants must wait to respond until Swift has been served.So far, Judge Cannon has held that no party should respond to the lawsuit until every named defendant has been officially served. That directive leaves the case in limbo, with no forward movement until Swift receives the papers.Swift has not issued a public statement about the lawsuit. Her legal team has previously prevailed in a similar high-profile case concerning her song “Shake It Off,” where she faced, and ultimately overcame, copyright infringement claims.Also Read: Did Taylor Swift really forgive Blake Lively after being dragged into the explosive $400M lawsuit scandal?
