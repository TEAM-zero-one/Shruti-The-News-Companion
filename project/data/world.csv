NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday congratulated Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman on his party’s ""decisive victory"" in the country’s parliamentary elections, and affirmed India’s continued support for a ""democratic, progressive and inclusive"" Bangladesh.“I convey my warm congratulations to Mr. Tarique Rahman on leading BNP to a decisive victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership,” PM Modi said in a post on X.“I look forward to working with you to strengthen our multifaceted relations and advance our common development goals,” he added.The BNP secured a commanding two-thirds majority in the general elections, winning more than 200 seats — one of its strongest performances, surpassing its 2001 tally of 193 seats. The outcome is widely seen as paving the way for political stability after months of unrest that followed the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-led uprising in August 2024.Rahman, son of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman, is expected to be sworn in as prime minister. He returned to Dhaka in December after spending 18 years abroad. His father ruled Bangladesh from 1977 until his assassination in 1981 and remains a prominent figure in the country’s independence-era politics.Soon after the results became clear, the BNP thanked voters and urged restraint among supporters.“Despite winning ... by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,” the party said in a statement, instead calling for nationwide prayers.The election marked the first since Hasina fled to neighbouring India. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, 85, had been serving as interim head of government following her departure. Hasina, now in exile in New Delhi, had dominated Bangladesh politics for years alongside Khaleda Zia, Rahman’s mother and a former prime minister.The Awami League, which governed for 15 years but was barred from contesting this election, had earlier recorded a larger mandate of 230 seats in 2008.Meanwhile, the head of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami conceded defeat, stating that his party would not engage in the “politics of opposition” merely for its own sake. The National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists who were instrumental in the movement against Hasina and part of a Jamaat-backed alliance, managed to win only five of the 30 seats it contested.","Prime minister narendra modi congratulates bangladesh nationalist party (bnp) chief tarique rahman.

'India A Priority, No Second Class Citizen': Jamaat Chief's Big Statement Before Key Bangladesh Vote





Bangladesh will vote Thursday in a Parliamentary election that will perhaps have more far-reaching consequences for India than any such exercise in the recent past in its neighbourhood. Ironically, with Sheikh Hasina ’s Awami League not in the fray, India’s best hopes of a realistic reset in ties with Dhaka rest on a majority for the frontrunner Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Hasina’s bête noire and a party with historically fraught ties with New Delhi.Wrongfooted by the 2024 July Uprising that ousted long-term ally Hasina, India intensified its outreach to the BNP realising the then Khaleda Zia-led party offered the optimum choice for future legitimacy and stability in the country. The renewed engagement with BNP leaders, PM Narendra Modi’s offer of help for Zia’s treatment just before her demise and his letter to her son and current leader Tarique Rahman, delivered through foreign minister S Jaishankar, firmed up the initiative, despite the restraining factor of Hasina’s presence in India.In the absence of the banned Awami League, the election is expected to see a tight bipolar contest between the BNP alliance and the other major bloc comprising 11 parties – including a curious mix of Islamists and Gen-Z revolutionaries - which is led by India’s traditional foe Jamaat-e-Islami.Jamaat is joined by the National Citizen Party (NCP), a new political outfit composed of student leaders who led mass protests that toppled Hasina.Apart from the election outcome, India will also closely follow the Constitutional “July Charter” referendum that will take place alongside the general election. With its emphasis on a two-term limit for the PM, introduction of an upper house to review legislation and on Bangladeshi, not Bengali, identity, the referendum seems designed not just to prevent the return of “authoritarianism” but also to minimise India’s deep-rooted cultural and linguistic bonds with the country.While India would not like to delay any outreach to the likely new government, given the significance it attaches to ties with Dhaka for its own security and also Bangladesh’s growing reputation as a “swing state” coveted by powers like the US and China, any such exercise will be mindful of several key concerns.First of course is security. Not allowing Indian insurgent groups in the northeast to use Bangladesh territory against India will top India’s agenda with the new government, given that the BNP-Jamaat government two decades ago was accused of providing safe havens to such groups. Robust security cooperation, including intelligence-sharing, can mitigate concerns.Equally important will be preventing Pakistani forces from using Bangladesh to target Indian interests. The interim government has already effected a dramatic turnaround in ties with Pakistan and efforts to step up defence and security ties with frequent visits to Dhaka by ISI officials will aggravate India’s security concerns. Pakistan pivot is also what the BNP-Jamaat government was accused of in the past. India will also watch closely Chinese ingress into Bangladesh’s defence sector, including a recent deal to manufacture drones not far from Indian territory.The safety and security of the 13-million strong Hindu community will also be on top of India’s agenda with the new government, as evident from the way Modi has himself raised this issue on several occasions. India will expect continued cooperation for transport of goods to the northeast through ports in Bangladesh under the existing frameworks.However, for any outreach to be meaningful, India might have to first address the Hasina factor. The BNP will press on with the demand to extradite Hasina, who has been sentenced to death for alleged crimes against humanity. According to a source in Dhaka, this is an issue that relates to the people’s sentiments and India will not be seen as a reliable ally till the time it is seen as shielding Hasina.While a likely BNP government is expected to aggressively pursue issues related to border killings, water sharing and even revival of SAARC, India might also face a challenge in the form of a resurgent Jamaat that is projected to win anywhere between 50 to 100 seats, more than ever in its history. If that happens, the party could trigger some serious anxiety in India about its role not just as a powerful opposition but also a potential ally of the BNP.","Bangladesh will vote thursday in a parliamentary election that will perhaps have more far-reaching consequences for india than any such exercise in the recent past.

Nine people were killed and dozens injured after a shooting at a school in Canada's Tumbler Ridge. Police further confirmed that the gunman died from a ""self-inflicted"" injury.While six people were found dead inside the high school in the area, two other people were found dead at a residence are also believed to be connected with the shooting incident.The Tumbler Ridge Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said officers responded to a confirmed active shooter situation at the school early Tuesday afternoon. In a press release, the police confirmed they were on scene and working to secure the area while assessing the scale of casualties and injuries.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, in a post on X, expressed his condolences and devastation at the ""horrific"" event. Assuring active support to the British Columbian citizens, he said that officials have been in close coordination with the local counterparts to ensure the best support.In the post he wrote, ""I am devastated by today’s horrific shootings in Tumbler Ridge, B.C.

However, investigators are still trying to determine whether reports of a second shooter are accurate. Police described the suspect in an earlier alert as a female wearing a dress with brown hair.An emergency alert was sent to mobile phones across the area shortly after 2pm, urging residents to shelter in place, lock their doors, and avoid going outside as officers responded to the unfolding situation.According to Canadian news outlet The Globe and Mail, an RCMP spokesperson said officials are still working to establish the full extent of the incident, including the number of victims and whether the suspect acted alone.Staff sergeant Clark said such incidents are often chaotic in the early stages, with multiple reports emerging that must be verified.“Situations like this are always very chaotic and typically result in multiple reports of multiple shooters,” he said, adding that investigators are continuing to determine the sequence of events.Police have not yet released details about the victims, and the investigation remains ongoing.The Tumbler Ridge Health Centre has been placed under Code Orange — indicating a mass casualty situation or major emergency response — with restricted access measures now in effect, The Globe and Mail reported, quoting Northern Health spokesperson Eryn Collins.""","Nine people were killed and dozens injured after a shooting at a school in canada's tumbler ridge.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the equity benchmarks, crashed in opening trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff. While Nifty50 went below 25,600, BSE Sensex was down over 700 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,592.75, down 214 points or 0.83%. BSE Sensex was at 82,931.27, down 744 points or 0.89%.Markets are likely to trade in a range in the near term, with movement largely driven by stock-specific developments as the December quarter earnings season draws to a close.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “Markets have fallen into a turbulent phase which will cause some panic among investors even while offering opportunities. The sell off in AI stocks in US markets was expected but the timing and extent of the sell-off was not known. The 2.04% decline in Nasdaq is not a crash. But if the downtrend continues it might pull the US market down. For the Indian market, this correction in AI stocks is a positive, because last year’s global rally was primarily an AI trade in which India, an AI laggard, couldn’t participate. So the unwinding of the AI trade, If it persists, is a positive from the Indian perspective.However, what is rattling the Indian market now is the massive sell-off in IT stocks, which is the second largest profit pool of India Inc. The real impact of the ‘Anthropic shock’ on the IT sector is yet to be ascertained. Panic selling in IT stocks at this stage may not be a good idea. Investors may wait and watch for the dust to settle.The market turbulence can be used to accumulate high quality growth stocks, particularly those that have come out with good Q3 results. Auto stocks are likely to remain resilient, given the excellent results and growth prospects. Therefore, any downtrend in this segment due to market turbulence can offer buying opportunities.""Investors are expected to shift their focus to upcoming global inflation data, trade-related developments, and foreign institutional investor flows, while concerns around artificial intelligence-led disruptions may continue to contribute to market volatility.Wall Street benchmarks ended sharply lower on Thursday. The technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped about 2 percent as investors accelerated selling in technology stocks and moved away from transport shares amid rising concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence on businesses.Asian markets also retreated from recent highs, tracking weakness in US technology stocks. Fresh worries about how artificial intelligence could affect multiple sectors weighed on sentiment and prompted investors to move toward safer assets such as US Treasuries.Foreign portfolio investors were net buyers of equities worth Rs 108 crore on Thursday. Domestic institutional investors also remained net buyers, purchasing shares worth Rs 277 crore, according to exchange data.","Nifty50 and bse sensex crashed in opening trade on friday amid weak global cues and the continued it stocks selloff.

NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Thursday clarified that the investigation into the June 2025 crash of Air India Flight AI-171 in Ahmedabad is still ongoing, dismissing reports that the probe has concluded and pinned the blame for the incident on pilot.“The investigation is still in progress. No final conclusions have been reached,” the AAIB said, urging media organisations to exercise restraint and avoid premature speculation, which it said could cause public anxiety and undermine the integrity of the investigation.The AAIB noted that it conducts investigations strictly under the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2025, and India’s obligations under ICAO Annex 13.The preliminary report, released in July 2025, provided only factual information available at the time. The final investigation report, containing conclusions and safety recommendations, will be published upon completion.Earlier, Italian daily Corriere della Sera had reported, citing unnamed sources, that investigators had determined the crash was caused by an “intentional act” rather than a technical defect, and identified Captain Sumeet Sabharwal as the primary suspect.The report claimed US experts assisting in the probe described the findings as a “breakthrough.”The AAIB stressed that such reports are speculative. “Aircraft accident investigations are technical, evidence-based processes aimed at determining root causes and enhancing safety,” it said.The Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner, operating Flight AI-171, crashed seconds after taking off from Ahmedabad airport, killing 260 people, including passengers and individuals in a medical students’ hostel where the aircraft fell.Only one passenger survived.

Priyanka Gandhi rejects allegations

NEW DELHI: A political row erupted in Parliament on Thursday after Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi snapped at journalists over questions on a possible privilege motion against him, triggering criticism from the BJP.The confrontation comes amid heightened tensions during the ongoing Budget session, following Rahul’s attack on the Modi government in the Lok Sabha a day earlier.As he walked towards his car outside the Parliament complex, Rahul Gandhi was surrounded by reporters who sought his response to reports that the ruling party could move a privilege motion against him.Visibly upset, he shot back, “Is privilege the key word for today? Have you been given this word for today?”Referring to questions raised a day earlier, he added, “Yesterday the word was authentication, today it is privilege. You should try to do some objective stuff. You are not totally employed by the BJP; it gets really shameful.”He further told the journalists, “You are responsible people, you have media people, you have a responsibility to stay objective. You are doing a disservice to this nation. Are you not able to recognize that?”The exchange follows a stormy session in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, when Rahul Gandhi launched a strong attack on the government, accusing it of “surrendering” India and its people before foreign powers and of “selling the Bharat Mata”.His remarks drew loud protests from treasury bench members, who termed his language “unparliamentary” and demanded that portions of his speech be expunged from the record.BJP lawmakers later said that a privilege motion would be brought against the Leader of Opposition for allegedly “misleading” the House with “baseless and malicious” claims.The Congress defended Rahul, saying he had not violated any parliamentary norms and was within his rights to criticise the government and the Prime Minister over what it described as “capitulating and surrendering” India’s energy and farmers’ interests in the India-US trade deal.Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju criticised Rahul Gandhi’s remarks against the media, saying the Opposition leader was unwilling to answer questions.“This is wrong. If he interrupts and scolds the media, then who will ask the questions? Have we ever stopped the media from asking questions? While we were in the Opposition, we never said anything to the media naming Congress. He must have said all this because he doesn't want to answer the media,” Rijiju said, as quoted by news agency ANI.He added that he had spoken to several Congress MPs and asked them to advise Rahul to adhere to House rules.“I have asked many Congress MPs to make Rahul Gandhi understand that notices can be moved against him if he speaks in contravention of the rules,” Rijiju said.Rijiju also shared a video on his X handle, which he claimed was “illegally taken by a Congress MP”. According to him, the footage showed 20–25 Congress MPs entering Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s chamber, verbally abusing him and threatening Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In his post accompanying the video, Rijiju wrote, “Our party believes in debate & discussion and never encourage MPs to threaten physically.”He alleged that senior Congress leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and K C Venugopal, were present in the chamber and did not stop other MPs.“They (the Congress MPs) were egging them on. Had our MPs misbehaved with anyone, our leader would stop them. But their (Congress') leaders were egging on the MPs to quarrel,” Rijiju had said earlier.The incident reportedly took place last week when Opposition MPs went to the Speaker’s chamber to protest against BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s remarks about former Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra strongly denied Rijiju’s claims, calling them “a lie”.“We did not abuse anyone. One or two MPs were agitated, and they expressed it. He also said that I was encouraging them, which is a lie. I was sitting quietly. In the end, I said a few things peacefully to the Speaker,” she told reporters in the Parliament House complex.She rejected the charge that she had encouraged colleagues during the confrontation, insisting that no abuse took place and that she spoke calmly at the end.","Rahul gandhi snaps at reporters outside; rijiju questions his stance.

There could be another round of questioning based on the findings of the first session, sources said.Police have sought the original manuscript of the book, ‘Four Stars of Destiny’, from Penguin Random House India to compare it with the versions that surfaced online.The publishers have been handed a set of 15 to 20 questions to answer, including on the steps they took after learning of the alleged leak.“A team led by a DCP-rank officer asked the publishers about their standard operating procedure while handling a book and the details of people who had access to the manuscript of this particular book written by the former Army chief.

NEW DELHI: Puducherry chief minister N Rangasamy on Thursday once again called for statehood for the Union territory, ahead of the assembly elections slated for April.Rangasamy was responding to remarks by opposition DMK leaders R Siva and AMH Nazeem, who urged that the demand for statehood should be pursued “without let-up.” Puducherry has remained a Union territory since the former French settlements merged with India in 1962.The chief minister highlighted the “hindrance” that the Union territory status poses to the elected government’s decision-making. The status means that in Puducherry, key powers are exercised by the lieutenant governor, who is a central government appointee, rather than the elected chief minister, limiting the authority of the local administration.“Lack of powers for the elected government under Puducherry’s current Union Territory status has been a major obstacle, preventing the ministry from taking swift decisions and implementing programmes. My party (All India NR Congress) would support the statehood demand if there is a collective consensus among all legislators and political parties,” Rangasamy said in the House, according to PTI.He added that Puducherry had achieved “significant development” over the past five years, despite the challenges arising from the limited powers of the elected government.“As today’s assembly session marks the final sitting of the five-year House, I feel fully satisfied that we were able to meet the aspirations and expectations of the people, thanks to the cooperation of all sections,” Rangasamy stated.Both Siva, the leader of the opposition in the assembly, and Nazeem expressed the DMK’s “full support” for Puducherry’s demand for statehood.“To achieve statehood, we will back any decision, including boycotting the forthcoming Assembly elections, if necessary, as statehood is crucial for the welfare of the people,” they said.Following the chief minister’s response to members’ views on statehood and other matters, Speaker R Selvam adjourned the House sine die.",Puducherry has remained a union territory since the former french settlements merged with india in 1962.

Wangchuk drew comparisons with Chinese, Pakistani provinces: Govt

NEW DELHI: As the Centre justified on Wednesday the detention of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk by pointing out his alleged inflammatory speeches and the use of Gandhian principles as a facade, Supreme Court said that it was reading too much into his statements.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court that the govt won’t review Wangchuk’s detention order on medical grounds as he is “hale and hearty”. Mehta said that the activist was being taken care of in jail and had a minor infection. SC had last week asked the Centre to rethink his continued detention.Referring to one of the speeches, a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale said that the activist was himself worried about people resorting to violent protest and that any conclusion has to be drawn by reading the entire speech. Additional solicitor general K M Natraj contended that the speeches and statements were meant to incite people to resort to violent means of protest against govt and he invoked the name of Gandhi and his principles to shield himself.The bench asked if it is objectionable if someone says that he is worried about people abandoning Gandhian principles and resorting to violence. As govt referred to his various speeches and interviews given in previous years, the bench asked it to refer to only those which led to the violence in Sept last year.The ASG alleged that Sonam Wangchuk tried to internationalise the domestic issue of Ladakh, made statements about referendums and plebiscites, and drew comparisons of Ladakh with Chinese and Pakistani provinces. The apex court had earlier directed the authority to conduct a medical examination of Wangchuk by a specialised doctor and file the report before it. The activist is currently lodged in Jodhpur jail. The medical report was placed before the court at the last hearing.Wangchuk was detained on Sept 26 by invoking the NSA against him following protests in Leh over demands of statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh.",Supreme court said that it was reading too much into sonam wangchuk's statements.

Why the GCC Unified Visa matters



Seamless multi-country travel: Visit multiple member states without applying for separate visas, a huge boon for global travellers.

Visit multiple member states without applying for separate visas, a huge boon for global travellers. Tourism growth: Industry analysts say it could attract millions of additional visitors annually, boosting hotel, hospitality, retail and transport sectors.

A unified visa promotes the GCC as a single tourism destination, enhancing its competitiveness with regions like Europe and ASEAN. Simplified logistics: Digital applications and harmonized border systems reduce wait times and bureaucratic friction.

Biometric and border control integration across all six nations. Common digital application and data-sharing platforms. Security and immigration protocols to ensure regional safety and streamlined entry.





The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf. It's launch is expected in 2026 (pilot late-year, full rollout to follow), eligibility includes tourists and other visitors with valid travel credentials, fees is estimated at US $100–$150 range with validity of likely 30–90 days, with single or multiple entries. This unified system could be a milestone for regional travel and a boost for the Gulf’s tourism, business and investment landscape.","The gulf cooperation council is moving forward with a long-planned unified tourist visa that could transform travel across the gulf region.
