NEW DELHI: In a striking echo of his predecessor, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday made an embarrassing gaffe as he confused India with Iran. Twice.While repeating his rant about negotiating a ceasefire between New Delhi and Islamabad, he referred to India as Iran, calling it a nuclear nation.Trump claimed he threatened both nations with 200% tariffs if the conflict blew up into a full-fledged war.""If you look at Pakistan and Iran -- I told them I was in the midst of negotiating a trade deal with Iran and Pakistan, and because of tariffs, they wanted to negotiate much differently. I heard they were shooting at each other, and then I said during one of my conversations, ""Are you guys going to go to war?” I said, 'Here’s a deal — you go to war, and I gotta put a 200% tariff and stop you from doing any business in the United States'. I said this to both of them, and within 24 hours, the war ended. That would have been a nuclear war .""Trump continues to blow a ""ceasefire"" trumpet despite India rejecting his claims and PM Modi firmly stating in Parliament that no global leader asked India to stop the attack.Sharing new details about India's Operation Sindoor in Lok Sabha, PM Modi said that US Vice President JD Vance had called him on May 9, to inform him about a 'huge' impending strike by Pakistan.""On the night of 9th May, the Vice President of America tried to talk to me. He tried for an hour, but I was in a meeting with my army, so I could not pick up his call. Later, I called him back. The Vice President of America told me on the phone that Pakistan is going to launch a big attack. My answer was that if Pakistan has this intention, it will cost them a lot. If Pakistan attacks, we will respond by launching a big attack. This was my answer,"" PM Modi told the Lower House.He further said that no leader anywhere in the world had asked India to stop its response, saying, “no global leader urged India to halt the operation.”“Operation Sindoor has not been called off yet and Pakistan remains on notice,” Modi said, adding that the neighbour's nuclear bluff has been called and India would not succumb to nuclear blackmail.","Trump claimed he threatened both nations with 200% tariffs if the conflict blew up into a full-fledged war.

Pakistani troops engaged in heavy fighting with Afghan Taliban fighters on Tuesday night along the Kurram district border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The clashes came after the Taliban and militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan , called Fitna al-Khawarij by authorities, reportedly opened fire without warning.PTV News said several Taliban posts were heavily damaged, including at least one tank, and fighters fled their positions. Later reports added that additional posts and tank positions, including Shamsadar post, were destroyed, and a senior Fitna al-Khawarij commander was killed.Earlier, Pakistan’s foreign secretary Amna Baloch briefed resident ambassadors in Islamabad, stressing “Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and its unwavering resolve to protect its territorial integrity and national security.”Over the weekend, Taliban forces allegedly attacked Pakistani border posts, killing 23 troops. Islamabad responded, claiming more than 200 Taliban and allied militants were killed. Kabul called the strike “retaliatory,” accusing Pakistan of air raids inside Afghan territory last week, which Pakistan has denied.","Pakistan-afghanistan clashes: heavy fighting along khyber pakhtunkhwa border, taliban posts damaged.

What are the charges?









Indian-origin US expert, Ashley Tellis, who has been an advisor to US government for more than two decades, was arrested on charges of unlawfully retaining classified information and allegedly meeting with Chinese officials.Tellis was found to have kept over 1,000 pages of top-secret or secret documents in his home, the affidavit stated.In April 2023, Tellis attended a dinner with Chinese government officials in a Washington DC suburb and “could be occasionally overheard talking about Iranian-Chinese relations and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence,” the affidavit noted.According to the affidavit, Tellis serves as an unpaid adviser at the State Department and is a contractor with the Office of Net Assessment (ONA). ONA is the Pentagon’s in-house think tank for anticipating security threats, which the Defence Department announced in March would be dismantled and “restructured.”Tellis reportedly met multiple times with Chinese government officials at a restaurant in the Washington suburb of Fairfax, Virginia. According to the FBI affidavit, cited by AFP, at one dinner he arrived carrying a manila envelope, which he did not appear to take back with him.On two other occasions, the Chinese officials reportedly presented him with gift bags.Additionally, late on the evening of September 25, Tellis entered the State Department, where he served as an unpaid adviser, and was seen printing from a classified document detailing US Air Force techniques, according to the affidavit.State Department confirmed that Tellis was arrested on Saturday—the same day the affidavit indicated he was scheduled to fly to Rome—but declined to provide further details, citing the ongoing investigation.Lindsey Halligan, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, announced that Tellis was charged by criminal complaint with the unlawful retention of national defense information, in violation of 18 USC § 793(e).“We are fully focused on protecting the American people from all threats, foreign and domestic. The charges as alleged in this case represent a grave risk to the safety and security of our citizens,” said US Attorney Halligan.“The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.”If convicted, Tellis is subject to a maximum of ten years’ imprisonment, up to a $250,000 fine, a $100 special assessment and forfeiture. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district judge will determine any sentence after considering the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.","Ashley tellis, a scholar and expert, is being probed in the us for alleged link with china.

The Indian Army on Wednesday signed the agreement with UK-based Thales group for the procurement of the Light Weight Modular Missile (LMM) system to significantly boost its air defence architecture and strengthen its air capabilities.Thales will manufacture the missiles and launchers at Belfast, Northern Ireland, before delivering them to the Indian Army.The contract follows days after India-UK defence initiatives unveiled during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to India.In a joint statement, the Centre said the deal will further support India’s air defence capabilities and, in the spirit of ' Atmanirbhar Bharat', meet current and future requirements of the Indian Ministry of Defence while fostering long-term collaboration on complex weapons between the two countries.British defence secretary John Healey had said, ""The defence deals announced today show how our growing strategic partnership with India will boost UK business and jobs. I am hopeful this will pave the way for a deeper relationship between our two defence industries, particularly in the development of electric engines for naval ships and in air defence"" he added.The LMM is a lightweight, man-portable missile system that can be deployed in operational areas, including high-altitude regions, the Indian Army said.The missile operates on a laser beam riding guidance system, allowing precision strikes with minimal collateral damage. Equipped with a triple-effect warhead and proximity fuse, it is effective against aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, and UCAVs, including low-infrared signature targets, at ranges beyond 6 km in all-weather conditions.Weighing just 13 kg, the LMM is a supersonic weapon with speeds above Mach 1.5. Its advanced sighting system and high-explosive warhead give it a high single-shot kill probability. The system is optimised for air, land, and naval deployments, enabling rapid response against drones, light aircraft, and helicopters near borders or frontline positions, reported news agency ANI.","Thales will manufacture the missiles and launchers at belfast, northern ireland.

Carbon dioxide levels increase by record amount to new highs in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/carbon-dioxide-levels-increase-by-record-amount-to-new-highs-in-2024/articleshow/124584004.cms,"Representative image

Carbon dioxide – continued emissions and less effective carbon sinks

Methane and Nitrous Oxide

BATHINDA: Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere soared by a record amount to new highs in 2024, committing the planet to more long-term temperature increase, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).The WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin said continued emissions of CO2 from human activities and an upsurge from wildfires were responsible, as well as reduced CO2 absorption by “sinks” such as land ecosystems and the ocean – in what threatens to be a vicious climate cycle.Growth rates of CO2 have tripled since the 1960s, accelerating from an annual average increase of 0.8 ppm per year to 2.4 ppm per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020. From 2023 to 2024, the global average concentration of CO2 surged by 3.5 ppm, the largest increase since modern measurements started in 1957.“The heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbo-charging our climate and leading to more extreme weather. Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being,” said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide – the second and third most important long-lived greenhouse gases related to human activities – have also risen to record levels.WMO released the annual greenhouse gas bulletin to provide authoritative scientific information for the UN Climate Change conference in November. The COP 30 meeting in Belém, Brazil, will seek to ramp up climate action.“Sustaining and expanding greenhouse gas monitoring are critical to support such efforts,” said Oksana Tarasova, coordinator of the Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, which is one of WMO’s flagship scientific reports and is now in its 21st issue.When the bulletin was first published in 2004, the annual average level of CO2 measured by WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations was 377.1 ppm. In 2024 it was 423.9 ppm.About half of the total CO2 emitted each year remains in the atmosphere and the rest is absorbed by Earth’s land ecosystems and oceans. However, this storage is not permanent. As global temperature rises, the oceans absorb less CO2 because of decreased solubility at higher temperatures, whilst land sinks are impacted on a number of ways, including the potential for more persistent drought.The likely reason for the record growth between 2023 and 2024 was a large contribution from wildfire emissions and a reduced uptake of CO2 by land and the ocean in 2024 – the warmest year on record, with a strong El Niño.During El Niño years, CO2 levels tend to rise because the efficiency of land carbon sinks is reduced by drier vegetation and forest fires – as was the case with exceptional drought and fires in the Amazon and southern Africa in 2024.“There is concern that terrestrial and ocean CO2 sinks are becoming less effective, which will increase the amount of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere, thereby accelerating global warming . Sustained and strengthened greenhouse gas monitoring is critical to understanding these loops,” said Oksana Tarasova, a WMO senior scientific officer.Today’s CO2 emissions to the atmosphere not only impact global climate today, but will do so for hundreds of years because of its long lifetime in the atmosphere.Methane accounts for about 16% of the warming effect on our climate by long-lived greenhouse gases and has a lifetime of about nine years. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources (for example, wetlands) which are sensitive to climate as well, and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources such as cattle, rice farming, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning.The globally averaged methane concentration in 2024 were 1942 parts per billion (ppb) – an increase of 166% above pre-industrial (before 1750) levels.Nitrous oxide is the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas and comes from both natural sources and due to human activities such as biomass burning, fertiliser use and various industrial processes.The globally averaged concentration reached 338.0 ppb in 2024, an increase of 25% over the pre-industrial level.","From 2023 to 2024, the global average concentration of co2 surged by 3.5 ppm, the largest increase since modern measurements started in 1957. Wmo released the annual greenhouse gas bulletin to provide authoritative scientific information for the un climate change conference in november.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124584023,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-455364,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will stop buying Russian oil, months after Trump imposed punitive tariffs over the purchases.""He's assured me there will be no oil purchased from Russia,"" Trump said. ""You know, you can't do it immediately. It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop. Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.""""He's a friend of mine. We have a great relationship. He just said that two days ago, as you know,"" the Republican chief added.Trump made the remarks during a joint news conference with FBI director Kash Patel at the Oval Office.The US President also criticised India's previous oil imports from Russia and said: ""We were not happy with him buying oil from Russia, because that lets Russia continue on with this ridiculous war, where they've lost a million and a half people, by the way.Russia has lost a million and a half people, soldiers mostly.""He called the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict unnecessary, sayin, ""This is a war that should have never started, but it's a war that Russia should have won in the first week, and they're going into the fourth year.""""And I want to see it stop. So I was not happy that India was buying oil,"" Trump added.On being asked about the recent meeting between PM Modi and US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor, Trump said they were ""great"" and hailed PM Modi’s persistent leadership.""I think they were great. Modi is a great man. He (Sergio Gor) told me that he (PM Modi) loves Trump.I have watched India for years. It's an incredible country and every single year you would have a new leader. Some would be in there for a few months and this was year after year after year and my friend has been there now for a long time,"" Trump said.Trump further said that he wanted Putin to stop the war, which has killed thousands, and claimed it would become easier to end the conflict if India stops buying Russian oil.""All we want from President Putin is to stop this, stop killing Ukrainians and stop killing Russians because he's killing a lot of Russians.The hatred of the two leaders (Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin) is a lot, it's an obstacle. But I think we'll get them. If India doesn't buy oil, it makes it much easier. They will not be buying oil from Russia and they'll go back to Russia after the war is over.""Trump again claimed he prevented India-Pakistan nuclear conflict, saying that Prime Minister of Pakistan had recently told a group that Trump had saved millions of lives by averting a war.""The Prime Minister of Pakistan got up the other day, said so beautifully, he says, you saved millions of lives. He told that to a group of people right in this office. He said the President saved millions of lives. What he's referring to is the fact that would have been with India a nuclear war.

The New York Jets head coach, Aaron Glenn, makes his feelings clear about the trade rumors concerning Breece Hall



Breece Hall has opened up about how he cannot afford a “costly fumble” now

Breece Hall, one of the most popular and talented players in the league, has been dealing with strong trade rumors as his team, the New York Jets, continues to struggle in the new season. The New York Jets have lost all the matches that they have played in the new season so far and it has been a pretty stressful situation for the team. Amid the mess, the New York Jets head coach, Aaron Glenn, has broken his silence on the trade rumors about Breece Hall.A few hours ago, as the New York Jets head coach, Aaron Glenn, spoke to the reporters, he was asked about the buzz around Breece Hall being considered for a trade before the NFL trade deadline.Aaron Glenn said, “They are rumors…”The New York Jets head coach added, “I still feel the same way.”This is not the first time that Aaron Glenn has spoken about not wanting to trade Breece Hall.

As one of the best players on offense, I can’t put us in that situation.”Since then, the New York Jets have lost one more match against the Denver Broncos this past weekend.This has been a pretty stressful situation for the team and fans, as many remain worried about the trade rumors surrounding Breece Hall.The New York Jets have not officially commented on the trade rumors yet as the team gears up to face the Florida Panthers.Also Read: “That’s my p*ssy now”: Leaked texts show Shannon Sharpe’s sexually charged relationship with OnlyFans model before assault allegations","New york jets head coach makes his feelings clear about breece hall.

Kim Zolciak and Kyle Mowitz started dating after their divorces

Jillian Green’s legal move against Kim Zolciak

Kim Zolciak has found love again, but this time, it comes with major drama. The Real Housewives of Atlanta star is now dating Kyle Mowitz, a businessman whose estranged wife, Jillian Green, has subpoenaed Kim in their $100 million divorce case. This marks Kim’s first serious relationship since her split from Kroy Biermann. According to TMZ, Jillian recently sent Kim legal papers asking her to give a deposition in her divorce. The documents ask Kim to provide messages, proof of payments, and any communications between her and Kyle. Sources close to Kim say she was shocked when she was served the papers, reportedly at her son’s school parking lot, in front of other parents and kids.Sources told TMZ that Kim Zolciak and Kyle started dating in April or May 2025. Both had already filed for divorce before getting together, and insiders insist there was no cheating. Kim waited nearly 20 months after separating from Kroy before dating again.People close to her say she and Kyle are “very happy” and spend most of their time together, though Kim still lives in her own home.Their romance became public only after Jillian’s subpoena was filed.The timing made headlines because Jillian’s divorce battle involves a $100 million family trust, which she says Kyle misused before their split.In court papers reviewed by Reality Blurb and TMZ, Jillian’s legal team wants Kim to hand over all documents showing gifts, trips, or payments between her and Kyle. Jillian’s lawyers believe these details could help her case in the divorce.Kim Zolciak’s attorneys quickly fired back, calling the subpoena “unreasonable and oppressive.” They filed to have it canceled, saying it drags Kim into a private legal fight that has nothing to do with her. Kim also asked for a confidentiality agreement to keep her family safe from public attention, but Jillian’s team refused.Also Read: “Cause I Keep F*Ckin”: Cardi B Sparks Internet Storm After Pregnancy Tweet Tied To Stefon Diggs And Offset Feud According to TMZ, Jillian confirmed in her own deposition that she kissed another man during a Las Vegas trip in May 2024 but did not accuse Kim and Kyle of being together before her divorce was filed.Kyle has denied any wrongdoing and says his relationship with Kim began only after his separation from Jillian. As of now, the court has not decided whether Kim must testify or hand over any evidence.Kim Zolciak, who rose to fame on Real Housewives of Atlanta, has stayed quiet about the drama, focusing instead on rebuilding her life after a long and public breakup with Kroy Biermann.","Kim zolciak and kyle mowitz started dating after their divorces from kroy biermann and jillian green.
