PM leaves for Ghana

'Opportunity to rejuvenate the special bonds': PM Modi on visit to Trinidad & Tobago

First visit to Argentina in over 5 decades

'Vital' Brics Summit in Brazil

'Celebrating enduring solidarity' in Namibia

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off the landmark five-nation tour on Wednesday, with visits lined up to Ghana, Trinidad & Tobago, Argentina, Brazil, and Namibia between July 2 and 9. The wide-ranging trip is aimed at enhancing India’s deepening engagement with the Global South and its commitment to forging stronger partnerships across the Atlantic.“I am confident that my visits to the five countries will reinforce our bonds friendship across the Global South, strengthen our partnerships on both sides of the Atlantic, and deepen engagements in the multilateral platforms such as BRICS, the African Union, ECOWAS and the CARICOM,"" the Prime Minister said in his departure statement.PM Modi’s first stop is Ghana, where he will be hosted by President John Dramani Mahama. During the July 2–3 visit, PM Modi is set to focus on enhancing cooperation in sectors such as investment, energy, health, security, and development. “Ghana is a valued partner in the Global South and plays an important role in the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States,” he said. PM will also address the Parliament of Ghana- a gesture he called “an honour” for both countries as fellow democracies.Then in West Africa, the Prime Minister will travel to Trinidad & Tobago on July 3–4. Calling the Caribbean nation a country with which India shares “deep-rooted historical, cultural and people-to-people connect,” PM Modi noted that this year marks 180 years since the first Indians arrived there. He will meet President Christine Carla Kangaloo and Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, who recently began her second term in office. “This visit will provide an opportunity to rejuvenate the special bonds of ancestry and kinship that unite us,” he said.Next, PM Modi will head to Buenos Aires, marking the first bilateral visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Argentina in 57 years. Argentina, described as “a key economic partner in Latin America and a close collaborator in the G20,” is expected to deepen collaboration with India in areas like agriculture, energy, trade, technology and critical minerals. PM Modi is scheduled to meet President Javier Milei, with whom he held a prior meeting last year.The Brazil leg of the trip includes participation in the Brics Summit in Rio de Janeiro on July 6–7, followed by a bilateral state visit to Brasília. “India is committed to BRICS as a vital platform for cooperation among emerging economies. Together, we strive for a more peaceful, equitable, just, democratic and balanced multipolar world order,” the Prime Minister said. His visit to Brasília- the first by an Indian Prime Minister in nearly six decades- will include talks with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on shared Global South priorities.The tour concludes in Namibia, where PM Modi will meet President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah. Emphasising the “common history of struggle against colonialism” that binds the two nations, he said, “It will be a privilege to also address the Joint Session of Namibian Parliament as we celebrate our enduring solidarity and shared commitment for freedom and development.”The Prime Minister’s visit is being seen as a significant diplomatic push to reaffirm India’s leadership role in the Global South and expand its outreach in both Africa and Latin America.","Pm modi kicks off landmark five-nation tour with visits to ghana, trinidad & tobago, argentina, brazil, and namibia.

Strengthening pilot training and safety protocols Rebuilding passenger trust and confidence

NEW DELHI: Yet another Air India wide body aircraft had a close shave within 38 hours of the deadly June 12 AI 171 crash in Ahmedabad. Immediately after taking off from Delhi in the early hours of June 14, a Vienna-bound Boeing 777 got stall warning. It also got ground proximity warning system’s (GPWS) don’t sink caution, asking pilots not to lose altitude as the aircraft operating as AI 187 had witnessed altitude loss of about 900 feet during climb.Luckily, pilots recovered the aircraft from this precarious situation and safely proceeded to the destination. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing the incident; have already summoned AI’s head of safety for this case and both the pilots have been taken off flying duty pending the investigation.According to flight tracking sites, the B777 (VT-ALJ) took off at 2.56 am on June 14 in bad weather. Delhi was witnessing a thunderstorm that time. “The aircraft was involved in an inflight occurrence of stick shaker and GPWS caution. Soon after takeoff, stick shaker warning and GPWS don’t sink caution appeared. Stall warning came once and GPWS caution came twice. There was an altitude loss of around 900 feet during climb.Subsequently, the crew recovered the aircraft and continued the flight to Vienna,” said officials aware of the incident.Stick shaker refers to the control column on the flight deck shaking and making a noise to indicate something is not right and that the pilots’ attention to the situation is urgently required. In this case the pilots did that and saved the day. The flight landed safely in Vienna after 9 hours and 8 minutes. After this technical halt in Europe necessitated by longer routes taken these days due to enroute airspace closures, the aircraft then proceeded to Toronto with another set of crew members.However, the flight report for Delhi-Vienna sector only had the “stick shaker due turbulence after takeoff mentioned and not the other occurrences in detail,” said officials. When authorities examined the B777’s flight data recorder (DFDR), possibly as part of the enhanced surveillance ordered by the DGCA after AI 171 crash, the other occurrences of GPWS don’t sink caution and stall warning appearing came to light, they say.An AI spokesperson said: “Upon receipt of the pilot's report, the matter was disclosed to DGCA in accordance with regulations. Subsequently, upon receipt of data from the aircraft's recorders, further investigation was initiated. The pilots have been off-rostered pending the outcome of the investigation.”Both the pilots have been off rostered (taken off flying duty) pending investigation. The regulator has taken a very stern view on the June 14 incident. It is learnt AI head of safety was summoned on this issue.Following AI 171 crash, the DGCA had on June 17 raised “concern regarding recent maintenance-related issues” reported by Air India and directed the airline to strictly focus on safety while “strengthen(ing) internal coordination across engineering, operations, ground handling units.”Multiple industry insiders said: “Old Air India (PSU time) did not have comfortable planes running on time but safety was never an issue. Now planes, at least the narrow body fleet, are better but passengers are apprehensive about safety after the terrible AI 171 crash. The new management and the new owner need to win back passenger and employee trust at the earliest by doing all it takes.""","Air india wide body aircraft had a close shave within 38 hours of the deadly june 12 ai 171 crash in ahmedabad.

AHMEDABAD: The number of Indians caught crossing illegally into the US in the first five months of 2025 fell a whopping 70% over the same span last year following Donald Trump's return as President and his take-no-prisoners immigration policies. The number fell from 34,535 in Jan-May 2024 - when President Joe Biden was in office - to 10,382 in the same period of 2025.Yet, the fact that 10,382 Indians risked life and limb to sneak in even as the route becomes more perilous indicates the desperation to chase the American dream remains just as fierce. The count included at least 30 unaccompanied minors, many from Gujarat. The numbers have been released by US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP).The sharp drop coincides with the Trump administration's renewed crackdown on illegal immigration, which allegedly disrupted long-standing smuggling networks that cater to hopeful migrants from Gujarat.US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) data shows a dramatic reversal in border encounters, with daily arrests of Indians dropping to around 69 from 230. Many of these syndicates paused their operations from late 2024, anticipating Trump's return.""The moment it became clear Trump would likely win again, routes started drying up,"" a source connected to a Gujarat-based human smuggling ring told TOI. ""People still want to go, but smugglers have either scaled back or raised costs, and the fear of stricter deportation is real. ""The broader impact is also visible in USCBP's overall data, which show the number of illegal immigrants (across all nationalities) apprehended dropped sharply over the same five-month period of 2025. Such arrests fell from 81,492 in Jan to 28,617 in Feb, 29,021 in March, 29,218 in April, and 29,502 in May.Yet for many Indians, especially from Gujarat, the dream of a better life across the border remains irresistible, and often fatal. On May 9, a boat carrying illegal migrants capsized near Del Mar, California, killing 14-year-old Prince and 10-year-old Mahi.Their parents, Brijesh and Sangita Patel, survived the wreck with grievous injuries. The deaths are not isolated. At least nine people from Gujarat are confirmed to have died while trying to cross the US border since Jan 2025.Of the at least 30 unaccompanied minors caught this year, agents said some were probably abandoned by adult companions during the perilous journey. In some cases, smugglers encouraged families to separate in hopes that minors would be treated more leniently under US immigration rules.According to officials, Gujarat continues to be one of the main sources of such illegal migration. ""Over the past decade, networks of agents have established overland routes through Central America,"" an official said.","Number fell from 34,535 in jan-may 2024 - when president joe biden was in office - to 10,382 in the same period of 2025.

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday told the US that it reserves the right to respond and defend itself against terrorism as well as pre-empt and deter any further cross-border attacks from Pakistan, days after President Donald Trump effusively praised Pakistan army chief Asim Munir while hosting him at the White House.In a 20-minute telephonic conversation with US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth, defence minister Rajnath Singh also made it clear that India's actions were ""measured, non-escalatory, proportionate and focused"" on disabling terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and POK when it launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, sources told TOI. While India believes Pakistan has become a safe haven for terrorists as internationally banned terrorists enjoy immunity there, Trump had praised both Munir as well as PM Modi as ""two very smart people"" for ending May 7-10 hostilities.Also read: Rajnath Singh speaks to US defence secretary Pete Hegseth; reviews defence ties, thanks US for anti-terror support Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir has continued with his rant against India, reaffirming Pakistan's commitment to providing support to the Kashmiri people for their ""legitimate struggle"".Singh, on his part, told Hegseth that India appreciates the unwavering support extended by the US for its fight against terrorism.""On defence cooperation, the two agreed to further build upon the momentum of this critical and mutually beneficial partnership across all its pillars such as interoperability, integration of defence industrial supply chains, logistics sharing, increased joint military exercises and cooperation with other like-minded partners,"" an official said.Also read: Quad meeting: Pahalgam terror attack was economic warfare, says Jaishankar; rules out yielding to nuclear blackmail Singh asked Hegseth to ensure faster deliveries of the long-delayed General Electric GE-F404 engines for the indigenous Tejas-Mark 1A fighters as well as the early conclusion of the agreement to jointly produce the more powerful GE-F414 engines in India.The defence minister also pushed for the delivery of the six Apache heavy-duty attack helicopters that the Indian Army had ordered in a Rs 5,691 crore deal in Feb 2020 but is yet to get.""The six Apaches will now be delivered before this year ends,"" another official said. The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-F404 engines by US firm General Electric, which Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) had ordered for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, is one of the main reasons for not even the first Tejas Mark-1A fighter to be delivered to the IAF yet. After the 83 ""improved"" Tejas Mark-1A jets are delivered under the defence ministry's Rs 46,898 crore deal inked with HAL in Feb 2021, another 97 of those jets for Rs 67,000 crore will also be in the pipeline.","Deliver tejas engines on priority, rajnath tells us secretary of defence pete hegseth.

I think the trade people are doing what the trade people should be doing, which is negotiate with numbers and lines and products and do their trade-offs.

NEW DELHI: India will exercise its right to defend its citizens from terrorism , and it expects Quad partners to understand and appreciate that, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told his Quad counterparts in Washington. Going into the Quad foreign ministers' meeting - ahead of the summit that India will host later this year - the minister drew attention to the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack, saying the world must display zero tolerance.""Victims and perpetrators must never be equated. And India has every right to defend its people against terrorism, and we will exercise that right. We expect our Quad partners to understand and appreciate that,"" the minister said in his opening remarks.Victims and perpetrators must never be equated, EAM Jaishankar said while speaking alongside American secretary of state Marco Rubio and his Australian and Japanese counterparts, Penny Wong and Takeshi Iwaya, respectively.Jaishankar's comments about India's expectations from Quad partners on the issue of terror are significant in the light of recent remarks by US President Donald Trump that seemed to draw an equivalence between India and Pakistan.Also, while Quad countries individually condemned the attack, India would have ideally liked them to do so in a joint statement.Earlier, in a conversation with US magazine Newsweek, the minister bluntly said India would not let the West's fear of a nuclear conflagration constrain its response to future Pakistan-backed terror attacks. ""We are very clear there will be no impunity for terrorists, that we will not deal with them any longer as proxies and spare the govt which supports and finances and, in many ways, motivates them. We will not allow nuclear blackmail to prevent us from responding,"" he said.""We've also heard this for too long... therefore the other guys will come and do horrible things, but you must not do anything because it gets the world worried. Now, we are not going to fall for that. If he is going to come and do things, we are going to go there and hit the people who did this. So no yielding to nuclear blackmail, no impunity to terrorists, no more free pass that they are proxies. And we will do what we have to do to defend our people,"" Jaishankar said. Speaking about Quad, the minister said it was committed to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. ""To that end, our endeavours are devoted to promoting a rules-based international order. It is essential that nations of the Indo-Pacific have the freedom of choice, so essential to make right decisions on development and security,"" he said.Even as India and others deny that Quad is a security alliance, both Beijing and Moscow see the grouping's primary objective as containment of China.

For Isro, benefits and learnings from the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission to the International Space Station (ISS) will far outweigh the cost it has had to incur in sending Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux).The Rs 548 crore spent on the mission is a fraction of what India would have otherwise needed to spend on replicating the same training, exposure and systems-level experience, Isro chairman V Narayanan told TOI, in his first exclusive interview about the multinational commercial mission.Speaking from Houston, Narayanan said that the learning outcomes — spanning astronaut training (for two astronauts), mission operations, and hardware-software-human interface — cannot be measured purely in monetary terms.“For a country of 140 crore people, what we’ve spent is only marginal,,” Narayanan said. For that, he said: “We’ve gained access to infrastructure and experience that would otherwise require thousands of crores.” If one looks at the per capita cost on the Indian population, it adds up to around Rs 4 per head.Narayanan, dismissing observations that Ax-4 is “just a commercial mission”, said discussions on such strategic missions must be rooted in long-term capability building rather than short-term financial arithmetic.“For a programme like Gaganyaan , which spans Rs 20,000 crore including follow-on missions, these early investments are necessary. Training, confidence, exposure, systems understanding — these are foundational,” he said.He added that maturity in public discourse is essential. “People must recognise that not all benefits can be quantified. But they can certainly be measured in preparedness and capability,” he said.Narayanan identified five key areas where Ax-4 will directly strengthen India’s human spaceflight capabilities: Training exposure, confidence building, operational experience, systems-and-process understanding, and cross-disciplinary learning.“Our astronauts trained in world-class facilities simulating space conditions, including microgravity and life-support systems. Each hour of training they’ve undergone would cost crores if we were to replicate the infrastructure ourselves,” he said.He added that interacting with seasoned astronauts — including those who have flown to space multiple times or performed several spacewalks — helped boost the confidence of Indian crew members and mission teams.Astronauts — Shux and his backup Group Captain Prashant Nair — learnt how to function in space as a team, handle real-time challenges, and carry out experiments. He said working on and observing the mission to ISS has given India insights into module design, layout, onboard systems, and processes that will feed into future Gaganyaan and space station designs.“We will, of course, have our own design and technology, but all this experience will help us develop those better,” he said.Narayanan, who is leading efforts to ensure astronaut safety, said he has himself gained from observing operations in Houston. “From data handling to high-level system safety discussions, our understanding of the end-to-end process has grown. This cannot be acquired by simulation or literature review alone,” he said.He added that the experience is equally valuable for backroom mission teams and decision-makers, who will now have real-world references to draw upon while preparing for Gaganyaan. TOI had reported last week about some specifics the Isro team is learning back in Houston, where mission control for Ax-4 is.India plans to build its own space station after the Gaganyaan crewed flights. Narayanan said direct exposure to the ISS environment will inform the design, configuration, and operational planning of the proposed Indian facility.“We had only studied the ISS on paper. Now we are seeing it in action. We may not adopt the same model, but this will help us make informed design choices,” he said.","Isro chairman v narayanan told toi, in his first exclusive interview about the multinational commercial mission. The rs 548 crore spent on the mission is a fraction of what india would have otherwise needed to spend on replicating the same training, exposure and systems-level experience, he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122190891,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1178193,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

India's Reach Now Deep Into China, Pak As Russia Offers Deadly R37M Hypersonic Missile

NEW DELHI: General Upendra Dwivedi is now on a four-day trip to Bhutan to further enhance the already close bilateral military ties, which come at a time when China continues to strengthen its military infrastructure in the Doklam plateau that saw a 73-day face-off between the Indian and Chinese armies in 2017.The Army chief will call on Bhutanese King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and hold wide-ranging talks with Lt General Batoo Tshering, the chief operations officer of the Royal Bhutan Army, during the visit.Gen Dwivedi will also interact with senior officials of the Indian embassy, the Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) stationed in the country, and Project Dantak of the Border Roads Organisation, which is engaged in the construction of roads and other developmental work there.“The visit reflects the deep-rooted and time-tested ties between India and Bhutan and reaffirms India’s commitment to a close and trusted partner,” Army spokesperson Colonel Nishant Arvind said.India has been keeping a close watch on the series of border talks between Bhutan and an expansionist China in a bid to resolve their territorial disputes, which include the Doklam plateau in the west and the Jakarlung and Pasamlung valleys in the north.Ever since India’s military confrontation with China in April 2020, after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh, the Indian Army has also been shoring up defenses in the strategically vulnerable Siliguri Corridor, or `Chicken’s Neck,’ the narrow strip of land in north Bengal that connects the northeast with the rest of India.The PLA has steadily stepped up its activities and infrastructure development in the Bhutanese territory of Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction, which witnessed the 73-day face-off between the rival troops in 2017.Indian troops had then blocked PLA attempts to extend their motorable track towards the Jampheri Ridge, which overlooks the Siliguri Corridor. After the disengagement, the PLA has constructed a lot of military infrastructure and permanently deployed troops in north Doklam, as reported by TOI earlier.",General upendra dwivedi is now on a four-day trip to bhutan to further enhance the already close bilateral military ties.

Double booster shot for India's blue-water combat capabilities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/navys-blue-water-capabilities-get-a-double-boost/articleshow/122193775.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a double booster shot for the country’s blue-water combat capabilities on Tuesday, the last Indian warship to be constructed abroad was commissioned as INS Tamal in Russia, while an indigenous stealth frigate was delivered to the Navy by Mazagon Docks (MDSL).Both the 3,900-tonne frigate INS Tamal and the 6,670-tonne frigate built by MDSL, which will be commissioned as INS Udaygiri next month, are packed with advanced sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic precision-strike cruise missiles whose range has been extended to 450-km from the original 290-km.“Both the multi-mission frigates, which have enhanced stealth features to reduce detection by enemy radars, pack a deadly punch augmented by their network-centric warfare capabilities,” a senior officer told TOI.For air defence, Udaygiri is equipped with the Israeli-origin Barak-8 surface-to-air missile system, with an interception range of 70-km against fighters, helicopters, drones and cruise missiles. INS Tamal, in turn, has the Russian Shtil vertical launched anti-aircraft missiles with an enhanced range of over 50-km, among other weapons like rockets, guns and torpedoes.Speaking at the commissioning of INS Tamal at the Yantar shipyard in Kaliningrad, Western Naval Command chief Vice Admiral Sanjay Jasjit Singh said, “I am confident the warship will prove its mettle as a force multiplier in our operational architecture towards safeguarding national maritime interests and promoting maritime security.”Overall, the 140-warship Navy now has another 58 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards for over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while another 31 warships are in the planning stage. This naval expansion is crucial to tackle the maritime collusiveness between Pakistan and China, which is making major strategic inroads into the Indian Ocean Region with the world’s largest naval force of 370 warships.Udaygiri is the second of the seven multi-role frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at MDSL in Mumbai and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of Rs 45,000 crore. The first was commissioned as INS Nilgiri in Jan, while the other five are to be progressively delivered by end-2026.Interestingly, Udaygiri is the 100ship designed and delivered by the Navy’s inhouse Warship Design Bureau. INS Tamal, in turn, is the 51ship produced under the India-Russia strategic collaboration over the last 65 years.It was in Oct 2018 that India had inked the agreement with Russia for four upgraded Krivak-III class frigates, with the first two INS Tushil (commissioned last Dec) and INS Tamal to be imported for around Rs 8,000 crore.The other two, Triput and Tavasya, in turn, are being built at the Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore. These four new warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted from 2003-2004 onwards. All these frigates can also carry Kamov-31 early-warning and Kamov-28 multirole helicopters.",The last indian warship to be constructed abroad was commissioned as ins tamal in russia.

Carolina Hurricanes target Nikolaj Ehlers after expiry of $42M Jets deal

Nikolaj Ehlers is expected to hit the open market in NHL Free Agency 2025 after completing a seven-year, $42 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets. The Carolina Hurricanes have emerged as strong contenders to land the 28-year-old winger—known for his speed, scoring touch, and offensive creativity. If he moves, it could be one of the biggest signings of the offseason.According to NHL insider Elliotte Friedman on the Spittin’ Chiclets podcast, the Hurricanes are showing serious interest in Ehlers.“Carolina, I think they really want that guy,” Friedman said, especially now with Mitch Marner likely off the board and other top names from Florida still uncertain.Ehlers perfectly fits Carolina’s style—fast, skilled, and creative. The Hurricanes have traditionally avoided overly physical players, preferring mobile, playmaking forwards. With Ehlers’ ability to generate offense and stretch defenses, he checks every box.The Hurricanes have been playoff regulars in recent seasons, but remain in search of that final push to become true Stanley Cup contenders. Adding a veteran winger with Ehlers’ scoring and skating ability could be the spark they need.Ehlers has played all 674 of his NHL games with Winnipeg, tallying 225 goals and 520 points over nine seasons. His best year came in 2016–17 when he posted 64 points, but even in recent seasons, he's maintained a strong two-way presence.Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff has made it clear that the team wants to re-sign him, calling Ehlers a player who developed within their system and someone they’d like to keep long-term.With the cap rising and several teams flush with spending room, the market could quickly heat up.

Ayesha Curry reflects on media exposure and Red Table Talk with Jada Pinkett Smith, regret



undefined

In a candid new conversation with Insider, Ayesha Curry , author, entrepreneur, and wife of NBA superstar Stephen Curry, opened up about her growing discomfort with the spotlight. It was a reflection shaped by years of public scrutiny. She particularly expressed regret over her 2019 appearance on Jada Pinkett Smith ’s Red Table Talk, which she says misrepresented her and ultimately shifted her view of fame, privacy, and the public’s expectations of celebrity families.Ayesha Curry’s journey into public life began organically, as her husband’s NBA career skyrocketed with the Golden State Warriors. She was a frequent guest on talk shows, celebrated for her relatable charm and culinary ventures. But behind the public appearances was a growing internal conflict. It became more evident after she appeared in the Red Table Talk interview with Jada Pinkett Smith in May 2019.During that appearance, Ayesha spoke frankly about her insecurities as the wife of a high-profile athlete and how she navigated the attention Steph Curry received from other women.“Stephen is very nice by nature. And he’s very talkative. … Obviously, you know, the devil is a liar.The ladies will always be lurking, hoping for their moment and waiting. You need to be aware of that,” she said on the show. “I honestly hate it. … We had the conversation about it, and he tries really, really hard if we’re going somewhere, he’s introduced me. I don’t like to have to introduce myself.”Looking back, Ayesha told Business Insider in 2023 that she was blindsided by how the interview was edited. “It’s not what I said, and the context was weird,” she explained. “Yeah. I took that one personally.” According to her, the episode portrayed her in a way that didn’t reflect the truth of what she shared.“When the social media thing started, nobody knew what that was going to become,” she said. “If we had known back in the day just how chaotic it would make life, I don’t think we would’ve done it.”Following backlash from her Red Table Talk appearance, Ayesha addressed critics through an emotional Instagram post on May 8, 2019. “I have never been one to cage my feelings and emotions to any capacity. I am human,” she wrote. “It brings me pure joy to speak my mind, be vulnerable at times and to know myself inside and out.”Recognizing that it was Mental Health Awareness Month, she added, “I really want to take the time to encourage everyone to speak their truth regardless of perception, fitting into a mold or offending someone, because it’s YOUR truth. And that’s okay!”Despite her issues with the editing, she still expressed gratitude toward Jada Pinkett Smith: “There is so much more depth to the talk and our family is grateful to @jadapinkettsmith for giving us the opportunity to bond together.”Also Read: Julie Vanloo gets heartbreaking news from Golden State Valkyries right after international flight touches down Years passed by, and Ayesha has long since gotten over that huge public scrutiny.

From NHL hopefuls to legal uncertainty

Once rising names in Canadian hockey, five young players—Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Carter Hart, Cal Foote, and Alex Formenton—now find their professional careers in limbo as they await a court verdict on July 24, stemming from sexual assault charges tied to a 2018 incident. What began as a celebration of a gold-medal victory at the World Junior Championships has spiraled into a national scandal that shook Hockey Canada and left the futures of these athletes hanging by a thread.The allegations relate to a night in June 2018, following a Hockey Canada gala in London, Ontario. According to investigators, the incident occurred in a hotel room, involving a then-unnamed woman and several players. Now, all five accused have pleaded not guilty, but their absence from NHL rosters and legal entanglements suggest the damage is already done.Michael McLeod, once a top draft pick and playoff hero for the New Jersey Devils, took an indefinite leave in January 2024 and was charged shortly thereafter. He now plays in Russia’s KHL as he awaits his fate.Dillon Dube had a breakout moment with the Calgary Flames during the 2020 playoffs, but after being charged in early 2024, he too left the NHL.He signed with Dinamo Minsk in Belarus, his mental health cited as the reason for his initial leave of absence.Carter Hart, who had once been dubbed Canada’s next elite goaltender, now sits without an NHL contract. His career came to an abrupt stop in 2023, shortly before charges were filed. Once backed by the Philadelphia Flyers, he now finds himself as an unrestricted free agent.Both Cal Foote and Alex Formenton sought refuge in European leagues, their North American careers stalled by the court case.
