"Extradition: Delhi, Mumbai jails being readied for 26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/extradition-delhi-mumbai-jails-being-readied-for-26/11-mastermind-tahawwur-rana/articleshow/120105633.cms,"NEW DELHI: With 26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana slated to land in India on Wednesday, two jails, one in Delhi and another in Mumbai, were asked to covertly make special arrangements in line with US judiciary recommendations about extradited subjects. He is initially likely to be in custody of NIA for the first few weeks. The exercise was supervised by national security adviser A K Doval, along with officials from the home ministry.Rana, a Pakistani-Canadian and active member of LeT, had arranged passports for fellow jihadi, Pakistani-American David Coleman Headley , aka Dawood Gilani, to travel to India to select targets for the terror attack that was being hatched by Lashkar in collaboration with ISI, Pakistan's spy agency. Rana gloated over the deaths in Mumbai on Nov 26, 2008 and said that the jihadis responsible for it should be given Pakistan's highest posthumous military honours.So far only Ajmal Kasab, the sole LeT terrorist involved in 26/11 rampage who was nabbed alive, had been prosecuted.In Feb, US President Donald Trump had confirmed Rana's extradition to India saying he was pleased to announce that Rana is ""going back to India to face justice"".The extradition was the result of sustained efforts by the Modi govt since 2019. That year in Dec, India had submitted a diplomatic note to the US to extradite Rana. On June 10, 2020, India filed a complaint seeking the provisional arrest of Rana to pave the way for his extradition.A confidant of ISI's Major Iqbal who conceptualised the Mumbai attacks, Rana and David Coleman Headley had established the groundwork for the Mumbai attacks, according to documents submitted in US court by both countries.Rana had personally arrived in Mumbai via Dubai before the attacks to ensure arrangements were precisely executed, say investigators. ""He had checked into hotel Renaissance in Powai during his visit to India between Nov 11 and Nov 21 in 2008. The attacks occurred five days after he departed,"" states a police document.According to a justice department document, Rana and Headley were apprehended in 2009 by FBI whilst plotting an assault against a Danish newspaper as well as providing material support, from 2005 to 2009, to Lashkar.Headley had testified in a US court that in the early summer of 2006, he and two Lashkar members discussed establishing an immigration office in Mumbai as a facade for his surveillance activities. Headley had travelled to Chicago and informed Rana, his longstanding friend since their schooldays in Pakistan, of his assignment to scout potential targets in India.Such was their understanding that in the late summer of 2009, Rana and Headley agreed that funds that had been provided to Rana could be used to fund Headley's work in Denmark, and the evidence showed that Rana pretended to be Headley in sending an email to the Danish newspaper.For Mumbai attacks, Headley obtained approval from Rana, who owned First World Immigration Services in Chicago and elsewhere, to establish a First World office in Mumbai as a cover for his activities. Headley had travelled to India five times between 2007 and 2008 and conducted reconnaissance for the Mumbai attacks - using a five-year visa that Rana had assisted him in obtaining.""Rana directed an individual associated with First World to prepare documents supporting Headley's cover story, and advised Headley how to obtain a visa for travel to India,"" states the justice department document. Mumbai Police had also discovered email communications between Headley and Rana discussing Major Iqbal.","26/11 mastermind tahawwur rana slated to land in india on wednesday.

NEW DELHI: London high court on Tuesday rejected Indian government's application to appeal in the UK Supreme Court against the discharge of Sanjay Bhandari , a defence consultant wanted on charges of tax evasion and money laundering. The judgement also said that Bhandari, in Tihar jail , would be at risk ""of extortion and violence"" from ""other prisoners and prison officials""""In our judgment, having regard to all the evidence and information provided on this ground, including the fresh evidence, we conclude that in Tihar prison, the appellant (Bhandari) would be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by threatened or actual violence, from other prisoners and/or prison officials,"" their judgment said.The application, part of a two-step process to escalate the case to the UK Supreme Court, was the government's first move—but with this stage denied, officials have yet to confirm whether they will seek direct permission from the Supreme Court.""The court received an application from the government of India seeking certification of points of law of general importance and grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court,"" justice Timothy Holroyde said.""Having considered the written submissions, the court is satisfied that no oral hearing is necessary, and no further submissions required. The two points on which leave to appeal was sought is refused. The reasons being that neither of the points of law of general importance were involved in the court's decision,"" he added.The court granted Bhandari's appeal against extradition on human rights grounds, ruling that sending him to India would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) due to concerns over the conditions of his proposed custody in Tihar Jail. Additionally, the court upheld a second ground under Article 6 of the ECHR, citing concerns about the burden and standard of proof in Indian criminal trials, which could undermine his right to a fair trial.Bhandari was ordered to be discharged in February after a ruling by Westminster Magistrates' Court in November 2022, which led to the withdrawal of then UK home secretary Suella Braverman’s extradition order.He faced two separate extradition requests from India—one certified in June 2020 for alleged money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, and another in June 2021 for allegedly attempting to evade tax under the Black Money Act, 2015.",London high court on tuesday rejected indian government's application to appeal in the uk supreme court against the discharge of sanjay bhandari.

In the defence sector, the focus was on working together in co-development and co-production of equipment.According to the Indian govt, Modi expressed his gratitude to the UAE leadership for ensuring the welfare of around 4.3 million Indians living in the UAE, acknowledging their vital role in the vibrant relations between the two nations.""Dubai has played a key role in advancing the India-UAE Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. This special visit reaffirms our deep-rooted friendship and paves the way for even stronger collaboration in the future,"" said Modi in a post on X.Sheikh Hamdan said that his meeting with Modi reaffirmed the strength of UAE-India ties which are ""built on trust, shaped by history, and driven by a shared vision to create a future full of opportunity, innovation and lasting prosperity"".Defence minister Rajnath Singh also held a separate ""productive"" meeting with the visiting dignitary and later said India is eager to work closely with the Gulf nation in the defence sector, including in co-production and co-development projects.

India offers Akash defence missile system to UAE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-offers-made-in-india-akash-defence-missile-system-to-uae/articleshow/120107195.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday offered the indigenous Akash air defence missile system to the UAE, even as the two countries decided to step-up their bilateral defence cooperation in fields ranging from military exercises and training exchanges to defence-industrial collaboration, joint projects, R&D and technology transfer.The offer for the Akash system, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a range of 25-km, was made at the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and the visiting Dubai crown prince and UAE deputy PM Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.This is in keeping with India’s ongoing thrust to export the Akash system, Pinaka multi-launch rocket systems and the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile to “friendly countries”, especially in the Gulf and Asean regions.While India has already exported BrahMos coastal batteries to the Philippines, Armenia has become the first foreign customer for the Akash, Pinaka and 155mm artillery guns.India and the UAE at the meeting acknowledged that bilateral defence cooperation needs to be scaled up to match the progress made in other areas such as trade and business, in line with “the vision and determination of the two leaders”, PM Narendra Modi and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.Singh, describing the meeting as “productive”, said, “For India, the comprehensive strategic partnership with the UAE is of immense priority. In the coming years, we are eager to work closely in areas such as defence cooperation, co-production and co-development projects, innovation and technology. Both India and the UAE are committed to work towards peace and prosperity in the region.”The two leaders, who also discussed the current geopolitical developments, expressed “happiness” on the current defence cooperation through institutional mechanisms, military exercises, exchange of training programmes and the like. “They identified training exchanges as one of the key areas of defence cooperation which would enable understanding of each other’s defence ecosystems and accelerate strengthening of bilateral defence ties,” an official said.The two sides decided that close collaboration between their defence industries should be an integral part of the bilateral cooperation and discussed opportunities for enhancing partnerships in defence manufacturing.They welcomed the India-UAE Defence Partnership Forum, which has the potential to result in strategic joint ventures and co-production projects benefiting the two countries. “They also agreed to focus on complementarities in the Make-in-India and Make-in-Emirates initiatives,” the official said.Significantly, apart from bilateral military exercises and initiatives, India and UAE have also teamed up with France to collaborate in a trilateral framework launched in 2022 in several areas including defence, technology, energy and environment, in tune with an ambitious roadmap chalked out by them.In the military arena, the three countries in Dec last year had conducted a major air combat exercise “Desert Knight” over the Arabian Sea to strengthen trilateral defence cooperation and enhance military interoperability amid the ongoing geopolitical churn.The navies of the three countries had also conducted their first-ever maritime partnership exercise to hone their combat skills against traditional as well as non-traditional threats through a wide spectrum of operations on the high seas in June 2023.","The offer for the akash system, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a range of 25-km, was made at the delegation-level meeting.

No-trust move against J&K Speaker over Waqf debate ‘gag’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-trust-move-against-jk-speaker-over-waqf-debate-gag/articleshow/120103917.cms,"SRINAGAR/JAMMU: Waqf law rocked J&K assembly for the second day Tuesday as opposition PDP and Sajad Lone’s People’s Conference brought a no-confidence motion against Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather for not allowing a debate on the act. Rather’s own party, the governing NC, urged him to show flexibility and permit the discussion.BJP, however, supported the Speaker for his decision on Monday disallowing discussions on the law. Rather insisted the law had been challenged in Supreme Court and assembly rules prohibited discussions on a sub-judice case. The row had flared after opposition members targeted CM Omar Abdullah for taking a walk in Srinagar’s Tulip Garden with Union minister Kiran Rijiju, who had piloted the Waqf bill in Parliament.On Tuesday, PDP legislator Waheed Parra displayed a resolution on Waqaf law, asking the Speaker to allow the debate. Lone and other legislators joined in. When Parra persisted, he was marshalled out on Rather’s orders, stoking the tensions.Earlier in the House, NC members had asked the Speaker to understand the sense of the House and allow the discussion. NC legislator and chief spokesman Tanvir Sadiq said 25 members of his party had sought a debate and urged the Speaker to allow it. Rather was unmoved, leading to adjournment of the House. “There is no rule that bars discussion (in the assembly) on any law passed by Parliament,” Parra said outside. Speaking later in the day about his decision and the members’ protests, Rather said: “If the House has no confidence, then I have no right to be there.”Earlier, when the House had reassembled in the afternoon, Lone moved a formal no-confidence seeking the Speaker’s removal. The motion was signed by three PDP legislators, including Parra. Lone cited outrage over Rather’s actions. “Such conduct undermines democratic principles governing this esteemed institution (assembly). J&K is the only Muslim province in India. History will hold us in contempt if we do not send a strong message against this bill,” Lone said. He called the Speaker an impediment in voicing “our opinion against the law”.Lone went to the extent of asking Rather to retire to his chamber and hand charge to deputy Speaker Mubarak Gul for the Waqf discussion. This angered NC, which refused to support the motion against Rather. “He is the senior-most leader of the party (NC) and has presented over a dozen budgets as (J&K) finance minister. We are only asking him that the rules cannot override the mandate and sentiments of people. We hope he shows some flexibility,” NC’s Salman Sagar said.Rather cited rules and stuck to his stand. “If it is not the concern of this govt, the motion (for a Waqf) discussion cannot be taken up,” Rather said. BJP members thumped tables in his support. Amid the uproar, deputy CM Surinder Choudhary pleaded with the Speaker to understand the sentiments. “We have been elected by the people. If it is the concern of the members, it is the concern of the govt, too,” NC’s Choudhary said.Eventually, the house was adjourned for the day without any business, with Rather in focus rather than the Waqf la",Opposition pdp and sajad lone’s people's conference brought a no-confidence motion against speaker abdul rahim rather.

Chinese manufacturing is built on a complete and continually upgrading industrial system, sustained investment in R&D, and a strong focus on innovation. China is a firm defender of economic globalization and multilateralism, which has injected strong impetus into the world economy, contributing to around 30 percent of global growth annually on average. We will continue to work with the rest of the world to safeguard the multilateral trade system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core,"" Yu said.""China-India economic and trade relationship is based on complementarity and mutual benefit. Facing the US abuse of tariffs, which deprives countries, especially Global South countries, of their right to development, the two largest developing countries should stand together to overcome the difficulties. Trade and tariff wars have no winners. All countries should uphold the principles of extensive consultation, practice true multilateralism, jointly oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism,"" she added.This comes at a time when China remains one of the US's top trading partners, with bilateral goods trade reaching $582 billion in 2024. The US trade deficit with China — ranging between $263 billion and $295 billion last year — remains a key point of contention.The fresh threat from Trump, issued via a post on Truth Social, warned that unless China rolls back its recently announced 34 per cent tariff hike by April 8, Washington will respond with additional duties, raising the cumulative tariff rate on Chinese goods to a staggering 104 per cent.Meanwhile, China vowed to retaliate against the United States if President Donald Trump goes ahead with his threat to impose fresh 50 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports.Reacting to Trump's new threat, China hinted of imposing more retaliatory tariffs on American products.

Usha Vance says she's not from a wealthy MAGA background



Second Lady Usha Vance, who was the recently the eye of the storm over her Greenland visit, has spoken out about the attacks that she and Vice President JD Vance receive -- and a majority of it stems from her Indian roots. “Do I think it’s great when people talk about ‘ normalizing Indian hate ’ or something like that? Absolutely not. I think it’s terrible,"" Usha Vance said in an interview with The Free Press. ]But Usha said these racist attacks are nothing new. “I think it’s our relationship to this information”—the technology, the screens, the social media—“that is potentially new.”The recent India hate that surrounded JD ad Usha was DOGE staff Marko Elez, who made multiple racist posts in the past. ""Normalize Indian hate,"" one of his posts read. These racist posts got him fired from DOGE, but JD Vance was in favor of rehiring him, which drew ire from Indian-origin Democratic Rep Ro Khanna, who reminded JD Vance of that his kids share Indian origin because of Usha's roots.""Are you going to tell him (Marko Elez) to apologize for saying 'Normalize Indian hate' before this rehire?

What is Alien Enemies Act?

The

Alien Enemies Act

is a wartime law that gives the president the power to deport immigrants from countries considered enemies during a time of war.

During his campaign, Donald Trump said he planned to use the Act, which has not been enforced since World War II, when it was used to detain Japanese Americans.

The law is meant to be used when the US is at war with another country, or if a foreign nation attacks or threatens to attack the US.

To use the Act, the president must officially declare the event that triggered its use. The law stays active until the president ends it.

The Trump administration argued that foreign drug cartels could be treated as an “invasion” or “predatory incursion,” allowing it to invoke the law.

The US supreme court on Monday lifted a lower court's order that had blocked the deportation of undocumented Venezuelan migrants under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA)—a wartime law.In a narrow 5–4 ruling, the justices allowed deportations to resume, siding with the Trump administration ’s decision to expel the migrants under a proclamation targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. However, the court also said that those deported under the AEA must be given a fair chance to challenge their removal in court.Trump praised the court’s decision in a post on his Truth Social: “The supreme court has upheld the rule of law in our nation by allowing a president, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our borders, and protect our families and our country, itself. A great day for justice in America!”","The us supreme court on monday lifted a lower court's order that had blocked the deportation of undocumented venezuelan migrants under the 1798 alien enemies act.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran khan, ousted in april 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

What is Alien Enemies Act?



Salvadoran President confirmed the arrival of 'illegal aliens'



US President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised the Supreme Court for clearing the way for his administration to press ahead with immigration actions.The ruling included deporting alleged gang members under a wartime law dating back to 1798 called the "" Alien Enemies Act "".“Thanks to the Supreme Court yesterday and today, we had a big ruling, too,” Trump said. “We had a very big ruling today, but we will continue to deport these monsters under the Alien Enemies Act.”Taking to his Truth Social platform, Trump added: “Last month, we officially designated Tren de Aragua , MS-13 and the Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations—and thanks to the Supreme Court yesterday... we will continue to deport these monsters under the Alien Enemies Act.”Last month, Trump officials flew 250 accused gang members to El Salvador. Upon landing, the alleged criminals — including 238 members of Tren de Aragua and 23 MS-13 operatives — were met by heavily armed commandos, chained, and transferred to the infamous Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT).The Supreme Court delivered two major rulings this week that bolster Trump’s agenda to tighten the borders and reduce the size of the federal workforce. In one ruling on Monday, the justices overturned a lower court's decision that had blocked the removal of several men alleged to be gang members — including members of Venezuela’s feared Tren de Aragua group — without formal legal proceedings. The court said deportations under the Alien Enemies Act may continue, although detainees must still be given due process.The Alien Enemies Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Acts passed in 1798, allows the US government to detain and remove nationals from hostile nations during times of conflict. Trump invoked the act earlier this year to detain and deport suspected members of foreign criminal organisations, which he has since designated as “foreign terrorist organisations.”In a second win for Trump on Tuesday, the Supreme Court temporarily halted a lower court’s order that would have required federal agencies to reinstate about 16,000 workers the Trump administration had previously dismissed. This pause allows Trump to continue reshaping federal departments as part of his cost-cutting strategy.Trump also drew a contrast between his administration and that of Joe Biden, claiming that last year under Biden there were “more than 184,000 illegal aliens” in the country. “Under my administration, we released nine — all because of medical emergencies only,” he said.Last month, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted a video on his X account confirming the arrival of Tren de Aragua members after being deported from the US: ""Today, the first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, arrived in our country. They were immediately transferred to CECOT, the Terrorism Confinement Center, for one year (renewable),” he wrote. “The United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us.”He also confirmed the arrival of 23 MS-13 members wanted in El Salvador, including two high-ranking leaders.Tren de Aragua, originally a prison gang in Venezuela, has gained ground in several US cities. In New York, the gang has been linked to retail theft, phone snatching, and peddling a synthetic drug known as Tusi.The Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that Trump invoked for deportations, allowed him to target gang members from Tren de Aragua. “They can be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies,” he said.",Us president donald trump praised the supreme court for clearing the way for his administration to press ahead with immigration actions.

Wall Street's wild ride

Tariffs at the center of economic anxiety

Business leaders hit a wall

Growing warnings from Wall Street

A shift in Trump's approach—or not?

Country by country list of new tariffs announced by Trump

White House defends the policy

Amid mounting criticism over plunging markets and global economic unease, US President Donald Trump has defended his aggressive tariff policy, insisting he ""stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street.""""I’m proud to be the President for the workers, not the outsourcers; the President who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street; who protects the middle class, not the political class; and who defends America, not trade cheaters all over the globe,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Trump's comments came as US financial markets experienced another day of dramatic swings. The S&P 500, after soaring 4.1 per cent in early trade on Tuesday, quickly lost ground, tumbling to a 3 per cent loss before closing down 1.6 per cent. The index now sits nearly 19 per cent below its February peak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 320 points lower—down 0.8 per cent—after wiping out an earlier gain of 1,460 points. The Nasdaq Composite slid 2.1 per cent.The extreme volatility echoed across global markets, with indices in Tokyo, Paris, and Shanghai posting morning rallies before analysts warned of further instability. Much of the chaos is tied to investor uncertainty over how far Trump will take his trade war—and for how long.Trump's sweeping tariffs, which are set to intensify, have unsettled investors and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Economists caution that if the trade restrictions linger, they could push the US into recession by raising consumer prices and disrupting global supply chains. A swift de-escalation through negotiations, however, could mitigate the damage.Despite these warnings, Trump has shown no signs of backing down—even as top business leaders and political donors attempt to influence his decisions behind the scenes.In recent days, Wall Street billionaires and corporate CEOs have stepped up efforts to reverse the administration's trade stance, but to little effect. Following Trump's latest tariff announcement, banking executives—including JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon—met with commerce secretary Howard Lutnick in a closed-door session. Sources say Lutnick was unmoved.Elsewhere, GOP megadonors and hedge fund tycoons have tried to sway the White House through calls to senior aides, including chief of staff Susie Wiles and treasury secretary Scott Bessent. These appeals, too, have fallen flat.Some financial heavyweights have now gone public with their frustrations. Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman took to social media, warning, ""The global economy is being taken down because of bad math,"" and urged the administration to reconsider before ""the President makes a big mistake.""Oil trader Andrew Hall applauded Ackman for speaking out and called on other ""financial titans"" to do the same. ""Where are the other 'financial titans'? Why aren't they speaking up?"" Hall posted.Dimon, in a message to investors, noted that the trade war was already denting consumer sentiment and investor confidence, and could slow economic growth. While he avoided forecasting a full-scale recession, he acknowledged the growing risk.Laurence D Fink, CEO of investment giant BlackRock, was more blunt during an address at the Economic Club of New York. ""The economy is weakening as we speak,"" he warned, citing even toy prices—like Barbie dolls—as examples of looming inflation due to tariffs.Fink said many CEOs believe the US may already be in a recession, highlighting the broad economic toll the tariffs could take if they remain in place.For a brief moment Monday, there was speculation that Trump might soften his stance, as reports surfaced suggesting a potential pause in tariffs. That sparked a short-lived market rally. But the White House quickly denied the rumors, and Trump reiterated his commitment, sending markets tumbling again.By the end of the day, the S&P 500 had dropped another 0.2 per cent, bringing it nearly 18 per cent below its mid-February high—dangerously close to bear market territory.In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said the administration remains in constant dialogue with business leaders and the public about major policy decisions. ""The only special interest guiding President Trump's decision-making, however,"" he continued, ""is the best interest of the American people -- such as addressing the national emergency posed by our country running chronic trade deficits.""Despite increasing calls for course correction, Trump appears determined to stand his ground—setting the stage for further clashes with Wall Street, allies abroad, and possibly, economic headwinds at home.","Us president donald trump has defended his aggressive tariff policy.

"Texas GOP civil war: Paxton enters Senate race, aiming to unseat longtime Texas rival",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-gop-civil-war-paxton-enters-senate-race-aiming-to-unseat-longtime-texas-rival/articleshow/120112088.cms,"Ken Paxton (AP Photo)

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton officially declared his candidacy for the US Senate on Tuesday night during an appearance on The Ingraham Angle on Fox News, launching what is expected to be one of the most heated and expensive Republican primaries in recent Texas history.“It’s time for a change in Texas,” Paxton told host Laura Ingraham, making clear his intention to unseat incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn . “It’s time that we have another great senator that will actually stand up and fight for Republican values, fight for the values of the people of Texas and also support Donald Trump in the areas that he's focused on in a very significant way.""Paxton’s announcement arrives shortly after federal prosecutors ended a long-running corruption probe into his activities, clearing a major cloud that had hung over his political future for years. The timing of his bid follows Cornyn’s formal launch of his re-election campaign two weeks ago, as the senior Texas senator seeks a fifth term in office.Tensions between the two Republicans have been simmering for years, with Paxton frequently branding Cornyn a “RINO,” or “Republican in name only,” and accusing him of being out of step with grassroots conservatives and insufficiently loyal to President Donald Trump.The intra-party fight has already turned bitter. Within hours of Paxton’s announcement, Cornyn’s campaign posted on X, formerly Twitter, slamming Paxton as a hypocrite. “Ken Paxton is a fraud,” the statement read. “He talks tough on crime and then lets crooked progressive Lina Hidalgo off the hook… uses fake Uber accounts to meet his girlfriend and deceive his family.”Cornyn allies also took aim at Paxton's legal controversies and alleged ethical lapses. Meanwhile, Paxton hit back by questioning Cornyn’s conservative credentials and slamming his past opposition to Trump during the 2016 election, as well as his role in crafting a bipartisan gun control bill in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde school shooting.Despite Cornyn’s longtime support for conservative policies — his campaign pointed out that he has voted with Trump more often than 95% of sitting senators — Paxton has positioned himself as the MAGA candidate, directly appealing to the populist base of the party.“This sets the table for the most expensive primary in Texas,” GOP strategist Dave Carney told Fox News. “It will be a brutal battle,” he added, noting that Paxton’s Senate bid will also create a wide-open contest for the now-vacant attorney general seat, with several candidates expected to jump in.Veteran Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak predicted a high-stakes, bare-knuckle fight between two deeply entrenched figures in Texas politics . “This is going to be the most expensive, nastiest, most aggressive, most personal US Senate primary in Texas history,” he said, adding that both sides “do not like each other, and the stakes could not be higher.”Paxton has not kept his Senate ambitions a secret. As early as September 2023, he criticized Cornyn in a Fox News interview, saying, “I can’t think of a single thing he’s accomplished for our state or even for the country,” and declaring, “somebody needs to step up and run against this guy.”He has also teased a potential campaign at GOP meetings and in January told Fox News Digital that he was “looking potentially at the US Senate.”Cornyn, 73, a fixture of Texas Republican politics since the early 2000s, has served as state attorney general, Texas Supreme Court justice, and US senator since 2002. Despite his credentials, many grassroots conservatives view him with suspicion — a dynamic Paxton is eager to capitalize on.As Paxton joins the fray, the stage is set for a no-holds-barred primary clash that could reshape the future of the Texas GOP — and determine which faction truly holds power within the party.","Texas attorney general ken paxton officially declared his candidacy for the us senate on tuesday night during an appearance on the ingraham angle on fox news.

China’s second-highest leader Li Qiang said on Tuesday that the country has the necessary tools to handle economic challenges, following widespread tariffs imposed by the United States, China’s main trading partner.""China's macroeconomic policy this year takes full account of various uncertainties and has a sufficient reserve of policy tools,"" Premier Li Qiang told European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen during a phone call, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. ""China can fully hedge against adverse external effects, and is fully confident of maintaining sustained and healthy economic development.""The comments were made during a phone call on Tuesday, in which both sides discussed ways to bring ""stability and predictability"" to the global economy after the disruption caused by US tariffs .""The resolute measures taken by China are not only to safeguard its own sovereignty, security and development interests, but also to defend international trade rules and international fairness and justice,"" Li told von der Leyen, according to a Chinese summary of the call.This was their first call since von der Leyen began her second term in office in December. It was also the first high-level contact between the two sides since US President Donald Trump introduced global tariffs, to which China reacted strongly. The European Union is still preparing a response.The EU raised trade concerns with China, but the wording of the summary indicated that the bloc was seeking to improve relations with Beijing, which have worsened in recent years, South China Morning Post reported..As both sides face pressure from US trade actions and deal with weak economic conditions, some observers believe it makes sense to try and improve ties, although European governments remain concerned about China’s economic policies.While China has responded to US tariffs, the EU is still working on its approach. EU members will vote on Wednesday on possible measures against US tariffs on steel and aluminium. A response to the ""reciprocal tariffs"" and car duties is expected next week.At the same time, Brussels is cautious about being caught in the middle of a conflict between major powers.

The Department of Commerce announced Tuesday it is pulling $4 million in federal funding from Princeton University, a move that strikes a blow to climate research projects associated with the prestigious institution.According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the funding cuts followed ""a detailed, careful, and thorough review of the Department’s financial assistance programs against the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) current program objectives."" The funding termination takes effect on June 30.The decision specifically impacts research efforts tied to NOAA, a sub-agency within the department, including Princeton’s Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES). The department argued these projects no longer align with NOAA’s mission or with President Donald Trump’s administration priorities.The Trump administration emphasized that the cuts are part of its broader effort to ""streamline and reduce the cost and size of the Federal Government,"" consistent with what it called the president’s promise. “The Department of Commerce is delivering on that promise,” the news release stated.In fiscal year 2024, Princeton University had received a total of $455 million in federal funding. The Commerce Department now says some of those funds supported climate modeling and predictions that are no longer in favor with the administration.The CIMES program, as described on its website, has contributed significantly to developing climate and oceanic models and advancing the education of postdocs and graduate students . However, the department criticized the initiative, stating that it ""promotes exaggerated and implausible climate threats, contributing to a phenomenon known as ‘climate anxiety,’ which has increased significantly among America’s youth.""Other agreements impacted include the Climate Risks and Interactive Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Predictability project and the Advancing Prediction agreement. The department claimed the first “suggests that the Earth will have a significant fluctuation in its water availability as a result of global warming,” while the latter focused on assessing climate-related risks such as sea-level rise and altered precipitation patterns. “It also aims to address coastal inundation while other more targeted research efforts are addressing this issue,” the statement added.The Department of Commerce emphasized that future reviews of financial awards will continue “on an individualized basis to avoid wasteful governmental spending — whether they be to Princeton or any other recipient.”This funding cut comes amid a wave of scrutiny directed at academic institutions.
