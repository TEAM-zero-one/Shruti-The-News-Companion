"Only 388 Indian illegals in US verified, all back: Govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-388-indian-illegals-in-us-verified-all-back-govt/articleshow/119028170.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign and all of them have returned to their home country, TOI has learnt. These include the plane-loads of illegals who landed in Amritsar and those who returned from third countries, mostly Panama, with help from the International Organisation for Migration.Verification of nationality is an ongoing process, and more are expected to be deported sooner than later, but not before their nationality is confirmed like in the past. For India, whether it's a million or a few thousand, there's no way of knowing conclusively how many Indians are living illegally in the US as they become Indian only after verification.While extremely large figures - ranging from 200,000 to 700,000 - have been bandied around about the number of Indian illegals in the US, the govt has maintained it has no data about the number of ""undocumented"" Indian immigrants residing in the US. ""The reason is that these immigrants have legally exited India but have either overstayed their US visa validity or have entered the US illegally or without valid documents,'' said junior external affairs minister Kirti Vardhan Singh, responding to a written question in RS earlier.Various Indian agencies closely scrutinise the list of persons identified for deportation by the US and only those who have been verified to be Indian nationals are accepted for deportation. Foreign minister S Jaishankar had said in his statement in Parliament that it is the obligation of all countries to accept their nationals living abroad illegally but it is subject to an ""unambiguous"" verification of their nationality. India has been accepting deportees from the US for the past couple of decades, with the maximum number (2,042) in 2019. Last year, it took back 1,368 illegal Indians.For the Indian govt, the real issue remains the need for a crackdown on what Jaishankar had described in his statement in Parliament last month as the illegal migration industry. He had said that law enforcement agencies will take action against agents facilitating illegal migration.","India has identified 388 illegal indian immigrants in the us since president donald trump launched his mass deportation campaign.

NEW DELHI: After Pakistan suggested India's involvement in the recent train hijacking in Balochistan, ministry of external affairs (MEA) released a statement on Friday rejecting 'baseless allegations' and asked their neighboour to look inwards for 'its own internal problems.'During a press briefing on Thursday, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan presented evidence of calls traced to Afghanistan regarding the hijacking. When questioned about Pakistan's stance shift from India to Afghanistan concerning terrorist attacks, he maintained their position, stating there was no policy change and reaffirmed their belief in India's involvement in terrorism against Pakistan.Since Tuesday's attack, Pakistan's military, government and media allies have implicitly suggested Indian involvement in the train assault, whilst overlooking significant security lapses by their military and intelligence services.MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal responded to media queries regarding remarks made by the Pakistan side, saying, ""We strongly reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan. The whole world knows where the epicenter of global terrorism lies. Pakistan should look inwards instead of pointing fingers and shifting the blame for its own internal problems and failures on to others.""Meanwhile, Afghanistan's foreign affairs ministry issued a statement rejecting Pakistan's claims, urging them to address their internal security concerns rather than making unfounded accusations.The Jaffar Express incident on March 11, involving over 450 passengers, resulted in 58 fatalities, including 21 passengers, four soldiers, and 33 militants from the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist organisation.Pakistan consistently accuses India of supporting groups like the BLA to create unrest in Balochistan, allegations that New Delhi firmly denies.The Balochistan insurgency, rooted in local issues of poverty and political marginalisation, has continued for decades.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Donald Trump and Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for their efforts to end the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflictIn his first public reaction on Ukraine's willingness to negotiate a ceasefire, Putin said that he agrees with the proposal of ceasefire but ""proceeds from the assumption that this cessation should lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of the crisis.""""We all have enough of our own domestic affairs to attend to. But many leaders of states, among them the President of the People's Republic of China, the Prime Minister of India, the Presidents of Brazil and the Republic of South Africa are addressing this issue and give it a lot of their time,"" Putin said during a joint press conference with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.""We are grateful to all of them for that because this activity is aimed at achieving a noble mission - the mission of ending hostilities and loss of life,"" he added.Putin said that Russia agrees to the ceasefire proposal by the United States but argued that some issues still need to be addressed.""We agree with the proposal for a ceasefire (with Ukraine) to cease hostilities, but we proceed from the fact that this ceasefire should lead to an enduring peace, and should remove the root causes of this crisis,"" Putin said during a news conference with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.This came a day after Trump said that ""it’s up to Russia now"" as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire, following peace talks between US and Ukrainian officials that resulted in Kyiv agreeing to a 30-day US-backed ceasefire covering the entire frontline.Putin questioned what a ceasefire would mean in light of the recent Ukrainian ""incursion"" in Kursk. ""Would that mean that everybody there would leave? Should we release them after they have committed numerous crimes against civilians there, or will the Ukrainian leadership command them to surrender? What will happen? That’s not clear,"" he said.Earlier, Putin had named India among the three countries he is constantly in touch over the Ukraine conflict and said they are sincerely making efforts to resolve it.In July last year, PM Modi travelled to Russia to participate in the 22nd India-Russia Bilateral Summit. He also travelled to Ukraine in August last year.During the bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, PM Modi emphasised India's position of peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.PM Modi also welcomed Trump's efforts to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict and reiterated India's position that the conflict should be resolved on the negotiating table.""I have always been in close contact with Russia and Ukraine. I have met the leaders of both countries. Many people are in a misconception that India is neutral, but I want to reiterate that India is not neutral; we are on a side, and that is peace,"" PM Modi said in a joint presser at the White House.He further reiterated India's position that a solution to the conflict can't be found on the battlefield and appreciated President Donald Trump's efforts in this direction.""I have said that 'this is not a time of war' in front of the media when President Putin was with me. Even today, my conviction is that the solutions to war cannot be found on the battlefield, and ultimately, we have to be at the table,"" PM Modi said.He added, ""India believes that the solution to the war can be found only when the issue is discussed in a forum where both countries (Russia and Ukraine) will be present. The efforts made by President Trump - I support, and welcome it. I hope he succeeds as soon as possible.""","Russian president vladimir putin thanked prime minister narendra modi, us president donald trump and brazil president luiz inacio lula da silva for their efforts to end the ongoing russia-ukraine conflict.

The Union law ministry has asked a district court in Ahmedabad to deliver a summons issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to billionaire Gautam Adani over alleged securities fraud and a $265 million bribery scheme, according to a letter dated Feb 25, seen by Reuters.The summons, issued under Hague Service Convention that does not allow the serving of legal documents directly to defendants in India, would require Adani or his legal counsel to appear in the case in the US, said Indian lawyers.Adani and the law ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Adani Group has, in the past, termed the allegations ‘baseless’ and vowed to seek all possible legal recourse’. The summons does not imply an extradition risk for the businessman, according to a lawyer. “Extradition proceedings only come in to the picture if the US court issues warrants of arrest,” said Malak Bhatt, founding partner at NM Law Chambers.However, Arshdeep Khurana, a criminal lawyer in India, said, “The summons seems to be for appearance in a court in New York.

NEW DELHI: Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Friday called his discussion with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer a “forward-looking” step toward a mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement , setting the stage for a major economic shift between the two nations.Goyal, who was in the US last week, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a photo from the meeting, emphasizing that India's approach would be rooted in 'India First,' 'Viksit Bharat,' and the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two nations.The meeting follows US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s commitment to negotiating the first phase of a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by fall 2025. Both leaders have designated senior representatives to accelerate these talks, underscoring their intent to strengthen economic ties.Also read: Come out of protectionist mindset: Goyal to exporters During their recent discussions, Modi and Trump set an ambitious goal—doubling total US-India bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, dubbed ‘Mission 500.’ The two leaders framed the initiative as a pathway to boosting prosperity, strengthening national economies, and making supply chains more resilient.President Trump, now in his second term, has maintained his tough stance on trade fairness, emphasizing tariff reciprocity—a policy where US tariffs will mirror those imposed by trade partners, including India. Washington has long argued that India maintains some of the highest tariffs globally, a concern that could become a sticking point in negotiations.US Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick recently acknowledged the complexities of the trade relationship, advocating for a broad-based trade agreement rather than product-specific negotiations. Speaking virtually at the India Today Conclave, Lutnick called for “understanding and cooperation” to craft a deal that benefits both sides.As trade negotiations progress, both nations must navigate sensitive issues, including tariffs, market access, and national security concerns.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average pm2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) it was more than 25 times higher than who-recommended level and over three times more than indian ambient air quality standards.

Pakistan blames India again for Baloch terror attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blames-india-again-for-baloch-terror-attacks/articleshow/119026425.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan military and Balochistan provincial leadership on Friday accused India of orchestrating terrorism in the restive southwestern province, a day after the PM Shehbaz Sharif-led govt levelled similar allegations against New Delhi.

He accused India of arming and funding the Baloch Liberation Army , a separatist group banned in Pakistan and blamed for the Jaffar Express attack.

Wayne Gretzky was sued for $10M over alleged false claims about a Weight Loss Gum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzky-was-sued-for-10m-over-alleged-false-claims-about-a-weight-loss-gum/articleshow/118879580.cms,"Image via TNT

Wayne Gretzky’s role and the impact of celebrity endorsements

What is the current status of the lawsuit

Wayne Gretzky, widely regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time, found himself at the center of a legal controversy in 2022 when he was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product. The lawsuit, filed by entrepreneur Steven Sparks in Los Angeles, alleged that Gretzky falsely promoted OMG Gum as a weight loss aid, claiming it helped him lose 35 pounds. Sparks, an investor in the product, argued that this statement artificially inflated the value of the company, leading to significant financial damages when the claim was revealed to be untrue.According to the lawsuit, Steven Sparks originally invested in OMG Gum because of its purported benefits and Wayne Gretzky's endorsement. The gum was marketed as a weight loss supplement, with Wayne Gretzky allegedly stating that he personally used it to shed excess weight. Sparks contended that this claim helped boost the product’s credibility and value, ultimately leading him to increase his financial involvement.However, Sparks later learned that Wayne Gretzky’s weight loss statement was false. As a result, he claimed that the company’s value plummeted, and he suffered substantial monetary losses. In response, Sparks filed a $10 million lawsuit against Gretzky, accusing him of fraud and deceptive business practices.While Gretzky was not the creator of OMG Gum, he was closely linked to its promotion. His status as a sports icon and public figure likely contributed to the product’s perceived legitimacy, demonstrating the significant influence that celebrity endorsements can have on consumer and investor decisions.This case highlighted concerns about the responsibilities of celebrities when endorsing products, especially those related to health and wellness. Investors and consumers often rely on such endorsements, assuming that public figures genuinely support and use the products they promote.As of now, there have been no major updates on the outcome of Sparks’ lawsuit against Wayne Gretzky. It is unclear whether the case was settled privately, dismissed, or remains ongoing. If proven, the allegations could serve as a cautionary tale for both investors and celebrities regarding the risks of false advertising and misleading promotions.Also Read: “A scumbag”: Brad Marchand a tongue-in-cheek answer when asked about coming back together with Sam Bennett Gretzky has not publicly commented in detail on the accusations, but the case remains an example of how endorsements, especially from high-profile figures, can have serious legal and financial consequences.","Wayne gretzky was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product.

Grimes' fresh concern is over an old fake post

Grimes once again expressed her disapproval of her son X having a public life, courtesy to his father Elon Musk who takes the four-year-old along with him almost everywhere he goes. Last, X was seen outside the White House as Elon Musk was showing Tesla cars to President Donald Trump before he purchased one. X was in front of the camera as Elon Musk stood beside the president when Trump took questions from reporters.This is not the first time that Elon Musk's ex and X's mother made it clear how she feels about her son getting so much exposure all of a sudden. When X was all over the Oval Office when his father joined Donald Trump in a press conference, Grimes said he should not be public like this. But despite what she feels about it, X is now a public figure and mostly remains perched on his father's shoulders -- as he's becoming camera-friendly showing his antics to his audience.Grimes' fresh concern, however, stemmed from an old fake post. The fake post made it look as if Grimes was spilling some secrets about Elon Musk's sex life --- without naming him. ""Sexuality and kinks are simply different for everyone. many Fortune 500 CEOs enjoy being pegged,"" the fake post of Grimes said.As Grimes commented on the fake post again clarifying that she never actually made any such post, a social media user asked her how to protect the children from such internet filth.""I unfortunately do not control the internet and cannot wipe this from the internet,"" Grimes said.""I have tried begging the public and my kids dad to keep them offline, and I've tried legal recourse. I follow you here I've seen young ppl destroyed by the internet too. The state of my children's lives being public is of grave concern to me and I think about how to solve this every day.

US Canada: New rule for Canadians staying in the US for over 30 days amid Donald Trump's tariff war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-rule-for-canadians-staying-in-the-us-for-over-30-days-amid-donald-trumps-tariff-war/articleshow/118984223.cms,"Canadians staying in the US will now have to register themselves with the authorities.

Will Canadians require a visa for the US?



Tariff war triggers new rule for Canadians?



Amid Donald Trump's ongoing tariff war with Canada, the US government has come up with a new rule for Canadians who are in the United States for 30 days or longer and those who have crossed the land border. Starting on April 11, Canadians who plan to stay in the US for longer than 30 days will be required to apply for registration and be fingerprinted. So far, Canadians have been exempt from both rules which apply to other foreign nationals.Traditionally, Canadians who cross the northern border by land and stay for over 30 days do not need to register with the federal government. However, the new rule would require them to fill out a different form to enter the US, which is not a visa. Canadians never needed any form or visa to enter the US for casual travelling, tourism, shopping etc.Those violating the rule may face fines of up to $5,000, six months in jail or both, according to the Federal Register, which was updated with the new guidance Wednesday.The new policy for Canadians is tied to President Donald Trump's executive order 'Protecting the American People Against Invasion' that he signed on the first day in the White House. The order is aimed at curbing ""the unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States"".According to Statistics Canada, 4.1 million Canadian residents arrived from trips abroad in December 2024. Of those, 2.1 million arrived from the United States by car, and 68.3% of those trips were taken within the same day.Reports said the new requirement is rooted in existing immigration law which states that foreign nationals of 14 or older and not already registered with American authorities have to register and fingerprinted if they plan to be in the US for 30 days or longer, but these rules were never applied to Canadians entering the US via land borders.It's now that the administration is moving to implement these rules for Canadians as Trump is engaged in a bitter trade war with Canada. The tariff war is now paused as both sides decided to sit across the table to address the situation.","Canadians staying in the us will now have to register themselves with the authorities.

Donald Trump files emergency Supreme Court appeal after judges block birthright citizenship ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-files-emergency-supreme-court-appeal-after-judges-block-birthright-citizenship-ban/articleshow/118999901.cms,"ANI

The Trump administration in an emergency appeal on Thursday asked the US Supreme Court to allow its plan to end birthright citizenship , arguing that lower courts overstepped by blocking the policy.Federal judges have already ruled that the executive order is unconstitutional, citing America’s long history of granting citizenship by birth . Trump is now pushing for an emergency ruling to enforce his order in limited cases.In January, a federal judge declared Trump’s executive order ""blatantly unconstitutional,"" preventing it from taking effect. Another judge in Maryland ruled that the order contradicts over 250 years of American law. Courts in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Washington have all blocked the policy following lawsuits from over 20 states, immigrant rights groups, and individual plaintiffs.The Justice Department argued that nationwide injunctions have become excessive, preventing the government from enforcing a key immigration policy. It also accused past administrations of wrongly interpreting the Constitution, saying that birthright citizenship was never meant to apply to children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. The administration believes this has encouraged illegal immigration.Signed on January 20—his first day back in office—Trump’s executive order aims to end automatic citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa holders. The policy applies to births from February 19 onward and does not affect those already granted citizenship.According to ANI, Trump’s appeal does not ask the Supreme Court to decide whether the policy itself is constitutional. Instead, his lawyers are making a “modest” request to limit the scope of the lower court injunctions.The Supreme Court will likely schedule a briefing to hear arguments from those who oppose Trump’s order.",Federal judges have already ruled that the executive order is unconstitutional.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has hinted at India being behind the train hijacking in Balochistan this week, saying the handlers of the attackers were based in Afghanistan and were allegedly sponsored by India.On Thursday, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said Islamabad had evidence that calls related to the hijacking originated in Afghanistan. Asked by reporters whether Islamabad had shifted its stance from India to Afghanistan over involvement in terrorist attacks on Pakistan, he said, “There is no shift in our policy. And again, the facts have not changed. India is involved in sponsoring terrorism against Pakistan. What I was referring to was, in this particular incident, we have evidence of calls being traced to Afghanistan. This is what I said.”Since the start of the attack on Tuesday Pakistan’s military, govt and media supporters have been blaming India without directly naming it in connection with the train assault, while keeping mum about grave security failures on the parts of the country’s military and intelligence authorities.While India has yet to respond to Pakistan’s latest allegations, Afghanistan’s foreign affairs ministry issue a statement, saying: “We categorically reject baseless allegations by the Pakistani army spokesman linking the attack on a passenger train in Balochistan province with Afghanistan, & urge Pakistani side to focus on resolving their own security & internal problems instead of such irresponsible remarks.”The Jaffar Express, carrying over 450 passengers, was seized by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist militant group, on March 11, leading to a deadly confrontation that left 58 dead, including 21 passengers, four soldiers, and all 33 militants.Pakistan has repeatedly accused India of fuelling unrest in Balochistan by backing groups like the BLA, a charge New Delhi dismisses as baseless. The latest claim comes as the BLA ramps up its campaign against the state, with the train hijacking marking a bold escalation in tactics.Analysts see it as part of a broader wave of militancy straining Pakistan’s security apparatus. Some observers said the Balochistan insurgency , fuelled by local grievances over poverty and political exclusion, has persisted for decades, casting doubt on the need for external provocation. “The BLA doesn’t require foreign sponsors to act but blaming India fits a familiar narrative here,” said Islamabad-based journalist Nazrul Islam.Relations between Pakistan and India, already frigid since the 2019 Pulwama attack, remain on edge, with little prospect of dialogue. For now, the Jaffar Express incident stands as a grim reminder of the region’s volatility, and the enduring rift between Islamabad and New Delhi.",Pakistan has hinted at india being behind the train hijacking in balochistan.

"Facebook's ex-COO Sheryl Sandberg 'lied' about boarding flight that crash-landed, claims former employee Wynn-Williams' book",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebooks-ex-coo-sheryl-sandberg-lied-about-boarding-flight-that-crash-landed-claims-former-employee-wynn-williams-book/articleshow/118919496.cms,"What Sheryl Sandberg said about taking the San Franciso flight that crash-landed

What Wynn-Williams wrote on Sandberg’s post

Sheryl Sandberg , former COO of Meta, allegedly fabricated a story about narrowly escaping disaster by claiming she had planned to board Asiana Airlines Flight 214 , which crash-landed in San Francisco over a decade ago, killing three and injuring nearly 200 people. This accusation, according to a report in New York Post, comes from Sarah Wynn-Williams , a former subordinate who served as director of public policy under Sandberg for six years at Facebook (as the company was then called). Wynn-Williams makes the claim in her new memoir, Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, asserting that Sandberg, once Mark Zuckerberg ’s second-in-command, lied about almost being on the ill-fated flight.“Do people really lie about dodging plane crashes?” Wynn-Williams muses in her book. “Why would she? It’s not like Sheryl craves the spotlight.” She adds, “After that, I could never look at Sheryl the same way.”The flight in question departed from Incheon International Airport near Seoul, South Korea, on July 6, 2013, carrying 307 passengers and crew. During its approach to San Francisco International Airport, the Boeing 777-200ER descended too low and too slow, resulting in a catastrophic crash landing. Emergency crews responded swiftly, and most passengers evacuated before flames engulfed the aircraft. Tragically, three people perished—one killed by a rescue vehicle in the chaos — and 187 were injured, many with spinal or head trauma.Shortly after the incident, Sandberg posted on Facebook, claiming she, her family, and several Facebook colleagues had originally intended to take Flight 214. “We switched to United so we could use miles for my family’s tickets,” she wrote. “Our flight was due to arrive at the same time, but we landed about 20 minutes earlier.” In subsequent posts, she reassured followers of her safety and noted that Samsung executive David Eun, a friend who was on the flight, had survived. “Serious moment to give thanks,” she concluded. The post rapidly gained attention, amassing over 3,000 likes in its first hour.Wynn-Williams, however, disputes Sandberg’s account. In her memoir, she recalls seeing news reports suggesting Sandberg and other team members, including then-director of global communications Debbie Frost, were slated to be on the flight—information she says the staff only learned from Sandberg’s post. Skeptical, Wynn-Williams contacted Frost, who allegedly called Sandberg’s claim “totally weird,” pointing out that Sandberg “always flies United” and that Asiana was never an option. “I don’t know why she posted it or tagged us all,” Frost reportedly told her.Frost, when approached by The Post, directed inquiries to her Threads account, where she wrote, “Everyone’s got their own take, but a lot of these stories are blown out of proportion or just didn’t happen.” Wynn-Williams’ book also includes other provocative allegations, adding fuel to the controversy surrounding Sandberg’s tenure.","Sarah wynn-williams served as director of public policy under sheryl sandberg for six years at facebook.
