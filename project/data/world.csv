Deep-sea quake in Bay of Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deep-sea-quake-in-bay-of-bengal/articleshow/118568278.cms,"KOLKATA: The city woke up to tremors that measured 5.1 on the Richter scale on Tuesday morning. Even though the earthquake did not cause any destruction or injury, it led to momentary panic.The National Centre for Seismology confirmed the earthquake at 6.10 am and traced its epicentre to the Bay of Bengal, off the Puri coast, at a depth of 91 km and 340 km south of Kolkata.Social activist Soumali Chakraborty was shaken out of slumber by the quake. ""It was early in the morning, and I was still asleep when I felt my bed shaking. I was so scared as I had no clue as to what was happening. Later, I realised that it must be an earthquake. Luckily, it lasted only a few seconds,"" said the New Town resident.Neera Bhatiya of Sodepur was in the kitchen preparing the morning tea when she felt the tremor. She was taken aback, wondering what was happening. Soon she realised that an earthquake had just shaken parts of Kolkata and the surrounding areas. ""I was making my morning tea when I felt the tremor. It was quite subtle and lasted only a few seconds,"" said Bhatiya, who runs Eurokids International.Despite the moderate magnitude of the quake, there was no report of damage to property or injury. Seismologists said this was due to the depth of the epicentre, which reduced the intensity of the tremor on the surface. Shallow earthquakes originating five to 10 km below the surface are the ones that cause more damage.""The shaking of my bed woke me up. I was perplexed. I realised the situation when my phone showed an earthquake notification alert,"" said Howrah resident Subhankar Das. ""I wake up early every day, and Tuesday was no different. I was leaning on my bed, listening to music, when I suddenly felt the tremor. Later, I found out that it was an earthquake,"" added Tanisha Chetrii, a student from Dum Dum.Experts said that Kolkata lies in Seismic Zone III, indicating a moderate risk of earthquakes, although the city is not as prone to severe seismic activity as regions like the Northeast.Tuesday's earthquake follows a similar one on Jan 8, when mild tremors were felt across Kolkata and its neighbouring districts following a powerful earthquake in Tibet and parts of Nepal.""While preparing for a recording, I noticed my mic setup and table shaking slightly. At first, I thought it was because I tend to shake my legs, but then I realised that it wasn't the reason. After posting on Facebook, I found out it was actually an earthquake,"" said voice-over artist Malay Ghosh, a resident of Jadavpur.","Kolkata woke up to tremors that measured 5.1 on the richter scale on tuesday morning.

Congress's Kerala conundrum: Shashi Tharoor rubs it in with 'selfie message',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congresss-kerala-conundrum-shashi-tharoor-rubs-it-in-with-selfie-message/articleshow/118563023.cms,"Shashi Tharoor posts selfie with Piyush Goyal and Jonathan Reynolds

NEW DELHI: Is Shashi Tharoor on his way out of the Congress or is he just flexing his muscles for a greater role in Kerala Congress keeping in mind the assembly elections in the state next year? Well, any answers to this at present would only be a guess. But what we know for sure is that the Thiruvananthapuram MP will not give in without a fight - either way.Tharoor, who is already in the middle of a political storm triggered by his ""perceived praise"" for rivals, seems undeterred by the criticism within the party. Ever since the controversy erupted, Tharoor has not just defended his remarks but has also reinforced his viewpoint.Also read: Congress's mouthpiece attacks MP Shashi Tharoor for his remarks on PM Modi On Tuesday, the senior Congress leader posted a selfie with Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal and the UK's secretary of state for business and trade Jonathan Reynolds and welcomed the revival of long-stalled India-UK FTA negotiations.""Good to exchange words with Jonathan Reynolds, Britain's Secretary of State for Business and Trade, in the company of his Indian counterpart, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal,"" he said of their meeting at an event on Monday. ""The long-stalled FTA (Free Trade Agreement) negotiations have been revived, which is most welcome,"" Tharoor said on X.While on the face of it there is nothing wrong in Tharoor posting a selfie with a BJP Union minister or for that matter praising the revival of India-UK talks, more so as he chairs the parliamentary standing committee on external affairs. But the fact that this comes from someone who is already under party fire for praising the positives of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US trip and highlighting the progress of start-up sector in Kerala ruled by the LDF government, shows that the Congress leader is in no mood to buckle.Also read: Row over praise for rivals: Should Congress be wary of Shashi Tharoor? The Congress MP, who had earlier defended his remarks and said that when something good emerges, it is petty not to acknowledge it, has used his posts on X to convey a message to his critics within the party.On February 24, Tharoor had tagged a news report titled ""Left, BJP and Congress share stage during Kerala's investors' meet"" and posted ""Good to see this. Economic development should, as far as possible, be above the petty divisions of party politics.""On February 22, Tharoor had a cryptic message for his baiters when he posted a Thomas Gray quote as thought for the day on his timeline - ""Where ignorance is bliss, 'Tis folly to be wise."" The message here was loud and clear.On February 16, Tharoor had posted a long note countering the critics who were targeting him for praising the Left Front government in Kerala. Stating that he was bemused by the raging controversy in Kerala over his article, Tharoor said the article did not mention party politics, but spoke of things Kerala needs to do to get out of the economic doldrums — changes that he has been demanding in the state during all his 16 years in politics.Tharoor is known to fight his battles against all odds. His contest for the post of Congress president against Mallikarjun Kharge is a case in point. The BJP claims the Gandhis have sidelined him within the Congress for taking on ""their nominee"" in the 2022 party elections. Tharoor, on his part, has been vocal about the changes that the party needs to revive from its political slump and cites his four consecutive Lok Sabha wins to prove his point.The Congress, on the other hand, will need to do a tightrope walk as it tries to find a solution to this conundrum. The party, which has already lost several leaders in the last 10 years, would not want to lose another one and give the BJP a handle to attack its leadership. But it can also not give in completely to Tharoor's demands and antagonize the state leadership. With assembly elections due in Kerala next year, the Congress will need to handle the Tharoor challenge deftly.","Shashi tharoor is in the middle of a political storm triggered by his ""perceived praise"" for rivals.

NEW DELHI: Sino-Indian ties are set for a reboot, following the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan last year and the subsequent visits to Beijing by NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri that resulted in a series of ""common understandings on the boundary question and practical cooperation"", said Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong on Tuesday.The remarks followed the recent meeting of external affairs minister S Jaishankar with his counterpart Wang Yi in which the former had lauded cooperation between the two countries on multilateral forums, particularly the G20. Doval had visited China in Dec for talks between the Special Representatives that took place after a gap of five years. This was followed by Misri's visit to China during which India and China agreed to resume Kailash Mansarovar Yatra , trans-border river cooperation and, in principle, direct air services.""Since the meeting between President Xi Jinping and PM Modi in Kazan last year, the two sides have earnestly implemented the important consensus reached by the two leaders, engaged in active interactions at various levels, and reached many common understandings on improving bilateral relations,"" said Xu, interacting with journalists on the margins the 3rd China-India Youth Dialogue. Calling India-China relationship one of the most important in the world, the ambassador said that the two countries are promoting positive changes in the international balance of power.For the first time in five years, Modi and Xi had met in Russia in Oct 2024 on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, days after the two countries reached an agreement to complete the military disengagement process in eastern Ladakh. India, however, wants to tread cautiously in normalising ties with China and, in his meeting with Wang last week, Jaishankar stressed the importance of restoring mutual trust in bilateral ties and jointly maintaining border peace.Calling for respecting each other's core interests, Xu said that Xi and Modi had agreed to handle relations from a long-term perspective, prevent ""specific disagreements"" from affecting the overall relationship, enhance strategic mutual trust and ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas.China will host the SCO summit later this year and expects Modi to participate. Appreciating India's contribution to the Eurasian bloc, Xu said China is willing to work with India to host a ""friendly, united and fruitful"" summit. China holds the rotating presidency of SCO this year.According to the ambassador, the recent high-level engagements had created an important opportunity for the ""reboot of China-India relations and provided a broader platform for exchanges and cooperation between the youth of our two countries"".","Sino-indian ties are set for a reboot, following the modi-xi meeting in kazan last year.

Preity Zinta-New India Cooperative Bank row

Preity Zinta claims the loan was fully paid over 10 years ago

'I have spent years working hard and...'

NEW DELHI: After Bollywood actor Preity Zinta slammed Kerala Congress for spreading fake news that the actor got a Rs 18 crore loan written off and for that depositors are on the streets for their money, the party asked the actor to clear the air with proof. ""We are glad to accept mistakes if we have made any,"" the Congress Kerala handle said.The party's X handle shared a news report on Preity Zinta that claimed that New India Cooperative Bank wrote off Rs 18 crore loan to the actor. ""She gave her social media accounts to BJP and got 18 cr written off and the bank collapsed last week. Depositors are on the streets for their money,"" the party wrote.A few days ago, the RBI restricted New India Co-op Bank from issuing new loans, making investments, or accepting fresh deposits without prior approval, effective February 13.Preity Zinta expressed shock and claimed that no loan was written off for her. She paid it fully over 10 years ago. ""Hope this clarifies and helps so there are no misunderstandings in the future,"" Zinta said.Without relenting, Congress Kerala said it was good to know that Preity Zinta's social media account was not handled by anyone else. They said they shared the news as it was reported. ""We are standing with the depositors who lost their savings. If the reports are wrong, we request you to clear the air with proof once for all and raise your voice in their interest too,"" Congress Kerala said.Preity Zinta thanked social media that she got a chance to clarify her stand regarding the 'fake news'. ""All through my career I have seen so many so respected journalists get so many stories completely wrong & never have the decency to correct the story or apologise. I have also gone to court and spent a tonne of money fighting cases that go on & on & on. I think it’s time we start holding them responsible right here so there is some accountability in the future.

Shashi Tharoor staking claim in Kerala Congress as 'new pole',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-tharoor-staking-claim-in-kerala-congress-as-new-pole/articleshow/118566379.cms,"NEW DELHI: When the Left bloc stunned Congress by bucking Kerala's ""revolving door"" politics to return to office in the state in 2021, Congress overhauled the state unit with factionally unaffiliated faces, and announced it was designed to end the notoriously entrenched factionalism in the party. Four years later, senior MP Shashi Tharoor staking claim to leadership ahead of assembly elections in 2026 has scrambled the thinly-veiled factional peace, with him as a new pole in the state Congress.Tharoor has adopted an unconventional style. Just like his praise for the growth of start-ups under the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala, on Tuesday, he posted a photo with Union minister Piyush Goyal and the UK trade minister to laud the revival of FTA talks -- triggering a buzz on social media.While Congress criticised Tharoor's praise of the Left govt, the MP's remarks questioning the party's strength in Kerala have thrown out in the open concerns which are privately shared by a large section of Congress. Party leaders are unsure if Congress can oust the LDF this time too. The concerns are based on the threat of fragmentation in the Congress support base, because of BJP's strong pursuit of the Christian community, as well as the fear of loss of some Hindu votes, which has made its dependence on key Muslim ally IUML stronger.The Left too is making a similar push for a slice of Congress votes. Congress seems to be banking on the anti-incumbency against the Left. Tharoor has put out in the open a widespread worry in the party. In the process, he has portrayed himself as the solution because of what he terms as his ability to reach out to non-Congress voters, and thereby, expand the party tent.Having won four successive terms from a difficult Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha seat , Tharoor is a popular leader, but is also a loner in the state unit, viewed by peers as an interloper. He has thrown his hat in the leadership ring of Kerala but Congress sources say it would not be possible for the party to accommodate his claim ahead of other local leaders. Many believe Tharoor may have taken a maximalist position and could be vying for a greater role in Kerala affairs but not necessarily to be declared the outright face. Given the precarious situation that Congress is in, it would be difficult for the party to not accommodate Tharoor in a meaningful way.His fresh remarks have triggered speculation about his future while party leaders have said Tharoor will not leave Congress. But even his disengaging himself from active party affairs ahead of assembly elections would not help the Congress cause. It is to be seen if Congress can find a way to accommodate the restive leader, a tricky task in which the party has failed in many states in the recent years.","Senior mp shashi tharoor staking claim to leadership ahead of assembly elections in 2026.

Supreme Court reverses expulsion of RJD MLC for mocking Nitish Kumar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-reverses-expulsion-of-rjd-mlc-for-mocking-nitish-kumar/articleshow/118568194.cms,"No place for aggression and indecency in Parl proceedings, says SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday reversed Bihar Legislative Council's July 26, 2024 decision to expel RJD leader Sunil Kumar Singh from the House for mocking and mimicking chief minister Nitish Kumar, and said the punishment was ""excessive and disproportionate"" to the nature of his misconduct.While a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotishwar Singh came down heavily on Singh for his conduct on the floor of the House and before the ethics committee, it said it would be just and proper punishment to convert the more than 18-month period of expulsion as the period of suspension from the House for the RJD leader.Also, while asking the House to take him back, the bench said he would not be entitled to any remuneration or other monetary benefits for the period of his suspension.SC had earlier stayed the by-election for the seat that had fallen vacant after Singh's expulsion.In a verdict which sought to strike a balance between the principle that punishment should not be disproportionate to the offence and the need for decorum and proper conduct in legislatures, the bench said,""There is no place for aggression and indecency in the proceedings of Parliament or legislature.Members are expected to show complete respect and deference towards each other.""The bench said, ""This expectation is not merely a matter of tradition or formality, it is essential for the effective functioning of democratic processes. It ensures that debates and discussions are productive, focused on the issues at hand, and conducted in a manner that upholds the dignity of the institution.""It emphasised that the right to speak inside the House could not be harnessed as a tool by members to insult, humiliate or defame fellow members, ministers and most importantly, the chair itself.Simultaneously, Justices Kant and Singh said the power of the House to punish a member for misconduct or misdemeanour could not be harsh or disproportionate. ""Courts must act decisively to strike down excessively harsh actions that threaten our democratic fabric while simultaneously exercising restraint to avoid encroaching upon the legislative domain. We reiterate that courts must reflect a certain degree of deference to the legislative will and wisdom, intervening only when the action prescribed is so disproportionate that it shocks the intrinsic sense of justice,"" Justice Kant said.Writing the 50-page judgment analysing the sensitive issue of legislative supremacy with regard to proceedings in the House and limited scope of judicial intervention, Justice Kant said, ""It is imperative that such legislative action remains mindful of the fundamental principle that the purpose of imposing punishment is not to serve as a tool for retribution but rather to uphold and enforce discipline within the House.""The primary objective of the punishment should be to maintain decorum and foster an environment of constructive debate and deliberation, the SC said.","Bihar legislative council's july 26, 2024 decision to expel rjd leader sunil kumar singh reversed.

Europe-backed resolution seeks withdrawal of Russian troops

Amid high drama at the UN over the 2 resolutions that were brought in the UN General Assembly on the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war – one by the US and other by Ukraine and Europe – India abstained from voting on both. Both resolutions were adopted with 93 votes in favour, as EU members seemed to prevail over the Americans in mustering support from the 193-member body for comprehensive peace and for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.The voting for the US effort, which sought a swift end to the conflict, was more dramatic as the US itself abstained from voting on a resolution it had sponsored.This was because the European countries managed to successfully introduce amendments in the text. India, which maintains that it is not neutral but on the side of peace, was expected to vote in favour but the amendments meant that Indian too had to abstain.India was also among the 65 countries that abstained from voting on the Europe-backed resolution that called for just and lasting peace, and also immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. This was in line with its earlier abstentions in the Assembly on resolutions condemning Russia.India officially continues to maintain that it wants both parties involved to restart the dialogue and diplomacy process to resolve the conflict. The Trump administration has been engaging directly with Russia to end the war, keeping both EU and Ukraine out.While the defeat in the General Assembly is a setback for the US, it will look to make up for it in the Security Council, hoping that France and UK will not veto it. Both countries have not used their veto power for decades. The voting was expected to take place later in the day. With effectively just one paragraph, the US resolution seeks lasting, and not just and lasting, peace and calls for a swift end to the conflict between the 2 countries. If approved, it will be the first real resolution to be adopted by the Council on the issue since the beginning of the war. The only 1 adopted so far was days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine for a special emergency session in the Assembly on Ukraine.EU member states had sought 3 amendments in the US draft resolution, including replacing “Russia-Ukraine conflict” with “the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation”.It also called for reaffirming the UN’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, including its territorial waters. The third was a mention of “just, lasting and comprehensive” peace and not just lasting peace. Russia’s amendment for addressing the “root causes” of the conflict was rejected.","India abstained from voting on 2 resolutions brought in the un general assembly.

'Get the house in order': Sanjay Jha's open letter to Rahul Gandhi amid Shashi Tharoor's growing rift with leadership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/get-the-house-in-order-sanjay-jhas-open-letter-to-rahul-gandhi-amid-shashi-tharoors-growing-rift-with-leadership/articleshow/118536030.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha on Monday wrote an open post for Rahul Gandhi on X, asking him to ""get the house in order"" amid reports of Shashi Tharoor's rift with the party.""Dear Rahul Gandhi, I am writing to you publicly here because no one within the Congress is probably going to tell you this. So as usual, let me bell the cat,"" he wrote.""Leadership ( corporate or political or any other) is about having difficult conversations. It is about trouble-shooting. It is not about living in denial; problems have to be addressed, they cannot be wished away.""You and I both know that Shashi (Tharoor) is an outstanding parliamentarian. He is probably among the only few in the country to whom the cliché, “He needs no introduction” truly applies. It is therefore disappointing that once again a great asset of the party is being forced to talk to the media to get his message through to you or the Congress leadership. Almost five years to the date, I was compelled to write an article in a national newspaper when facing a similar predicament. No problem is intractable; the key question is do we have the will to solve them in everyone’s interest? And that too quickly,"" he said in the post.""The Congress must be focused on taking on the BJP, but a prerequisite for that is to first get the house in order. This cannot become an ongoing unresolved challenge for years as it paralyses the energy and drive of the Congress workers and supporters. A challenger party has to be swift, desperate, risk-taking, hungry and on a constant prowl. It cannot be business as usual, for sure. We need to the hit the nail on the head going forward, but right now, we seem to be hitting our head on the nail,"" Jha wrote.Four-time Congress MP Tharoor appears to be growing increasingly disillusioned with the party, following what he perceives as a continued sidelining by the high command.His recent public criticism of a leadership vacuum in Kerala Congress and a meeting with Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi to discuss his role in the party have fuelled speculation about his future within the organisation.","Former congress spokesperson sanjay jha wrote an open post for rahul gandhi on x.

NEW DELHI: Bollywood actress Preity Zinta slammed the Congress party’s Kerala unit for spreading "" fake news "" about her Rs 18 crore loan waiver by New India Cooperative Bank and claims that she handed over her social media accounts to the BJP Responding to the allegations raised by Kerala Congress, Zinta expressed shock that a political party was ""promoting fake news,"" clarifying that she had repaid the loan in full over a decade ago.The controversy erupted after Congress Kerala, in a post, claimed that Preity Zinta ""gave her social media accounts to BJP and got Rs 18 crore written off.""Slamming the claim, Zinta took to X (formerly Twitter) and wrote, ""No, I operate my social media accounts myself, and shame on you for promoting FAKE NEWS! No one wrote off anything or any loan for me. I'm shocked that a political party or their representative is promoting fake news & indulging in vile gossip & click baits using my name & images.""""For the record, a loan was taken and fully paid back over 10 years ago. Hope this clarifies and helps so there are no misunderstandings in the future,"" she added.Following Zinta's clarification, Kerala Congress acknowledged her response but doubled down on its claims, stating that the news had been shared based on media reports.""Good to know you're managing your own account, unlike other celebs who have handed theirs over to the notorious IT cell. Thanks for the clarification, @realpreityzinta regarding your loan position. We are glad to accept mistakes if we have made any,"" Kerala Congress said in a reply.Referring to a report from IndianCooperative.com, Kerala Congress alleged that ex-employees of the now-embattled New India Cooperative Bank had warned the RBI in 2020 about ""corrupt practices"" at the bank, in which Zinta's name was mentioned along with other borrowers.The party urged Zinta to provide proof to clear the air and ""raise her voice in the interest of depositors who lost their savings.""The RBI has placed severe restrictions on the Mumbai-based New India Cooperative Bank due to financial instability concerns.Effective from February 13, the bank has been barred from granting loans, accepting deposits, or allowing withdrawals, leading to panic among customers. The restrictions will remain in place for six months, subject to further review by the central bank.","Bollywood actress preity zinta strongly refuted accusations by the kerala congress unit of having loans written off by bjp in exchange for her social media accounts.

Vivek Ramaswamy on track to become third US governor of Indian-origin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamy-on-track-to-become-third-us-governor-of-indian-origin/articleshow/118547051.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington

: Entrepreneur-turned-Trump acolyte Vivek Ramaswamy will be on track to become the third governor of Indian-origin in US after jumping into the gubernatorial race in Ohio on Monday, promising, among other largesse to voters, abolishment of income tax and property tax in the state.Two other Indian-Americans, Piyush ""Bobby"" Jindal in Louisiana (2008-2016) and Nimrata ""Nikki"" Haley in South Carolina (2011-2017), have preceded him as US governors of Indian-origin, illustrating the rapid strides the community has made in politics, including having half dozen lawmakers in Congress. Before Jindal's breakthrough, George Ariyoshi (1974–1986), a Japanese American, was the first Asian-American governor in Hawaii, a state with a pronounced Asian orientation. Gary Locke (Washington, 1997–2005) became the first and so far only Chinese-American governor in the US.Cincinnati-born Ramaswamy, 39, whose parents emigrated from Palakkad in Kerala, was immediately endorsed by President Trump. ""Vivek Ramaswamy is running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio. I know him well, competed against him, and he is something SPECIAL. He’s Young, Strong, and Smart! Vivek is also a very good person, who truly loves our Country. He will be a GREAT Governor of Ohio, will never let you down, and has my COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT!"" the MAGA supremo posted about a former rival-turned-fanboy who has described Trump as the greatest US President of the century.Polls show Ramaswamy viewed favorably by voters in Ohio, a former bellwether state that is now reliably red, having voted for Trump by more than 8 points in the last three elections. He will be up against Ohio's Republican Attorney General Dave Yost, and Heather Hill, a Black entrepreneur from Appalachia, in the GOP primaries, while Dr. Amy Acton, the former state health director, is running as a Democrat.Ramaswamy also found support from Elon Musk, who posted a starchy ""Good luck, you have my full endorsement!"" message on X.Trump appointed the tech duo to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but Ramaswamy, evidently a #2, peeled off after two weeks on the job, following a revolt by MAGA hyper-nationalists who took exception to his screed on American culture and the mediocrity it engendered while expounding virtues typically associated with successful Asian communities, such as an emphasis on education.""The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over “native” Americans isn’t because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy & wrong explanation). A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture....Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long (at least since the 90s and likely longer)...a culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,"" Ramaswamy had written, igniting fury in the MAGA base which saw him as bashing the American way of life.Ironically, Ramaswamy made the argument in support of Musk, who had lamented the lack of engineering talent in the US in defense of H1-B visas, but who has since backed down on the issue having thrown his DOGE partner under the bus. Some political observers though saw Ramaswamy's bailing out of DOGE as a political astute move to line up another run for the White House which they see as easier from a governor's mansion or from the Senate, rather than be hamstrung by DOGE and any potential mishaps there.In his first campaign speeches, Ramaswamy, a multi-millionaire like most people in Trump's inner circle, Ramaswamy spoke of the ""need to bring down the income tax eventually down to ZERO because you (voters) deserve to keep what you earn,"" adding, ""It is your money, not the government's.""He also proposed bringing down property taxes in the state immediately, and eventually down to ZERO, arguing, ""If you own land, it should not feel like it's a lease from the government.""Ramaswamy has degrees from Harvard (biology undergrad) and Yale (law), and before he founded the bio-pharma Roivant Sciences, he worked as an investment partner at a hedge fund, and later co-founded an investment firm, Strive Asset Management. His mother Geeta Ramaswamy is a graduate of Mysore Medical College and worked as a geriatric psychiatrist for Merck and Schering-Plough, while his father Ganapathy Ramaswamy, a graduate of the National Institute of Technology Calicut, worked as an engineer for General Electric.","Entrepreneur-turned-trump acolyte vivek ramaswamy will be on track to become the third governor of indian-origin in us after jumping into the gubernatorial race in ohio.

‘Tyranny of the judiciary’: Elon Musk blasts federal judge for blocking Trump’s refugee order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tyranny-of-the-judiciary-elon-musk-blasts-federal-judge-for-blocking-trumps-refugee-order/articleshow/118569781.cms,"Elon Musk

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has criticised the US judiciary following a federal judge’s decision to block President Donald Trump’s executive order pausing refugee admissions . Musk, in a post on X, questioned the judiciary’s power over presidential authority, calling it a threat to democracy.“If any judge anywhere can block every presidential order everywhere, we do not have democracy, we have tyranny of the judiciary,” Musk wrote.Musk’s remarks come after US District Judge Jamal Whitehead, a Biden-appointed judge based in Seattle, issued an injunction against Trump’s directive, which sought to indefinitely halt refugee admissions. The judge ruled that the order effectively nullified existing federal law and overstepped the president’s authority.“To be sure, the president has substantial discretion … to suspend refugee admissions, but that authority is not limitless,” Whitehead said in his ruling from the bench. “I cannot ignore Congress’ detailed framework for refugee admissions and the limits it placed on the president’s ability to suspend the same. … Our system of separated powers demands no less.”Musk’s criticism reflects growing frustration among some conservatives and Trump allies over judicial interventions in executive actions. The court’s decision is one of several recent rulings blocking key elements of Trump’s policies since his return to office. Judges have also halted his administration’s freeze on federal grants and foreign aid, as well as efforts to give Elon Musk’s allies in the Department of Government Efficiency access to vast government databases containing sensitive financial and personal data.Whitehead’s ruling, issued after a hearing on a lawsuit brought by refugees and resettlement groups, temporarily halts the Department of Homeland Security from enforcing Trump’s order. Opponents of the directive argued that it left many would-be refugees stranded overseas after they had sold their belongings in preparation for their scheduled resettlement.“The defendant agencies’ implementation of the order likely violates bedrock principles of administrative law by vastly expanding the scope of the order with no reasoned explanation [and] no advance notice,” Whitehead stated.The Justice Department has indicated that it may appeal the ruling. Government attorney August Flentje urged Whitehead to pause his injunction while the administration considers its next steps, but the judge said he would rule on that request after issuing a formal written order.Musk’s post reignited debate over the judiciary’s role in reviewing executive actions. While critics argue that judicial intervention is necessary to check presidential overreach, Musk and others see it as an impediment to governance.The US Constitution grants courts the authority to block executive orders that violate the law or the Constitution, a fundamental aspect of the separation of powers. However, Musk’s comments align with Trump’s longstanding grievances against judicial interference, particularly when it comes to immigration policy .As Trump’s administration pushes forward with its agenda, legal battles over executive authority are likely to continue, with Musk emerging as one of the most vocal critics of judicial intervention in governance.","Elon musk has criticised the us judiciary following a federal judge's decision to block president donald trump’s executive order pausing refugee admissions.
