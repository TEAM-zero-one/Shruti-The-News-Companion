NEW DELHI: Flights between the West and India, mainly Delhi and Mumbai, will get even longer following the Iranian airspace closure on Friday after Israel attacked the country's nuclear sites. Sixteen Air India (AI) flights were impacted Friday, with the majority diverting and the others returning to origin.AI had resumed overflying Iran shortly after Pakistan had closed its airspace to Indian carriers on April 24 to partially mitigate the longer route its flights had to take since then. While AI will have to take longer routes to and from the West, IndiGo between Delhi and Tbilisi and Delhi and Baku will become one-stop flights now. With both Pakistan and Iran no-go areas, Indian carriers will have to take really longer routes to reach Central Asia. ""We are studying the situation and some AI flights may become one-stop after closure of Iran airspace,"" said sources.Also, if and when Iran retaliates, the airspace of countries near Israel, like Jordan and Lebanon, also be impacted. This has in the past forced airlines to take longer detours in that area whenever conflict escalates.""Due to the emerging situation in Iran, subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of safety of our passengers, (some) Air India flights are either being diverted or returning to their origin.

He briefed me on the evolving situation. I shared India's concerns and emphasized the need for early restoration of peace and stability in the region.”The conversation comes amid growing international alarm after Israel launched a wide-ranging assault on Iranian military and nuclear facilities, reportedly killing senior officials and scientists.Netanyahu’s office confirmed that he has spoken with several global leaders, including those of India, Germany, and France, and is expected to speak with US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and UK PM Keir Starmer.

Gabriella Zuniga’s explicit content offer raises public and legal questions

Legal teams release conflicting evidence in heated court battle

Career fallout and postponed projects for Shannon Sharpe







The legal battle between former NFL star Shannon Sharpe and OnlyFans creator Gabriella Zuniga has taken an even more sensational turn. Zuniga, also known online as ""Karli,"" is now offering a s*x tape to subscribers who tip over $2,000—despite being in the midst of a $50 million lawsuit against Sharpe, which includes serious allegations of sexual assault, emotional abuse, and coercion.At just 21 years old, OnlyFans star Gabriella Zuniga’s decision to promote adult content while pursuing a high-profile legal case has ignited a firestorm of debate online. Critics argue her move could damage her credibility and shift public perception of the lawsuit. Supporters counter that she’s continuing her career as an adult content creator, independent of the case at hand.Notably, Gabriella Zuniga has not confirmed whether the tape involves Sharpe, a point that adds ambiguity and intrigue to an already explosive case. Given the legal implications, it seems unlikely she would directly tie the content to the former athlete, though the timing of her announcement has undeniably complicated the narrative.Represented by high-profile attorney Tony Buzbee—known for taking on Deshaun Watson and Sean “Diddy” Combs—Zuniga alleges a disturbing pattern of manipulation by Sharpe. This includes claims of non-consensual recordings and threats of violence.Buzbee released audio recordings in which Sharpe allegedly states he would ""choke"" her, painting a picture of abuse behind the scenes.Sharpe, 56, has firmly denied all allegations through his lawyer, Lanny Davis, calling the lawsuit “an extortion attempt.” In response, Davis released explicit messages that appear to show a consensual relationship between the two. One message reportedly even features Zuniga expressing a desire to have Sharpe’s child.According to court documents, the two met at a Los Angeles gym in 2023, when Zuniga was just 19. She claims their relationship evolved from flirtation to deep emotional and psychological distress.The scandal has already had serious career repercussions for Sharpe. Once on the brink of signing a $100 million media deal, the NFL Hall of Famer has since stepped away from First Take and postponed his Nightcap podcast tour with co-host Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson.“We’ve decided to postpone the Nightcap tour,” Sharpe stated. “We look forward to seeing you guys in the summer of 2026.

Air India plane crash: Did electrical failure of 'more-electric' B787 cause both engines of AI 171 to fail?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-plane-crash-did-electrical-failure-of-more-electric-b787-cause-both-engines-of-ai-171-to-fail/articleshow/121869320.cms,"Kalpeshbhai Patni faints while waiting for the body of his younger brother to be brought home. Akash, 14, was sleeping under a tree near the family-run tea stall when AI 171 debris fell on him

APUs take over 90 seconds to reach up to engine RPM & support flight

MUMBAI: Competing theories about what caused AI 171 to crash have generated a new set of possible explanations. Among them is the question that since Boeing's 787 replaced conventional pneumatic and hydraulic systems with electrical systems - to make the aircraft lighter to save fuel and maintenance costs - whether there was an electrical system failure.There's no consensus. But as pilots continue to look for answers, electrical system failure has emerged as one of the latest attempts, by some, to explain the tragedy.All theories start from the premise that the lone survivor heard a boom, which may indicate a single engine failure. That wouldn't have caused a modern aircraft to crash? So what else went wrong? Did the second engine fail or was it something else?Dual engine failures are rare events: seven instances have been recorded in the past seven decades, the world over. The causes were bird strikes (US Airways Hudson river landing in 2009), wrong engine shutdown (1989 British Midland flight 92, technical issues led to the mistaken shutdown of the good engine) and fuel contamination or starvation. The possibility of bird strike has been largely ruled out in case of the AI 171 crash on June 12.But B787 is a ""more-electric"" aircraft. So, pilots and experts are looking at this accident differently.A senior B787 commander said: ""The boom sound indicates it's highly likely one of the two engines had a partial or complete shutdown."" But what happened after that?Did the pilots shut off the good engine, like in an earlier crash? But many pilots said that the process of shutting off fuel to the malfunctioning engine begins only at 400 feet and it takes some time to execute - the aircraft had crashed before that could be completed.Did the ""startle effect"" - pilots' involuntary reaction to a sudden, unexpected event - make the pilots forget they had to retract the landing gear? Or, were the flaps (devices on a wing's trailing edge that, when lowered, generate lift at lower speeds) retracted instead of the landing gear? But as the B787 commander said: ""Even if that had happened, with one engine intact, the aircraft could have climbed out safely to come back and land"".It's the both-engines-down scenario that's making some pilots think of electrical failure. ""Preliminary assessments indicate that at some point during the take-off one or more VFSGs (Variable Frequency Starter Generators: these start engines and provide main electrical power during flight) may have failed or become electrically isolated, resulting in partial or total loss of engine control,"" said a senior Airbus commander, who has flown Boeing wide-body aircraft.Another senior pilot said: “VFSC failure could lead to failure of EEC, the aircraft’s ‘throttle computers’ as these run on electrical power. If both engines and APU (auxiliary power unit, back-up of sorts, but doesn’t provide as much power as the engines) fail or disconnect from the power system, EECs may stop controlling thrust, even if engines are still running. In such cases, the engines can get stuck at idle, leaving pilots with no way to increase thrust. ”But the simultaneous failure of engines and APU is rare. Pilots pointed out that APUs take over 90 seconds to reach up to the engine RPM and support flight. Since the entire event began and ended in 32 seconds, there was not enough time or altitude for APU to come into the picture, they say.Based on DGCA safety directives issued a day after the accident, some senior pilots said early findings suggest a potential electrical systems malfunction, which compromised engine responsiveness. Another theory that supports the dual engine failure theory rests on the deployment of RAT or Ram Air Turbine. RAT is a small wind turbine that juts out from the underbelly of the aircraft. It supplies power to run the critical control surfaces of the aircraft, which helps pilots land the plane.Some pilots point out a small, hazy, black patch seen under the aircraft, and theorise that RAT was deployed. Unlike APU, RAT cannot provide power to safely land an aircraft. Could it be a more prosaic reason? Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert, hinted at possible cargo overloading. “That would explain why the plane took a longer length of runway to take off. It also explains why, after one engine failure, it failed to maintain altitude and crashed”.A senior B777 pilot pointed to another possibility, that the pilots mistakenly entered the zero fuel weight, not accounting for 50-60 tons of fuel that the aircraft had at take-off. “This would have led to lower thrust settings, and that compounded with an engine failure would have led to thrust loss”. But this argument was countered by a B787 commander who said the aircraft systems, based on the weight acting on its wheels, would have alerted the pilots.",Boeing's 787 replaced conventional pneumatic and hydraulic systems with electrical systems. There's no consensus on whether there was an electrical system failure.

'I think it's been excellent': Donald Trump







A tense escalation unfolded across the Middle East overnight, as Iran launched back to back, and overnight missile strikes toward Israel late Friday and early Saturday. The move came in response to what Iran described as Israel’s earlier attacks on its territory.The confrontation began with Israel’s ""greatest military operations in history,"" against Iran.In a sweeping and highly coordinated attack on Thursday night, Israeli warplanes and drones, some of them reportedly smuggled into Iranian territory in advance, struck deep inside the Islamic Republic.Key targets included parts of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, ballistic missile production sites, and command centers. The strike also killed top Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists.Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at central Tel Aviv, following a warning from its military that ""everyone will feel it.""Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had cautioned that Israel ""should expect severe punishment"" in response to its sweeping attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities and top military officials.""In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime's most significant enrichment facility, and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,"" declared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a defiant video address. ""The regime does not know what hit them, or what will hit them. It has never been weaker.""Netanyahu also addressed the people of Iran directly: ""To the proud people of Iran, we are in the midst of one of the greatest military operations in history, Operation Rising Lion. The Islamic regime, which has oppressed you for almost 50 years, threatens to destroy our country, the State of Israel. More is on the way.""That promise of escalation was swiftly realised — by both sides.Late Friday night, Iran responded with a salvo of ballistic missiles and drones targeting Israeli territory. Explosions thundered over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as sirens blared and the Israeli military urged residents to take cover.Buildings shook under the pressure of near-simultaneous detonations, with several of them likely the result of Israel’s air defence systems intercepting incoming threats.In a pointed statement, Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the retaliatory attacks.""Using a combination of precision-guided and smart systems,"" the IRGC said, ""Iran targeted military centers and airbases that served as the source of the criminal aggression against our country.""The IRGC added that its missiles struck Israeli military-industrial centers that produce missiles and other war equipment, stating that ""field reports, satellite imagery, and intercepted intelligence indicate that dozens of ballistic missiles effectively hit strategic targets.""""Despite claims of interception, the enemy failed to counter the waves of missile strikes launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" the statement continued.But Israel maintained it had successfully intercepted a significant portion of the threat.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) released footage of a Navy missile ship intercepting five Iranian drones over Israeli waters early Saturday. ""Attached is documentation of the interception of two drones launched earlier today from Iran,"" the IDF posted on social media platform X.The IDF also published a map highlighting areas across Israel currently under threat from Iranian attacks, warning, ""Israeli civilians are currently being targeted by the Iranian regime. The world cannot stay silent.""Inside a fortified command center, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant conducted ongoing situation assessments. According to an Israeli official who spoke with CNN, the leadership is ""fully engaged in real-time military coordination and strategic planning.""The attacks did not cease after Netanyahu's fiery speech. Minutes after his video was posted, more Iranian missiles were launched, with renewed explosions reported in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.

""Of course we support Israel in its actions,"" Trump told CNN. ""Iran better agree to a nuclear deal before there is nothing left.""“I think it’s been excellent,” Trump told ABC News about the Israeli strikes. “We gave Iran a chance, and they didn’t take it. They got hit—hard. As hard as you can get hit. And there’s more coming. A lot more.”Trump wrote on his Truth Social: ""Two months ago I gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to “make a deal.” They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn’t get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!

Trump's post





US President Donald Trump has ordered federal immigration officials to prioritise deportations in Democratic-led cities following widespread protests in Los Angeles and other major urban centers against his administration's immigration policies.In a post on Truth Social, Trump urged ICE agents ""to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.""He emphasized that to accomplish this, officials ""must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.""This announcement follows weeks of intensified enforcement and remarks from Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and chief architect of Trump’s immigration strategy, who stated that ICE officers would aim for at least 3,000 arrests per day—an increase from approximately 650 daily arrests during the first five months of Trump’s second term.Simultaneously, the administration has instructed immigration agents to pause arrests at farms, restaurants, and hotels after Trump expressed concern about the negative effects of aggressive enforcement on these industries, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter who requested anonymity.In his post, Trump said: ""Our Nation’s ICE Officers have shown incredible strength, determination, and courage as they facilitate a very important mission, the largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History.Every day, the Brave Men and Women of ICE are subjected to violence, harassment, and even threats from Radical Democrat Politicians, but nothing will stop us from executing our mission, and fulfilling our Mandate to the American People. ICE Officers are herewith ordered, by notice of this TRUTH, to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.""""In order to achieve this, we must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside. These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens. These Radical Left Democrats are sick of mind, hate our Country, and actually want to destroy our Inner Cities — And they are doing a good job of it! There is something wrong with them. That is why they believe in Open Borders, Transgender for Everybody, and Men playing in Women’s Sports — And that is why I want ICE, Border Patrol, and our Great and Patriotic Law Enforcement Officers, to FOCUS on our crime ridden and deadly Inner Cities, and those places where Sanctuary Cities play such a big role. You don’t hear about Sanctuary Cities in our Heartland!""""I want our Brave ICE Officers to know that REAL Americans are cheering you on every day. The American People want our Cities, Schools, and Communities to be SAFE and FREE from Illegal Alien Crime, Conflict, and Chaos. That’s why I have directed my entire Administration to put every resource possible behind this effort, and reverse the tide of Mass Destruction Migration that has turned once Idyllic Towns into scenes of Third World Dystopia. Our Federal Government will continue to be focused on the REMIGRATION of Aliens to the places from where they came, and preventing the admission of ANYONE who undermines the domestic tranquility of the United States.""""To ICE, FBI, DEA, ATF, the Patriots at Pentagon and the State Department, you have my unwavering support.

Dubey targets Priyanka, recalls Congress’s past on Israel, Palestine

Trump’s military spectacle draws crowds and criticism

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday demanded an apology from the Congress for falsely claiming that Pakistan’s army chief, General Asim Munir, was invited to a US military parade hosted by President Donald Trump. The White House had categorically denied the claim, calling it “false.”Speaking to ANI, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey accused the Congress of ""falling into Pakistan’s trap"" and spreading misinformation. ""For the last 2-3 days, the entire Congress party kept saying that Pakistan's Army Chief General Asim Munir is going to the US. This was a trap by Pakistan,"" he said. “Today, it is known that the White House or the US military never called Asim Munir.”A White House official confirmed this, stating, “This is false. No foreign military leaders were invited.”Dubey used the controversy to attack the Congress party's broader foreign policy history, particularly over its handling of Israel and Palestine.He criticised Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s remarks on India abstaining from a UN vote on Gaza, calling it “shameful,” and responded with a lengthy post on X. “This is what happens when you haven't studied history,” he said, pointing to India’s covert ties with Israel going back to Nehru’s era, even as it officially supported Palestine at the UN.“In 1948, Nehruji supported Palestine... but in 1950, Nehruji secretly opened his trade office Mission in Mumbai... In 1971, Indira Gandhi used Israeli weapons... In 1992, the first Israeli embassy was opened in Delhi,” he told ANI.He further alleged that after the 26/11 attacks, the Congress government under Manmohan Singh “supported terrorism and Pakistan under global pressure.” Praising Prime Minister Modi’s foreign policy, Dubey said India’s global standing has improved significantly, especially with Arab nations like Saudi Arabia.The row emerged as President Donald Trump hosted the largest US military parade in decades on Saturday to mark the 250th anniversary of the US Army—coinciding with his 79th birthday.Thousands of troops marched past the White House, with tanks rolling down Constitution Avenue and fighter jets flying overhead. The White House claimed that over 250,000 people attended the event, though no evidence was provided.Trump, who once admired France’s Bastille Day parade, declared, “Time and again, America’s enemies have learned that if you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you.”While Trump’s supporters celebrated, protests erupted in major cities under the banner “No Kings,” with critics accusing the former president of authoritarianism. Tear gas was fired in Los Angeles, and a shooting at a protest in Salt Lake City left one person critically injured.","Bjp mp nishikant dubey accuses congress of ""falling into pakistan's trap"" dubey uses controversy to attack congress party's broader foreign policy history.

Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, experienced a record-breaking $26 billion surge in his net worth on June 12, 2025, after Oracle’s stock skyrocketed following strong earnings. The monumental gain propelled the 80-year-old billionaire to the second spot on Forbes’ real-time billionaires list, surpassing Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, with a total fortune now standing at $243 billion just behind Elon Musk’s $407 billion. Fueled by investor optimism and Oracle’s impressive financial performance, Ellison's wealth has now outgrown the GDP of several nations. His rise reflects not only Oracle's momentum in AI but also Ellison’s enduring influence in global tech.Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison witnessed a staggering $on Thursday, June 12, driven by a sharp rally in Oracle's stock price. The massive single-day gain catapulted the 80-year-old tech mogul to the second position on Forbes’ real-time billionaires list,. According to the reports,, placing him just behind Elon Musk, who leads the list with a net worth of $407 billion.The leap in Ellison’s wealth was fueled by Oracle’s impressive earnings report, which exceeded Wall Street expectations and sparked a wave of investor confidence. With the stock hitting record highs, Ellison reaffirmed his dominance in the tech industry, not just as a business leader but as one of the wealthiest individuals in modern history, surpassing even the GDP of several small countries.The jump in Ellison's wealth followed Oracle's after-earnings rally that pushed its stock to an all-time closing price of $200. During the Wednesday afternoon announcement, Oracle logged better-than-expected quarter-ending financial results. The company had $1.70 of adjusted earnings per share and $15.9 billion of revenue, beating Wall Street estimates. Although it dipped 13% briefly after the report's release, investor confidence returned strongly, powering the upward path.According to the ET reports, Ellison's net worth today is not only staggering in comparison to single billionaires but it surpasses the total GDP of a number of nations, the IMF suggests in its 2025 estimates.

From 2018 to 2022, he was a member of the board of directors at Tesla, aligning himself with the largest Silicon Valley names.His own business enterprises are equally impressive.

He also was instrumental in bringing a star quarterback to the University of Michigan football team his wife, Kere Zhu, being an alumnus of the university.Ellison's influence also goes beyond tech investment and high-end real estate. In January, he stood at the side of the US President Donald Trump when he unveiled Stargate, a strategic AI effort supported by Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI. The venture aims to grow the US's competitive advantage in artificial intelligence by developing scalable next-generation infrastructure.","Oracle co-founder larry ellison witnessed a staggering $ on thursday, june 12, driven by a sharp rally in oracle's stock price.

While the composer’s post rubbished the marriage talk, he chose not to address rumours about dating Kavya, which intensified after alleged sightings of the two at a dinner outing.The origin of the rumours can be traced back to a Reddit thread that claimed the two had been in a relationship for over a year and that superstar Rajinikanth had spoken to Kavya’s father, media baron Kalanithi Maran , about a possible alliance.

Why it matters

Trump’s peacemaker promise under fire: From the outset of his second term on January 20, 2025, Trump cast himself as a global deal-maker-securing a Gaza ceasefire, brokering talks in Oman and vowing to end the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Netanyahu’s unilateral strike not only undermines those diplomatic efforts but also exposes the limits of Trump’s influence over a key ally.

From the outset of his second term on January 20, 2025, Trump cast himself as a global deal-maker-securing a Gaza ceasefire, brokering talks in Oman and vowing to end the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Netanyahu’s unilateral strike not only undermines those diplomatic efforts but also exposes the limits of Trump’s influence over a key ally. Shortly after the strikes, Trump said on social media platform Truth Social: I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to “just do it,” but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn’t get it done. I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it. Certain Iranian hardliner’s spoke bravely, but they didn’t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse! There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end. Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All! (SIC)

US-Israel relations strained: Though Israel relies on Washington for weapons and intelligence, this mission proceeded without US coordination. Secretary of state Marco Rubio stressed “we are not involved in strikes against Iran” and urged Tehran “not to target US interests” (AFP). The disconnect has prompted questions about whether America will be drawn into defending Israel if Iran retaliates.

Though Israel relies on Washington for weapons and intelligence, this mission proceeded without US coordination. Secretary of state Marco Rubio stressed “we are not involved in strikes against Iran” and urged Tehran “not to target US interests” (AFP). The disconnect has prompted questions about whether America will be drawn into defending Israel if Iran retaliates. Regional stability at risk: The attack risks igniting fresh conflicts across the Middle East. Iran has already vowed “decisive” retaliation against its “sworn enemies,” heightening the possibility of strikes on US bases, Red Sea shipping by Houthi proxies and renewed hostilities in Gaza and Syria.

Zoom in

Natanz’s resilience: Buried deep under mountains, the Natanz enrichment halls have withstood previous Israeli sabotage and covert operations. While jets can inflict damage, restoring capacity-swapping centrifuges, repairing cascades-can take weeks, not years. Last year’s strikes set Iran back by an estimated 12–18 months; this round may only marginally extend that delay without sustained pressure.

Mossad’s covert campaign: According to senior Israeli officials, a parallel sabotage effort led by Mossad targeted Iran’s air defenses and missile depots over the past year. These clandestine actions-planting explosives, cyber intrusions-underscore that the air campaign is but the visible tip of a multifaceted strategy to “roll back the Iranian threat.”

Gulf state jitters: Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha are bracing for fallout. US-brokered normalization deals hang in the balance as Gulf monarchies weigh security guarantees against the risk of becoming battlegrounds in a US-Israel-Iran showdown.

The big picture

A fractured peacemaking track record:

Emerging US-Israel strategic divergence:

Netanyahu’s calculus: Facing what he deems an existential threat from a “cleric-run government” backing Hamas, Netanyahu judged that delaying invites a nuclear-capable Iran. He has already ordered similar strikes on air defenses last year and quietly overseen sabotage operations inside Iran attributed to Mossad-indicating a long-built contingency rather than a spur-of-the-moment choice

What they’re saying

Benjamin Netanyahu: “This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat,” he said, confirming strikes on Iran’s “main enrichment facility at Natanz” and its ballistic-missile program.

Marco Rubio: “Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” he said, warning Tehran “should not target US interests or personnel.”

Justin Logan, Cato Institute: The strike will “destroy US diplomatic efforts” and “Israel has the right to choose its own foreign policy…At the same time, it has the responsibility to bear the costs of that policy.”

Tom Cotton, US Senator: The United States must “back Israel to the hilt, all the way,” including “topple\[ing] Iran’s Islamic Republic if it targets US troops” .

Jack Reed, US Senator (D-RI): “Israel’s alarming decision to launch airstrikes on Iran is a reckless escalation that risks igniting regional violence,” he warned on the Senate Armed Services Committee floor.

MAGA’s moment of truth

What’s next

US policy decision: Trump has convened the National Security Council to chart a response. Options range from strictly defensive support-air refueling and intelligence sharing-to direct involvement if Iran strikes US forces.

Iranian counter-strikes: Tehran’s Revolutionary Guards promise “decisive retaliation.” Potential targets include US bases in the Gulf, shipping lanes in the Red Sea via Houthi drones and missiles, and proxy actions in Syria and Lebanon.

Diplomatic deadlock: The scheduled June 15 talks in Oman are imperiled. Iran may withdraw to reassess, while US willingness to negotiate under fire will be tested. GCC monarchies, once champions of Trump’s outreach, now face heightened insecurity.

Energy markets: Oil prices spiked over 5% on Friday, reflecting fears of prolonged disruption across Middle East export routes and potential Houthi attacks on commercial vessels .





On Thursday night, Israeli jets unleashed a coordinated “preemptive” air campaign against Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure-bombing enrichment facilities at Natanz, key Revolutionary Guards installations in Tehran and ballistic-missile sites around the country-just hours after President Donald Trump publicly implored Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off. Netanyahu named the operation “Rising Lion,” warning it would “continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat”.Trump’s diplomacy hinged on high-profile announcements and personal outreach-his Sunday summit with Qatar’s emir promising “no nuclear dust” over the region, the planned June 15 meeting in Muscat between US envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian officials, and last month’s removal of Syria sanctions. Yet each initiative has stumbled: Gaza talks collapsed; Russian President Vladimir Putin rebuffed a Ukraine ceasefire; and now Netanyahu has effectively sidelined the Oman talks.“We’ve clearly seen a fork in the road in the American and Israeli approaches to this problem set,” observes Dana Stroul, former Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.The US favored patience while negotiations ran their course; Israel opted for immediate military action to “delay and degrade” Iran’s program. Whether the two will coordinate follow-on steps to maximize the setback remains uncertain.Inside the MAGA movement, fury erupted. As per a Politico report, many in Trump’s base saw in the Israeli strike both a personal affront and a political trap. Breitbart’s Matt Boyle warned that Trump now faces a defining moment: “He has to balance protecting America’s greatest ally in the region in Israel with avoiding getting the USA drawn into war” .Breaking Points host Saagar Enjeti was even more blunt: “Israel has now made a mockery of the United States … a blatant attempt to force us into war. We must resist,” he declared, insisting Trump’s longtime criticism of “stupid leaders who pursue disastrous foreign wars” should guide his response .Charlie Kirk, live-streaming the chaos to his Turning Point USA followers, lamented that the strike “is now going to have major American domestic implications,” warning of a coming schism in the movement. Mollie Hemingway of The Federalist warned that any US backing of the strike “would be seen as an unforgivable betrayal by millions of American voters,” putting Trump in an “impossible position.”Even more hawkish voices in his party-Senator Tom Cotton among them-quickly rallied behind Israel, calling to “back Israel to the hilt, all the way,” with some urging that the United States pressure Tehran’s regime to its knees if it dared strike back at US forces .(With inputs from agencies)","Trump cast himself as a global deal-maker-securing a gaza ceasefire, brokering talks in oman and vowing to end the wars in gaza, ukraine and curb iran’s nuclear ambitions. The unilateral strike not only undermines those diplomatic efforts but also exposes the limits of trump's influence over a key ally.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121826606,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-225358,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Mid-air escape: Air India London-Delhi flight entered Iran airspace as Israel struck with missiles; rerouted over Iraq,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mid-air-escape-air-india-london-delhi-flight-entered-iran-airspace-as-israel-struck-with-missiles-rerouted-over-iraq/articleshow/121831814.cms,"NEW DELHI: An Air India flight from London to New Delhi had just entered Iranian airspace when Israel launched a wave of missile strikes on Iran’s military and nuclear sites.The flight was rerouted over Iraq before arriving in India one hour late, according to an AFP report.The close call was one of several disruptions on Friday as Air India diverted or turned back at least 16 international flights mid-air due to the sudden escalation and subsequent closure of Iranian airspace. Among those affected were services between India and cities like London, Toronto, and New York.Aircraft tracking site Flight Aware showed that two other Air India flights — from Delhi to Vienna and Mumbai to London — were nearing Iranian airspace and turned back to their origin airports shortly after the strikes began.In a statement, Air India said: “Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace and in view of the safety of our passengers, the following Air India flights are either being diverted or returning to their origin. We regret the inconvenience caused to our passengers due to this unforeseen disruption and are making every effort to minimise it.”The airline is offering full refunds or complimentary rescheduling to affected passengers and is arranging accommodation where necessary.The Indian Embassy in Iran also issued an advisory urging Indian nationals and people of Indian origin to stay alert and avoid non-essential travel, as tensions surged following Israel’s precision strikes targeting Iranian defence infrastructure.Iran, Israel, Iraq, Jordan, and Syria temporarily shut down their airspace, leading to widespread cancellations and rerouting of global flights to and from the Middle East. Global airlines suspended flights to Tel Aviv and Tehran as air traffic over the region thinned out overnight.Israel said the strikes were a direct response to the growing threat from Iran’s missile and nuclear capabilities. Iran retaliated by launching a wave of drones toward Israeli territory.","The flight was rerouted over iraq before arriving in india one hour late.

Israel's Operation Rising Lion



Iran retaliates



Trump walks a fine line







A major flashpoint in the Middle East erupted into open military confrontation overnight, with Israel launching its most expansive airstrikes on Iran in decades, targeting the country’s military command and nuclear infrastructure.In a dramatic twist, US President Donald Trump claimed credit for setting the stage, citing a 60-day ultimatum he says he gave Iran, even as his own officials denied direct American involvement in the operation.Despite earlier statements by senior Trump administration figures, including secretary of state Marco Rubio , distancing the US from the Israeli attack, Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to suggest the strikes followed a countdown he had initiated.""Two months ago I gave Iran a 60-day ultimatum to 'make a deal,'"" Trump wrote. ""Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn’t get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!""In another lengthy post, Trump described warning Iran in ""the strongest of words"" and claimed Iranian commanders ""didn’t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!""He added, ""There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter...come to an end. Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.""Early Friday, Israeli fighter jets and drones struck key Iranian military and nuclear facilities in what Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu dubbed ""Operation Rising Lion.""The strikes killed six top nuclear scientists and several senior military commanders. Israeli officials declared the operation a necessary pre-emptive strike to dismantle Iran’s weapons capabilities.""This operation will continue for as many days as it takes,"" Netanyahu said in a video message, warning of further action against the Iranian regime.Within hours, Iran responded with a heavy barrage of ballistic missiles aimed at Israeli cities including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Explosions echoed across central Israel into early Saturday as missile defense systems were activated and civilians were urged to take shelter.The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said it targeted military airbases and weapons production centers that were “sources of the criminal aggression.”A senior Iranian official told CNN, “Everyone will feel it,” referencing further possible retaliation and threats to strike regional bases of any nation that aids Israel.While Trump openly praised the Israeli operation—calling it ""excellent"" in remarks to ABC News—he continued to insist the US played no active military role. ""We gave them a chance, and they didn’t take it. They got hit—very hard. And there’s more to come. A lot more,"" he told to ABC News.Still, the mixed signals out of Washington have raised eyebrows. Just a day earlier, Trump had called for peaceful diplomatic resolution with Iran.","'today is day 61': trump ties himself to israeli strikes on iran.
