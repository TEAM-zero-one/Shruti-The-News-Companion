'No mention of trade in India-US talks during India-Pakistan crisis',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-mention-of-trade-in-india-us-talks-during-india-pakistan-crisis/articleshow/121124830.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government sources have denied former US President Donald Trump's claims about using trade as leverage to broker peace between India and Pakistan amid heightened tensions.According to news agency PTI, discussions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US Vice President JD Vance made no mention of trade relations.""After Operation Sindoor commenced, Vice President Vance spoke to the Prime Minister on May 9,"" a source told PTI.""Secretary of state Marco Rubio spoke to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on May 8 and May 10 and to NSA Ajit Doval on May 10. There was no reference to trade in any of these discussions,"" they added.This comes after Congress questioned PM Modi on Donald Trump's claim, asking if the operation against Pakistan was stopped due to trade obligations and whether he had accepted American mediation on Kashmir.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X, ""The prime minister, his drumbeaters, and his apologists should answer.""""The prime minister's much-delayed address to the nation was completely upstaged by President Trump's revelations a few minutes earlier.

Ramesh asked.""The months ahead will demand both painstaking diplomacy and a collective resolve. One-liners and dialogue-baazi are poor substitutes. We applaud and salute our armed forces unreservedly. They have done the country proud. We are 100 per cent with them at all times. But the prime minister has still much to answer for,"" he added.This comes after Trump on Monday claimed that he threatened India and Pakistan to stop the hostilities by using the trade card and said the States would stop doing trade with them if the two nations did not end the military operations against each other.""I said. Come on, we're going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let's stop it, let's stop it. If you stop it, we're doing trade. If you don't stop it, we're not going to do any trade.

How AI is reshaping the doctor’s role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-ai-is-reshaping-the-doctors-role/articleshow/121113979.cms,"Digestive Disease Week (DDW) held in San Diego, California

ASGE president Prateek Sharma and Microsoft leader Eric Horvitz discuss the impact of AI in healthcare

Both speakers underscored the importance of thoughtful, clinically grounded progress.

During Digestive Disease Week (DDW) held in San Diego, California and attended by more than 12,000 physicians, Dr. Prateek Sharma, President of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), and Dr. Eric Horvitz, Chief Scientific Officer at Microsoft, explored the rapidly evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare.Their conversation highlighted how AI is shaping patient care, improving efficiency in the physician's office, and redefining the role of the clinician. Both their fireside chat and individual lectures at the Presidential Plenary Session drew a large and engaged audience, which reflects the increased interest of integrating AI in healthcare.Dr. Sharma shared real-world examples of how AI is already transforming gastroenterology, from computer-aided detection (CADe) and diagnosis (CADx) in endoscopy to workflow optimisation and predictive modelling. He emphasised that the speciality is entering a point where AI reduces documentation burden, scheduling tools improve clinic flow, and how digital twins may one day enable real-time coaching during procedures.Dr. Horvitz, who leads Microsoft’s health and AI initiatives, discussed broader trends in the field, highlighting AI’s growing role in early disease detection and clinical decision support. He emphasised that AI systems should assist rather than replace human intelligence, serving as tools that support, not override, clinical judgment.He also touched on the need for explainable AI, stating that systems must be transparent and trustworthy if they are to be safely adopted into practice. Both speakers acknowledged that as AI capabilities accelerate, so do challenges facing their integration into clinical practice. Dr. Sharma emphasised the importance of clinical validation, integration across platforms, and policy reform. Dr. Horvitz echoed his concerns, along with the need for ethical guardrails that evolve alongside the technology. Dr. Sharma emphasized that tomorrow’s clinicians must be fluent in AI.“AI won’t replace you, but a gastroenterologist who knows how to use AI might”, he said. Both leaders agreed that training must include interdisciplinary learning to responsibly evaluate and deploy AI tools. Dr. Horvitz added that doctors must be involved from day one in AI development to ensure these tools are clinically relevant and usable for patient needs.As AI continues to advance, both speakers underscored the importance of thoughtful, clinically grounded progress. They encouraged healthcare professionals to stay informed, engage with new technologies, and contribute their perspectives to ensure AI evolves in ways that serve patients, providers, and the healthcare system. The conversation made clear that shaping the future of AI in medicine is not just a technical challenge, but a clinical responsibility.","Digestive disease week (ddw) held in san diego, california and attended by more than 12,000 physicians.

‘Operation Sindoor a new benchmark in war on terror’: Excerpts from PM Modi’s address,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-pakistan-tensions-operation-sindoor-a-new-benchmark-in-war-on-terror-excerpts-from-pm-modi-address/articleshow/121124493.cms,"PM Modi addresses nation

Wiped out terror HQ

Pakistan prepared for border hit, we struck at its heart

Will give befitting reply to terrorists on our terms

Every Indian must be able to live in peace

First of all, on behalf of the people of India, I salute the valiant forces of India, the Armed Forces, our intelligence agencies, and our scientists. Our brave soldiers displayed immense courage to achieve the objectives of Operation Sindoor . I pay tribute to their bravery, courage and valour. I dedicate this valour to every mother, every sister and every daughter of the country.The barbarity displayed by terrorists in Pahalgam on April 22 had shocked the entire country and the world. The merciless killing of innocent citizens in front of their family and their children on the basis of their religion was a very gruesome face of terror and cruelty. This was also a disgusting attempt to break the harmony and unity of the country. For me personally, this was very painful. After this terrorist attack, the entire nation, every citizen, every community, every class, every political party, unitedly stood up for strong action against terrorism. We gave full freedom to the Indian forces to wipe out the terrorists. And today every terrorist, every terror organisation knows the consequence of wiping out the Sindoor of our sisters and daughters.Operation Sindoor is our unwavering commitment to justice. Late night of May 6 and in the early morning of May 7, the whole world saw this pledge turn into reality. Indian forces attacked terror hideouts in Pakistan and their training centres with precision. The terrorists had never imagined that India could take such a big decision. But when the country is united, endowed with the spirit of Nation First and national interest is paramount, then strong decisions are taken, and results are achieved.When India’s missiles and drones attacked terrorist bases in Pakistan, not only the buildings of terrorist organisations but their courage also was shaken badly. Terrorist bases, like Bahawalpur and Muridke , are universities of global terrorism. The big terrorist attacks of the world, be it 9/11, be it London Tube bombings, or the big terrorist attacks which have happened in India in the last many decades, their roots are somehow connected to these terrorist hideouts. The terrorists had wiped out the sindoor of our sisters and India responded by destroying their terrorist headquarters. More than 100 dreaded terrorists have been killed in these attacks by India. Many terrorist leaders were roaming freely in Pakistan for the last two and a half to three decades, who used to conspire against India. India killed them in one stroke.Pakistan was deeply disappointed and frustrated by this action of India. It was bewildered, and in this bewilderment, it did another cowardly act. Instead of supporting India’s strike against terrorism, Pakistan started attacking India itself. Pakistan targeted our schools, colleges, gurdwaras, temples and houses of civilians. Pakistan targeted our military base.But in this act Pakistan itself got exposed. The world saw how Pakistan’s drones and missiles fell like straws in front of India. India’s strong air defence system destroyed them in the sky itself. Pakistan had prepared for an attack on the border, but India struck at the heart of Pakistan. India’s drones and missiles damaged those airbases of the Pakistani air forces, of which Pakistan was very proud. India caused heavy damage to Pakistan in the first three days itself, which it had never imagined.That’s why after India’s aggressive action, Pakistan started looking for ways to escape. Pakistan was pleading to the world to ease tensions. And after suffering heavy losses, Pakistan’s army contacted our DGMO on the afternoon of May 10. By then we had destroyed the infrastructure of terrorism on a large scale. The terrorists were eliminated. We had destroyed the terror camps established in the heart of Pakistan. Therefore, when Pakistan appealed and said that it will not indulge in any sort of terror activities or military audacity further, India considered it. And I am repeating again, we have just suspended our retaliatory action against Pakistan’s terror and military camps. In the coming days we will measure every step of Pakistan on the criterion that what sort of attitude Pakistan will adopt ahead.After the surgical strike and air strike, now Operation Sindoor is India’s policy against terrorism. Operation Sindoor has carved out a new benchmark in our fight against terrorism and has set up a new parameter and new normal.First, if there is a terrorist attack on India, a fitting reply will be given.We will give a befitting response on our terms only. We will take strict action at every place from where the roots of terrorism emerge.Secondly, India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail.Thirdly, we will not differentiate between govt sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism. During Operation Sindoor, the world has again seen the ugly face of Pakistan, when top Pakistani army officers came to bid farewell to the slain terrorists. This is strong evidence of state-sponsored terrorism. We will continue to take decisive steps to protect India and our citizens from any threat.We have defeated Pakistan every time on the battlefield. And this time Operation Sindoor has added a new dimension. We have proved our superiority in new age warfare. The credibility of our Made in India weapons was also proven. Today, the world is witnessing that in 21st century warfare, the time has come for Made in India defence equipment.This is certainly not the era of war, but this is also not the era of terrorism. Zero tolerance against terrorism is the guarantee for a better world.The way the Pakistani army, Pakistan govt are encouraging terrorism, it will destroy Pakistan one day. If Pakistan wants to survive, it will have to destroy its terror infrastructure. There is no other way to peace. India’s stand is very clear... Terror and talks cannot go together... Terror and trade cannot go together…. Water and blood cannot flow together.Today, I would also like to tell the global community that our stated policy has been: If there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; and if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK).Today is Buddha Purnima . Lord Buddha has shown us the path of peace. The path of peace also goes through power. Humanity should move towards peace and prosperity. Every Indian should be able to live in peace and can fulfil the dream of Viksit Bharat. For this, it is very necessary for India to be powerful. And it is also necessary to use this power when required. And in the last few days, India has done just that.","Pm modi: pakistan prepared for border hit, we struck at its heart. Will give befitting reply to terrorists on our terms. Every indian must be able to live in peace with pakistan.

NEW DELHI: The Indian defence establishment was outraged when Pakistan violated the understanding to stop all cross-border military action from 5pm onwards on Saturday by sending another wave of drones across the entire western front later that night.Lt General Ghai had on Sunday declared that India would deliver ""a fierce and punitive response"" if Pakistan violated the bilateral understanding, with Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi granting ""full authority"" to commanders for ""counteraction in the kinetic domain"" to any more misadventures.As for the build-up after the Pahalgam terror massacre, Pakistan has moved several reserve army formations, tanks and Chinese-made SH-15 self-propelled 155mm howitzers closer to the LoC as well as the International Border. India, of course, had also made ""mirror deployments"" of its forces.Sources said the Shakargarh Bulge, which protrudes into India between the Chenab and Ravi rivers, was one of the places where a major build-up of tanks and armoured vehicles by the Pakistan army was spotted.The area's flat terrain and its proximity to Indian cities such as Amritsar, Pathankot, Batala and Gurdaspur as well as road links to Jammu makes it a high priority area for the Indian Army. It was the site of the famous 'Battle of Basantar' during the 1971 war.","Pakistan violated the understanding to stop all cross-border military action from 5pm onwards on saturday by sending another wave of drones across the entire western front.

Blackout measures in Punjab border districts

NEW DELHI: Suspected Pakistani drones were detected and engaged along the International Border in Jammu’s Samba district on Monday, in what officials described as yet another ceasefire violation. According to Army sources cited by PTI, security forces responded swiftly, intercepting and engaging the UAVs shortly after they were spotted.“A small number of suspected drones have been observed near Samba in J&K. They are being engaged,” said an Army official, assuring that the situation is under control and there is no need for public alarm.ANI also quoted Army sources saying, “Comparatively, a very small number of drones have come in the Samba sector. They are being engaged and there is nothing to be alarmed.”The drone incursion occurred within an hour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s televised address, where he reaffirmed India's resolve under Operation Sindoor, warning Pakistan against sheltering terrorists and saying that talks would be limited to terror and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).As a precaution, blackout protocols were activated in multiple districts of Punjab, which shares a 553-kilometre border with Pakistan. These included Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, and parts of Jalandhar.An air-raid siren was sounded in Amritsar. Deputy Commissioner Sakshi Sawhney confirmed, “We are alert. We are enforcing a blackout. People should stay away from windows.”In Jalandhar, deputy commissioner Himanshu Aggarwal said that lights had been switched off in Suranassi after reports of drone sightings: “There is no total blackout as of now... There is nothing to worry.”In Hoshiarpur, the blackout affected Dasuya and Mukerian towns.Despite the heightened alert, border areas in Punjab largely remained calm. Markets stayed open while some schools remained shut as a precautionary measure.","Suspected pakistani drones detected and engaged along the international border in jammu’s samba district.

They are ready to undertake any future missions should the need arise,’ said Air Marshal Bharti

NEW DELHI: From Turkish drones to Chinese missiles , and possibly even a few Pakistani aircraft, all were thwarted by India's integrated multi-layered air defence network during three days of intense hostilities, top military officers said on Monday.""Our integrated air defence (AD) systems stood like a wall and they (Pakistan) could not breach it. Whether it's a Turkish drone or anything else, it fails in front of the technology of India,"" director general of air operations Air Marshal A K Bharti said.""The sky remains ours,"" with a relatively impregnable AD shield, was the underlying message of the briefing he addressed with his Army and Navy counterparts, Lt-General Rajiv Ghai and Vice Admiral A N Pramod, on Monday.""All our military bases, all our systems continue to remain fully operational. They are ready to undertake any future missions should the need arise,"" Air Marshal Bharti added.The officers showed evidentiary photos of Pakistan having used Chinese-made PL-15 LR beyond visual range air-to-air missiles as well as Turkish-origin Byker Yiha kamikaze and Asisguard Songar drones, apart from long-range rockets, loiter munitions and quadcopters.Most of them were shot down by India's AD systems, while the ones that got through caused only minimal damage. ""Whenever Pakistan Air Force attacked us, it failed in front of our AD grid,"" Lt-Gen Ghai said.As reported by TOI earlier, the AD network of surveillance and target-acquisition radars and a wide array of weapon systems are all plugged into the integrated air command and control system (IACCS) of the IAF and the Akashteer system to provide a composite real-time air picture to the armed forces.The network stretches from the long-range Russian S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile systems (380-km interception range) and Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70-km), jointly developed with Israel, to the shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles (6-km) and the indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (1-2 km).The indigenous Akash system, which is capable of intercepting hostile aircraft, helicopters and drones at a range of 25-km, falls in between. ""Another highlight has been the stellar performance of indigenous AD weapons like Akash,"" Air Marshal Bharti said.The IAF, as reported by TOI earlier, has inducted the bulk of the 15 squadrons of Akash-1 and 2 systems it has ordered for Rs 10,900 crore. The Army, in turn, has four Akash regiments worth Rs 22,340 crore, with more in the pipeline. A new-generation Akash weapon system, with an interception range of 30-km, is also now ready for the final trials.The senior IAF officer also praised the ""performance and efficacy"" demonstrated by even older AD systems like the Pechora missiles, OSA-AK-m (10-km) and low-level L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5-km) in countering the ""Pakistani threat vectors"".Of the 300 to 400 drones launched by Pakistan across the entire western front on May 8, for instance, 50 were destroyed by L-70 and ZU-23mm twin-barrel guns and other such weapons.Another 20 drones were jammed and spoofed by a variety of devices, while the rest flew back across the border. At the other end of the spectrum, a Pakistani high-speed missile was intercepted over Sirsa by an advanced AD missile system on May 10.Though the Navy's formidable ""fleet air defence mechanism"" did not come into play in the northern Arabian Sea, Vice Admiral Pramod said the presence of aircraft carrier INS Vikrant battlegroup, with MiG-29K fighters and early-warning helicopters, compelled the Pakistan Air Force to remain ""bottled-up"" close to the Makran coast.","‘all our military bases, all our systems continue to remain fully operational.

NEW DELHI: It took 15 years, a thousand scientists and combined effort of several defence labs situated across the country to develop the indigenous Akash missile defence system that successfully passed its first battlefield test along the western borders with Pakistan, said a proud Prahlada Ramarao , the then project director of the totally-indigenous missile shield programme of Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ).The Akash missile defence system proved its mettle when it successfully countered waves of drone and missile attacks from Pakistan during the night of May 8 and 9. Indian military officials have confirmed the effectiveness of India’s missile defence systems like Akash and S400 Triumf when IAF DGMO Air Marshal AK Bharti on Monday asserted that India’s defence systems “stood like a wall”, preventing enemy breaches.On Akash clearing its first ‘agni-pariksha’ and boosting India’s ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence production, Ramarao, a Padma Shri recipient, told TOI, “My eyes welled up when my baby worked so well. It is the happiest day of my life. This is bigger than my Padma award.”Ramarao was handpicked by India’s ‘Missile Man’ Dr APJ Abdul Kalam as the youngest project director at the age of 35 to head the Akash programme in early 1990s. Kalam was then head of DRDO’s defence laboratory Defence Research Laboratory (DRL) in Hyderabad, before he became scientific adviser to the defence minister and subsequently the President of India. “A leader brings team spirit and inspires all to work towards a common goal. Kalam was a true leader in that sense. The country now requires 10 Abdul Kalams to grow and develop in various fields like the way the aerospace and defence sectors grew under him,” he said.Though Akash had undergone numerous test trials and later user trials by the Army and IAF, this was the first time the missile defence witnessed a real battlefield condition when Pakistan attacked India with missiles and drones. Both Indian Army and IAF have strategically deployed this missile system alongside the western border as Akash has the capability to neutralise aerial targets like fighter jets, cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles and even drones. The real time multi-sensor data processing and threat evaluation enables simultaneous engagement of multiple targets from any direction.“We started work on this project in 1994 with an initial budget of Rs 300 crore. When you invent something, you fail several times. We also failed. But we learnt from our mistakes. Developing Rajendra, a complex multi-function electronically scanned phased array radar, was the biggest challenge. But we overcame that challenge after several hits and trials. Later, the project budget was raised to Rs 500 crore,” Ramarao said.“I guarantee you, nowhere in the world a missile defence system could have been invented in just Rs 500 crore. Our Akash is the cheapest but most effective missile shield. It can detect a hostile missile from a distance of 70km and kill it at a 30km range,” the DRDO veteran, now 78 years old, said.After its development in 2009, Akash has since undergone continuous evolution, resulting in the development of several variants, each with enhanced capabilities tailored to address specific operational requirements. These variants include initial Mark-I, upgraded Akash-1S with an indigenous seeker, high-accuracy Akash Prime designed for high-altitude and low-temperature operations, and advanced next-generation Akash-NG, which boasts significantly extended range and sophisticated features.As per an estimate, IAF has inducted a substantial number of Akash systems, with reports indicating the induction of 15 squadrons. Army operates four regiments of Aakash, with plans for further acquisitions to augment its air defence capabilities.Impressed with its efficient working, Armenia became the first country to ink a deal with India in 2022 to procure 15 Akash missile systems worth around Rs 6,000 crore. Last year, India had dispatched the first batch of the missile systems to the central Asian country to protect its borders.",Akash missile defence system proved its mettle when it successfully countered waves of drone and missile attacks from pakistan during the night of may 8 and 9.

""Come on, we are going to do a lot of trade with you guys, so let's stop it. People have never really used trade the way I use it. Then all of a sudden they said - let's stop,"" he had first said in the context that the US was going to trade more with both countries.The assertion was not only refuted by official sources that US V-P J D Vance had brought up the trade issue when he called the PM on Friday, it also appeared to be running afoul of Modi's assertion to let his ""tough on terror"" stand be encumbered by any consideration, trade including.In his address, Modi reiterated that trade and terror cannot go together.
