MCX Gold has been exhibiting a steady upward momentum, and this positive trend has opened the possibility of prices moving toward the ₹1,27,000 level in the near term. The recent price action suggests strong buying interest, supported by favorable global cues and renewed investor confidence. However, this optimism must be balanced with caution, as the upcoming week is expected to be data-heavy. A series of key economic releases from the United States—delayed due to the recent government shutdown—could inject volatility into global markets, including commodities like gold.Given this backdrop, traders are advised to maintain disciplined risk management. A strict stop-loss at ₹1,22,000 is recommended to protect long positions. This level has been acting as a crucial support zone; a break below it could indicate a shift in sentiment.If prices fall below this stop-loss, gold may witness a deeper correction, potentially dragging it down toward the ₹1,18,000 mark, where the next major support lies.Overall, while the broader outlook remains constructive, traders should stay vigilant and responsive to global macro developments. With significant US economic data on the way, adopting a cautious yet strategic approach will be essential for navigating short-term market fluctuations.MCX Silver has shown strong upward momentum, successfully moving above the ₹1,58,000 mark and gradually approaching its previous swing high near ₹1,65,800. This breakout reflects renewed strength in the bullion market, supported by improving sentiment, global uncertainty, and steady buying interest from investors seeking safety. The price action suggests that silver may continue its upward journey if bullish conditions persist, especially with supportive cues from international markets.However, despite the encouraging trend, traders should remain cautious. Much like gold, silver is also sensitive to global economic data, currency movements, and macro-level developments. With several important economic indicators expected from the US this week—following delays caused by the recent government shutdown—volatility may rise across precious metals.To manage this potential risk, it is advisable to maintain a strict stop-loss at ₹1,55,500. This level serves as a crucial support area and helps protect against sudden downside moves. If silver fails to sustain above this threshold, it could trigger profit-booking or aggressive selling pressure, which may drag prices down toward the ₹1,45,000 level, where the next major support exists.Overall, while the broader trend remains constructive, adopting disciplined risk management and monitoring global cues closely will be essential for navigating the short-term movements in MCX Silver.","Gold prices may move towards rs 1,27,000 levels in the near term, says abhilash koikkara, head - forex & commodities, nuvama professional clients group.

Delhi Police Alleges 2020 Riots Were Timed With Trump Visit And Aimed To Spark Pan India Unrest

'Sharjeel spoke about targeting Chicken Neck'



What is the case?



NEW DELHI: Delhi police on Thursday told the Supreme Court that when intellectuals become terrorists, they become ""more dangerous"" than those working on the ground. The police made these statements as it strongly opposed the bail pleas of activists Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and others in connection with the February 2020 Delhi riots.Appearing for Delhi Police, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S V Raju argued before a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria that the delay in trial was caused by the accused themselves and ""they cannot take advantage of it.""ASG Raju played videos in the top court showing Sharjeel Imam delivering ""inflammatory speeches"" against the CAA at Chakhand, Jamia, Aligarh and Asansol in 2019–20, ahead of the February 2020 Delhi riots.Further pointing that Sharjeel is an engineering graduate, the advocate said, ""Nowadays there is a trend that doctors, engineers are not doing their professions but engaging in anti-national activities.""""It's not a simple protest. These are violent protests. They are talking about blockades,"" the Additional Solicitor General added. When Justice Kumar asked whether these speeches formed part of the chargesheet, he said that they did.ASG Raju further claimed that the content of Sharjeel's speech, ""we should separate Assam from India"" and ""you must be able to endure lathis and injuries"", were intended to incite violence and internationalise the issue.He added that Sharjeel spoke about targeting the ""Chicken Neck"" corridor, arguing that cutting the 16-km stretch would isolate Assam from the rest of the country. Sharjeel also allegedly referred to the abrogation of Article 370 and warned the court over its Babri Masjid verdict saying ""Court ki nani yaad kara denge.""According to ASG Raju, the accused ""did not have sufficient protest during 370, Babri Masjid, Triple Talaq. They saw an opportunity during the CAA Bill to garner the support of the Muslims and mislead them.""ASG Raju further argued that the timing of the protests was linked to then US President Donald Trump’s visit, in an effort to draw global media attention. ""The ultimate intention is regime change. CAA protests were a red-herring, the real purpose was regime change, economic deprivation and chaos across the country,"" he said.""The riots were deliberately made to coincide with the visit of US President Donald Trump. These so-called intellectuals are more dangerous than the ground-level terrorists,"" he added.Khalid, Imam, Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider and Rehman have been charged under the UAPA and provisions of the erstwhile IPC for allegedly being the ""masterminds"" of the 2020 riots, which left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. The violence broke out amid nationwide protests against the CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens.Earlier, strongly opposing the bail pleas, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had submitted that the riots were ""not something spontaneous but an orchestrated, pre-planned, and well-designed attack on the sovereignty of the nation.""He argued that the attempt was to ""divide society on communal lines"" and that it was ""not merely an agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.""","Delhi police alleges 2020 riots were timed with trump visit and aimed to spark pan india unrest.

350% tariff claim: Congress hits out at NDA; asks why PM Modi won’t respond to Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/350-tariff-claim-congress-hits-out-at-nda-asks-why-pm-modi-wont-respond-to-trump/articleshow/125462853.cms,"Donald Trump Signals Harsh Sanctions On Russia’s Trading Partners With India On List For Oil Trade

NEW DELHI: Congress on Thursday targeted the NDA over US President Donald Trump’s repeated claim that he forced India and Pakistan to step back from the brink of conflict by threatening both countries with 350% tariffs. The party said the claim was “extraordinary” and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi clarify whether any such conversation took place.Responding to Trump’s latest remarks, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said the US president had made three specific claims. “He (Donald Trump) said three things. First, that PM Modi called me. Second, I pressurised him, and third, I told him that if you do not stop Operation Sindoor, you might get a 350% tariff... Our Prime Minister is silent?... Why are his ministers silent?...” Ramesh asked.Trump, speaking at the US–Saudi Investment Forum in Washington this week, said he warned both India and Pakistan that the US would impose massive tariffs and halt all trade if they continued escalating. He claimed the threat led both sides to pull back and prompted Modi to call him to say, “we're not going to go to war.” Trump has repeated the story more than 60 times since May, despite India’s consistent rejection of any suggestion of third-party mediation.Recounting what he described as a firm message to the two nuclear-armed neighbours, Trump said he told them they could “go at it” but that he would respond with a 350 per cent tariff. According to him, both sides urged him not to proceed. He added that Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later thanked him for “saving millions of lives.”Trump also linked his approach to broader claims that he used tariffs to “settle” several global conflicts.India, however, maintains that the ceasefire understanding with Pakistan on 10 May followed direct military-level talks between the two DGMOs.

NEW DELHI: A group of 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter accusing leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and the Congress of trying to erode public faith in the Election Commission and other constitutional institutions.The letter, titled ""Assault on National Constitutional Authorities,"" alleged that opposition leaders were attempting to manufacture a sense of institutional breakdown through what it described as “venomous rhetoric” and “provocative but unsubstantiated accusations.”The letter said: “Some political leaders, instead of offering genuine policy alternative, resort to provocative but unsubstantiated accusations in their theatrical political strategy. After their attempts to tarnish the Indian Armed Forces by questioning their valour and accomplishments, and the Judiciary by questioning its fairness, Parliament, and its constitutional functionaries, now it is the turn of Election Commission of India to face systematic and conspiratorial attacks on its integrity and reputation.”The signatories singled out Rahul Gandhi for repeatedly alleging vote theft while, they said, failing to file a formal complaint or sworn affidavit to back his claims. They pointed to his assertions that he had “100 per cent proof” and an “atom bomb” against the Commission, alongside accusations of “treason,” and argued that such remarks came “without the prescribed sworn affidavit” required for accountability.The letter also noted that similar accusations had been amplified by Congress leaders, opposition parties and allied NGOs, including claims that the Election Commission had acted like the “B-team of the BJP.” It argued these assertions collapsed under scrutiny, pointing to the ECI’s public release of its methodology and verification done under court oversight.It said, “Moreover, several senior figures of Congress and other political parties, leftist NGOs, ideologically opinionated scholars, and a few attention seekers in other walks of life, have joined in with similarly blistering rhetoric against SIR, even declaring that the Commission has descended into complete shamelessness by acting like the ‘B-team of the BJP.’ Such fiery rhetoric may be emotionally powerful but it collapses under scrutiny, because the ECI has publicly shared its SIR methodology, overseen verification by court-sanctioned means, removed ineligible names in a compliant manner, and added new eligible voters. ”The signatories described this pattern of criticism as “impotent rage,” stating that leaders who faced electoral setbacks “lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility.”The letter said, “This pattern of behaviour reflects what might be called ‘impotent rage’ deep anger born of repeated electoral failure and frustration, without a concrete plan to reconnect with the people. When political leaders lose touch with the aspirations of ordinary citizens, they lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility. Theatrics replace analysis. Public spectacle takes the place of public service. ”Invoking the legacy of former chief election commissioners TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, the letter said, “Today, thinking of ECI, the country also remembers the likes of TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, whose unyielding leadership transformed the Election Commission into a formidable constitutional sentinel. They did not court popularity. They did not chase headlines. They enforced the rules fearlessly, impartially, relentlessly. ”Calling for transparency, legal accountability and respectful political conduct, the letter concluded by saying, “We call upon the Election Commission to continue its path of transparency and rigour. Publish complete data, defend itself through legal channels when necessary, and reject politics dressed up as victimhood. We call upon political leaders to respect the constitutional process, to compete not through baseless accusation but through policy articulation, and to accept democratic verdicts with grace. ”","272 eminent citizens accuse rahul gandhi and congress of trying to erode public faith in constitutional institutions.

NEW DELHI: Two men suspected of working for an ISI-backed ""terror module"" were injured in an encounter with Ludhiana Police on Thursday after they allegedly opened fire during a police operation. Officers had laid a trap based on intelligence that a Pakistan-based handler had instructed the duo to exchange grenades at specific locations.Ludhiana Police Commissioner Swapan Sharma said the suspects fired at the police when they were intercepted, prompting retaliatory firing. One man was hit by three bullets, and the other by one. Both were taken to a hospital, where one is reported to be in critical condition.Sharma said the module was being run through virtual numbers by an ISI handler based in Pakistan. “They used to receive calls from a virtual number operating from Pakistan; the handler was from Pakistan's ISI...In the encounter today, the Pakistan-based handler had tasked these two individuals to exchange grenades at designated spots,” Sharma was quoted as saying by ANI.Police had earlier arrested three others linked to the same module, Arsh from Bihar’s Bhojpur district, Ajay from Haryana’s Fatehabad, and Shamsher from Ludhiana, each assigned different roles.During the operation, police recovered two Chinese-made grenades, five pistols suspected to have been smuggled across the border, and live ammunition.

US Approves Major Arms Deal For India With Javelins And Excalibur To Counter Regional Threats

NEW DELHI: India is now set to ink another two arms deals with the US for Excalibur precision strike artillery munitions and man-portable Javelin anti-tank missiles worth $93 million (Rs 826 crore), even as the two countries try to work out a trade deal that would address the hefty 50% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Indian goods.The two new deals come soon after India earlier this month signed the over $1 billion (Rs 8,900 crore) contract with US major General Electric for another 113 GE-F404 engines to power the indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters.However, another major deal for India to acquire six more advanced P-8I long-range maritime patrol and submarine-hunting aircraft – Navy already has 12 such planes bought for over $3.2 billion – is still stuck in negotiations due to the high price being demanded by the US.Approving the two FMS (foreign military sale) cases “requested” by India on Wednesday, the Trump administration notified the US Congress and said the proposed deals will support the US foreign policy and national security objectives by strengthening the bilateral strategic relationship. India, a major defence partner, continues to be an important force for political stability, peace and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions, it said.The first is for 216 Excalibur tactical projectiles, along with associated equipment, for $47.1 million. The Army had deployed M-777 ultra-light howitzers, imported from the US, to fire Excalibur `smart’ extended range artillery shells to pound Pak Army and terror targets during Operation Sindoor in May. “The Excalibur munitions, with a 40-km range, proved very effective. The fresh supply will replenish stocks,” an officer said.The second deal is for 100 shoulder-launched FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), which have a 4-km range, along with 25 command launch units and other equipment for $45.7 million. This comes even as the two countries are also working to finalize a much larger project to jointly manufacture the fire-and-forget Javelin missile systems in India.With a huge deficiency in different kinds of shoulder, vehicle and helicopter-launched ATGMs, the Indian armed forces have been demanding third and fourth-generation ATGMs with longer ranges and greater armour-penetration capabilities for well over a decade now.The Army and IAF have also gone in for a limited number of Israeli Spike ATGMs, both man-portable as well as helicopter-launch ones, over the last few years in the absence of viable indigenous options.DRDO, on its part, says its man-portable ATGM, which has a 2-3 km range, is now fully ready. The ATGM, which is equipped with day/night and top attack capabilities to penetrate modern armour-protected tanks, has been field evaluated in different flight configurations many times, it adds.",India is set to ink another two arms deals with the us for excalibur precision strike artillery munitions and man-portable javelin anti-tank missiles.

World Leaders In Shock As Clashes Erupt In Brazil, COP30 Stormed By Violent Indigenous Protesters

NEW DELHI: Pitching for expanding a unique model where bilateral cooperation can reinforce multilateral objectives, India has called an existing ‘joint crediting mechanism’ a key tool for global climate action, and urged countries to join this cooperative approach to collectively reduce their carbon footprints.The benefit of the mechanism was flagged by Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on the sidelines of the ongoing 30th session of the UN climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil on Wednesday.India is one of the 31 partner countries of the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), spearheaded by Japan, which provides a clear framework for both governments and the private sector to jointly develop mitigation projects, mobilise finance, deploy advanced technologies, and transparently allocate the resulting emission reductions credit among themselves.It’s a bilateral mechanism which is being implemented in accordance with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement that facilitates the creation and functioning of carbon markets as an emission reduction tool. India had joined the mechanism with Japan in August as part of the country’s first bilateral cooperation under the Paris Agreement. JCM is expected to serve as a model for achieving rapid economic growth while simultaneously addressing environmental challenges.Participating in the 11th JCM partner countries’ meeting, chaired by Japan’s environment minister Hirotaka Ishihara, Yadav highlighted the importance of cooperative mechanisms at a time when the world seeks scalable, equitable and technology-driven climate solutions. He underlined that the mechanism represents “a significant approach in strengthening efforts for climate action while supporting national priorities, particularly for developing countries”.Noting that the JCM would contribute directly to India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term low emission development strategy, Yadav said the move would help develop a domestic ecosystem and localise high-technology interventions, while also contributing to the country’s sustainable development goals.","India has called an existing ‘joint crediting mechanism’ a key tool for global climate action.

Demanding an explanation for his praise, Tharoor's colleague Sandeep Dikshit went on to ask ""why are you in Congress"" and even termed him a ""hypocrite"".""Shashi Tharoor's problem is that I don't think he knows a lot about the country... If, according to you, someone is doing good for the country by going against the Congress's policies, then you should follow those policies... Why are you in Congress? Is it only because you are an MP?"" Dikshit said.""If you really feel that the BJP or PM Modi's strategies are working better than the party you are in, then you should give an explanation. If you are not giving one, you are a hypocrite,"" he added.Congress leader Supriya Shrinate had echoed similar sentiments as she said that she ""didn't find anything in the speech (of PM Modi) worth appreciating"" and she didn't ""know how he (Shashi Tharoor) found one"".""I didn't find anything in the speech (of PM Modi) worth appreciating. I think PM must answer a lot of things. He was at an event of a newspaper. He should tell us what his problem is with fair journalism.He should have told us why is he not happy with those who show and speak truth... So, I didn't see any reason to appreciate him,"" she said.""I don't know how he (Shashi Tharoor) found one...I found it to be a petty speech. He criticised Congress there too. PM thinks of Congress day and night. This is amazing,"" she added.Earlier this week, Tharoor shared his experience of attending a PM Modi lecture. In a post on X, he wrote a short critical analysis of what his opinion was regarding the prime minister's speech.However, he did go on to praise the PM's address saying that it ""served as both an economic outlook and a cultural call to action, urging the nation to be restless for progress.""""The PM emphasized that India is no longer just an 'emerging market' but an 'emerging model' for the world, noting its economic resilience. PM Modi said he’d been accused of being in “election mode” all the time, but he was really in “emotional mode” to redress the problems of the people,"" Tharoor said.""A significant part of the speech was dedicated to overturning Macaulay's 200-year legacy of ""slave mentality."" PM Modi appealed for a 10-year national mission to restore pride in India’s heritage, languages, and knowledge systems. I wish he had also acknowledged how Ramnath Goenka had used English to raise a voice for Indian nationalism!"" he added.","Shashi tharoor's recent praise for prime minister narendra modi has ruffled some feathers in the congress.

"'Unconstitutional': SC strikes down Tribunal Act, slams govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unconstitutional-sc-strikes-down-tribunal-act-slams-govt/articleshow/125447657.cms,"SC: Parl's discretion broad, not absolute

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court struck down Wednesday the Tribunal Reforms Act as unconstitutional and slammed the central govt for its repeated attempts to override SC's consistent rulings to shield the judicial independence of tribunals, which decide disputes in a gamut of regimes - taxation, environment, electricity, telecom and real estate.Days before his retirement, a CJI B R Gavai-led bench deprecated the Centre's repeated attempts to tinker with the qualifications, tenure and service conditions for chairpersons and members of the tribunals and took umbrage that within weeks of SC striking down the Tribunal Reforms Ordinance in July 2021, the govt tabled a bill in Parliament to enact the law whose provisions were identical to that of the ordinance.Censuring the govt for ""consciously attempting to annul the rulings"" by enacting a law that had ""cosmetically changed a few provisions"" of the annulled law, the bench of CJI Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said, ""The Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021 is a replica of the struck-down ordinance; old wine in a new bottle, the wine whets not the judicial palate, but the bottle merely dazzles.""The verdict means that, pending the enactment of a new law, the service conditions of tribunal presidents and members would be governed by their parent Acts.For example, ITAT Act would govern service conditions of ITAT president and members.Writing the judgment, CJI Gavai said, ""The provisions of the impugned Act cannot be sustained. They violate the constitutional principles of separation of powers and judicial independence.""The Supreme Court said the Act directly contradicts binding judicial pronouncements that have repeatedly clarified the standards governing the appointment, tenure and functioning of tribunal members. The bench said that the Act, which intended to usher in uniformity in tenure and service conditions of all tribunal members, undermined the constitutional requirements of independence and impartiality of tribunals by enabling the executive to exercise control over them.The Supreme Court said, ""Where Parliament reenacts provisions previously struck down without curing the underlying defect, the resulting legislation remains vulnerable to invalidation, not because the Court is imposing its own policy, but because the Constitution itself demands adherence to these structural safeguards.""""The Indian constitutional framework does not subscribe to parliamentary sovereignty, nor does it vest unqualified supremacy in the judiciary.""The architecture of our Constitution is firmly rooted in the principle of constitutional supremacy.""It said that when SC interprets the Constitution and pronounces upon the validity of a law, that pronouncement becomes the authoritative and binding declaration of the law.""Once the court has struck down a provision or issued binding directions after identifying a constitutional defect, Parliament cannot simply override or contradict that judicial decision by re-enacting the very same measure in a different form,"" CJI Gavai said.Supreme Court said Parliament's discretion is broad but not absolute.","Supreme court said parliament's discretion is broad but not absolute.

Candace Owens claims the story about the day Charlie Kirk was shot does not make sense to her. She shared her thoughts during Myron Gaines’ livestream, which was uploaded to YouTube on November 18, 2025. Owens said she has been looking into the case on her own, and from what she has seen, the clips and details shown to the public feel incomplete. She pointed out that the public has not seen the exact moment when the shot was fired, and only a short clip of a person running after the shooting was released.Owens also said that Tyler Robinson, the man accused of shooting Charlie Kirk, may not have played the role many people think. She claimed that his fingerprints were found on the gun but said they were not the only fingerprints present. She also said another person named Lance Twiggs might have had a bigger role that day. Candace Owens stressed that these are her claims based on what she has seen so far.During the livestream, Candace Owens explained what she believed happened on the day Charlie Kirk was shot. She said she thinks the whole situation looked like a planned setup with many people involved, not just one person acting alone.Myron Gaines asked her why she thought the story felt wrong, and she said there were gaps that did not add up.Candace Owens said that in her view, Tyler Robinson’s only real link to the case was that his fingerprints were found on the gun. She said his prints were not the only prints and claimed that this detail was not openly talked about.She also said that she does not believe Robinson stepped onto the campus that day. According to her, his “job” was only to pick up clothes and drop them near a Dairy Queen and then near a cemetery.She then discussed Lance Twiggs, who she said was the partner of the accused shooter. Candace Owens claimed Lance Twiggs was “much more involved.” She said she did not think he fired the shot, but she believed he had a deeper part in the plan.Candace Owens also pointed to a TMZ video from September 13. The video showed a person walking toward Utah Valley University hours before the shooting. The person wore a maroon shirt, black cap, light shorts, and sneakers. Owens said this person was not Robinson but Lance Twiggs. She said the body in the video did not match Robinson and used this to support her claim that different people had different roles.Candace Owens said these details made her believe the Charlie Kirk shooting used patsies who were each given small tasks so the plan looked bigger and more confusing.Also Read: Candace Owens Brings Attention To YouTuber Claim Of TPUSA Financial Delay Before Charlie Kirk Shooting","Candace owens claims the story about the day charlie kirk was shot does not make sense to her.

Taylor Swift’s ‘The Fate of Ophelia’ has fans convinced she’s revisiting her Joe Alwyn breakup — making clear it’s not about Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swifts-the-fate-of-ophelia-has-fans-convinced-shes-revisiting-her-joe-alwyn-breakup-making-clear-its-not-about-travis-kelce/articleshow/125346377.cms,"Taylor Swift's new song, 'The Fate of Ophelia,' is fueling fan theories linking it to her breakup with Joe Alwyn.

Swifties think Taylor Swift’s ‘The Fate of Ophelia’ is aimed directly at Joe Alwyn

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift’s latest track, “The Fate of Ophelia,” is sparking a fresh wave of online theories and Swifties are convinced she’s weaving real-life heartbreak into a Shakespeare-inspired narrative. The song, featured on The Life of a Showgirl, flips the tragic Ophelia storyline into one of revival, and fans immediately tie the imagery to Taylor’s emotional journey after her six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn.With lyrics that feel pointed, timing that feels deliberate, and symbolism that leans heavily into themes of rescue, rebirth, and choosing a new path, this track has become the latest cultural flashpoint as listeners dissect what Taylor may be saying between the lines..Swifties didn’t waste time pulling receipts. The lyric “dug me out of my grave” is being hailed as a symbolic nod to Travis, the man fans believe helped lift Taylor from the emotional stagnation she experienced during her long romance with Joe. And the shade? It’s there in sharpened form.When Taylor Swift sings, “All that time, I sat alone in my tower / You were just honing your powers,” listeners immediately connected it to Joe’s famously private lifestyle and his recent role in a new Hamlet film.The overlap between Ophelia, Hamlet, and Taylor’s real-life history is simply too on-the-nose for fans to ignore.What makes the moment hit even harder is how openly Swift seems to be reclaiming her narrative. Rather than turning her breakup into bitterness, she’s framing it as the final chapter of a darker era, one that allowed her to rise stronger and choose a love that fits her world rather than hides from it. Joe Alwyn, for his part, has subtly signaled he’s over the conversation, reportedly saying he’s moved on and suggesting fans do the same. But Swifties aren’t budging it.For Swift, this track feels like a mic-drop: a poetic goodbye to the past, a wink at the present, and a reminder that she’ll always turn heartbreak into art, even if some people would prefer not to be name-checked in her mythology..","Taylor swift's new song, 'the fate of ophelia,' is fueling fan theories linking it to her breakup with joe alwyn.

Candace Owens Makes Shocking Egyptian Planes Claim In Charlie Kirk Case

Candace Owens says flight signals, rental cars, and timing raise new questions

Operation Mocking-Plane: The Charlie Kirk Plot Thickens. | Candace Ep 266





Candace Owens says she has many serious questions about the killing of Charlie Kirk. She talked about this again in her podcast on November 17. She said she found new details that made her even more worried. Candace Owens said two Egyptian planes showed up many times near Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s wife. She said these planes showed up at places where Erika Kirk was 73 times from 2022 to September 2025. She said she found these numbers after checking the work of a woman online, whom she called a “pregnant mommy sleuth.”She said the woman was right. Candace Owens said 29 of those overlaps also had Charlie Kirk in the same place. She said both planes were also at the Provo airport on September 10, the day Charlie Kirk was shot near Utah Valley University. She said one plane took off, and the other stayed on the ground with its power on.Candace Owens said the two planes were the yellow SU-BTT and the blue SU-BND. She said these flights mostly matched Erika Kirk’s movements inside five U.S. states but also matched her travel overseas. She said one plane at the Provo airport sent out a signal from 9:05 a.m.until 10:34 a.m. on September 10. She said its signal turned on again 17 minutes after Charlie Kirk was shot at 12:40 p.m., and stayed on until 1:29 p.m.Candace Owens said she believed this signal came from data on ADS-B Exchange. She also said the flight was “transponding” at Duncan Aviation. She said she saw claims online from MJTruthUltra that Duncan Aviation gave rental cars to people linked to the Egyptian planes. She even read out the car details and asked if anyone had seen them.Candace Owens said the plane could have been doing normal maintenance. She also said the plane might have tools to make private satellite calls. She said these ideas were only her guesses of her about the situation.Also Read: Candace Owens sparks chaos with new Britney Spears trafficking claim as Lou Taylor link trends after Kim Kardashian video Candace Owens said Turning Point USA knew about these flights and should explain why the planes were there.

Candace Owens questions missing video and messages from Charlie Kirk





Candace Owens has spoken out after new reports said there is no video of Tyler Robinson walking into the Washington County Sheriff’s Office after the death of Charlie Kirk . This news has caused many questions online because earlier reports said Robinson turned himself in soon after the shooting. Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on September 10 during an event at Utah Valley University. After the shooting, reports said Tyler Robinson went to the sheriff’s office. But when 2 News asked the Washington County Sheriff’s Office to show the footage, the office said the video does not exist. They told 2 News that Robinson never entered the jail area.Later, when asked again for any surveillance video of Tyler Robinson walking into the sheriff’s office, the office said the footage was no longer available because the 30-day period had passed. Candace Owens reacted strongly to this and shared her thoughts on her X account.Candace Owens posted on X on November 19 and said the missing footage makes no sense. She wrote; “you honestly cannot make this up…Footage of Tyler Robinson turning himself into police does not exist. The footage simply does not exist anymore or…maybe it never existed in the first place. You decide!.”She told her followers to decide for themselves. This post came after 2 News shared responses from the sheriff’s office saying they had “no records” because Tyler Robinson “did not go to or enter the jail area.”Candace Owens has been talking a lot about Charlie Kirk’s death in the past few weeks. She said in an interview with Myron Gaines on YouTube that a Turning Point USA staff member got a text message from Charlie Kirk the day before he died. She said the message said, “They are going to kill me.” Owens said Charlie Kirk was not talking about the trans lobby when he wrote that message.Candace Owens then shared more of her thoughts. She said she does not like the silence from Turning Point USA employees. She said she knows for sure that one staff member has the message from Charlie Kirk. She said she will not let anyone “emotionally manipulate” her into stopping her questions. She also said Charlie Kirk knew he would “die young” and felt she would be the only one to defend him.Candace Owens added that she believes his death was a “military hit.” She also said some people inside Turning Point USA knew about it and worked toward it. The missing video has now become a major part of her concerns. She says the questions will only grow because the sheriff’s office also confirmed the footage was not sent to any other agency.Also Read: Candace Owens Drops Explosive Claim On Charlie Kirk's Assassination With Shocking Twist About Tyler Robinson Fingerprints",Candace owens has spoken out after new reports said there is no video of tyler robinson walking into the washington county sheriff’s office after the death of charlie kirk.

His comments align with a broader campaign to restrict H-1B visas, as he claims that only those born in the U.S.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





Nikki Haley’s son stirred a row after saying naturalised citizens in the United States should not be allowed to hold public office. His comments come at a time when he is already under fire for calling for a complete ban on H-1B visas.The 24-year-old Indian-origin said in an interview that growing up in America is the “biggest part of understanding” the country and argued that only those born in the US should be eligible for elected positions. The comments were made during a conversation with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, who himself has been facing attacks from Democrats accusing him of working for Israel and promoting an extreme right agenda.Nalin had already caused a stir earlier this month when he told Fox News that the H-1B programme disadvantages Americans entering the job market. “We are seeing kids graduate with six figures in debt and not having a job to show for it,” he said. “My main friend group graduated with great degrees from great schools. It's been a year and a half since graduation. Not one of them has a job.”He claimed that the presence of foreign workers has worsened the situation, and in his interview with Carlson said that the US should stop giving university admission to immigrants, adding that ‘America First’ is the only motto people should follow.He also alleged that some of the students are ""spies"" from other countries and the government should limit the influx of foreigners.The elite youngster defended his hardline position despite criticism from Democrats and the Indian-American community. “I mean, they shouldn't be [surprised] because I've seen how it's affected my friends and those around me. At the end of the day, my loyalty is to America,” he said.He doubled down on his position, saying, “We need to get rid of the foreign worker visas. We need to ban H-1B visas. And we need to punish companies that are not putting American workers first.”Moreover, Nalin’s comments come at a time when the H-1B issue is already highly sensitive, with Trump himself softening his stance by saying the US lacks talent and needs skilled foreign workers to fill positions in areas such as tech and defence. The MAGA base is currently split, with one side supporting Nalin’s “America First, America only” view, including figures like Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, while other conservatives argue that the US is in urgent need of foreign workers and cannot afford to end the H-1B programme for the sake of the country's economy.Nalin is the son of Nikki Haley, who is a former US Ambassador to the UN and former governor of South Carolina.",Nikki haley's son says naturalised citizens should not be allowed to hold public office. 24-year-old indian-origin said growing up in america is the ‘biggest part of understanding’ the country.

Gen Z demonstrators returned to the streets of Nepal’s Bara district on Thursday, reigniting tensions for a second straight day as clashes with police broke out early in the morning.With unrest intensifying in Simara, local authorities imposed a curfew from 1.00 pm to 8.00 pm (local time) in an effort to contain the situation after Wednesday’s confrontation between the youths and CPN-UML cadres.""Curfew has been reimposed following the clash with the police to bring the situation under control,"" assistant chief district officer Chhabiraman Subedi was quoted as saying by ANI.Tensions in Bara have been escalating since Wednesday, after UML (Unified Marxist Leninist) leaders prepared to visit the district ahead of the March 5, 2026 elections. The unrest has raised concerns among experts, who point to the fragile security situation, with hundreds of inmates still at large and a comparable number of weapons missing following the September uprising.The situation intensified when Gen Z supporters were injured in a confrontation at Simara Chowk near the airport, prompting the group to file a complaint against six UML cadres.Gen Z leader Samrat Upadhyay, 21, a resident of Simara in Bara, said that a group of 10–12 youths had gathered peacefully when CPN-UML cadres allegedly attacked them, leaving seven injured, including himself.""Thus, our demand is simple – arrest Mahesh Basnet and UML cadres who launched a brutal attack on us today, injuring at least seven of us. Bara will remain close until our demands are met,"" Upadhyay was quoted as saying by The Himalayan Times.Police later detained Ward Chair Dhan Bahadur Shrestha of Ward 2 and Ward Chair Kaimudin Ansari of Ward 6 of Jeetpursimara Sub-metropolitan City in connection with the earlier clashes.As violence escalated near Simara Airport, police fired tear gas to disperse protestors, leading authorities to temporarily suspend airport operations.The agitated Gen Z protesters have accused the police of failing to apprehend those named in their complaint related to Wednesday’s clash. Sushila Karki , the former chief justice now serving as interim prime minister following the September uprising, urged all political actors to “refrain from unwanted political provocation” and place their trust in the democratic process ahead of the March 5, 2026 elections.In a statement issued late Wednesday, Karki said, “I have directed the Home Administration and security agencies to work with utmost restraint and preparation to maintain peace and order.”She added that her priority is to “ensure the safe movement of leaders of all political parties, and create a fair and fear-free environment for the elections.”Nepal remains in a fragile political transition following the September regime change, when nationwide protests forced then–prime minister and UML chairman KP Oli to resign.The two-day uprising left 76 people dead across the country. What began as anger over a government-imposed social media ban quickly expanded into a wider revolt driven by years of economic stagnation and entrenched corruption in the nation of 30 million.Demonstrators torched parliament, courts and government offices, ultimately toppling the 73-year-old four-time premier. Karki, also 73, was appointed interim prime minister to guide the country toward fresh elections.","Gen z demonstrators returned to the streets of nepal’s bara district on thursday, reigniting tensions for a second straight day.
