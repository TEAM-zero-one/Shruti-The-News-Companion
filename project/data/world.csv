The penguin walked away quietly. But what was it trying to say?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-penguin-walked-away-quietly-but-what-was-it-trying-to-say/articleshow/127803414.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. The internet loves noise, but this time it fell in love with silence. A short video went viral: a lone penguin walking away from its colony, not toward the sea, not toward its companions, but straight toward the frozen mountains of Antarctica. No drama. Just a steady, deliberate walk into white nothingness. Memes followed, as they always do. Even the White House posted one where the American President escorts the penguin to Greenland. Social media crowned it the nihilist penguin . Laughter spread, but beneath it lay recognition. This penguin wasn’t protesting. It wasn’t rebelling. It wasn’t asking to be saved. It was simply walking away. And that quiet exit felt deeply familiar, especially to Gen Z—a generation tired of performing happiness, exhausted by constant comparison, crushed by the pressure to prove that life is “working out”. Somewhere inside, many whispered the same thought the penguin seemed to carry: Enough is enough. What many forgot — or never knew — was that this was not a new moment. The footage came from a 2007 documentary by Werner Herzog , titled ‘Encounters at the end of the world’. At the time, the scene passed quietly, almost uneasily, without commentary or conclusion. It was neither analysed nor celebrated. The internet was not yet ready for it. Two decades later, in an age of burnout and quiet quitting, the clip resurfaced and suddenly felt uncannily current, as though the penguin had been walking all this time to meet us here. From a Western philosophical lens, the label came easily: nihilism. The word itself comes from nihil , Latin for nothing. Nihilism argues that life has no inherent meaning, no objective values, and no moral truths beyond human invention. It emerged in modern Western thought, especially in the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, who saw it as a dangerous vacuum left by the collapse of religion and tradition. For Nietzsche, nihilism was a crisis, not a destination. Closely allied is existentialism, articulated by thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Simone de Beauvoir. Existentialism claims that humans are not born with purpose; we exist first and define ourselves later through choice. Meaning is not given; it is made. Everyone saw the solitary walk of the penguin to be in synchronisation with western philosophical ideas that inherently indicated purposelessness. But here is where the Eastern lens gently interrupts the Western conclusion. Indian philosophy talks about renunciation. At first glance, nihilism and renunciation seem similar. But nihilism often carries a bleak tone, disillusionment after belief collapses. Renunciation, or vairāgya , begins not in emptiness but in insight. The world is not denied; it is understood as transient. Suffering does not arise from existence itself, but from clinging. The renunciate does not walk away in despair, but in clarity. There is freedom here, not apathy; compassion, not cynicism. Thiruvalluvar captures this radical lightness with stunning economy. In Kural 345, from the chapter on renunciation, he writes: Matrum thodarpaadu evankol pirapparukkal Utraarkku udambum migai. “For those who have renounced, even the body itself is a burden; what more could they desire?” This is where the penguin begins to look different. Perhaps it is not rejecting life. Maybe it is stepping out of the noise. Perhaps it is not a nihilist at all, but an accidental symbol of letting go.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

Final ops on to target ‘Big 4’ as Naxal-free deadline nears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/final-ops-on-to-target-big-4-as-naxal-free-deadline-nears/articleshow/127811988.cms,".

NEW DELHI: As the March 31, 2026 deadline for making the country ""Naxal-free"" approaches, the security forces are in the final leg of intelligence-based operations to get the remaining 'Big Four' of the apex CPI(Maoist) leadership -- three politburo-cum-central committee members and one central committee member -- and an estimated ""300-350 regular, uniformed cadres of concern"" still out there in the jungles.""Time is running out for these leaders, and full-time cadres spread across Chhattisgarh (around 200-250) and totalling no more than 10-20 each in Telangana, Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra. They must choose between eschewing the path of violence and being confronted by the security forces in their hideouts across the Indravati national park area, small pockets of Jharkhand, and the inter-state borders of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra and Telangana,” Bastar range Inspector General P Sundarraj told TOI.There are only four surviving politburo (PB) and central committee (CC) members, of which two are not known to be active. Thippiri Tirupathi @ Devji is the de facto No. 1, though not formally anointed as the CPI(Maoist) general secretary. Former general secretary Muppalla Laxman Rao @ Ganpathy is in his late seventies and supposedly ailing. Misir Besra, who is heading the CPI(Maoist) Eastern Regional Bureau since his predecessor Prashant Bose's arrest in 2021 and is the only non-Telugu face in PB, is currently operating in the Saranda forests of Jharkhand, where his aide and CC member Patiram Manjhi @ Anal Da was killed only a few days ago.The forces are already on Besra's trail. Malla Raji Reddy @ Sangram, who is in charge of Maoist operations in Odisha, is not known to have been involved in any active operations for quite some time.Though some state police have a 5th CC member — Asim Mondal — in their ‘active’ list, opinion is divided on whether he indeed is part of the CC.Devji, though currently No. 1 in CP( Moist), is debilitated by the series of killings and surrenders by his PB/CC colleagues, senior commanders and armed cadres in the past year or so. ""There have been multiple public appeals for surrender, including at the political level, but Devji may prefer to go down fighting, holding on to Maoist ideology,"" said a senior officer.As a senior MHA functionary had told TOI earlier, the “end” of Left-wing extremism may not mean there will be no incidents of Maoist violence. “But such incidents will be isolated and dealt with at the police station level. CPI(Maoist) will no longer have an organised, cadre-based strength operating across states,” said the officer.Between January 1, 2025, and January 22, 2026, a dozen central committee members, including general secretary and politburo member Basavaraju, were neutralised by the counter-Naxal forces, and five opted for surrender. There are still two senior commanders -- Pappa Rao and Prabhakar, both members of the Dandkarenya special zonal committee (DKSZC) — on the loose. They are said to be active in the inter-state border of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, covering Kanker, Gadchiroli and south of Indravati.The flood of Maoist surrenders last year, including by PB and CC member Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu; CC members Chandranna and Sujata in Telangana; and Ramder and Rupesh in Chhattisgarh, along with the huge dent in Naxal arsenal with the recovery of 698 weapons and 915 IEDs in Chhattisgarh alone over the past year, have left the Maoists a depleted army on ventilator support.","There are only four surviving politburo (pb) and central committee (cc) members, of which two are not known to be active.

"Why has gold and silver prices fallen? Brutal selloff! Gold, silver prices crash in exceptionally volatile session - what’s causing the sudden dip?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brutal-selloff-gold-silver-prices-crash-in-exceptionally-volatile-session-whats-causing-the-sudden-dip/articleshow/127793760.cms,"Representative AI image

ETFs crashes 14%

'2008-crisis levels'

What now

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold and silver futures saw a sharp decline on Friday as traders locked in profits following Thursday's record-breaking rally. Both Gold and silver futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange ended Friday’s session with steep losses, retreating sharply as traders booked profits following a powerful rally earlier in the week that had driven both metals to new all-time highs. Bearish global markets and a stronger US dollar also influenced the sentiment. It was one of the steepest single-day fall for both gold and silver prices in the past few months in futures trade. Gold and silver exchange traded funds or ETFS have also dropped up to 20% n the domestic markets.Gold futures expiring on February 5, 2026, slid by as much as Rs 11,000, or 6.5%, to settle at Rs 1,59,984 per 10 grams. Silver contracts for March 5, 2026, delivery saw an even steeper decline, plunging Rs 68,000, or 16.6%, to Rs 3,34,503 per kg - going below the Rs 3.5 lakh per kg mark.The dramatic shift came after both metals had achieved historic highs the previous day. Silver had peaked at Rs 4,20,048 per kg before settling lower, while gold had touched Rs 1,80,779 per 10 grams. The pullback was particularly noticeable in international markets, with Comex gold falling 2.2% to USD 5,236.74 per ounce.""After hitting record highs, gold and silver prices dropped as a rebound in the US dollar triggered aggressive profit-taking,"" said Manav Modi from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, as quoted by PTI.The dollar index bounced back from recent lows of 96, while the USD/INR pair hit a record high.The World Gold Council has raised concerns about India's future gold imports. They expect a decline in jewelry demand from the world's second-largest consumer due to record-high prices. The council also noted that central bank purchases slowed in Q4 2025, though strong investor interest helped offset this decrease.Despite the current dip, gold is still headed for its best monthly performance since the 1980s. Silver, too, remains impressive with a potential January gain exceeding 50%, its strongest monthly showing ever. Market expert Jigar Trivedi attributed this to ""a weak US dollar and shifting US monetary policy outlook.""Looking ahead, traders are turning their attention to upcoming US Producer Price Index numbers, which will offer new insights into monetary policy direction. The recent price movements highlight the ongoing impact of economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions on precious metals markets.Gold and silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also plunged by up to 14 per cent on Friday as investors rushed to book profits after precious metals retreated sharply from record highs, prompting debate over whether the correction offers a buying opportunity or signals the end of the powerful rally.The fall followed a surge in January, when silver jumped 56 per cent, putting it on course for its strongest monthly performance on record, while gold logged its biggest monthly gain since January 1980, rising more than 20 per cent in dollar terms.Silver-focused ETFs led the losses. Zerodha Silver ETF and SBI Silver ETF fell 14 per cent, while Nippon India Silver ETF dropped 14 per cent and Kotak Silver ETF declined 12 per cent. Gold ETFs also slipped, with Nippon India Gold ETF down 10 per cent and ICICI Prudential Gold ETF losing 6 per cent. ICICI Prudential Silver ETF fell 7 per cent.The domestic selloff tracked global markets, where spot silver slid 5.7 per cent to $109.55 an ounce after touching a record $121.64 a day earlier. Spot gold fell 3.9 per cent to $5,183.21 per ounce, after dropping as much as 5 per cent from Thursday’s peak of $5,594.82.The sharp reversal came after US President Donald Trump said he would soon announce his pick to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with reports pointing to former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a likely candidate.“So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar, and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,” said KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer, as quoted by ET.Expectations of a more hawkish Fed unsettled investors who had been betting on looser monetary policy. “Gold and silver show very high volatility, and prices dip from record high levels amid heavy profit-taking; safe-haven buying could support prices,” said Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart.Jain noted that both metals had ended the previous session higher in global and domestic futures markets before surging to fresh records in early trade, only to face intense profit-taking at elevated levels.Despite the selloff, the broader trend remains strong. Silver is set for its ninth consecutive monthly gain, while gold is heading for a sixth straight monthly advance. “Silver fell about 4% toward $110/oz, retreating from all-time highs as investors locked in profits following the record rally, while, rebound in the dollar added pressure on the metal,” said Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst at Indusind Securities. “Despite the pullback, silver is on track to gain more than 50% in January, marking its best monthly performance on record and extending a winning streak to nine consecutive months,"" he added.The rally has been supported by persistent geopolitical and economic uncertainty, strong safe-haven demand, and a weaker dollar. Trivedi added that “silver’s surge was further supported by a tight physical market, with both investment and industrial demand hitting record levels.”An industry commentary on the global capital markets platform The Kobeissi Letter made a remark that vent viral on how gold's volatality has reached ""2008-crisis levels"".""This is absolutely insane: Gold just posted its largest daily swing in market cap in history, at $5.5 TRILLION. Between 9:30 AM ET and 10:25 AM ET, gold lost -$3.2 trillion in market cap, or -$58 billion PER MINUTE. Then, between 10:25 AM ET and 4:00 PM ET, gold added back +$2.3 trillion. That's over 3 TIMES the market cap of Bitcoin swung in 6.5 hours, or ~$850 billion per hour,"" it said on X.Further commenting on its significance, it added, ""We are witnessing one of the most historic trading opportunities of all time. Gold's volatility is above 2008 levels.""Outlooks for both gold and silver for the year point to strong long-term support but elevated volatility. Major banks such as UBS, Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale remain bullish on gold, citing safe-haven demand, geopolitical tensions and portfolio diversification, according to ET. Silver forecasts are more divided. Some, such as Citigroup, see significant upside driven by structural demand and supply deficits, while stretigists Marko Kolanovic warn that prices could correct sharply if speculative positions unwind.However, across both metals, analysts agree that price swings will remain a defining feature, shaped by macro uncertainty, monetary policy, liquidity conditions and shifting investor positioning.",Both gold and silver futures on the multi commodity exchange ended friday’s session with steep losses. Bearish global markets and a stronger us dollar also influenced the sentiment.

Sanju Samson headache for Team India | Is Ishan Kishan the right choice?

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has softened his earlier stance on calling for a boycott of the upcoming T20 World Cup, admitting that the moment for such a move has passed. While ruling out a full withdrawal, the former wicketkeeper-batsman floated a different form of protest, suggesting Pakistan could take part in the tournament but decline to play fixtures against India. He stressed, however, that any such call would have to come from the Pakistani government rather than the cricket board.“If the government says we won’t play against India, the ICC will have to accept it,” Latif said. “If they don’t, that’s where the real confrontation begins.” Asked what would happen if India and Pakistan met in the final, Latif replied, “nahi khelenge’ (we won’t play)”.Latif, who had earlier urged Pakistan to boycott the World Cup to challenge what he described as India’s influence over global cricket administration, said on Wednesday that the opportunity slipped away when the Pakistan Cricket Board did not act immediately after Bangladesh were excluded from the event.“The time for a strike has passed,” Latif said on the YouTube channel CaughtBehind. “Every decision has a timing. When the iron is hot, that’s when you strike. That time was last week during the ICC meeting.”Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland after 14 votes went against their participation, with the ICC citing logistical and contractual issues. Pakistan backed Bangladesh in the vote but eventually went along with the final decision.“We showed our support. We voted for them. That chapter is over,” Latif said. “If we boycott now, it won’t have the same impact.”Pakistan chairman Mohsin Naqvi had hinted earlier this week that the board could consider a principled stand similar to Bangladesh’s, but no formal announcement followed. The T20 World Cup will go ahead with Pakistan participating under a hybrid model, with matches involving India scheduled at neutral venues until 2027.",Former pakistan captain rashid latif has softened his earlier stance on calling for a boycott of the upcoming t20 world cup.

NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has sought to reassure the public over India’s latest Nipah virus outbreak, saying the risk of spread remains “low” and that there is no need for travel or trade restrictions following the confirmation of two cases in West Bengal.The cases were reported from North 24 Parganas district, an area that has seen Nipah outbreaks in the past.Both patients are 25-year-old nurses—a woman and a man—working at the same private hospital in Barasat. They developed initial symptoms in the last week of December 2025, which rapidly progressed to neurological complications. The two were placed in isolation in early January.In an update shared on its website, following confirmation of the cases, WHO said an extensive public health response was activated. Authorities identified, traced, monitored, and tested 196 contacts linked to the two patients. All contacts were asymptomatic and tested negative for Nipah virus infection. As of 27 January, no additional cases were been detected. “ The likelihood of spread to other Indian states or internationally is considered low. ”WHO assessed the risk at the sub-national level in West Bengal as moderate due to the presence of fruit bat reservoirs in border areas and the possibility of sporadic spillover.However, the agency said the national, regional, and global risk remains low.“Based on current evidence, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions,” said the agency.The national government deployed an outbreak response team to West Bengal to work closely with state authorities. Enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control measures, and field investigations are underway. WHO said coordinated efforts between central and state health teams have enabled timely containment of the outbreak.""Nipah virus is a zoonotic disease transmitted mainly from bats to humans, sometimes through contaminated food or close contact. With no licensed vaccine or treatment currently available, early detection, supportive care, and strong infection prevention measures remain essential,"" said WHO on it's website.Historically, Nipah outbreaks in the WHO South-East Asia Region have been limited to Bangladesh and India, occurring sporadically or in small clusters. Human-to-human transmission is rare and usually confined to health-care settings or close family contacts, with no known instances of international spread through travel.This is the seventh documented Nipah outbreak in India and the third in West Bengal, following earlier outbreaks in Siliguri in 2001 and Nadia in 2007. The affected districts border Bangladesh, where Nipah outbreaks occur almost annually.WHO said several vaccine candidates are under development, but early supportive care, including intensive treatment for severe respiratory or neurological complications, remains critical for improving survival.",The world health organisation (who) has sought to reassure the public over india’s latest nipah virus outbreak.

'India’s EU Trade Deal Marks Global Leap': Piyush Goyal Targets Congress For Missing The Bus

‘Congress pushed India towards China-centric pacts’

'Congress FTAs failed'

Goyal slams Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday took a sharp swipe at the Congress over its criticism of the India–EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) using a colloquial phrase, ""angoor khatte hain"", likening the party's reaction to the story of sour grapes.Speaking to news agency ANI, Goyal said, ""It's like angoor khatte hai (story of sour grapes). Discussions started in 2006, launched in 2007, abandoned in 2013. They didn't even have the courage or the will to finalise an agreement. Out of fear, the UPA and Congress governments could never take decisive action.""""And Jairam Ramesh himself is considered anti-development, you've seen it. As an environment minister, he stalled the country's development journey. The Congress party's track record is that bad,"" he added.Goyal's remarks came in response to Congress leader Jairam Ramesh’s criticism of the India–EU FTA.In a post on X earlier this week, Ramesh said the agreement was ""the biggest trade opening India has given to any trade partner"", noting that tariff relief covers over 96% of EU exports to India.""This hugely-hyped FTA… is expected to double India's imports from the EU.Its impact on India's trade deficit will have to be monitored closely,"" Ramesh wrote.He also flagged concerns over the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), saying, ""The Modi Government’s failure to secure an exemption for India’s aluminium and steel-makers from the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is one of @INCIndia’s key concerns regarding the FTA.""Ramesh said India’s aluminium and steel exports to the EU had already fallen from $7 billion to $5 billion and could decline further after CBAM comes into force on January 1, 2026.""Over time, CBAM will also expand to include other categories of India’s industrial exports and can effectively nullify any gains India secures from the FTA,"" he added, also raising concerns over strict EU health and product safety norms acting as non-tariff barriers. He further said the EU was seeking privileged access to India’s services sector, including financial services and maritime transport.Hitting back, Piyush Goyal accused the Congress of endangering India’s economic interests by pushing for trade agreements with China.""Friends like Jairam Ramesh and parties like the Congress were pushing India to enter into an FTA with China,"" he said, referring to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).""I want to ask them directly: How did you even think of letting India enter RCEP, which was effectively an FTA between China and India? How did you have the courage to put India at risk?"" Goyal asked.""This was a grave mistake by Congress. Congress must answer the people about how they were willing to harm India's interests through an FTA with China. This is the Congress track record,"" he added.Goyal further contrasted the India–EU FTA with agreements signed under previous Congress-led governments.""The Congress government had signed an FTA with Japan and Korea. That FTA was so bad that our exports to those countries haven't increased at all,"" he said.""The products on which they gave us duty concessions are not even reaching those markets, while their imports into India have doubled,"" he added.Defending the current agreement, Goyal said, ""Here, 99% of everything exported from India will have zero duty. We have negotiated balanced FTAs. We have even signed FTAs with developed countries on our own terms.""""But unlike the Congress government, we don't sign FTAs with countries that compete with us or those with lower labour costs that would harm our manufacturers,"" he said.Goyal also slammed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s remark that the Indian economy was ""dead"".""The world's fastest-growing large economy… Today, no other economy is growing at 7–8% except India,"" he said. He highlighted India’s progress under the current government, citing poverty reduction, startup growth and infrastructure expansion.""25 crore people have come out of poverty, the youth are becoming job creators through startups, infrastructure is expanding across the country. People's lives are improving, incomes are rising, and at the same time taxes are being reduced,"" he said.""Congress's negative mindset can no longer stop it. That mindset kept India backward for decades,"" Goyal added.Calling the India–EU FTA a landmark achievement, Goyal said, ""This FTA between the EU and India places India at the high table of international geopolitics.""""Under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India has gained recognition and importance across the world,"" he said, adding that India is now seen as a key trading partner and strategic ally.""Today, India is sought after as a trading partner and strategic ally by developing nations across the globe,"" Goyal said.""This FTA with 27 countries… allows for mutual complementarity. Together, we become a force multiplier. That is the significance of this agreement,"" he added.",Commerce and industry minister piyush goyal took a sharp swipe at the congress over its criticism of the india–eu free trade agreement (fta) he likens the party's reaction to the story of sour grapes.

‘Some Historians, Politicians Tried To Whitewash History Of Invaders’: PM Modi Hits Out In Somnath

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) on Friday strongly criticised former Vice President Hamid Ansari over his remarks describing Sultan of the Ghaznavid Empire Mahmud of Ghazni as an Indian. The party accused him of distorting history and attempting to “whitewash” the brutal invasions of India.Ansari, who served as Vice President during the Congress-led UPA governments from 2007 to 2012 and again from 2012 to 2017, had said that figures commonly described as foreign invaders in textbooks were, in fact, Indians.“Those whom we describe in our textbooks as foreign invaders—whether it is the Lodhis or Ghazni—were all Indian plunderers. They did not come from outside,” Ansari said.Reacting sharply, BJP National Spokesperson CR Kesavan questioned the Congress party’s position on Ansari’s statement and accused it of attempting to sanitise violent episodes from history.In a post on X, Kesavan said the remarks were “shocking” and recalled that Ansari had been the Congress-led UPA’s choice for Vice President twice.“Ghazni was not a foreign invader, he was Indian'! Indeed shocking remarks by former Vice President Shri Hamid Ansari ji, who was the Congress led UPA govt's choice for the post of Vice President, not once but twice. Does the Congress leadership and Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi agree with such whitewashing of mercenary brutal raids as mere domestic acts, which demolished Hindu temples and murdered thousands?” Kesavan said.He alleged that Islamic invasions beginning in the early eighth century had systematically targeted Hindu religious sites.Kesavan further said Mahmud of Ghazni carried out 17 raids into India in the 11th century, during which he claimed major temples such as those in Mathura and Somnath were attacked.He also linked the issue to the Congress party’s historical opposition to the reconstruction of the Somnath temple.Shehzad Poonawala, also attacked the Congress over Ansari’s comments, accusing the party of consistently “eulogising Hindu haters” and downplaying atrocities committed against Hindus.Speaking to ANI, Poonawala said, “The Congress ecosystem always eulogises Hindu haters. Whoever attacks or commits atrocities on Hindus is always subjected to whitewashing by the Congress ecosystem. Now, Hamid Ansari says that Ghazni was not a cruel person, that he was just an Indian. It shows the Hindu hatred they have in their mind.”Poonawala also expanded his criticism to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of disrespecting constitutional institutions and national traditions by skipping key official events.“‘Sena and Samvidhan ka apmaan is Congress’s pehchaan’. Rahul Gandhi feels his family is above the Constitution and the Army. For him, ‘parivar tantra’ is more important than ‘samvidhan tantra’,” he alleged.","Bjp national spokesperson cr kesavan accused the congress of attempting to sanitise violent episodes from history.

Blatant lie: Gaurav Gogoi slams Assam CM Himanta Sarma over ‘Miya Muslims’ remarks; alleges misuse of SC's name,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/blatant-lie-gaurav-gogoi-slams-assam-cm-himanta-sarma-over-miya-muslims-remarks-alleges-misuse-of-scs-name/articleshow/127804280.cms,"Photo credit: ANI

Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, who represents Assam ’s Jorhat constituency, on Friday sharply criticised chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over his “Miya Muslims” remarks, accusing him of “misusing” the name of the Supreme Court to justify his statements and calling his claims a “blatant lie.”In a post on X, Gogoi described Sarma’s politics as driven by “dishonesty and shamelessness” and alleged that the chief minister falsely attributed certain words to the apex court in the Sarbananda Sonowal case.“Dishonesty and shamelessness define Himanta Biswa Sarma's politics. He has stooped so low that he is misusing the name of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. He claims to rely on the Hon'ble Court's 'own words' from the case of Sarbananda Sonowal. This is a blatant lie,” Gogoi wrote in his X post.He added, “The language he quotes is not the Supreme Court's. The Hon'ble Court neither authored the said words nor adopted it. To pass off an executive report as a judicial pronouncement is a deliberate contempt.”Gogoi further said that a chief minister attributing words incorrectly to the Supreme Court amounts to a violation of constitutional norms and urged the court to take note.“For a chief minister holding a constitutional office to falsely attribute words to the Hon'ble Supreme Court is not just contemptuous, it is an assault on constitutional propriety and institutional integrity. The Hon'ble Supreme Court may take cognisance of the remarks of Himanta Biswa Sarma that violate the Constitution and falsely attribute to the Court,” he said.The Congress MP’s remarks came after Sarma defended his comments on “Miya Muslim” in the context of alleged Bangladeshi infiltrators and said the Supreme Court itself had expressed concern over the influx of immigrants into Assam.Responding to criticism from the opposition, Sarma told reporters, “Those who have come from Bangladesh call themselves 'Miya'. I did not give them that name; it is they who call themselves that,” ANI reported.He added, “They only said to call them Miya. They wrote Miya poetry. If we say 'miya, miya', they can also call us 'Assamese, Assamese'; and what is the problem with that?”In a separate post on X, Sarma said critics should read the Supreme Court’s observations on Assam and illegal migration.“Those who are attacking me for my remarks on ""Miyan""--a word used in Assam in the context of Bangladeshi Muslim illegal migration--should pause and read what the Supreme Court of India itself has said about Assam. This is not my language, not my imagination, and not political exaggeration,” he said.",Congress mp gaurav gogoi accuses himanta biswa sarma of misusing the name of the supreme court to justify his statements.

My Take 5 (Edition 63): The week that was in international affairs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/my-take-5-edition-63-the-week-that-was-in-international-affairs/articleshow/127805483.cms,"Image: ANI

Update

Welcome back to another edition of My Take 5, your weekly round-up of top international news. This week we are covering developments in Syria between Damascus and the Kurds, the signing of the India-EU FTA, Russia-Ukraine war negotiations, China’s purging of its top general, and EU’s recognition of Morocco’s position on the Moroccan Sahara. So, let’s get to it.Syria focus: In significant developments in Syria over the past two weeks, the transition government of Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus launched offensives against Kurdish forces in that country’s north and east. The conflict began in Aleppo and then spread out, leading to Kurdish forces retreating from several towns. Importantly, many of these towns had Kurdish SDF run prison camps hosting former ISIS fighters. The US, which has been an ally of the Kurdish SDF, transported many of those fighters to Iraq. But a significant number of former ISIS fighters were also released by Damascus’s forces.There are two points here. First, the conflict between Damascus and the Kurds practically ends efforts to integrate Kurdish forces into the new Syrian army and governance structures as per an agreement last year. I interviewed senior Kurdish-Syrian politician Foza Yusif of the Democratic Union Party, the leading party among Syrian Kurds, on this subject. You can watch the interview here: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/international/turkey-instigating-syrian-govt-kurdish-politician-slams-u-s-for-damascus-vs-sdf-fighting-watch/amp_videoshow/127467458.cms Yusif was clear that Turkey is instigating al-Sharaa and the Damascus interim government to carry out the attacks against the Kurds.The latter are now left with no choice but to call for a general mobilisation to defend themselves, even as a fragile 15-day truce was announced.Second, there is a larger strategic game being played between Damascus, Turkey, Russia and US. Al-Sharaa is in Moscow to meet Putin as I write this. Moscow is using this meeting to secure its two major military bases in Syria, Hmeimim airbase and the Tartus naval base. Al-Sharaa, despite expectations that he would kick out the Russians completely from Syria after the fall of Assad in 2024, hasn’t done so. Turkey, which is essentially controlling al-Sharaa, wants to neutralise the Syrian Kurds of Rojava. So, Russia, despite sheltering Assad after his ouster, is trying to strike a grand bargain: allow Damascus and Turkey to move against the Kurds in exchange for retaining its military presence in Syria. Earlier this week, Russia also evacuated its forces from Qamishli airport in Kurdish-held northeast Syria, possibly to facilitate Damascus’s oncoming assault against the Kurds.Turkey will be very happy with this. Moscow may already have reached a tacit understanding with Ankara whereby the latter doesn’t create problems for it in the Black Sea in the context of the war in Ukraine where the Europeans have now aggressively started targeting Russian shadow fleet ships. Meanwhile, the US is waiting to see how things pan out. But if it waits longer to deter Damascus from attacking the Kurds, it will lose a huge strategic asset in Syria. True, Washington might think it can deal directly with al-Sharaa. But it should remember that it was the Kurds that fought and defeated ISIS. Not standing with the Kurds now would be a strategic blunder.: At the time of publishing, a deal has been struck between the Syrian interim government and the Kurds, laying out a phased integration of Kurdish forces into the new Syrian army. This will be followed by integration of Kurdish governance structures into Syrian state institutions. But we have been here before. An integration deal between Damascus and the Kurds in March last year went nowhere. Also, already there appears to be some disagreement with the new integration plan – Damascus wants Kurds to join the Syrian military on individual basis, but Kurds favour joining as complete brigades with four such Kurdish brigades being planned. Let’s see if the new integration plan actually works or just serves as a temporary reprieve in tensions.India-EU FTA: India and EU finally concluded their FTA after 18 years of negotiations to produce what is being described as the mother of all trade deals. The deal will either eliminate or substantially reduce tariffs on more than 99% of India’s exports by trade value. Many of these are labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, footwear, tea, spices, gems and jewellery, and marine products that were hit by US tariffs. Similarly, EU gets duty-free or lower-tariff access for 97.5% of its exports by value. These will include wine, beer, olive oil, confectionary, European cars, machinery and pharmaceuticals. Of course, the deal has to be signed off on by the EU Council and EU Parliament. That process might take up to a year. There could also be some hurdles as seen with the recent trade deal between EU and the South American Mercosur group.However, the main import of the India-EU trade deal is strategic. Facing American tariffs and threats, New Delhi and Brussels have essentially signalled their defiance and independence to Washington with this deal. This is indeed welcome. Europe for far too long was complacent in the knowledge that the US will always have its back. Trump has shattered that illusion. EU now has to stand on its own feet, reinvigorate its own defence industry and make some smart strategic moves. This is precisely what it is doing with the FTA with India. The latter on its part is also slowly accepting the fact that it can’t perpetually mollycoddle its industries such as automobiles. It must open them up to competition, gain efficiency and compete globally.Overall, a diversified trade profile is any day better than relying on just a few markets. It took Trump to hammer home this truth. Both India and EU are better off for it.Russia-Ukraine war negotiations: Following the Davos summit last week, Ukraine, Russia and US have been engaging in a new round of talks to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. From the Ukrainian side, this round of talks and the Russian participants have appeared to be somewhat constructive. But the sticking points remain Russia’s unjustifiable demand that Ukraine give up all of its Donbas region, control over the now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power, and security guarantees for Ukraine. Russia has said it won’t accept foreign Nato-member troops in Ukraine after the war – UK and France are ready to send troops. But this would be a key pillar of Ukraine’s security guarantees. Without this how can Russia be deterred from carrying out another aggression against Ukraine in the future? It just doesn’t make sense, especially when Nato membership for Ukraine is off the table as per the US.Plus, why should Ukraine give up those territories in Donbas that it currently holds? All of these Russian demands suggest that Moscow is simply putting the entire burden of ending this war on Ukraine when it is itself the aggressor. There is no indication so far of any meaningful climbdown on Russia’s part.That said, as I write this, there are unconfirmed reports of a potential energy ceasefire between the two sides. Trump has also said that he spoke with Putin and asked for a week-long cessation of Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as temperatures are set to dip further next week – Putin has ostensibly agreed, but there is no confirmation of this as yet. Russia has been relentlessly targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure to deliberately heap misery on Ukrainian civilians in the middle of peak winter with sub-zero temperatures – Ukraine has responded by hitting Russian oil infrastructure. So, a pause will be welcome for Ukrainian civilians who are being subjected to Russia’s brutal weaponisation of winter. With another round of talks this weekend, one can only hope for a minor breakthrough.Xi purges top general: In another massive shakeup at the top echelons of the Chinese military, PLA’s top general and vice-chairman of China’s Central Military Commission (CMC) Zhang Youxia was purged along with the head of PLA’s joint operations, Liu Zhenli. This round of purge effectively hollows out the PLA’s top leadership. The CMC now has just two members – President Xi Jinping as chairman and Zhang Shengmin, PLA’s anti-corruption tsar. Critically, all top PLA generals with military experience have now been purged.Again, there can be two interpretations. First, Xi clearly saw a threat in Zhang, who was actually believed to be a close ally of the Chinese president. Officially he has been removed for violation of discipline – a Chinese euphemism for corruption. But there are rumours that he was leaking Chinese nuclear secrets to the Americans. This too may be a red herring and the actual reason could be that Zhang was planning a coup against Xi. After all, he was senior and influential enough to take this risk.Second, whatever the reason, the whole episode makes Xi look bad. If it was an attempted coup, that means divisions within the Chinese leadership. If it was corruption, that means Xi’s anti-corruption drive hasn’t succeeded even after a decade. And if Xi did this to achieve total control over the PLA, that shows insecurity and paranoia. Plus, there are now serious questions about the military preparedness of China. Without experienced generals, a Taiwan invasion is unlikely. Unless Xi is so desperate to get himself another term at the party congress next year that he is willing to surround himself with military yes-men and do that Taiwan invasion to unify domestic support. But he should know better – this strategy totally backfired for Putin in Ukraine. But given China’s economic size and global trade dominance, such unpredictability can only put the world on edge. Here’s the TOI editorial written by me on the subject this week: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/xiopolitics/ EU supports Morocco’s Sahara Autonomy Plan: In another big diplomatic victory for Morocco, the EU officially adopted a unified position supporting Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Moroccan Sahara. In a joint communique with Rabat, the European bloc agreed that “genuine autonomy could represent one of the most realistic solutions” for the long-running artificial dispute. It will be recalled that the Moroccan Sahara issue is a leftover baggage from Morocco’s colonial history. Even after Morocco gained full independence and reunified the Sahara through the historic Green March of 1975, different international players, led by Algeria, have used the Moroccan Sahara issue to strategically hem in Morocco. Algeria’s propping up of the Polisario Front separatist group and sustaining of the artificial Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic has been nothing but a strategic tool to prevent Morocco’s natural rise.But the other interesting point is EU’s changed position. Earlier, there wasn’t unanimity among EU members about the Sahara question. But today, faced with Trump’s tariff threats and bullying over Greenland, EU is willing to do more to have an independent, clear, consolidated position on foreign policy and strategic issues. This is welcome, just like the India-EU FTA mentioned above. Happily, on Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Sahara, EU’s and US’s positions now align. That’s a huge win for Rabat.","Syria focus: in significant developments in syria over the past two weeks, the transition government of ahmed al-sharaa in damascus launched offensives against kurdish forces in that country’s north and east.

'India will decide in line with international law': Palestine FM on Gaza Peace Board invitation for New Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-will-decide-in-line-with-international-law-palestine-fm-on-gaza-peace-board-invitation-for-new-delhi/articleshow/127799883.cms,"Varsen Aghabekian (PTI image)

Palestine’s foreign minister Varsen Aghabekian on Friday said that India would decide on joining the proposed Gaza “Board of Peace” in line with its own understanding of peace. She further stressed that any genuine effort to end the conflict should be welcomed.Speaking on the US-backed initiative announced by President Donald Trump, Aghabekian said, “India will decide in line with its understanding of peace, international law. Each country can decide on its own, and each country would look at its interests”.Aghabekian underlined that the participation in the proposed body should be guided by national priorities and respect for international norms.Welcoming diplomatic efforts to end the Gaza war, the Palestinian minister said that any attempt to forge peace was positive. At the same time, she cautioned against external pressure shaping global responses to the conflict.Commenting on Pakistan’s reported inclusion in the proposed body, Aghabekian said that Israel must stop dictating what is acceptable to the international community.She also flagged broader regional risks, observing that continued instability, including tensions between the United States and Iran, was a concern for all countries and had direct implications for Gaza and the wider West Asian region.The remarks come after Trump announced the formation of a “Board of Peace” to oversee post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza, calling it a key step in the second phase of a US-backed plan to end the conflict.In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the body as the “greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled”.According to the White House, the Board of Peace will function as a new international organisation and transitional governing authority for Gaza, focusing on governance reform, reconstruction, economic investment and long-term stability.India has been formally invited to join the proposed board. In a letter shared by US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, Trump said the initiative was part of a broader 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” to end the Gaza conflict, first announced in September last year and later endorsed by the UN Security Council through Resolution 2803 in November.New Delhi had received an invitation to join the initiative but has not officially accepted or rejected the offer.Alongside the Board of Peace, Washington has announced the formation of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic body—the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza—which will manage day-to-day governance once the war ends.The committee is expected to operate under the supervision of the proposed board. The plan also includes deploying an international stabilisation force and training selected Palestinian police units.Confirmed members of the Board of Peace include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special negotiator Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, US financier Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga and senior US National Security Council aide Robert Gabriel.A separate Gaza Executive Board will support implementation on the ground, with participation from international diplomats and regional representatives, including from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the United Arab Emirates.Apart from India, countries such as Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Albania and Cyprus have been invited. Pakistan has also confirmed receiving an invitation, with its foreign office saying that Islamabad would continue supporting international efforts for peace and security in Gaza.According to a Bloomberg report, a draft charter of the Trump-led Board of Peace proposes that countries contribute $1 billion to secure long-term membership, with the US president retaining authority over membership and final decision-making.",Varsen aghabekian said that india would decide in line with its understanding of peace.

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor on Friday dismissed speculation of a rift with the party, projecting bonhomie with the Congress high-command after meeting Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and party chief Mallikarjun Kharge The Thiruvananthapuram MP, who described Rahul and Kharge as “my two leaders”, said he would not leave the Congress and played down the row that followed the recent ""Kochi Mahapanchayat.""Tharoor presented a picture of unity ahead of the Kerala assembly polls, where the Congress-led UDF is aiming to dislodge the incumbent LDF government-led by Pinarayi Vijayan . He said he plans to campaign extensively across the state’s 140 constituencies.Speaking about his campaign plans in Kerala, Tharoor said, ""People seem to overlook the fact that in the last elections, I campaigned in 56 constituencies. That doesn’t change. I hope to add even more constituencies to that list this time. It is very important that we send the right message to voters and have an opportunity to make a significant impact on people’s lives.""The grand old party's MP Tharoor also lauded former party president Rahul Gandhi, calling him ""sincere"" and a ""strong voice"" on issues like communalism in country.He also added later, ""I see it in a positive way that one has an opportunity to discuss all issues very cordially and constructively in the spirit of camaraderie. We are all colleagues working together. These are my two leaders -- the Congress president and the leader of the opposition in my own House of Parliament. We are moving forward together in a very positive way.""Rejecting reports of discord within the party, Tharoor termed them “exaggerated” and said “all is good”.After his meeting with Rahul Gandhi and Kharge in Parliament on Wednesday, Tharoor shared a photograph of the three leaders, wrote, ""all is good"" and ""we are all on the same page.""Reflecting on criticism of his stand on certain issues, Tharoor said his views may have been perceived as pro-BJP by some, but insisted they were “pro-India.”Tharoor said that he has made it clear in the past as well that on some international matters, he does not like to talk about politics and instead prefers to speak about the country.""It is not something new, I have always said so,"" the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram told reporters here.A row had erupted last year over his comments on the India-Pakistan conflict and the diplomatic outreach after the Pahalgam attack. His comments were at variance with the Congress' stand and many party leaders took a swipe at him, questioning his intentions.Tharoor, while speaking to reporters, also admitted that a party member should not go against the party line.""I have always stood with the party in Parliament and therefore, there is no need to be concerned,"" he said.On being asked by reporters whether he can categorically state he will not leave the Congress party , Tharoor said, ""I can say that I am going to be in the Congress and that I am not going anywhere. I will be part of the poll campaign (in Kerala) and will work for the victory of the UDF.""""But, why is it that I am being asked to make such statements,"" he asked.Tharoor had been upset over the treatment meted out to him at a Kochi event recently and reported attempts by some leaders to sideline him in Kerala.",Tharoor presented a picture of unity ahead of the kerala assembly polls.

Congress Chief Kharge Demands Ban On RSS Citing Sardar Patel's 1948 Letter, BJP Hits Back

NEW DELHI: On the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh shared two historic letters from 1948, written by Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to Syama Prasad Mookerjee. The letters shared criticise the activities of Hindu Mahasabha and RSS.Ramesh took to social media platform X to share these pieces of history, alongside a link to Nehru's radio address from the night of Gandhi's assassination on January 30, 1948.In his letter, Nehru had said, ""Speeches were delivered that Mahatma Gandhi was an impediment and the sooner he died the better it would be for the country....The RSS has behaved in an even worse way and we have collected a mass of information about its very objectionable activities...""Ramesh's social media post included screenshots of both letters. Ramesh called these letters ""damning indictments of the self-declared custodians of nationalism."" ""And to think that there is a Lok Sabha MP wedded to that ideology and who was blessed by the PM himself, who said that he could not choose between Gandhi and Godse. His mindset is revealing,"" he added, apparently taking a dig at BJP MP Abhijit Gangopadhyay's controversial remarks in 2024, according to PTI.The timing of these letters was significant. Nehru wrote his letter just two days before Gandhi's assassination. Patel's letter came later, on July 18, 1948. Both leaders expressed strong criticism of the Hindu organisations' activities during that crucial period in Indian history.Mahatma Gandhi was killed by Nathuram Godse on January 30, 1948.","Congress leader jairam ramesh shared two historic letters from 1948, written by nehru and sardar vallabhbhai patel to syama prasad mookerjee.

NEW DELHI: The security forces intensified their anti-terror operation in the Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir against three Jaish terrorists. The operation launched in the Chatroo area of Kishtwar has also led to the continued suspension of internet services.Areas within the 6km range covering Singpura, Arigam Dwathar and Naidgam also continue to face internet suspension since January 23, which has been extended till Friday, 11.59pm, as per an order issued by the Jammu and Kashmir home department.News agency PTI reported, citing the officials, that the suspension has been put in force to curtail anti-national activities that could disrupt the security operation.The operation, which began on 18 January in the snowbound region, has been hampered by difficult geography despite multiple contacts. The terrorists managed to escape the confrontation utilising the environment to evade capture.The encounter on the first day of the operation led to one paratrooper being killed while injuring seven other soldiers.

New Delhi: As Republic Day celebrations drew to a close with the Beating Retreat ceremony, Vijay Chowk reverberated with three of composer AR Rahman's iconic songs - Oscar-winning 'Jai ho', 'Bharat humko jaan se pyaara hai' and 'Ma tujhe salaam'.Earlier this month, when asked about his absence from Hindi-film music during an interview with BBC Asian Network, Rahman said, ""It might be a communal thing also... but it is not in my face"". He later said that intentions could be ""misundersood sometimes"" and that he was grateful to the country.While the Central Armed Police Forces band performed ""Jai Ho"", the Indian Navy band played 'Bharat humko...'.The song 'Aarambh hai prachand' from the movie Gulaal was played by the Indian Army band. Vande Mataram on its 150th anniversary and Operation Sindoor were featured prominently during the ceremony on Thursday evening, which was presided over by President Droupadi Murmu, who arrived in the ceremonial buggy. Vice-President CP Radhakrishnan, PM Narendra Modi , defence minister Rajnath Singh, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, and the three service chiefs were also present.The bands stood various formations that included 'Amar Jawan': a tribute to Indian Army bravehearts, 'Deva Vyuha: a battle formation referred to in Mahabharata battle formation against Bhishm Pitamah and 'Ardhachandra Vyuha': a half-moon battle formation.LED screens placed at the venue also showed a video clip of a BrahMos missile hitting a target; instruments of several band members were wrapped with LEDs on which the logo of Op Sindoor shone. Images of Rafale, Tejas, Su-30, BrahMos, S-400 air defence system, Netra, Prachand and C-130 also played on the screens.Later, the PM shared the glimpses from Beating Retreat 2026, saying that ""performances by the various bands were memorable"".In a series of posts on X, Modi said: ""Air Force Band was exceptional... They performed 'Brave Warrior', 'Twilight', 'Alert (Post Horn Gallop)' and 'Flying Star' impeccably. The Sindoor formation was brilliant!""On the naval band, he posted, ""Simply outstanding! The Naval Band's performances included 'Namaste', 'Sagar Pawan', 'Matribhumi', 'Tejasvi' and 'Jai Bharati'. The Matsya Yantra formation was flawless.""","Vijay chowk reverberated with three of composer ar rahman's iconic songs.

Offsetting impact of Trump tariffs

India and the EU have concluded discussions for a free trade agreement (FTA) that is being called the ‘mother of all deals’ by both sides. It’s a big breakthrough after 18 years of talks, and comes at a crucial juncture in the global economy which is reeling from unpredictable trade and tariff policies of US President Donald Trump. The trade deal is expected to be signed sometime this year after the legal framework is in place and the European Parliament agrees to it.The landmark India-EU trade deal that will help ease both sides’ dependence on the United States of America, and even China. The push to wrap up negotiations, which began nearly two decades ago, gathered pace after tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Indian and European goods disrupted global trade flows.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday described the India-European Union free trade agreement as a framework for shared prosperity that serves the broader global interest, saying the partnership with Europe would reinforce international stability at a time of growing uncertainty in the world order.He addressed a joint press conference with European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen following the conclusion of negotiations on the India-EU FTA and the summit meeting between the two sides.The European Union is India’s biggest partner in merchandise trade, with two-way goods commerce at roughly $136 billion in the year ending March 2025, according to official figures. Services exports from India to the EU reached €37 billion in 2024, nearly doubling from €19 billion in 2019, as Indian technology firms and outsourcing companies have deepened their footprint across Europe.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has said that the agreement between India and the European Union is expected to come into force sometime in 2026. Goyal said the agreement would now undergo expedited legal vetting. “Every agreement stands on its own legs, and this is a wonderful agreement. It'll be taken up for a legal scrubbing on a fast track basis...We do hope that we should be able to celebrate the entry into force of this agreement within calendar 2026 itself,” he said.Ahead of the trade deal announcement, the Trump administration has expressed displeasure on the FTA. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday criticised the FTA, alleging that Europe was effectively bankrolling the Russia-Ukraine conflict by purchasing energy products routed through India.Bessent argued that European countries were weakening their own security position by importing refined fuel from India that is derived from Russian crude oil. He contrasted this with Washington’s stance, which has imposed stiff tariffs on Indian exports over New Delhi’s energy dealings with Moscow.In an interview with ABC News, Bessent justified the Trump administration’s tariff measures, directly linking them to India’s purchases of Russian oil. “We have put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,” he said.The US is among the largest markets for India’s exports and Trump’s 50% tariffs have had a major impact on its exports to America. At the start of this financial year, India’s exports to the US were $8.4 billion. They have now come down to $6.88 billion December. The decline has been drastic since August, when the 50% came into effect in a phased manner.In FY25 so, India’s total exports stood at roughly $825 billion, comprising about $438 billion in goods and $387 billion in services. Looking ahead to FY26, merchandise exports are expected to remain largely stagnant as global demand stays subdued and fresh tariff pressures from the United States weigh on shipments. Services exports, by contrast, are likely to show modest growth, edging beyond the $400 billion mark, according to an analysis by Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).Global trade conditions have worsened sharply. Under President Donald Trump, the United States has moved away from World Trade Organization norms, relying instead on aggressive unilateral tariffs.As a result, India’s exports to the US declined by nearly 21% between May and November 2025 amid a 50% tariff regime. Unless Washington withdraws the additional 25% levy tied to India’s purchases of Russian oil or reaches a bilateral trade agreement, shipments to India’s largest export destination could face further pressure.However, some resilience is evident. Even as exports to the US have dropped steeply, shipments to other markets increased by around 5.5% over the same period, signalling slow but steady diversification. Nevertheless, the US and the European Union continue to be India’s most critical export destinations, making disengagement neither practical nor desirable, says GTRI.Once operational, around 93% of India’s exports are set to gain duty-free entry into European markets, while Indian consumers are likely to see lower prices on premium European imports such as luxury automobiles and wines.The agreement delivers exceptional access to the European market, covering over 99% of India’s exports by value. In addition to merchandise trade, it secures substantial openings in services, supported by a mobility framework that facilitates the smooth movement of skilled Indian professionals.The India-EU FTA is set to significantly strengthen labour-intensive industries, including textiles, apparel, leather, footwear, marine products, gems and jewellery, handicrafts, engineering goods and automobiles. Under the pact, tariffs of up to ten percent on nearly $33 billion worth of exports will be eliminated once the agreement comes into effect.The agreement would effectively create a combined market of nearly two billion people across India, the world’s fourth-largest economy, and the EU, the second-largest economic bloc globally.Together, India and the EU represent about 25% of global GDP and roughly one-third of world trade, estimated at around $11 trillion out of a global total of $33 trillion.For India, the agreement promises restored market access, tariff relief for labor-intensive exports, and new opportunities in services; for the EU, it offers scale, growth, and supply-chain diversification beyond China.As Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI, notes, the India-EU trade deal is an example of ‘classic FTA economics at work’.“Because both economies specialise in different segments, tariff elimination works as a cost-reduction tool rather than a displacement shock. An India–EU FTA would thus deliver classic trade gains—higher volumes, deeper integration and stronger industrial competitiveness on both sides—at a moment when such economically rational trade arrangements are becoming increasingly rare,” says Ajay Srivastava.As GTRI notes, rather than competing with each other, the two economies occupy different positions within global value chains. India largely ships labour-intensive and processing-oriented products, while the EU specialises in capital equipment, sophisticated technologies and industrial intermediates.“This structural complementarity explains why an India–EU free trade agreement is likely to lower costs and expand trade rather than threaten domestic industry,” says GTRI.In FY2025, merchandise trade between the two sides crossed $136 billion, and reductions in tariffs would mainly ease input costs, strengthen value-chain linkages and boost trade volumes, delivering the conventional efficiency gains associated with such agreements for businesses and consumers alike.Diversification of product basket and geographies is key to mitigating the impact of US tariffs, say experts. So will the India-EU FTA deliver on that front?In a report, Emkay Research says, “...India–EU FTA comes at a crucial juncture—of global trade fragmentation, rising protectionism, US–India trade frictions, and heightened global uncertainty. The deal could act as an effective counter-cyclical buffer by improving India’s export participation in global value chains, expanding market access, and supporting supply-chain diversification.”The EU accounts for around 17% of India’s goods exports. Emkay Research estimates that a bilateral alignment could lift India’s exports to the EU by around $50 billion by 2031, led by medium-tech manufacturing.Agneshwar Sen, Trade Policy Leader at EY India tells TOI, “The India - EU FTA’s value lies beyond tariffs. It will provide predictable market access, regulatory cooperation, and investment linkages. While strengthening Indian competitiveness, it may partially mitigate the trade-distorting effects of unilateral tariff actions elsewhere.”Sen points out that the tariff concessions, while an important element under the India–EU FTA, will not provide a like-for-like offset to the adverse impact of the recent US tariff increase.“They can certainly and meaningfully cushion the shock in some sectors, but given the differences in domestic regulations in the EU as compared to the US, wholesale redirection of trade from one market to the other is unlikely to happen. The US remains India’s largest single-country export market, nonetheless deeper access to the EU—especially in engineering goods, chemicals, textiles, auto components and new-age sectors—will help diversify demand and stabilise export growth,” he adds.Gulzar Didwania, Partner at Deloitte India believes that the deal is likely to open up the EU market for India for various sectors such as textile, gems and jewellery, auto components etc. “India exports a significant amount of these items to the US which has been impacted due to 50% tariffs. While the US is India’s largest trading partner so far, this deal is likely to offset some amount of impact created by US tariffs on Indian exports,” he tells TOI.Gautam Khattar, Principal at Price Waterhouse & Co LLP says, “The EU trade deal offers a critical window for Indian exporters to diversify and de-risk supply chains. Gaining preferential access to a market of this scale is a massive catalyst for labour-intensive sectors like textiles and leather.”“In an era of rapid geopolitical shifts, this isn't just a trade agreement, it’s a strategic expansion of India’s global footprint,” he tells TOI.However, Ajay Srivastava of GTRI strikes a note of caution: “The first set of tariff cuts under the India-EU FTA may kick in after at least one year. But India’s exports to the US are already down by 21% between May and Dec 2025. We hope that a US deal may happen soon, reducing US tariffs from 50 to 15%,” he tells TOI.India is confronted with one of the most demanding global trade backdrops in recent memory. A surge in protectionist policies across developed economies, softening worldwide demand and the emergence of climate-related trade restrictions are all coming at a time when India is seeking to accelerate export growth. Instead of expansion, the near-term focus is increasingly on preserving existing market share.With this pact, the European Union becomes India’s 22nd free trade agreement partner. Since 2014, the NDA government has concluded trade agreements with Mauritius, the UAE, the UK, EFTA, Oman and Australia, and has announced deals with New Zealand. In 2025, India signed trade agreements with Oman and the UK and confirmed the conclusion of negotiations with New Zealand.","India and the eu have concluded discussions for a free trade agreement (fta) that is being called the ‘mother of all deals’ by both sides.

Leaked Zoom audio puts Erika Kirk under scrutiny as Candace Owens questions her tone





Podcaster Candace Owens has ignited a fresh political and cultural firestorm after releasing audio she claims came from a private Zoom meeting involving Erika Kirk, held just days after the assassination of her husband. The clip, shared on Owens’ show, has quickly spread across social media, drawing intense scrutiny not just for what was said, but for how it was said.The recording came out at a time when there was still a lot of tension over changes in leadership at Turning Point USA, an organization that is still dealing with the death of its founder. Owens said the audio was disturbing and that the tone of the call was very different from how serious the situation was. Her comments have sparked a bigger discussion about grief, optics, and authority during a time of trauma in the organization.Owens focused on moments in the call where Erika Kirk appeared lighthearted while addressing staff concerns. After playing the clip, Owens offered her blunt assessment:""It is the general tone that is off-putting, it is the laughter that is off-putting. We are not even two weeks after watching your husband be assassinated.""The Zoom meeting reportedly took place on September 16, less than a week after Charlie Kirk was killed. In the audio, Erika Kirk reassured employees that their jobs were secure and emphasized unity during the transition. While some listeners viewed the remarks as an attempt to steady a shaken team, Owens argued that the delivery raised uncomfortable questions about leadership style and emotional timing.This controversy lands against a backdrop of unresolved questions surrounding Charlie Kirk’s death. Owens has repeatedly challenged official accounts, advancing theories that authorities strongly dispute and for which no evidence has been presented. She has also claimed internal upheaval at Turning Point USA, alleging sudden dismissals and loyalty tests under the new leadership.Neither Erika Kirk nor the organization has issued a direct response to the leaked recording. Still, the episode has intensified public discussion about transparency, trust, and how power shifts are handled when tragedy collides with influence. As debate continues online, the audio has become less about a single Zoom call and more about how institutions survive their most vulnerable moments.","Candace drops 'secret' tpusa tape: erika kirk heard laughing days after charlie kirk’s killing.
