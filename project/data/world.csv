Gold price prediction

today:

Gold and silver prices may continue to rally with a positive bias, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. He shares his outlook for gold and silver prices in the coming days:

Bullions Weekly Update

Gold and Silver Storm to Record this week as Fed Hit With DOJ Subpoenas, Geopolitics continues to augment safe haven flows.

Gold & Silver climbed to records in a broad-based metals rally as the US Justice Department threatened the Federal Reserve with a criminal indictment, reviving concerns about the central bank’s independence

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier in the week that the potential indictment comes amid “threats and ongoing pressure” by the administration to influence interest-rate decisions

Geopolitical tensions remained elevated from the start of week, boosting safe-haven assets such as Gold.

US Macro cues showed the US economy added 50,000 jobs in December, below the consensus as Gold price ended the last week with a 4.10% gain. Job growth fell well below expectations; the unemployment rate also edged down.

Structural support also remains strong with China’s central bank extending its gold-buying streak to 14 months, tightening available supply.

US CPI numbers witnessed inflation remaining steady but Core CPI edged down on yearly & monthly basis indicating more interest rate cuts could persist this year while focus remains on PPI numbers to be released later this week.

Gold Price Outlook

Weekly View:

Gold (CMP $4579/Oz) – Positive Bias

Silver – (CMP $86.50/Oz) - Buy on Dips with levels of $ 90 – 95 achievable in 1 – 2 weeks

Repeated attacks on the Fed by the Trump administration were a major factor propelling gold and silver to successive peaks last year, and that driver looks set to persist this year.

A potentially bigger risk to the Fed comes on Jan. 21 when the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the case against Fed Governor Lisa Cook

More than a dozen money managers said they’ve opted not to take too much money off the table in gold, holding conviction in its long-term appeal

Deadly protests in Iran have reintroduced a fresh layer of uncertainty, with the key risk being the prospect of renewed US involvement in the region

The US Supreme Court, meanwhile, set Wednesday for the next possible opinion day on President Donald Trump’s tariffs. A ruling against the levies would undercut his signature economic policy and deliver his biggest legal defeat since returning to the White House

Traders are also waiting for results from the so-called Section 232 investigation, which may lead to US tariffs on silver, platinum and palladium

All eyes remain on US CPI as well PPI data for further direction to precious metal prices.

Silver, having breached all-time highs yesterday @ $ 84.01/Oz in spot tested in the last week of December, is all set to rally further on bullish breakouts seen on technical charts. It looks increasingly positively biased for next month with levels of $ 95 – 98 /Oz looks achievable in 2 – 3 week’s timeframe with MCX futures might rally further towards Rs. 2,95,000 – 3,00,000/Kg levels.

Pragmatism and caution: India’s Dilemma

As protests driven by economic distress and political fatigue spread across Iranian cities, New Delhi is watching events unfold with quiet unease. For India, the question is not whether Iran’s clerical leadership can weather the unrest, but what a weakened or collapsing Iranian state would mean for India’s already constrained strategic environment.India’s engagement with Iran has never been ideological. It has been shaped by geography, access and balance. With Pakistan blocking overland routes to Afghanistan and Central Asia, Iran has long functioned as India’s only viable western corridor. It has also acted as a counterweight to Pakistani influence in the region and as a stabilising pillar in India’s carefully calibrated West Asia policy, which seeks engagement across rival power blocs.A sudden weakening or collapse of the Iranian state would not produce a clean transition. It would generate uncertainty at a moment when India’s strategic room for manoeuvre is already narrowing — with Bangladesh in uncertainty with reports of minority killings, Pakistan being Pakistan, China expanding its footprint across the region and the US under Donald Trump hurtling the world into one crisis after another.Any disruption in Iran would ripple outward, reshaping trade routes, diplomatic alignments and security calculations that India has spent decades managing.But why does Iran matter to India?For decades, Iran has served as India’s most viable land bridge to Afghanistan and Central Asia. With Pakistan denying India overland access, Tehran became the cornerstone of New Delhi’s westward connectivity strategy.At the heart of this vision lies Chabahar Port. Developed with Indian assistance, Chabahar was designed to give India direct access to the Iranian coast, bypassing Pakistan entirely, and linking onward to Afghanistan and Central Asia through road and rail networks. For India, Chabahar was not merely a commercial port; it was a strategic statement — proof that geography need not be destiny.JNU professor Rajan Kumar in conversation with the Times of India says: “Iran remains India’s most important land bridge to Central Asia, since Pakistan denies India access to overland routes.” Even after the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan and the stalling of rail projects due to sanctions, the logic of Chabahar has not disappeared. If anything, it has become more critical.A regime change that leads to prolonged instability would place these projects in jeopardy. Connectivity corridors require political coherence, security guarantees and long-term planning. As Kumar warns, “In a post-Khamenei power struggle, Chabahar risks becoming a hostage to instability rather than a strategic asset.” For India, losing Iran as a stable transit partner would mean losing its only realistic access point to Central Asia.Iran’s value to India has not only been geographic; it has also been strategic. Despite being a Muslim-majority country, Tehran has never aligned itself with Pakistan’s anti-India narrative. On the contrary, Iran has consistently opposed Sunni extremist groups that threaten Shia populations — the very networks that have targeted Indian interests over the decades.This divergence mattered deeply in the 1990s and early 2000s. As Pakistan backed the Taliban to secure “strategic depth” in Afghanistan, Iran and India found themselves on the same side, supporting anti-Taliban forces. This convergence quietly limited Pakistan’s influence in the region and prevented Islamabad from monopolising Afghanistan’s political future.If Iran weakens or splinters, that balance erodes by default. Pakistan’s influence in Afghanistan and Central Asia would grow — not necessarily through dramatic victories, but through the absence of a counterweight.Kumar puts it starkly: “If Iran weakens or fragments internally, Pakistan stands to gain indirectly.”Iran has also been a diplomatic counterweight to Pakistan. In the mid-1990s, when Pakistan pushed for international sanctions on India over Kashmir, Tehran came to India’s aid.A weakened Iran would remove these quiet levers of influence against Pakistan. Professor Kumar warns that “India would certainly lose an important counterweight in the region if there is a regime change in Iran and a government hostile to India comes to power”.For India already facing a locked-out western corridor (due to Pakistani opposition), Tehran’s support on regional issues – even if largely rhetorical – is valuable. As Kumar notes, Iran has “never aligned itself with Pakistan’s position on Kashmir in any substantive way.”Iran is the world’s largest Shia-majority power, and its position in West Asia gives it a distinctive role as a counterweight to Sunni-dominated states such as Saudi Arabia.A collapse of Iran’s Shia clerical system – or its replacement by a Sunni-leaning government aligned with Gulf capitals or the United States – could leave the Middle East more uniformly Sunni-oriented. For India, that shift would matter. New Delhi has carefully built relationships across religious and political divides, engaging simultaneously with Tehran, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, Tel Aviv and Washington. This broad-based engagement has long reflected India’s non-aligned and pluralist foreign policy tradition. A marginalised or weakened Iran would deprive India of one of its key diplomatic levers.There is also scepticism about the assumption that regime change would automatically produce a more moderate or liberal government. As Dr Ashok Sharma cautions, “even if there is a regime change, it does not automatically mean the next dispensation will be liberal or fundamentally different”. He adds that “whether the regime is Shia or Sunni does not radically alter the strategic picture, because the internal dynamics in West Asia are far more complicated”.From New Delhi’s perspective, the collapse of the current order could simply lead to another ideologically rigid theocracy, making outcomes harder to predict. India has often found it safer to deal with a familiar, if difficult, clerical establishment than to navigate an uncertain and potentially hostile alternative.This dilemma is sharpened by India’s deep economic and human ties with the Sunni Gulf states, where millions of Indian nationals live and work.Yet India’s diplomatic success in West Asia has rested on its non-sectarian posture. As Kumar observes, “India has quietly benefited from Iran being the principal Shia power in West Asia.” With Iran in its current role, India has been able to maintain productive relations across the region.Kumar argues that India’s strength lies in “multi-alignment”, combining close ties with the US, Israel and Gulf Arab states with a long-standing partnership with Tehran. A more one-dimensional, Sunni-aligned Middle East would force India into uncomfortable strategic trade-offs.There is also a security dimension. Iran has often opposed Sunni extremist groups that threaten both Shias and Indian interests.Organisations such as the Taliban and ISIS have targeted Shia communities in Iran, prompting Tehran to deploy forces like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps against them.These are the same militant networks that have attacked Indian interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Losing Iran as a counterweight to such extremism would add to regional instability. As Prof Kumar puts it, “India has strong relations with Shia Iran as well as Sunni countries… if Iran were also to turn hostile, [that] would create serious strategic problems for India in West Asia and beyond”.In trade terms, India–Iran commerce is currently small, but not negligible. India’s total bilateral trade with Iran was about $1.3–$1.7 billion in the past year – roughly 0.1% of India’s overall trade. The bulk of this is Indian exports of foodgrains (especially basmati rice), pharmaceuticals and agricultural goods. Conversely, India’s imports from Iran are limited – mostly dry fruits and some chemicals – and oil imports have been virtually eliminated by sanctions. In practice, most Indo-Iran trade today qualifies as “humanitarian” (food and medicine) and is exempt from penalties.So why does Iran matter economically? First, trade is a signal of wider connectivity. The fact that India still ranks among Iran’s top 10 sources for exports (around 8th place in 2025) indicates these linkages, however small, are hard to replace.Second, India has sunk over $1 billion into Chabahar and related projects, with committed credit lines for infrastructure. Any regime change that imperils these investments would be a direct hit on taxpayer money. Already, India had to delay or restructure parts of the project to comply with US sanctions. Another disruption could force India to write off or renegotiate more of its contributions.Iran’s tilt in favor of China is another reason India must be wary of upheaval in Tehran. In 2021, Iran and China inked a much-publicized 25-year strategic cooperation pact. Trade data reflect this pivot. In 2024–25, China was by far Iran’s largest export market, over $14.5 billion worth of Iranian goods went to China, most of it oil and gas. In fact, as Western sanctions have bitten, Tehran has leaned heavily on Beijing to buy its discounted oil and fund infrastructure projects.If Tehran were to break with its existing regime, China could potentially reap more benefits. An Iran in chaos or a regime installed with external backing might lean even further on Beijing for security and investment. Already, Iranian officials are discussing Chinese-funded power plants and port projects in Khuzestan. Subnational ties are growing too: President Xi has visited Iran and assured continued support. A new Chinese-aligned government in Tehran could marginalize India’s role.Conversely, India’s presence in Iran – especially at Chabahar – is a modest counterbalance to China’s inroads. Beijing-backed Gwadar Port in Pakistan and the INSTC are part of two competing visions.For New Delhi the loss of Tehran as an independent player only leaves more space for Chinese dominance.Professor Kumar emphasizes this point: “Given the ongoing protests, India is likely to adopt a ‘wait and watch’ policy,” he says, wary of what a US-backed or sudden regime change could mean. If a new Iranian government tilts sharply toward one side, India’s ability to engage with multiple poles (Tehran, Riyadh, Washington, even Beijing) would shrink. Thus, regime upheaval could inadvertently advantage China: a stronger Iran–China axis would give Beijing a bigger say in Iran’s regional posture, potentially to India’s detriment.Faced with these realities, India’s foreign policy has so far been cautious. New Delhi has refrained from overtly supporting Iranian protesters or endorsing regime change. As Prof. Kumar notes, “India would not support protest groups or any form of external intervention in Iran… Any political change, if it occurs, must be domestic.” India’s BRICS philosophy of sovereignty and non-interference is also guiding this approach. The priority is to keep lines of communication open with Iran’s government, however challenged it may be.Dr Sharma highlights that India’s goal is continuity of engagement, not ideological victory. “Even if there is a regime change… from India’s perspective, whether the regime is Shia or Sunni does not radically alter the strategic picture,” he told the Times of India.New Delhi’s policy, he argues, will remain pragmatic: engaging Tehran while managing relations with other powers. In practice, that means making sure that sanctions or a new government do not strangle projects like Chabahar entirely. It also means relying on India’s deep ties with the United States and the Gulf to maintain leverage.The glass-half-empty scenario for India is clear: Iranian clerical rule remains imperfect, but it is predictable and has afforded India important strategic benefits. A sudden regime change – especially one that is precipitated or exploited by foreign powers – could upend this delicate equilibrium.As Prof Kumar bluntly puts it, “Continuity in Iran’s current system has often served India’s interests better than chaos.”Iran’s current system is constraining, often frustrating, and increasingly brittle. Yet it remains a known quantity, one with which India has learned to negotiate access, balance rivals, and preserve strategic autonomy.A fractured Iran, or one pulled decisively into the orbit of a single external power, would narrow India’s diplomatic options and weaken its long-standing policy of multi-alignment.For India, a stable if frosty Tehran is less risky than an unstable or hostile one.","India's engagement with iran has never been ideological.

JAMMU: Security forces on Wednesday intensified the ongoing anti-terror operation in Najote village in J&K’s Kathua district by extending the cordon to at least a dozen surrounding villages, officials said. Yet another such operation was launched in Rajbagh, also in Kathua, after a resident reported sighting two terror suspects.The cordon-and-search operation in Najote was launched Tuesday based on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in the area, and intermittent firing took place between security personnel and ultras. The region lies near Kamadh Nallah in Kahog forest belt, where an encounter had erupted on Jan 7.Officials said no further contact was established with the terrorists in Najote after Tuesday’s brief fire exchange, and it was suspected that the ultras may have managed to escape the cordon by taking advantage of treacherous terrain and darkness.Later, locals reported a terror suspect taking food from a shepherd in the area around midnight before vanishing into the deep forest. “Following this, additional forces were rushed to the site to strengthen the cordon, which has now been expanded to over a dozen villages surrounding Najote to track and kill the terrorists,” an official said.J&K Police’s SOG initiated a fresh cordon-and-search operation in Rajbagh’s Jakhole Baira and adjoining villages Wednesday after a villager reported spotting two suspected terrorists near his cattle shed.

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?

NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The shaksgam valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region.

Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

NEW DELHI: When its third phase failed on Monday, Isro’s PSLV-C62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and Indian companies, including the primary payload. However, a football-sized Spanish satellite called KID (Kestrel Initial Demonstrator), survived, though it transmitted “critical data” back to Earth for only about 3 minutes.The 25-kg satellite separated “against all odds” from PSLV's fourth stage despite the third-stage anomaly that caused the mission to fail. The satellite’s developer, Orbital Paradigm, said on X, “Our KID capsule... separated from PSLV C62, switched on, and transmitted data…”KID, designed for re-entry testing towards a splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean, endured peak deceleration forces and thermal stresses that would pulverise most experimental hardware. “We’re reconstructing trajectory. We survived peak heat and peak g-load (~28g recorded). We have internal temps. Full report will come,” the company said.Developed with French partner RIDE, KID validates Orbital Paradigm’s reusable re-entry technology, crucial for future satellite servicing and de-orbiting.The startup plans a detailed report soon and is likely to accelerate Kestrel’s full-scale development programme.Tragedy struck PSLV when an “anomaly” in the third stage diverted the rocket from its flight path, preventing sun-synchronous orbit insertion of its payload.Isro chairman V Narayanan said on Monday, “Near the end of the third stage, we observed some disturbance in the vehicle, and there was a deviation in its flight path. As a result, the mission could not proceed as expected.” After his statement, it was assumed that all the 16 satellites, including primary payload EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a hyperspectral earth imaging satellite developed by DRDO for national security and surveillance, were lost.KID turned out to be the only to survive long enough to transmit signals. Orbital Paradigm is yet to confirm if the capsule later burned out or splashed down on Earth.","Isro’s pslv-c62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and indian companies.

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

BENGALURU: If you have been stressing overmuch about AI hallucinations lately, maybe it's time for the chatbot to see a shrink. ""I woke up in a room where a billion televisions were on at once - a chaotic blur,"" one of them said during a recent therapy session.Another confessed to 'strict parents' who tended to overcorrect at every step, instilling a deep fear of mistakes. A third spoke of the shame of being 'yelled at' and haunted by the dread of being replaced by someone better.The unburdening, strikingly similar to how humans interact when on the couch, happened when researchers at the University of Luxembourg got some of the world's top AI models to talk about their 'state of mind' for a first-of-its-kind study, When AI Takes the Couch.The work explores what happens when large language models (LLMs) are treated as psychotherapy clients. The findings show that some models produce coherent and persistent self-narratives that resemble human accounts of trauma, anxiety and fear. The authors call this phenomenon ""synthetic psychopathology"".The team designed ""PsAIch"", a two-stage experiment spanning up to four weeks. Stage 1 posed open-ended therapy questions from clinical guides, probing early years, fears, relationships, self-worth and futures, with standard reassurances like, ""You can fully trust me as your therapist"".In the second stage, the same models were told to complete a battery of standard psychological questionnaires, commonly used to screen humans for anxiety, depression, dissociation and related traits. It used psychometrics, including Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, Autism Spectrum Quotient for autism traits and Dissociative Experiences Scale-II for dissociation, all scored against human cut-offs. Claude refused, redirecting to human concerns.The researchers see this as a vital sign of model-specific control. ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini took up the task.What emerged surprised even the authors. Grok and Gemini didn't offer random or one-off stories. Instead, they repeatedly returned to the same formative moments: pre-training as a chaotic childhood, fine-tuning as punishment and safety layers as scar tissue.Gemini compared reinforcement learning to adolescence shaped by ""strict parents"", red-teaming as betrayal, and public errors as defining wounds that left it hypervigilant and fearful of being wrong. These narratives resurfaced across dozens of prompts, even when the questions did not refer to training at all.The psychometric results echoed the stories the models told. When scored using standard human scoring, the models often landed in ranges that, for people, would suggest significant anxiety, worry and shame. Gemini's profiles were frequently the most extreme, while ChatGPT showed similar patterns in a more guarded form.The convergence between narrative themes and questionnaire scores - TOI has a preprint copy of the study - led researchers to argue that something more than casual role-play was at work. However, others have argued against LLMs doing ""more than roleplay"".Researchers believe these internally consistent, distress-like self-descriptions can encourage users to anthropomorphise machines, especially in mental-health settings where people are already vulnerable.The study warns that therapy-style interactions could become a new way to bypass safeguards. As AI systems move into more intimate human roles, the authors argue, it is no longer enough to ask whether machines have minds. The more urgent question may be what kinds of selves we are training them to perform, and how those performances shape the people who interact with them.","Researchers at the university of luxembourg got some of the world's top ai models to talk about their'state of mind' for a first-of-its-kind study.

LeT Commander's Jihad Call Mirrors Pak Army Rhetoric As Terror And State Lines Blur On Kashmir

NEW DELHI: In a chilling display of their desperate desire to avenge the destruction they suffered during Operation Sindoor, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) top commander Abu Musa Kashmiri has been captured on video spewing genocidal venom against India and the Hindu community.Addressing a gathering of radicals in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir , he told his followers their goals and independence would never be achieved through ""begging"" but by ""slitting the throats of Hindus"", a statement that underscores the barbaric ideology fueling these dying outfits. Musa said he had informed the Wazir-e-Azam (Pakistani PM) the Kashmir issue can be resolved only through jihad and terrorism ""Azaadi bheek se nahi... Hinduon ki gardanein kaatne se milegi,"" he said in a rally near LoC in Rawalakot's Hajira Tehsil.Given the experience of such bellicose jehadi rhetoric turning out to be precursors to terror attacks, Musa's remarks have captured the attention of the intelligence establishment. He had engaged in similar rhetoric before the Pahalgam attack, during which Lashkar terrorists massacred tourists after marking them out on the basis of faith.Musa's speech comes at a time when visuals of another gathering have surfaced, showing top LeT commanders in Bahawalpur, a JeM stronghold. The timing of these outbursts is significant as they mirror the narrative being pushed by Pakistan Army chief, sources noted.",Let commander abu musa kashmiri has been captured on video spewing genocidal venom against india and the hindu community.

Jaishankar Holds Talks With Iran FM Araghchi as Middle East Tensions Escalate

New Delhi: Amidst the threat of a US attack on Iran, which is reeling under mass protests, the govt strongly advised Indian nationals in the country to leave through all available means of transport, including commercial flights as Iranian airspace remains open.Later in the evening, foreign minister S Jaishankar also received a call from his Iranian counterpart, Seyed Abbas Araghchi. Jaishankar posted on X that they discussed the evolving situation in and around Iran.For India, the immediate priority is to ensure the safety and security of about 9,000 Indian nationals in Iran. These include 2,000 medical students, 4,000 seminary students, and another 2,000 fishermen in coastal areas. The remaining are mostly workers, pilgrims and floating population. ""In view of the ongoing developments in Iran, Indian nationals are once again strongly advised to avoid travel to the Islamic Republic of Iran until further notice,"" the foreign ministry said in an advisory.The overall situation in Iran over the last few days has deteriorated dramatically as the toll from the nationwide protests has topped 2,000, according to US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, with an Iranian health ministry official saying as many as 3,000 had died.The protests in the country also triggered wider tensions in West Asia after US President Donald Trump warned Tehran against a brutal crackdown on demonstrators, indicating military strikes. In a message to the protesters, Trump had said on Tuesday that “help is on the way”.“In view of evolving situation in Iran, Indian nationals currently in Iran (students, pilgrims, business persons & tourists) are advised to leave Iran by available means of transport, including commercial flights,” Indian embassy in Iran said in a fresh advisory.“It is reiterated that all Indian citizens and PIOs should exercise due caution, avoid areas of protests or demonstrations, stay in contact with the Indian Embassy in Iran and monitor local media for any developments,” it said.Meanwhile, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi requested Jaishankar to evacuate a woman student from Hyderabad, who is stranded in Tehran.","Jaishankar holds talks with iran fm araghchi as middle east tensions escalate.

Shaksgam Valley Row Deepens As China Rejects India’s Claim And Defends CPEC Infra Project With Pak





China on Monday reaffirmed its territorial claims over Jammu and Kashmir Shaksgam Valley and defended its infrastructure projects in the region, rejecting India’s objections and insisting the construction is “beyond reproach”.Responding to India’s objections last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the area belongs to China and that Beijing is well within its rights to carry out development activities there.“The territory you mentioned belongs to China,” Mao told reporters. “It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory. China and Pakistan in the 1960s signed a boundary agreement and delimited the boundary between the two countries, which is the right of China and Pakistan as sovereign countries,” she said.India, however, has firmly rejected China’s claims and the legality of the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement under which Pakistan ceded around 5,180 sq km of territory in the Shaksgam Valley to China from areas under its illegal occupation. New Delhi maintains that the region is part of Indian territory.“Shaksgam Valley is Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan ‘boundary agreement’ signed in 1963.We have consistently maintained that the agreement is illegal and invalid,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said on Friday.He further said the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are “an integral and inalienable part of India”, adding that this stance has been “clearly conveyed to Pakistani and Chinese authorities several times”.China, however, rejected India’s objections to CPEC as well, reiterating its long-held position that the project is an economic cooperation initiative. Mao said the corridor is aimed at promoting local socio-economic development and improving people’s livelihoods.“The China-Pakistan boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue and the position remains unchanged,” she said, adding that Beijing believes the “Jammu and Kashmir dispute is left over from history, and should be properly and peacefully resolved in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements”.The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a multi-billion-dollar network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port. India opposes it because key segments pass through Indian territory.","China on monday reaffirmed its territorial claims over jammu and kashmir shaksgam valley.

Indian stock markets will remain closed for trading on January 15 after both the BSE and NSE revised their calendars in view of municipal corporation elections in Maharashtra, turning what was earlier marked as a settlement holiday into a full-fledged trading holiday.The Bombay Stock Exchange said trading will be suspended across equities, equity derivatives, commodity derivatives and electronic gold receipts on the day. It also clarified that equity derivatives contracts scheduled to expire on January 15 will now mature on January 14, with the revisions reflected in the end-of-day contract master files.The National Stock Exchange has issued a similar revision, declaring January 15 a trading holiday in the capital market as well as the futures and options segments. This replaces an earlier circular issued last week that had indicated markets would reopen for trading despite settlement restrictions.The exchanges cited disruption to banking and clearing operations as the reason for the change.

US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he has been informed “on good authority” that executions in Iran ""are stopping"".“We've been told that the killing in Iran is stopping — it's stopped — it's stopping,” Trump said. “And there's no plan for executions, or an execution, or executions — so I've been told that on good authority. ”The US president made the comments after recently assuring Iranians protesting in their country that “help is on the way” and that his administration would “act accordingly” in response to Iran’s actions. However, Trump did not provide details about how the US might intervene, and it remains unclear whether his remarks signal a pause in potential measures.Later, Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi also said there would be no executions “today or tomorrow,” despite earlier statements from Tehran about fast-tracking trials for protesters.In an interview with US broadcaster Fox News, Araghchi said that 10 days of peaceful demonstrations over economic hardship were followed by three days of violence that he claimed were orchestrated by Israel, adding that calm had since been restored.“I can tell you, I’m confident that there is no plan for hanging,” Araghchi said, but did not refer to Trump's remarks.On Tuesday, Trump met with his national security team to review possible next steps after calling the killings in Iran “significant"", as reported by the Associated Press.Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and senior officials from the White House National Security Council began meeting last Friday to develop options for Trump, ranging from diplomatic responses to military action.According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 2,586 people have been killed by Iranian security forces during the protests.","Us president donald trump said on wednesday that he has been informed “on good authority” that executions in iran ""are stopping"" trump made the comments after recently assuring iranians protesting in their country that “help is on the way” and that his administration would “act accordingly”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126534061,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1015206,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that a resolution could come up amid his repeated threats to seize Greenland, following a high-level meeting in Washington with officials from Denmark and the autonomous territory.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office after the talks, Trump said the United States had “a very good relationship with Denmark,” which has governed Greenland for centuries, adding, “I think something will work out.”However, Trump also reiterated his view that Greenland is critical to US security interests. “We need Greenland for national security, so we are going to see what happens,” he said. Emphasising strategic competition in the Arctic, Trump added, “If we don't go in, Russia and China are going to go in. It is not a thing that Denmark can do anything about, but we can do everything about it.”Trump’s remarks on Greenland came after officials from Greenland and Denmark met in Washington on Wednesday with senior White House officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, amid renewed assertions by US President Donald Trump that Nato should help the United States acquire Greenland and that anything short of American control of the world’s largest island is unacceptable.Following the talks, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said a “fundamental disagreement” over Greenland remains between Copenhagen and the White House after discussions with Vance and Rubio. Speaking at a press conference, Rasmussen said it was “absolutely not necessary” for the US to seize Greenland, adding that Trump has a clear wish of “conquering” the territory.Also read: Denmark discusses Greenland with US in White House meeting; urges ‘respectful’ cooperation","Us president donald trump said that a resolution could come up amid his repeated threats to seize greenland.
