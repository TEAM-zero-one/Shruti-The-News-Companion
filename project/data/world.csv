Tejas Crashes In Dubai Air Show Display As Massive Fireball Sparks Panic, Pilot Succumbs To Injuries

Since its 1st squadron was raised in 2016, Tejas has had an excellent safety record

In a major blow to India's much-delayed project for indigenous fighters as well as their export potential, a single-engine Tejas jet crashed during a demonstration at the Dubai Airshow on Friday afternoon. The IAF pilot, Wing Commander Namansh Syal, died in the accident.The Tejas Mark-1 fighter was on a low-altitude aerobatic demonstration sortie when it couldn't recover from a ""negative G-turn"" and plummeted to the ground, exploding in a ball of fire in front of a large audience at the Al Maktoum International Airport at 2.10 pm, local time.Wing Commander Syal was from Kangra in Himachal Pradesh and was posted at TN's Sulur IAF station. His wife is a retired wing commander. The couple has a daughter, who is seven years old.This is the second crash of the lightweight multi-role Tejas, manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics and powered by American GE-F404 turbofan engine, since it was inducted into the IAF 10 years ago.In the first crash near Jaisalmer on March 12 last year, the pilot had managed to eject safely. The jet was returning from the Bharat Shakti military exercise at Pokhran.Wing Commander Syal, an experienced fighter pilot, was not so lucky. He could not eject in time before the jet slammed into the ground.The pilot sustained fatal injuries,"" an officer said. The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry (CoI) to ascertain the exact reason behind the crash after coordinating with Dubai aviation authorities and recovering the ""black box"" of the ill-fated fighter. ""It's very difficult to say what led to the crash at this moment. It could be a sudden loss of power or control malfunction at a critical juncture,"" said a veteran fighter pilot, who did not want to be named.""Pilots can also suffer spatial disorientation during negative G-turns when they push the controls forward to make their planes dive, though they are trained to manage and mitigate negative G forces,"" he added.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said he was ""deeply anguished at the loss of a brave and courageous IAF pilot"", adding the nation stands firmly with the bereaved family in this tragic hour. Military aviation is inherently dangerous, with fighters being pushed to their limits through extensive combat manoeuvres and low-level flying and diving missions.The 13.5-tonne Tejas so far has had an excellent safety track-record since its first squadron '45 Flying Daggers' was raised with only two jets at Sulur in July 2016 despite its torturous development saga and excruciating delays. Over the last few years, India has been deploying the fourth-generation Tejas Mark-1 jets for airshows in Dubai, Singapore and other places to showcase its ""superior handling characteristics and manoeuvrability"" through low-level aerobatics to an international audience in a bid to win export orders.IAF, however, has inducted only 38 Tejas Mark-1 fighters, with the second squadron '18 Flying Bullets' deployed at Naliya, of the 40 ordered for Rs 8,802 crore in the 2006-10 timeframe. ""Three Tejas jets were sent for the Dubai air show for the No 45 and 18 squadrons,"" another officer said. IAF has also ordered 180 'improved' Tejas Mark-1A jets for over Rs 1.1 lakh crore, with the latest Rs 66,500 crore deal for 97 jets being inked in Sept this year. The force, however, is yet to begin getting Tejas Mark- 1A deliveries due to huge delays in supply of engines from the US as well as pending weapons trials.The trials involve Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs and their integration with Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system.","Iaf pilot, wing commander namansh syal, died in the accident. The tejas mark-1 fighter was on a low-altitude aerobatic demonstration sortie when it couldn't recover from a ""negative g-turn"" this is the second crash of the lightweight multi-role tejas since it was inducted into the iaf 10 years ago.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125496558,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1655084,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Order against ‘bulldozer justice’ was my most important: CJI Gavai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/order-against-bulldozer-justice-was-my-most-important-cji-gavai/articleshow/125495363.cms,"'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

Equality does not mean equal treatment: Gavai

NEW DELHI: Judges traditionally avoid commenting publicly on their own judgments, but on Friday CJI B R Gavai departed from that norm to pick his verdict against “bulldozer justice” as his most important one, followed by the ruling allowing states to sub-classify SCs and STs for job reservations.At the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) farewell function, CJI Gavai said he could do so as he has completed his judgments and doesn’t have any judicial work as he is retiring on Sunday. He said if he was asked to pick the most important judgment authored by him, it would undoubtedly be the one against bulldozer justice.“Bulldozer justice is against the grain of rule of law. How can a house be demolished just because a person is accused of a crime or convicted for it? What is the fault of his family and parents? Right to shelter is a fundamental right,"" he said.The Chief Justice of India B R Gavai had mentioned bulldozer justice judgment even in his speeches in foreign countries to highlight how the judiciary protects rule of law in India.He said the judgment allowing sub-classification of SCs and STs for availing reservation in jobs was needed as it would be difficult to imagine how a chief secretary’s children could be equated in status with the children of an agricultural labourer who have no access to education or resources.Quoting Ambedkar , he said equality does not mean equal treatment to all as “it would lead to further inequality.” CJI Gavai said he had a law clerk, who is the son of a top bureaucrat in Maharashtra belonging to a SC community.After I delivered the judgment, the law clerk said he would not avail benefit of reservation as he had the best of facilities despite belonging to SC community, the Chief Justice of India said on Friday.The CJI said he veered away from the traditional notion of the Supreme Court being a CJI-centric court and always consulted all his colleagues before taking decisions relating to the institution.He said during his short tenure, 107 judges were appointed to the HCs and thanked his collegium colleagues for the congenial atmosphere in the meetings. Not all meetings were congenial though, as Justice B V Nagarathna had shot off a long letter protesting the collegium’s choice to recommend Justice Vipul M Pancholi as a judge of the SC.In the morning, the courtroom farewell unprecedentedly extended beyond one and half hours as senior advocates and lawyers kept highligting the humble, compassionate and to-the-point demeanour and approach of the CJI.Chief Justice of India B R Gavai said he has been heading the green bench in Supreme Court for the last three years and his first judgment as CJI was protecting a forest land in Pune and the last judgment was to protect Aravali Hills and range.CJI B R Gavai said his 40-year-long career in the legal field, 18 years as an advocate and 22 years as a judge of constitutional court, was driven by Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's philosophy of justice, equality and liberty.",Chief justice of india b r gavai said he veered away from the traditional notion of the supreme court being a cji-centric court. He said equality does not mean equal treatment to all as “it would lead to further inequality” he said he had a law clerk who is the son of a top bureaucrat in maharashtra belonging to a sc community.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125495529,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-699687,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck Pakistan in the early hours of Friday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The agency said the quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.In a post on X, the NCS said, “EQ of M: 5.2, On: 21/11/2025 03:09:12 IST, Lat: 36.12 N, Long: 71.51 E, Depth: 135 Km, Location: Pakistan.” Officials said more information is awaited.The NCS also shared details of another recent tremor. On Thursday, a magnitude 3.9 earthquake struck Pakistan at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, making the region susceptible to aftershocks. The agency posted: “EQ of M: 3.9, On: 20/11/2025 17:19:20 IST, Lat: 35.02 N, Long: 71.63 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Earlier on November 10, an earthquake of magnitude 3.6 was recorded at 02:42 AM at a depth of 90 kilometres. The NCS said on X, “EQ of M: 3.6, On: 10/11/2025 02:42:55 IST, Lat: 35.20 N, Long: 73.40 E, Depth: 90 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Seismologists note that shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous because seismic waves have less distance to travel, resulting in stronger ground shaking and greater potential damage.Pakistan lies in one of the world’s most seismically active zones, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. The region frequently experiences moderate to strong earthquakes, often felt across borders in Afghanistan and northern India.Multiple provinces lie close to major fault lines. Balochistan sits near the active boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan fall along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Punjab and Sindh are positioned on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, making large parts of the country vulnerable to frequent seismic activity.","An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck pakistan in the early hours of friday, according to the national centre for seismology.

5.7-magnitude earthquake in Bangladesh triggers tremors across Kolkata, northeast

KOLKATA: An earthquake of magnitude 5.7 struck near Dhaka capital of Bangladesh on Friday. The tremors were reported in Kolkata and several parts of Northeast India, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).The quake struck 13 km south-southwest of Narsingdi in the Bangladesh at 10.08am, and at a depth of 10 km, it said. Several people in Kolkata and other districts were seen coming out on the streets as a precautionary measure.Residents in Kolkata reported brief tremors around 10:10 am, describing them as lasting only a few seconds. Within minutes, videos of the moment began circulating widely on social media.Similar mild tremors were also felt in Guwahati, Agartala and Shillong, according to early reports.There was no immediate report of any injury or damage.In October, Bangladesh experienced a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).Shallow quakes like this produce stronger shaking as seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface. Globally, earthquakes occur roughly every 30 seconds, though most are too minor to be noticed.Bangladesh sits at the junction of three tectonic plates—the Indian, Eurasian, and Burma plates.The Indian plate moves northeast at about 6 cm per year, while the Eurasian plate shifts north at roughly 2 cm annually.The country is crisscrossed by several major fault lines, including the Bogura, Tripura, Dauki, and Assam faults, as well as the Shillong Plateau, placing it within 13 earthquake-prone zones.High-risk areas include Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts, and Jaintiapur in Sylhet.Dhaka, with a population density exceeding 30,000 people per square kilometre, is among the world’s densest cities and ranks as one of the 20 most earthquake-vulnerable cities globally, according to The Daily Star.","Strong earthquake tremors felt in kolkata, northeast india.

MEA Outlines Agenda For PM Modi's South Africa Visit For G20 Summit In Johannesburg

NEW DELHI: Congress on Friday took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he left for Johannesburg, the venue for this year’s G20 Summit. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh suggested the prime minister was attending the event “safely and securely” because US President Donald Trump has chosen to boycott it, and wondered whether “huglomacy” with “my good friend” would revive when the next Summit takes place in the US.The prime minister embarked on a three-day visit to South Africa on Friday to attend the G20 Summit.Ramesh, Congress general secretary in charge of communications, noted that the next G20 Summit, a year from now, will be held in the United States and that by then India’s trade “(or)deal” with Washington would presumably be completed.“But if in the past seven months, President Trump has claimed 61 times that he halted Operation Sindoor , imagine how many more times he will repeat those claims in the next twelve months,” Ramesh said on X.He said the prime minister was attending the Johannesburg Summit “safely and securely” since “President Trump and the US are boycotting the summit”.“Recall that Mr Modi didn't go to Kuala Lumpur a few days back for the India-Asean Summit since he would then have to come face-to-face with President Trump,” he added.Calling the situation “extraordinary,” Ramesh criticised US Secretary of State Marco Rubio for opposing South Africa’s G20 themes of solidarity, equality and sustainability on grounds that they amounted to anti-Americanism.“It is incidentally the very same Marco Rubio who was the first, at 5:37 PM on May 10th, to announce to the world the abrupt halt to Operation Sindoor,” he said.Ramesh also pointed out that the G20 presidency rotates annually: India assumed it from Indonesia in November 2023 and handed it to Brazil in November 2024. South Africa is now set to hand it to the US, which will not be present at the Summit.“So the next G20 Summit a year from now will be in the US. By then, presumably, India's trade (or)deal with the US will be done. But if in the past seven months, President Trump has claimed 61 times that he halted Operation Sindoor, imagine how many more times he will repeat those claims in the next twelve months,” he reiterated.“Will huglomacy with ‘my good friend’ revive or whether there will be just handshakes or whether Mr. Modi doesn't go — time alone will tell,” he said.In his departure statement, Modi said he would present India’s perspective at the forum in line with its vision of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” and “One Earth, One Family and One Future”.“Will be attending the G20 Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa. This is a particularly special Summit as it is being held in Africa. Various global issues will be discussed there. Will be meeting various world leaders during the Summit,” Modi posted on X.On the sidelines, the prime minister is expected to hold several bilateral meetings and will also attend the sixth IBSA Summit. He is visiting South Africa from November 21–23 at the invitation of President Cyril Ramaphosa.This year’s G20 theme is “Solidarity, Equality and Sustainability”.The Ministry of External Affairs said on Wednesday that Modi is expected to speak in all three sessions of the Summit.The G20 represents 85% of global GDP, 75% of international trade , and two-thirds of the world’s population.

But that is not the only reason for govt to feel confident that the long-promised labour reforms did not meet the fate that befell the farm sector laws.The farm reforms had to be aborted because govt failed to convince farmers that the proposed schemes were meant to help them. Going by the drift of the deliberations in govt over the past several months, the Centre seems to be confident that it will be able to persuade the intended beneficiaries; essentially a sprawling mass of workers who are not part of the organised sector.The proposal to extend social protection to a large and rapidly growing mass of contractual and unorganised workers will be welcomed by millions like those engaged by online platforms.The established trade unions have failed to acquire a following among them.The codes mandate timely wage-payment guarantees by seventh of every month, and allow women to work night shifts across sectors with consent and safety arrangements.This seems to be a combination of multiple factors - their obsession and the resultant dependence on organised labour, difficulty in bringing together those who are not working under one roof and the perception of unionisation as an anti-business pursuit whose worst victims have been workers themselves. But the net result is the presence of a large mass who have not been cared for and who should welcome any effort to improve the deal for them.Denial of minimum wages in large parts of the country and absence of safety norms also give govt an opening to win the support of these sections for its larger agenda, which includes preparing the country to the challenges of an uncertain global milieu.The uncertainty wrought by the Covid pandemic has been compounded by US President Donald Trump's aggressive mercantilism. The risks can be offset by opportunities, but the country does not seem fully prepared to grasp them. For all the talk of China-plus-one and the need to diversify the global supply chain, India has not benefited significantly from the concern about dependence on a ruthless China.The codes seem to make an effort to remedy the situation by introducing flexibility in a labour market which discourages entry of new players and capacity expansion while deterring foreign investors. While the codes address the need to shake up things a bit, govt will have to contend with an opposition, licking its wounds after successive electoral defeats, using them to amplify their ""pro-rich"" charge.","The centre's decision to implement the four labour codes is the second ""big bang"" reform measure since the unsuccessful bid to overhaul agricultural markets.

Key provisions under the codes

Universal minimum wages and mandatory timely wage payments

and mandatory timely wage payments Extension of social security to gig and platform workers

Women allowed to work in all sectors including night shifts, with mandatory safety measures

Free annual health check-ups for workers above 40 years

Fixed-term employees eligible for gratuity after one year

Expanded ESIC coverage, including units with even one hazardous-process worker

Gender-neutral pay and mandated appointment letters for all employees

Trade unions call move ‘undemocratic’, cite ignored consultations

Unions submit charter in pre-budget consultations

NEW DELHI: A joint platform of ten central trade unions on Friday criticised the government’s notification of the four labour codes, calling the move “a deceptive fraud committed against the working people of the nation” and announcing a nationwide day of protest on November 26.The unions allege that the implementation, effective from November 21, is unilateral and “anti-worker, pro-employer” and undermines the welfare-state framework. The statement was issued jointly by INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC.The notification operationalises the Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Social Security Code (2020) and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code (2020), replacing 29 central labour laws.PM Narendra Modi hailed the implementation, calling it “one of the most comprehensive and progressive labour-oriented reforms since Independence” and said the move strengthens workers’ rights and simplifies compliance.“These Codes will serve as a strong foundation for universal social security, minimum and timely payment of wages, safe workplaces and remunerative opportunities for our people, especially Nari Shakti and Yuva Shakti,” PM Modi said on X.""It will build a future-ready ecosystem that protects the rights of workers and strengthens India’s economic growth. These reforms will boost job creation, drive productivity and accelerate our journey towards a Viksit Bharat."" PM Modi added.The government said that the overhaul is intended to expand formalisation, reduce compliance burden and enhance worker protections across sectors, including gig and platform labour, MSMEs, women workers and contract employees.According to the government’s announcement, major changes include:The trade unions called the rollout arbitrary, alleging the decision caters to “employers’ representatives and fringe supporters of the Govt”. They claimed multiple protests and strikes since 2019—including the January 2020 general strike, the November 26 protest with Samyukt Kisan Morcha, and a July 9, 2025 strike claimed to involve “more than 25 crores workers”—were ignored.They said appeals to convene the Indian Labour Conference and repeal the codes, including during pre-budget meetings on November 13 and November 20, received no response.“This Union government has made effective the labour codes to cater to the demands of employers’ representatives… The most undemocratic, most regressive—anti-worker and pro-employer move,” the statement said.“Implementing the codes amid deepening unemployment crisis and rising inflation is nothing short of declaration of war on the working masses,” the platform said, alleging the government acted “in cahoots with capitalist cronies” to return to an “exploitative era of master-servant relationship”.""The working people of India will put up a formidable fight till the labour codes are withdrawn."" the labour unions added.Earlier, the Joint Platform of Central Trade Unions presented its 20-Point Workers Charter at the 2026-27 pre-budget consultation on November 20.The charter sought measures to boost domestic demand amid tariff concerns, stronger auditing of government schemes, and steps to reverse declining audit reports placed before Parliament. The unions demanded wider EPF/ESI coverage, higher statutory thresholds, increased minimum pension and scheme-worker honorariums, and sectoral cesses to fund welfare.They also sought reversal of decriminalisation under the Jan Vishwas Act and demanded job-creation measures in place of public funding through PLI, Capex Incentive and ELI schemes, citing declining employment growth, stagnant real wages and weak manufacturing performance.","Trade unions allege that the implementation is unilateral and “anti-worker, pro-employer” and undermines the welfare-state framework.
