One Month Since Pahalgam Attack: How India Punished, Isolated Pakistan Since April 22 | Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar , speaking at the German Council on foreign relations on Friday, reflected on the recent terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam and India's subsequent strong retaliatory action under Operation Sindoor He described the attack as part of a wider pattern of crossborder terrorism aimed at destabilising the region and harming India's socio-economic fabric.""This was meant to create a fear psychosis and destroy the tourism economy of the Kashmir...and sow religious discord,"" Jaishankar said, specifying the strategic intent behind the assault.He added, ""This was a terrorist attack, which is part of a pattern which has targeted not only J&K but other parts of India as well...what we were responding to were terrorism...and when we responded there were a lot of international understanding...we targeted terrorist headquarters and terror sites. Our campaign is against terrorism, and in this case, terrorists happen to be located in the country next door because that country, for many years, has used terrorism as a tool. ..""Reaffirming India’s position on its right to self-defence, Jaishankar also mentioned the growing international support for India’s counterterrorism stance.""When it comes to terrorism, today, there is virtually no country which would say they approve of what was done and won't condemn it...If I say I have the right to defend myself, my people and secure my country, much of the world will agree with me...Germany does. We are encouraged by the very early condemnation of the terrorist attack, as well as the clear message we got on May 7th and again today from Minister Wadephul that Germany recognises India's right to defend itself. .."" he said.","S jaishankar was speaking at the german council on foreign relations on friday. He described the attack as part of a wider pattern of crossborder terrorism.

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Friday said that the delegation he is leading to the United States will inform global partners about India's own experience with terrorism and the rationale behind its current approach.In a video message posted on X, Tharoor said, ""I'm heading off to five countries leading an all-party delegation to Guyana, Panama, Colombia, Brazil and the United States, and the reason we are going is to speak for the nation, to speak about this horrendous crisis we were subjected to in which our country was attacked by terrorists in the cruellest possible way.""The MP further said that the delegation will highlight the values India stands for and why they need to be upheld in today’s world.Tharoor said, ""We need to speak up with clarity and conviction for our country, for our response and to give the world the message that we will not be silenced by terrorism and we don't want the world to look away either. We don't want indifference to triumph over the truth. It's a mission of peace. It's a mission of hope.

When Indian TV news made social media look sane,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-indian-tv-news-made-social-media-look-sane/articleshow/121372135.cms,"In times of war and other crises, people want news by the minute, but during Op Sindoor some Indian TV channels went overboard, at times running reports of deep strikes by Indian forces without verification, especially on May 8.Late evening, news anchors claimed Indian Navy had destroyed Karachi port, Indian Air Force had downed Pakistani jets, and their pilots had been captured, Pakistan’s PM had sought refuge in a bunker, and its army chief Asim Munir had been ousted in a coup. All of these claims eventually turned out to be false, and were picked up by major Western news organisations as a sign of decay in Indian TV journalism.The Economist has described the disinformation on TV as a “culmination of decades of descent into inanity,” adding that “Indian television achieved the astonishing feat of making social media appear sane.” The New York Times says, “anchors and commentators became cheerleaders for war between two nuclear-armed states. Some well-known TV networks aired unverified information or even fabricated stories amid the burst of nationalistic fervor. ”India had made it clear that Op Sindoor was a nonescalatory strike intended to take out terrorist infrastructure without harming Pakistan’s civilian and military installations.However, the belligerence of news channels suggested something else. “Indians watching television thought their country was only moments away from annihilating Pakistan,” NYT says.The Economist also took note of the commentary by panelists, “If news segments were merely outrageous, commentary was unhinged.” “One anchor demanded: ‘Set fire to Karachi, blow up the entire city.’ On another channel a former army officer called Iran’s foreign minister a ‘son of a pig’, triggering a minor diplomatic incident.” NYT points out that by pushing falsehoods, prominent news channels harm their audience and themselves: “When previously trusted sources become disinformation outlets, it’s a really large problem. ” In The Economist’s view, “Disinformation about drone swarms and mass suicide attacks was amplified rather than squashed. Border communities — which bore the brunt of blackouts and drone attacks — were left groping for facts. The rest of the country was less vulnerable to bombs, but not to lies.”But where TV news failed, newspapers remained true to their ethos of credibility. The Economist notes, “newspapers proved reliable” even though readers got their hands on them many hours after the “skirmishes” in the morning. That’s because the print media sticks to the old rule book of journalism and is also answerable for what it publishes. Every report is carefully fact-checked to safeguard credibility and reputation, built over decades and decades. Op Sindoor isn’t the first time newspapers have proven their credibility. Because processes of newsgathering and factchecking are sacrosanct. Seeing is believing, only if it’s in print.","During op sindoor some indian tv channels went overboard, at times running reports of deep strikes by indian forces without verification.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar has sharply criticised the West for backing military regimes in Pakistan, saying no one has done more to undermine democracy in the country than Western powers.In an interview with Danish daily Politiken, Jaishankar said, ""No one has supported the military regime and undermined democracy in Pakistan in so many ways as much as the West.""He pointed out that Pakistan has violated India's borders in Kashmir since independence in 1947, yet democratic Europe consistently stood by military dictatorships in the region.""That large, democratic Europe has stood side by side with military dictatorships in the region,"" he remarked, calling the threat of terrorism one of the greatest collective challenges the world faces today, alongside climate change, poverty, and the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.Jaishankar, currently on a three-nation Europe tour including the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany, emphasised that India respects sovereignty and the sanctity of international borders.“But my worldview and my view of Europe are shaped by my own experiences. You talk about the inviolability of borders — well, why don't we start with the inviolability of my borders?” he said. “That’s where my world begins,” the minister added.On questions over India’s continued oil imports from Russia, Jaishankar defended the move, turning the lens on Europe’s scramble for Middle Eastern oil.“Wealthy Europe turned to the Middle East because it had a problem with Russia and offered inflated prices to get oil redirected to Europe,” he said. “So what happened was that many countries — not just us — could no longer afford it.”“What was the rest of the world supposed to do? Say ‘okay, we’ll just do without energy because Europeans need it more than us?’” Jaishankar added.ALSO READ | 'There should be no confusion': In Germany, Jaishankar says India will deal with Pakistan bilaterally In a separate interview to Danish broadcaster TV 2, Jaishankar reiterated that the May 10 ceasefire understanding between India and Pakistan was a direct outcome of military-to-military communication — not mediated by any third party.His remarks come amid US president Donald Trump’s claim that Washington helped broker the ceasefire.“We had the conflict for a few days and we resolved that conflict for the moment… through an understanding for the cessation of fighting and military action,” Jaishankar said. “This was something that we negotiated directly between the militaries of the two countries,” he said.Jaishankar said that on May 10, after India’s Operation Sindoor delivered a heavy blow to Pakistan’s terror infrastructure, Pakistan conveyed readiness to halt hostilities.“We hit them very hard on the morning of May 10… and that caused the Pakistanis to say, ‘Ok, we’re prepared to stop the firing and reach an understanding,’” he said.]ALSO READ | 'Is that called mediation?': Ahead of landing in US, Shashi Tharoor's swipe at Donald Trump over ceasefire claim Under Operation Sindoor, India carried out precision strikes on nine terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7, in retaliation to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.Pakistan responded with attempted strikes on Indian military bases on May 8, 9, and 10, all of which were countered by Indian forces.On May 10, foreign secretary Vikram Misri announced that India and Pakistan had agreed to cease all military action across land, air, and sea, with immediate effect.","S jaishankar is currently on a three-nation europe tour including the netherlands, denmark and germany.

Not allowed to do so, they considered returning to Delhi before deciding to continue to Srinagar. During this time, they got multiple warnings like maximum operating speed and angle of attack fault for the Airbus A321neo (VT-IMD). They flew the aircraft manually (without autopilot) till exiting the hailstorm and declared an urgency situation. The aircraft touched down at Srinagar with everyone safe, and the plane’s nose cone (radome) damaged while flying through the hailstorm.The directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA), which is probing the incident, said in a statement Friday. ""While cruising at 36,000 feet, the aircraft entered hailstorm and severe turbulence near Pathankot. As per the crew statement, they requested Indian Air Force northern control for deviating left towards the international border due to weather on the route.However, it was not approved. Later, the crew contacted Lahore (air traffic control or ATC) to enter their airspace to avoid the weather, but the same was refused too. Crew initially attempted to return (to Delhi) but as they were close to the thunderstorm cloud, they decided to penetrate the weather,"" says the report.Subsequently, they encountered hailstorm and severe turbulence. ""The crew chose to continue at same heading to exit the weather by the shortest route towards Srinagar. While in the thunderstorm cloud, warnings of angle of attack fault, alternate law protection lost, and backup speed scale (being) unreliable were triggered. Due to updraft and down draft encountered by the aircraft, the autopilot tripped and aircraft speed had wide variations. As a result, maximum operating speed/maximum operating Mach warnings and repeated stall warnings were triggered.""ALSO READ | Pakistan refused to bail out IndiGo flight hit by sudden hailstorm During this period, the DGCA statement says, the plane’s rate of descent reached 8,500 feet per minute. “Crew flew the aircraft manually till they exited the hailstorm.

She claimed that although she ranked second in the country among expert fighter controllers and had served over 13.5 years, she was being discharged due to a 2019 policy change that denied her a permanent commission.“Our Air Force is one of the best organisations in the world. Officers are very commendable. The quality of coordination they have exhibited - I think it's unparalleled. Therefore, we always salute them. They are a big asset for the nation. They are the nation, in a way. Because of them, we are able to sleep at night,” Justice Kant said.The bench expressed concern over the uncertainty faced by SSC officers, stating that a long tenure without permanent commission needed to be addressed.“That sense of uncertainty may not be good for the armed forces. It's a layman's suggestion, because we are not experts. On minimum benchmarks, there can't be a compromise,” Justice Kant added.Representing Pandey, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy argued that her client was an expert fighter controller, who had played a key role in the Integrated Air Command and Control Systems (IACCS) deployed during Operations Sindoor and Balakot.Pandey’s case, Guruswamy said, was affected by policy shifts that gave her just a month’s notice to end her career despite her stellar service record.Appearing for the government and the IAF, additional solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati said that the officer had been found unfit by the selection board and had approached the apex court directly without first filing a representation. She also confirmed that a second selection board would now review Pandey’s case.Bhati, herself from a military background, acknowledged the difficult position of SSC officers but explained, “There are a limited number of posts. It's a very steep pyramid structure.”She noted that typically, 90–95 per cent of officers considered for permanent commission are found fit, but only a few miss out due to comparative merit.Justice Kant responded, urging a more accommodating approach, “You can have a policy of taking that many SCC officers who can be accommodated in the Permanent Commission, if they are found suitable. If you have 100 SCC officers, you should have the capacity to take 100 of them to the permanent commission.”He also emphasised that women officers have performed exceedingly well and highlighted the need for systemic capacity to retain them.The court directed that Wing Commander Pandey must not be released from service until further orders and posted the matter for hearing on August 6.However, the bench clarified that no equity would be created in the officer’s favour at this stage and that all contentions remain open.","Wing commander nikita pandey alleged discrimination in being denied permanent commission.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force sources on Friday said that Lahore air traffic did not permit IndiGo’s Delhi-Srinagar flight of May 21 to use Pakistan airspace to escape the hailstorm, citing airspace ban, news agency ANI reported.Air Force sources said, ""NOTAM A0220/25 issued by Pakistani Civil Aviation Authorities was in vogue upto 23 May 25 midnight (2359 hrs), which mentions ""Pakistan airspace is not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators, including military flights."" Northern Area Control advised the Indigo crew within the frame of the NOTAM (which is also a regular planning feature for all airlines in their route planning), ensuring the safety of aircraft and passengers. """"The aircraft was immediately assisted in coordinating their route diversion by contacting Delhi Area and passing the requisite contact frequencies of Lahore control for an overflight weather diversion request. Once Lahore refused overflight clearance, and the aircraft proceeded towards Srinagar, the flight was subsequently professionally assisted till a safe landing at Srinagar airfield by giving control vectors and groundspeed readouts,"" they added.Earlier, DGCA said the aircraft was cruising at an altitude of approximately 36,000 feet near Punjab's Pathankot when it ran into a thunderstorm and hailstorm.Experiencing severe turbulence, the crew first requested the Northern ATC of the Indian Air Force to allow the flight to deviate towards the International Border.However, the request was denied because it was felt that the plane would face danger from the Pakistan side due to the recently witnessed intense hostilities between India and the neighbouring country during Operation Sindoor.The pilot then sought permission from the Lahore air traffic control (ATC) to briefly venture into Pakistani airspace to avoid the storm. But it was refused, too.Meanwhile, Pakistan extended its closure of its airspace for Indian flights until June 24, according to a new NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) issued by the Pakistan Airports Authority.The extension follows the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) rules that restrict such closure for a month at a time.""The ban on Indian aircraft flying over Pakistan airspace has been extended until 4:59 am June 24, 2025,"" the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said in a statement here.All aircraft that are Indian-registered, operated, owned, or leased will remain subject to the ban, the PAA statement said.""This ban will also apply to Indian military aircraft.

Indigo, Air India Cancel Flights Amid Drone Scare Even After Ceasefire | Is Flying Still Safe?

NEW DELHI: The pilot of IndiGo's Delhi-Srinagar flight on Wednesday requested permission from Lahore ATC to briefly enter Pakistan airspace to escape turbulence after being caught in a sudden hailstorm. Sources said Lahore ATC denied the request, prompting the Airbus A321 pilot to declare an emergency with Srinagar ATC.The flight, carrying over 220 passengers, including Trinamool MPs, landed safely in Srinagar, but not without damage - the aircraft's radome, or nose cone, was left badly battered by the storm.A senior official from Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said, ""We've asked IndiGo for a detailed report and a probe is underway. The aircraft (VT-IMD) remains grounded in Srinagar. The pilots are being praised for their presence of mind and professionalism in ensuring everyone's safety.""IndiGo, in an official statement, said: ""Flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar on May 21 encountered a sudden hailstorm and landed safely at Srinagar International Airport. All passengers were well attended to upon landing and no injuries were reported.The aircraft is undergoing inspection and maintenance, and will resume service once it receives the necessary clearances.""Although Pakistan airspace is shut for Indian carriers, aviation experts argue that emergency requests like the one made by the IndiGo pilot should not be refused in the interest of passenger safety.Aviation regulator DGCA has directed commercial airlines and charter and private jet operators to ensure aircraft window shades, barring those for emergency exit-row seats, are closed during take-off and landing at defence airports, “particularly those near the western border”.The rule is meant to “enhance operational safety and prevent unintentional sharing of security-related information by general public/crew”. Failure to comply will invite legal action, DGCA said.Pakistani drone and missile attacks in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor led to 32 airports in north, central and western India — including defence airbases with civil enclaves in Srinagar, Jammu, Leh, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Gwalior and Hindon — being shut for a few days. While operations at these airports have resumed, security concerns remain.“These instructions shall apply post opening of Indian airspace for commercial operations to all scheduled, scheduled commuter, and non-scheduled aircraft operating from defence airfields. All passenger window shades, where applicable, shall remain closed until the aircraft is airborne and has crossed an altitude of 10,000 feet during departure, or during arrival, after it descends below 10,000 feet and reaches the parking bay at the civil terminal,” the order states.In normal circumstances, safety protocol mandates all window shades remain open during take-off and landing. This is to ensure passengers and crew can assess external conditions, such as fires or debris, and identify exits in case of an emergency evacuation. DGCA order for civilian operations at defence airfields also bars photography.","Indigo flight 6e2142 from delhi to srinagar hit severe mid-air turbulence due to a hailstorm.

What is S-400 Sudarshan Chakra?

NEW DELHI: National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval is expected to visit Moscow next week, where he is likely to press the Russian government for the expedited delivery of the remaining two S-400 air defence systems.The NSA's visit comes amid reports that India may place fresh orders for additional units of the same system to bolster its military capabilities.The trip will follow a visit by a delegation of Indian Members of Parliament to Moscow, beginning Thursday.Doval’s visit carries added significance in the wake of India’s recent air strikes in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor . The operation saw the use of BrahMos missiles, developed jointly by India and Russia, and the S-400 system, among other Russian-origin defence platforms that played a key role in the conflict.India is now looking to deepen its political and strategic coordination with Moscow, particularly in countering terror infrastructure based in Pakistan. Sources said that New Delhi expects Russia’s continued support in line with the longstanding India-Russia security partnership.As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a major Eurasian power, Russia has historically played a balancing role in the region.The Indo-Russian relationship has frequently acted as a counterweight to other global powers in Eurasia. Moscow has also been one of India’s most consistent partners in counter-terrorism cooperation over the decades.Doval is expected to take part in the 13th International Meeting of High Representatives for Security Issues, scheduled to be held in Moscow from May 27 to 29. The event will be chaired by Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu. On the sidelines, Doval is slated to hold bilateral meetings with various national security counterparts, including Shoigu himself.The S-400 ""Sudarshan Chakra"" is an Indian name given to the S-400 Triumf air defence missile system acquired from Russia. The term ""Sudarshan Chakra"" draws from the Epic Mahabharata, symbolising precision, speed, and lethal capability, qualities that closely reflect the S-400's operational strengths.Developed by Russia's Almaz-Antey, the S-400 is among the most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile systems in the world. India signed a $5.43 billion deal with Russia in 2018 to procure five S-400 units, with the first system deployed in Punjab in 2021 to bolster defences against threats from Pakistan and China. The S-400 can engage aerial targets at ranges of up to 400 km and detect threats as far as 600 km away.It supports four different types of missiles, enabling it to target everything from aircraft and drones to cruise and ballistic missiles. Equipped with sophisticated phased-array radar, the system can track over 100 targets simultaneously and is mounted on mobile launchers for rapid repositioning.The deployment of the S-400 significantly strengthens India’s multi-layered air defence capabilities, offering a strategic edge in protecting key military and civilian assets. It is widely regarded as a game-changer in South Asia’s aerial defence landscape.","Nsa ajit doval is expected to visit moscow next week.
