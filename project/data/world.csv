As IndiGo Spirals Into Crisis, PM Modi Stresses Rules Must Ease Citizens’ Lives, Not Burden Them

NEW DELHI: The ministry of civil aviation has constituted an oversight team to monitor IndiGo’s operations amid large-scale disruptions reported across multiple airports.In an order dated December 10, 2025, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announced that the move aims to address passenger inconvenience caused by flight delays and cancellations.The team comprises senior officials, including deputy and senior flight operations inspectors.Two members from the group will be stationed at IndiGo’s corporate office in Emaar Capital Tower 2, Gurgaon, on a daily basis.They will review key parameters such as total fleet, network details, number of pilots, crew availability, standby crew strength, split duties, training status, and all unplanned leave taken by crew. The officials will also monitor total daily flights, available crew and sectors affected due to manpower shortage.In addition to the oversight team, the DGCA has deployed Aishveer Singh, Deputy Director (AED), and Mani Bhushan, Senior Statistical Officer, to the same office. Their mandate includes tracking domestic and international cancellation status, refund progress through airlines and online travel agents, on-time performance, compensation provided to passengers under Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR), and baggage return timelines.Both teams are required to submit a daily report by 6 pm to the Joint Director General.The instructions have been issued with the approval of the Director General (Civil Aviation), the order stated.The flyers faced severe inconvenience on December 2 when IndiGo cancelled thousands of flights nationwide after failing to adjust operations to tighter safety regulations.The fallout has caused major bottlenecks at airports, sent airfares soaring on other carriers and triggered widespread complaints over poor communication, long queues and baggage chaos.The DGCA has already issued show-cause notices to Elbers and Chief Operating Officer Isidro Proqueras, who is also the airline’s Accountable Manager, while the Civil Aviation Ministry has capped fares and ordered flight curtailment to “stabilise the airline’s operations”.","The team comprises senior officials, including deputy and senior flight operations inspectors.

IndiGo’s 5% Flight Cut Explained: Causes, Impact on Routes, and the Ripple Effects on Passengers

NEW DELHI: Under govt scrutiny for unprecedented flight disruptions, IndiGo chairman Vikram Singh Mehta on Wednesday denied the same were deliberate. Apologising multiple times in his about 8-minute video message, he said “external technical experts (will) work with the management; help determine the root causes, and ensure corrective action so that this level of disruption never occurs again. ”The DGCA is probing IndiGo’s fiasco that unfolded this month. It is examining whether the airline caused the same to avoid abiding by the new pilot rest rules. Mehta denied the same.“Over the past week there has been a ot of criticism. Some fair. Some not. The fair criticism is that the airline let down you down. We owe answers to customers, govt, shareholders, employees. We will examine every aspect of what went wrong. We will learn from it,” he said.“However, there are some allegations that are untrue. That IndiGo engineered the crisis. That we tried to influence govt rules. That we compromised safety. That the board was not involved. These claims are incorrect. IndiGo has followed the pilot fatigue rules as they came into effect. We operated under the new rules throughout, both in July and in Nov. We did not attempt to bypass them.Nor did we anything that impacted our unblemished track record of safety. The disruptions of last week did not happen because of any deliberate actions,” said the former chairman of Shell Group of companies in India.“On Dec 3, an unexpected chain of events led to large scale flight cancellations. This continued into Dec 4 & 5. Thousands of our passengers were left stranded. We did not meet your expectations during those days. This happened because of a combination of of internal and external events including minor technical glitches; schedule changes linked to start of winter; adverse weather conditions; increased congestion in the aviation system and implementation of and operation under the updated crew rostering rules. This is not an excuse, this is simply the truth. This combination of events pushed our systems beyond their limits,” Mehta said.He said the board was constantly involved in tackling the issue and that things are back on track much before expected. The airline operated 1,900 flights to 138 destinations with normal punctuality, he said.Although he admitted: “Last week’s events are a blemish on this company’s pristine record. Our compay has erred. It has to win back your trust. It will not be easy. It will depend on actions and not words. It will be a journey.”","The dgca is probing indigo’s fiasco that unfolded this month. It is examining whether the airline caused the same to avoid abiding by the new pilot rest rules.

'Execute Tomorrow...': Candace Owens Claims Charlie Kirk Sent Alarming Texts Before Assassination

Erika Kirk tells Fox News she wants “one thing” kept private as Candace Owens links message to herself







Candace Owens reacted fast after Erika Kirk went on Fox News and asked people to stop searching for the secret place where her husband Charlie Kirk is buried. Erika Kirk told the public she wanted “one thing” left private for her family. But soon after, Candace Owens posted a video saying Erika Kirk’s words were really pointed at her. Candace Owens said in her new clip, “Super fun show today. You’re probably seeing the clips … it’s about me. It’s indirect, but it’s also about me. And don’t worry, in case you think it’s not about me, she is going to name check me on stage.”This reaction came as many conspiracy theories continue to grow around Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on September 10 while giving a speech at Utah Valley University. His body’s location has never been shared. This has only made more people online push strange theories, something Erika Kirk finally addressed on TV.When Erika Kirk sat with host Harris Faulkner on Fox News, she looked tired and upset as she spoke about the rumors. Faulkner asked her, “Talk to me about this part of the conspiracies that are out there.This disturbing part that people are trying to guess where Charlie is.”Erika Kirk answered with strong emotion:“Can I have one thing? Can I have one thing? Can my children have one thing? Everything was public. We will be building the most beautiful memorial for my husband at Turning Point USA… But can I have one thing? Can my babies have one thing where we hold it sacred?”She also said she feared someone might try to damage Charlie’s grave.“Where my husband is laid to rest, where I don’t have to be worried about some secular revolutionary coming and destroying my husband’s grave while my daughter is sitting there praying. One thing. This is my husband.”Soon after Charlie Kirk’s death, Erika Kirk received money from life insurance and public donations.While Erika Kirk asked for privacy, Candace Owens continued to question the official story of Charlie Kirk’s murder. Owens has pushed many unproven ideas, saying the killing was a “hit” and claiming she got secret “military” tips.Also Read: “Some Ignorant Black…”: Nick Fuentes Warns He Will Expose Candace Owens If TPUSA Livestream On Charlie Kirk Fails",Candace owens fires back hard as erika kirk asks the public to end charlie kirk conspiracy stories.

Her growing popularity, fueled by TikTok and her charm, shows that a personal touch can make social media magic.

Rising combined wealth and how their earnings continue to expand each year

Properties, assets and lifestyle choices that continue drawing attention

The growing interest around John Cena and Shay Shariatzadeh’s financial journey has intensified in 2025 as new reports highlight their rising net worth, expanding properties, and steadily increasing earnings, creating wider curiosity about how their individual careers continue shaping their shared financial path. Together, their lifestyle reflects a balance between high earnings, stable investments, and carefully chosen luxury, allowing them to maintain comfort without relying on constant public display or extravagant change. Let’s take a look at where the power couple stands today.Fresh evaluations for 2025 suggest that John Cena holds a personal net worth close to $80 million, supported by his long wrestling career, expanding Hollywood roles and multiple commercial partnerships that continue generating consistent income for him across different categories of the entertainment industry.Shay Shariatzadeh contributes an estimated $2 million, which comes from her engineering work, strategic career moves, and selective investments that reflect a steady approach rather than a public lifestyle focused on expensive displays or high-profile spending choices.Together, their combined worth reaches nearly $82 million, showing how their financial paths complement one another through two very different professional worlds that still manage to work in harmony.Cena’s earnings remain anchored by an annual WWE salary reportedly around $8.5 million, supported by bonuses linked to special appearances and merchandise sales that continue performing strongly across global markets due to his long-standing popularity.John Cena’s well-known Florida property, purchased many years ago for roughly $525,000, has grown significantly in value and now sits near $4 million, featuring spacious interiors, multiple recreational spaces and design upgrades that reflect his preference for calm surroundings rather than extravagant display.The home includes an indoor pool, outdoor pool, cigar room, extended garage, and a guest area, allowing him a private retreat while balancing entertainment commitments and travel schedules across Hollywood and wrestling venues. Cena also owns a residence in San Diego valued within the high-end category, although he maintains a low-key approach toward detailing the property publicly, which matches the couple’s gradually shifting preference for privacy.Shay Shariatzadeh, while less public about real estate, aligns her lifestyle with practical investments and career growth, showing a contrast to Cena’s entertainment-driven earnings but still contributing meaningfully to their shared financial foundation through consistent professional progress.Also Read: John Cena to still be affiliated with WWE after retirement?

Trump FREEZES Green Card, Citizenship Applications From THESE High-Risk Countries After DC Shooting

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled what he called the ""Trump Gold Card,"" announcing that people will be able to apply for Gold Card citizenship starting Wednesday afternoon.In a post on Truth Social, Trump promoted the new immigration pathway, saying, ""THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT’S TRUMP GOLD CARD IS HERE TODAY! A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""Speaking further about the initiative, Trump said, ""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government... It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France...

The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even.""Trump has previously spoken about a Gold Card–style visa program designed to attract wealthy or highly skilled foreign nationals. The broader objective has been to bring top talent and significant foreign investment into the United States by offering a faster pathway to residency.While full details of the newly announced Gold Card are still unclear, earlier proposals included substantial financial thresholds: individual applicants were expected to donate $1 million to the US Treasury, and corporate-sponsored applicants needed to contribute $2 million, in addition to a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee.A third tier, the Platinum Card, had also been proposed, allowing an individual to spend up to 270 days a year in the US without becoming subject to US tax on foreign income, in exchange for $5 million. It remains unclear whether this tier is part of the current rollout.The website clarifies that simply having the money does not guarantee entry into the US, a point that had been less explicit in earlier announcements. Applicants must still qualify for permanent residency, be legally admissible, and have an available visa slot.Under US immigration rules, Gold Card holders will effectively fall under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories. These visas are typically meant for individuals with “extraordinary ability,” including top researchers, distinguished professors, accomplished artists and leading business figures, and they provide a route to permanent residency and eventual citizenship.","Us president donald trump on wednesday unveiled what he called the ""trump gold card"" people will be able to apply for gold card citizenship starting wednesday afternoon.

'Best Offers Ever': US Official Reveals India Trade Talks Details, Says It Marks Unusual Opening

India ‘difficult nut to crack’ for US?

India-US trade deal: Calling India a ‘tough nut’ to crack, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Tuesday also said that India gives some of the ‘best offers’. Greer’s comments assume significance at a time when a US delegation is in India for another round of talks for a bilateral trade agreement between the two countries.The Donald Trump administration has imposed a 50% tariff rate on Indian exports to the US. 25% of this tariff is for India’s crude oil imports from Russia, which the US wants brought to a complete halt. Trade deal talks between the two countries have continued, and both sides are looking to seal the first tranche this year.The USTR Jamieson Greer has indicated that India's proposals for the planned trade agreement are the ""best"" they have received, as discussions between both nations commence for a two-day period in India.During a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee session in Washington on Tuesday, Greer noted India's reluctance to open the market for specific row crops, meat and other agricultural products. The US row crops comprise corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton.""They have been very difficult nut to crack...but they have been quite forward leaning....the type of offers that they have been talking to us about ...have been the best we have ever received as a country, so I think that is a viable alternative market,"" he said according to a PTI report.The American team, led by US Deputy Trade Representative Rick Switzer, started discussions with Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal on Wednesday. They assessed the ongoing agreement negotiations, aiming to establish a mutually advantageous trade arrangement.The commerce department said via social media: ""The two sides exchanged views on matters related to India-US trade and economic ties, including on the ongoing negotiations for a mutually beneficial Bilateral Trade Agreement.""Indian manufacturers and exporters anticipate the swift completion of negotiations and subsequent deal announcement, as elevated import duties negatively impact their US-bound shipments.Despite diversifying into alternative markets to sustain export earnings, the United States remains crucial for Indian trade, representing approximately 18 per cent of the nation's total exports.Initially, the US levied a 25 per cent duty on Indian products, citing trade deficit concerns amounting to $46 billion in 2024-25. Subsequently, an additional 25 per cent penalty was applied on India for its Russian oil purchases. India maintains that addressing these tariff issues is essential for finalising the initial phase of the trade agreement.The US seeks reduced duties on agricultural items including almonds, corn and apples, alongside industrial products. India remains firm in its opposition to concessions in agriculture and dairy sectors, asserting its commitment to protect farmers and MSMEs interests.During the Pravasi Rajasthani Divas in Jaipur, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal indicated that discussions with the US regarding the proposed bilateral trade agreement are advancing.""Talks are continuously progressing with them. We are moving forward towards a bilateral trade agreement,"" Goyal informed reporters.Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia Brendan Lynch, the US' chief negotiator, is participating in the US delegation. The Indian side is represented by Joint Secretary Darpan Jain from the Department of Commerce. This marks the US officials' second visit following the implementation of increased tariffs, with their previous visit occurring on September 16.Agrawal previously indicated that whilst the Bilateral Trade Agreement requires time, India continues extensive negotiations with the US regarding a framework trade deal to resolve reciprocal tariff issues affecting Indian exporters.Currently, India and the US are conducting parallel negotiations on two fronts: a framework trade deal focusing on tariffs and a comprehensive trade agreement. Officials were instructed to negotiate an agreement following directions from both nations' leaders in February.The initial phase of the agreement was scheduled for completion by autumn 2025. Currently, six rounds of negotiations have happened. The agreement seeks to increase bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, up from the present $191 billion.In 2024-25, the US maintained its position as India's primary trading partner for the fourth successive year, with bilateral trade reaching $131.84 billion ($86.5 billion exports).The US represents approximately 18 per cent of India's total goods exports, 6.22 per cent of imports, and 10.73 per cent of total merchandise trade.October witnessed a continued decline in India's merchandise exports to the US, decreasing by 8.58 per cent to $6.3 billion, marking the second consecutive monthly reduction.","The ustr jamieson greer has indicated that india's proposals for the planned trade agreement are the ""best"" they have received.

US Federal Reserve cuts rate: What does it mean for Indian stock markets? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-federal-reserve-cuts-rate-what-does-it-mean-for-indian-stock-markets-explained/articleshow/125901249.cms,"Most experts believe that a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve is a positive signal for the Indian markets. (AI image)



US Federal Reserve’s rate cut decision:

What it means for Indian stock markets

The US Federal Reserve cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in the latest monetary policy review. A split US Federal Reserve announced its third successive interest rate cut of the year, whilst indicating a potential pause in future cuts. The rate cut, reducing the range to between 3.50 percent and 3.75 percent, brings it to the lowest level in approximately three years - matched market predictions.A rate cut by the central bank of the world’s largest economy has implications for markets globally and India is no different. Indian equity benchmarks, Sensex and Nifty , are already down 2.05% and 2.16% from their lifetime highs hit a few days ago. The markets have been bleeding despite a repo rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Continuous outflow of foreign capital, rupee depreciation, and lack of clarity on the India-US trade deal are acting as negative triggers for the stock market. What does the US Fed’s rate cut mean for the Indian stock markets? We take a look:US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank finds itself ""well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves from here."" The Federal Reserve reintroduced specific phrasing from late 2024 in its policy statement, suggesting a temporary halt to rate cuts.Powell emphasised that the committee remains suitably placed to assess the ""extent and timing of additional adjustments based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.""The Federal Reserve projected one rate cut for the upcoming year, whilst highlighting increased employment-related concerns in its latest policy announcement.Most experts believe that a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve is a positive signal for the Indian markets.Vijay Singh Gour, Research Analyst at Mirae Asset Sharekhan explains that the Fed’s monetary policy influences India's financial markets, mainly by driving capital flows.The market had anticipated a 25 basis point rate cut, which would ease global liquidity. Such a cut is generally positive for Indian equities because lower US Treasury yields make dollar-denominated assets less appealing, encouraging Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) to increase allocations to emerging markets like India, thus boosting inflows and strengthening the Rupee, Vijay Singh Gour told TOI.“The 25 bps rate cut from the Federal Reserve is likely to provide some relief to the Indian currency and the FII sell off. This shall ease some pressure on Indian markets which are expecting some positive triggers,” says Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Group. “Also the Fed rate cut further opens up the space for RBI for a rate cut in the current low inflation environment to support growth,” he tells TOI.Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited cautions that the rate cut bodes well for the Indian markets, but the net impact may be muted. “The Fed’s decision to cut rates by 25 bps was on expected lines. The noteworthy part of the decision is the 9-3 vote, which signals a tough road ahead for further rate cuts. The FOMC’s dot plot indicates two more rate cuts - one in 2026 and another in 2027. However, this might change since the Fed chair has clearly indicated that “ we are well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves,” he tells TOI.The Fed decision, though favourable from the market perspective, is unlikely to have a significant impact on the Indian market, which is being weighed down by the sustained selling by FIIs, the huge supply of paper from IPOs and the poor earnings growth of the last six quarters, he feels.“Of these, earnings growth is the most significant, and this is going to change for the better in the coming quarters. A slowdown in IPOs is likely in 2026, and along with this when earnings growth picks up, the market will respond positively. Weakness in the market now presents buying opportunities in high quality stocks, particularly in largecaps and selectively in midcaps,” VK Vijayakumar adds.","Us federal reserve cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in the latest monetary policy review.

How the market reacted?





The United States seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday, marking a dramatic escalation in his administration’s pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela.“As you probably know, we have just seized a tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized, actually,” Trump said during a White House event on a new luxury visa programme.Trump declined to say who owned the tanker. But when asked about the ship’s oil, he said: “Well, we keep it, I guess.”Meanwhile, hours after Trump's statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi shared a video in a post in X and said that the government executed a seizure warrant on a tanker headed from Venezuela and Iran.""Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, and the United States Coast Guard, with support from the Department of War, executed a seizure warrant for a crude oil tanker used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.""""For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.This seizure, completed off the coast of Venezuela, was conducted safely and securely—and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues,"" she added.A video posted by Bondi showed armed operators descending ropes from helicopters onto the deck of the vessel before entering what appeared to be the bridge.The reports came two days after Trump declined to rule out deploying troops in an interview with POLITICO.In the interview, Trump repeatedly declined to rule out sending troops to bring down Maduro, whom he accused of exporting drugs and criminals to the United States.Since then, the administration restored sanctions, bolstered the US military presence in the Caribbean and used lethal force against vessels it alleged were trafficking drugs in concert with the Venezuelan military. Officials said the measures aimed to pressure Maduro to cede power to the opposition.According to the NBC, as soon as the reports being circulated online, the oil prices began steadily rising, climbing more than 1.3% or about 75 cents, as of 3:45 p.m. ET.US crude prices jumped 1 percent Wednesday afternoon, to just under $59 a barrel.As per the reports from Politico, the seizure could put pressure on shippers to stop taking Venezuelan crude, potentially tightening global oil supplies. U.S. crude prices jumped 1 percent Wednesday afternoon, to just under $59 a barrel.Trump, who has repeatedly pointed to declining gasoline prices amid voters’ complaints about the rising cost of living, repeated his claim Wednesday that gasoline prices had dropped to $1.99 a gallon, though data collected by the American Automobile Association put the national average slightly below $3 per gallon.","The united states seized an oil tanker off the coast of venezuela, president donald trump announced wednesday.

Pros and Cons of a Mets–Tucker Marriage

Pros for the New York Mets

Cons to Consider

Why This Move Changes the Mets’ Entire Offseason

My Opinion On the Winners Across the Board

The’ 2025 offseason has spiraled into full-blown unrest, with franchise cornerstones Pete Alonso and Edwin Díaz walking out the door and fans pleading for a turnaround. The front office’s search for a reset has now zeroed in on Chicago Cubs outfielder Kyle Tucker, whose free-agency buzz has grown into the most plausible redemption swing left on the board. While not a traditional trade scenario, the Mets’ offseason moves and recent salary shuffling have created a sign-and-trade-like narrative, keeping Tucker at the center of New York’s winter chaos.Pete Alonso’s move to Baltimore and Edwin Díaz’s decision to join the Dodgers blew open New York Mets’ roster and public perception. As frustration mounted, Kyle Tucker quickly surfaced as the organization’s most realistic path to salvaging what has been labeled a horrendous winter. With Juan Soto already in the fold, pairing him with Tucker offers a level of star power the Mets have lacked since their postseason aspirations first unraveled.Unlike Alonso and Díaz, Tucker is a free agent after his stint with the Cubs. That eliminates a true trade market, but chatter around Brandon Nimmo and recent payroll-balancing moves has created a backdrop where a sign-and-trade structure feels possible.Nimmo’s previous move to Texas for Marcus Semien is already believed to reset the outfield calculus.Insiders project Kyle Tucker’s next contract around 10 years and $400 million, with opt-outs after year six. That number blows past his previous $16 million arbitration figure and signals the New York Mets’ willingness to correct their early-winter missteps with an aggressive, franchise-shifting offer.There is no traditional trade in play, but the Mets could move Nimmo’s money or package prospects to create room, effectively manufacturing the feel of a sign-and-trade. This aligns with their recent attempts to dodge luxury-tax complications while eyeing significant CBA shifts.• Tucker is a free agent; no prospect haul is required unless a sign-and-trade structure emerges• Mets need immediate star talent, not long-term development pieces• The Alonso and Díaz exits demand a big splash• Soto-Tucker pairing elevates Mets’ lineup instantly• Luxury-tax maneuvering becomes easier with an outgoing contract like Nimmo’sFor New York, the appeal is obvious. Tucker brings elite contact quality, reliable power, strong WAR output, and defense that anchors an outfield suddenly thin after losing Nimmo and absorbing a .240 team outfield OPS dip. His age also works in New York’s favor; at 28 (turning 29 in January), he’s entering his statistical prime.For Tucker, a move to Queens repositions him from an injury-hit stretch in Chicago to a major-market contender. The Cubs clear payroll, and other bidders like the Dodgers and Blue Jays simply pivot elsewhere. It is one of the rare big-money maneuverings where no party truly loses.Kyle Tucker’s production speaks for itself, even while battling injuries during his Chicago tenure. His 2024 numbers approached MVP levels, and his 2025 output remained strong across 136 games.The metrics reinforce his value as a consistent middle-order force and dependable defender. A 4.7-WAR output in just 78 games in 2024 hints at his ceiling when fully healthy.• High-end defense in right field• Left-handed bat pairs perfectly with Soto’s profile• Contact-power blend fits NL East pitching• Prime-age window supports a 2035 competitive arc• Front-office redemption amid public backlash• Replaces both star power and OPS production lost this winter• Injury history includes shin and hand fractures• Around $40 million AAV tightens payroll flexibility• Citi Field’s left-field dimensions may mute some of his pull power• Heavy long-term commitment after losing Alonso’s more predictable aging curveThe New York Mets still view the upside as overwhelming, especially given the organizational pressure to respond after losing two franchise pillars.A Tucker signing shifts the story from dysfunction to revival. It transforms a front office under fire into one that retained its aggression despite public scrutiny. For a team that has been criticized as the biggest disappointment in New York sports this year, the optics of a Soto-Tucker outfield erase the perception of surrender.This is not simply replacing Alonso or Díaz; it’s rewriting the offseason narrative altogether.• Mets stabilize their long-term core• Tucker secures a mega-deal and steps into a marquee market• Cubs gain payroll relief• Dodgers, Jays, and others redirect without significant lossEven in a hypothetical structure, the move creates the rare scenario where every party lands on its feet. For the New York Mets, though, the stakes are far higher. This isn’t just about adding an All-Star; it’s about rescuing an offseason that fans have labeled an embarrassment.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Chicago Cubs proposed to bag $6.5 million Washington Nationals All-Star to bolster squad and improve title odds If the Mets close on Kyle Tucker, they flip a disastrous winter into a defining moment. It recasts the franchise from reeling to reloaded and positions New York for a run that extends well into the next decade. In a market begging for hope, Tucker becomes the most impactful answer available.","Kyle tucker is a free agent after his stint with the chicago cubs.

Owens criticized the slain activist's widow, Erika Kirk, for denouncing conspiracy theories, prompting Loomer to defend Erika and accuse Owens of jealousy. Authorities maintain a single suspect is in custody, yet the dispute highlights the increasingly personal fallout.

Laura Loomer defends Erika Kirk while slamming Candace Owens’ motives and theories about Charlie Kirk’s death







The fallout surrounding Charlie Kirk’s assassination has taken yet another dramatic turn, this time pulling two high-profile conservative personalities into a public feud. On December 10, Candace Owens used her podcast to criticize Erika Kirk, the CEO of Turning Point USA and widow of the slain activist, after Erika denounced the conspiracy theories swirling around her husband’s killing.Owens suggested Erika had “missed the mark,” signaling yet another escalation in her long list of unproven theories that have pointed fingers at everyone from foreign intelligence agencies to the US military. But her comments did not go unchallenged. Conservative commentator Laura Loomer fired back almost immediately, igniting a new wave of tension within the right-wing media space.Erika Kirk had recently spoken out on Fox News, urging the public to stop amplifying conspiracies about her husband’s September 10 assassination at Utah Valley University. Her stance directly contradicted Owens, who has repeatedly floated dramatic and consistently unsupported claims since the shooting.Owens addressed Erika’s remarks on her own show, saying she believed Kirk’s widow had “missed the mark,” but added the “good news” was that she finally had clarity about Erika’s plans for TPUSA moving forward.Ahead of the episode, Owens teased her followers on X with, “Erika Kirk GOES OFF on ‘conspiracy theorists’ (read: me)… And to be honest, it’s weird.”That post set the stage for what would become a heated exchange.Loomer, who has criticized Owens multiple times in the past, responded forcefully. Sharing Owens’ post, she wrote, “As I have been saying, Candace Owens @RealCandaceO is jealous Charlie Married Erika instead of her.” She then urged Owens to back off, adding, “Hasn’t she suffered enough? This is ghoul behavior.”Loomer’s comments resonated widely, with many echoing the sentiment that Owens’ repeated accusations, none supported by evidence, were compounding the distress of a grieving widow. Owens has not directly responded to Loomer, but she continues to hint that she will release more “information” related to Kirk’s death.Meanwhile, authorities maintain that Tyler Robinson, currently in custody, is the sole suspect. As official investigations proceed, the public feud between Owens and Loomer underscores how polarized and personal the fallout from Kirk’s assassination has become.Also Read: Candace Owens intensifies controversy with new claims dragging Charlie Kirk’s security provider in new assassination claims","Conservative personalities candace owens and laura loomer are embroiled in a public feud.
