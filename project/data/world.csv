Donald Trump’s New Envoy To India Sergio Gor Arrives In Delhi With Big Agenda On Trade And Security

NEW DELHI: The underlying priority of India’s trade negotiations is to secure fair and balanced agreements in the best interest of the nation and the people, a top PMO official said on Saturday, asserting that the economy continues to demonstrate remarkable dynamism and resilience amid global uncertainty.Delivering the Kale memorial lecture at the Punebased Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, principal secretary-2 to PM Modi Shaktikanta Das said the global economy is going through a phase of unprecedented uncertainty and fundamental reset.“A rules-based trading framework that promoted globalisation and free trade for over eight decades is under challenge. Established rules are being increasingly questioned while new norms are yet to be firmly established,” said the former RBI governor. He said the pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia conflict have accelerated the move toward self-reliance.“This transformation is also evident in the growing influence of regional trade agreements (RTAs), which reflect a shift towards more fragmented yet practical trade alliances,” said Das, adding that India is a signatory to 14 free trade agreements (FTAs) and six preferential trade agreements (PTAs), with the UK, Australia and the UAE being the recent additions among FTAs.He said that at present, India is in free trade agreement negotiations with the US, the EU, Peru, Oman, New Zealand, among several others.Das said that amid the uncertain global environment, India continues to demonstrate remarkable dynamism and resilience.“Guided by a decade of structural reforms and strategic global positioning under the vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, the nation has successfully weathered multiple global headwinds,” said Das who has helped navigate several economic headwinds in the past during his stint at RBI and the finance ministry.“India’s robust domestic demand, together with prudent macroeconomic and financial sector policies, has enabled the country to withstand many external shocks. India is now poised to contribute about one-fifth of the world’s GDP growth.”The former RBI governor said India continues to record impressive growth, as several favourable factors, such as a younger demography and greater reliance on domestic demand, provide the strength to withstand the negative spillovers from global turbulence. Das also said India’s average economic growth during 2014-15 to 202425 was 7.1% (excluding the Covid-19 years of 2020-21 and 2021-22) and in the last three years (2022-23 to 2024-25), GDP growth averaged 7.8%.",Shaktikanta das said the global economy is going through a phase of unprecedented uncertainty and fundamental reset.

'Let Them Decide': Trump At Oval Office When Asked About NOBEL PRIZE After Gaza Deal

Will Trump get the Peace Prize?

Who are the contenders?







The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. The award is considered one of the most anticipated and unpredictable honours.Experts say the committee usually focuses on lasting peace, international cooperation, and the work of institutions that promote these goals.The announcement will be made in Oslo, Norway, where the committee will name the laureate who reflects the values of Alfred Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish industrialist who founded the prize.There has been speculation about the possibility of US President Donald Trump winning the prize, a discussion partly driven by Trump himself. However, experts who follow the Nobel process say his chances are low despite his involvement in several international peace efforts.The announcement comes just hours after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that could help end the two-year conflict in Gaza.While Trump has claimed credit for pressuring both sides to reach the deal, the timing makes it unlikely that the Nobel Committee considered it.The five-member committee held its final meeting on Monday, when it completed the statement explaining its choice, which is usually decided days in advance.""The Gaza deal has absolutely no significance for the choice of the 2025 laureate because the Nobel Committee has already made its decision,"" historian and Peace Prize expert Asle Sveen told news agency AFP.""Trump will not win the prize this year. I’m 100 percent certain,"" he said.A total of 338 individuals and organisations have been nominated for the 2025 Peace Prize, but the list remains secret for 50 years. With no clear favourite, several possible names are being discussed in Oslo.Among them are Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms, a network of volunteers helping civilians during war and famine; Yulia Navalnaya, widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which monitors elections.The committee could also choose a laureate that signals its position on global issues, even if it invites criticism from the United States.Possible choices include UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres , the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), or international courts such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC).Organisations defending press freedom, such as the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) or Reporters Without Borders (RSF), are also being discussed as potential winners.Last year’s prize went to Nihon Hidankyo, an organisation of survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings that campaigns against nuclear weapons.The Nobel Peace Prize includes a diploma, a gold medal, and a $1.2 million cash award.The economics prize, to be announced on Monday, will conclude the 2025 Nobel season, which has already seen awards for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, and peace.","The norwegian nobel committee will announce the winner of the nobel peace prize on friday.

Jaishankar-Muttaqi Meet Marks Strategic Shift in India-Afghan Ties, Pak Faces Pressure: Experts

Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi backed trade through the Chabahar port route and called for opening the India-Pakistan Attari-Wagah border for trade with India. At a press conference in the Afghanistan embassy, following his meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Muttaqi also announced that the Taliban will appoint diplomats in India.Pakistan does not allow India to export to Afghanistan via the land route, and the Indian government has used the Chabahar port in Iran for trade and commerce with Afghanistan. The US, however, last month revoked the 2018 sanctions waiver that allowed India to develop the port and access Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan.Muttaqi said trade is meant to benefit people and should not be mixed with politics. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all 3 countries,’’ said Muttaqi, addressing a press conference at the Afghanistan embassy for which no woman journalist was invited. He also announced the formation of a trade committee to remove obstacles in commercial ties with India.Muttaqi also reiterated Afghanistan’s position that it won’t allow the US to take control of the Bagram airbase, even as it remains open to diplomatic ties with Washington. Indian government sources later confirmed India had agreed to work with the Taliban to have their diplomats stationed here but added India’s position on formal recognition will remain broadly aligned with that of the international community.Muttaqi addressed the media with a small flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), Taliban’s name for the country, placed on the table. He told reporters the embassy building, which still flies the flag of the erstwhile Islamic Republic, belonged to the IEA. “The appointment of diplomats will be a step towards normalisation and further improvement of ties,” said Muttaqi. The appointment will not be at the ambassador level, in the absence of formal recognition by India. The diplomats appointed by the Taliban will be allowed to work from the embassy.Asked about women’s rights, a sticking point in the Taliban’s ties with the international community, Muttaqi said all countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected. He was also non-committal on whether girls or women would be allowed to travel to India for studies.""In the recent earthquake in Afghanistan, India was the first responder. Afghanistan looks at India as a close friend. Afghanistan wants relations based on mutual respect, trade and people-to-people relations. We are ready to create a consultative mechanism of understanding, which helps towards strengthening our relations,” said Muttaqi.The issue of women rights has been flagged by Indian authorities from several multilateral forums. India believes Taliban must work towards the formation of a truly inclusive government and preservation of women, children and minorities.Muttaqi also said he and Jaishankar discussed security concerns in detail. “The IEA has proven in the last four years that the territory of Afghanistan will not be used against others. And it remains committed to that policy that the territory of Afghanistan is not used to threaten others,” said Muttaqi.","Afghanistan foreign minister amir khan muttaqi called for opening the india-pakistan attari-wagah border for trade with india.

Clear messaging to Pakistan



Strategic recalibration: Delhi steps in



Economics, connectivity and regional stakes



Security calculus: Terrorism and recognition



Presence restored, recognition withheld



Regional balancing act



Strategic hedging, not endorsement



NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in kabul to a full-fledged embassy.

NEW DELHI: Taliban ’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday, meeting Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind President Maulana Arshad Madani and other senior officials of the seminary.Muttaqi expressed gratitude for the warm reception and optimism about India-Afghanistan ties. “I am thankful to all of you for the warm welcome given to me by everyone in Deoband and the love showered upon me. I will pray to God that India-Afghanistan relations improve further,” he said, as quoted by news agency ANI.The Afghan leader highlighted the significance of educational and cultural ties, noting that no political discussions took place but that historical connections were celebrated.As per news agency ANI, Maulana Arshad Madani emphasised the historical role of Afghanistan in India’s independence struggle and reassured that Afghanistan would not allow terrorists to use its soil against India.This visit is part of a week-long trip to India by Muttaqi, marking the first high-level delegation from Kabul since the Taliban took power in 2021.Darul Uloom Deoband, established in 1866 in present-day Uttar Pradesh, is one of South Asia’s most influential Islamic seminaries.It was founded by scholars including Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi and Maulana Rashid Muhammad Gangohi to educate Muslim youth in a rigorous, orthodox understanding of Islam, known as Deobandi Islam.The seminary was originally part of an anti-colonial movement aimed at revitalising Islam and resisting British rule in India. Over the decades, Deobandi schools spread throughout India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other parts of South Asia.While Darul Uloom Deoband is in India, its teachings spread across the border into Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pashtun communities were instrumental in establishing Deobandi seminaries along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, according to The Conversation.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 accelerated this process as Deobandi madrassas, supported by Pakistani authorities and funding from Saudi Arabia and the CIA, educated Afghan refugee youth who would join the anti-Soviet resistance.Many of these students later became key figures in the Taliban. The movement’s founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other Taliban leaders were educated in Deobandi-inspired seminaries in Pakistan, adopting a version of the ideology that included ultraconservative Wahhabi influences, as per NPR.While the Taliban identify as Deobandis, scholars at the original Indian seminary emphasise that their interpretation diverged from classical Deobandi teachings.“The Taliban say they are doing what we did in India. The way we kicked the British out of India, that’s what the Taliban are doing in Afghanistan,” said Maulana Arshad Madani back in 2021 when the Taliban took control over Afghanistan, clarifying that there is no organisational link between the seminary and the Taliban, as per NPR.This visit of Taliban’s foreign minister comes amid efforts to improve India-Afghanistan relations, as Muttaqi emphasised hopes for increased exchanges and cooperation, including in regional projects like the Chabahar port in Iran.The visit reinforces the soft-power and cultural dimension of diplomacy between the two countries while acknowledging the centuries-old educational and religious links that connect them.","Afghanistan foreign minister visits darul uloom deoband in up.

Taliban presser in New Delhi



NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi on Saturday led a wave of opposition outrage after women journalists were barred from a Taliban press conference in New Delhi. Taking direct aim at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Congress MP addressed PM Modi and said, ""you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them. ”The remark came as several opposition leaders condemned the government for allowing such an event, calling it a shameful affront to women’s rights and democratic values.Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, voiced his disappointment over the incident and criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, writing on X, ""Mr. Modi, when you allow the exclusion of women journalists from a public forum, you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them.""He added, ""In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space. Your silence in the face of such discrimination exposes the emptiness of your slogans on Nari Shakti.""BJP responded sharply to Rahul Gandhi's criticism of the Taliban press conference, denying the allegations and linking him to Pakistan, while calling Congress the ""best friend of Pakistan.""BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said, ""Yet again Rahul Gandhi is batting for Pakistan by spreading fake news!""He also fact-checked Rahul on X, noting, ""Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961 Article 22 declares embassy land as 'inviolable' and belonging to the embassy.""It was not just Rahul Gandhi, but several other opposition leaders also targeted PM and Centre. Lok Sabha member Priyanka Gandhi also addressed the issue, asking the prime minister to clarify the government’s position. She wrote on X, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India. ""Priyanka added, ""If your recognition of women’s rights isn’t just convenient posturing from one election to the other, then how has this insult to some of India’s most competent women been allowed in our country, a country whose women are its backbone and its pride.""Former home minister P Chidambaram expressed shock over the exclusion, writing, ""I am shocked that women journalists were excluded from the press conference addressed by Mr Amir Khan Muttaqi of Afghanistan. In my personal view, the men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited).""TMC MP Mahua Moitra also targeted the Modi-led government, saying, ""The government has dishonoured every single Indian woman by allowing Taliban minister to exclude women journalists from presser. Shameful bunch of spineless hypocrites.""She added in another post on X, ""How dare our government allow Taliban foreign minister Amir Muttaqi to exclude women journalists & hold a ‘male-only’ news conference on Indian soil with full protocol? How dare EAM Jaishankar agree to this? & why did our emasculated spineless male journos remain in room?""The press conference was held at the Afghanistan embassy hours after Taliban FM talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, where women journalists were barred from entry. The forum was only opened to a few male journalists, reflecting the Taliban’s ongoing record of gender discrimination.Sources say the decision on journalist invitations was made by Taliban officials accompanying Muttaqi. The Taliban government in Kabul has faced sustained global condemnation, including from the United Nations, for its restrictions on women’s rights, education, and participation in public life.Amid backlash, the ministry of external affairs clarified to ANI that India had ""no involvement"" in the press interaction held by Muttaqi.When asked about the condition of women in Afghanistan, Muttaqi sidestepped the question, saying, ""Every country has its own customs, laws and principles, and there should be respect for them."" He claimed Afghanistan’s situation had improved since the Taliban takeover in August 2021, contrasting current conditions with previous years. ""Some 200 to 400 people died in Afghanistan every day before Taliban started ruling the country,"" he said.","Rahul gandhi led a wave of opposition outrage after women journalists were barred from a taliban press conference in new delhi.

Sergio Gor Calls Meeting With PM Modi 'Incredible', Says ‘Trump Considers Him Great Friend’

Key takeaways



The two leaders discussed the importance of critical minerals, Gor said.

Bilateral issues, including defence, trade and technology were also discussed, he said.

Gor noted that the United States“values its relationship with India” and emphasised that his visit underscored Washington’s commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation.

He also gifted a portrait to PM Modi with Trump's signature on it saying: ""Mr Prime Minister, you are great.""

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday met US Ambassador-designate Sergio Gor in New Delhi, marking the first high-level interaction between the two since Gor’s Senate confirmation as the next American envoy to India.The meeting comes amid ongoing trade tensions and hopes for renewed momentum in the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Sergio Gor said, “I had an incredible meeting with Prime Minister Modi. We discussed bilateral issues, including defence, trade and technology. We also discussed the importance of critical minerals.”He added, “President Trump considers Prime Minister Modi a great and personal friend. In fact, just before I left for New Delhi, they had an incredible phone call. And that is something that will continue over the weeks and months ahead.”PM Modi wrote on X, “Glad to receive Mr. Sergio Gor, Ambassador-designate of the US to India. I’m confident that his tenure will further strengthen the India–US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.”Earlier in the day, he also held discussions with external affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Vikram Misri.“We had a great series of meetings,” Gor said, adding that both sides exchanged views on expanding defence ties and economic collaboration.EAM Jaishankar described his meeting with Gor as “productive,” saying on X, “Discussed the India-US relationship and its global significance. Wish him the best for his new responsibility.”Gor, accompanied by US deputy secretary for management and resources Michael J Rigas, is currently on a six-day visit to India.The trip comes amid ongoing strains in India-US relations following Washington’s decision to impose 50 per cent tariffs on Indian exports — including 25 per cent additional duties on crude oil purchases from Russia.Despite these challenges, the recent phone call between PM Modi and Trump, and Gor’s outreach in New Delhi, are being seen as signs of optimism in resetting trade negotiations.Earlier, during his Senate confirmation hearing, Gor had highlighted the “deep friendship” between Trump and PM Modi, calling it a “unique strength” in advancing bilateral relations.He said, “India is a strategic partner whose trajectory will shape the region and beyond.”Gor’s formal presentation of credentials is expected to take place at a later date, according to the US embassy.","Us ambassador-designate sergio gor meets pm modi in new delhi.

Sergio Gor Calls Meeting With PM Modi 'Incredible', Says ‘Trump Considers Him Great Friend’

In a rare gesture, amidst ongoing efforts to repair the India-US relationship, PM Narendra Modi Saturday received US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor who delivered a message to him from President Donald Trump in the form of a framed photograph of their White House press conference earlier this year signed by the president as, “Mr. Prime Minister, you are great!”.Modi later said in a post on X he was glad to meet Gor. “I’m confident that his tenure will further strengthen the India–US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership,” said Modi, who spoke to Trump for the second time in less than a month on Thursday. Gor responded by saying it was an honour to meet Modi, who is considered a “great and personal” friend by Trump, and the relationship with India will only strengthen over the months ahead.Gor’s engagements on Saturday - including with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri - have raised hopes of an early conclusion of the trade talks as well as a summit level meeting. A diplomatic source said positive outcomes are in the works.Gor also said that in his “incredible” meeting with Modi, both sides discussed bilateral issues, including defence, trade, and technology.In the middle of a fresh US-China row over rare earths and critical minerals, he also discussed the importance of critical minerals and the “importance of that to both of our nations”.“The U.S. values its relationship with India, and under the strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Modi, I'm optimistic about the days ahead for both of our nations,” said Gor, adding he arrived from Washington in the morning and hit the ground running.It’s rare for the PM to meet an ambassador before the person has assumed office and the development suggests both sides might be within striking distance of a trade deal that could act as an antidote to the dramatic downturn in ties since May this year, if not earlier. The contentious negotiations for the agreement have threatened to undermine other aspects of the relationship. Modi had congratulated Trump on Thursday for the success of his Gaza peace plan, while also endorsing what he described as good progress in the negotiations and said the leaders agreed to being in close touch in the coming weeks.Whether or not that translates into a meeting on the margins of the Asean and East Asia summits in Malaysia later this month remains to be seen. Both leaders are expected to participate, but neither has officially confirmed it yet. Both sides seem keen on a bilateral meeting this year. The possibility of a Quad summit in the next few months is also not ruled out.The ambassador’s appointment has been confirmed by the Senate but he’s currently in India only for a 6-day trip, apparently to familiarise himself with his new responsibility. He will take charge at a later date. After his meeting with Gor, Jaishankar said in a post on X later that he discussed the India-US relationship and its global significance and wished him the best for his new responsibility.Gor is travelling to India, accompanied by deputy secretary for management and resources Michael J Rigas. In his engagements, there was focus on expediting the trade negotiations and building upon the several major initiatives announced during Modi’s visit to Washington in February to further strengthen the relationship. That Trump chose to remind him about the meeting then in the form of the photograph is being viewed positively by India, even as the US shows no sign of lifting the additional 25 percent tariff on India for its oil purchase from Russia.","Sergio gor presented an autographed photo of pm modi and trump.

Pakistan Panics After Taliban Issues Warning, Accuses India of Using Afghanistan Soil for Terror

Pakistan has lodged formal objections with Afghanistan’s Ambassador in Islamabad over several ‘elements of the India‑Afghanistan joint statement’, particularly the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as 'part of India'.It also rejected remarks by Afghan foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi that “terrorism is an internal problem of Pakistan,” the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs (MOFA) said.The foreign office said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Joint Statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self‑determination.”In addition, Islamabad strongly rebutted Muttaqi’s claim, saying: “Pakistan has repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna‑e‑Khawarij and Fitna‑e‑Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan.”The Pakistani statement added that deflecting responsibility by branding terrorism in Pakistan as an ""internal matter"" does not relieve Afghanistan’s interim government of its duty to ensure regional peace and security.It also urged that “unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan” return to their country.These protests follow a joint statement issued on October 10 during Muttaqi’s visit to India, where both nations reiterated condemnation of terrorism emanating from regional countries, affirmed respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and affirmed that the Afghan government would not permit any group or individual to use Afghan territory against India.In that statement, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed gratitude for Afghanistan’s condemnation of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, while Afghanistan reaffirmed its support in counterterrorism.""Both sides emphasised respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The external affairs minister appreciated the Afghan side's understanding of India's security concerns. The Afghan foreign minister reiterated the commitment that the Afghan government will not allow any group or individual to use the territory of Afghanistan against India,"" the statement issued by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) read.Muttaqi is on a week-long visit to India (October 9–16), the first such high-level visit since the Taliban takeover in 2021.

The Man Who took the life of TikToker Yoon Ji-ah — The Dark Truth Behind “Black Cat”

The digital world in South Korea is mourning after losing Yoon Ji-ah who was known for being a TikToker and live streamer with more than 300,000 fans. On September 11, she was found dead on a secluded mountain in Muju County, North Jeolla Province, only a few hours after her last live stream. The terrifying circumstances of her passing have once again raised the issues of the dark side of fan communities and influencer security in the era of the internet.Police have indicated that Yoon Ji-ah met with her death about 30 minutes after cutting off her last stream. The 30-year-old digital star was pronounced dead with serious physical injuries inflicted on her body through beating, strangling, and asphyxias. Later, the medical examiner declared the cause of death to be suffocation from neck compression.Initially, the fan's affection reportedly transformed into obsession. Choi, who presented himself as a CEO enjoying success, was actually an individual who had gotten into deep financial trouble and lost his home through auction. He had created a fake persona and was financially supported which led him to create a close bond with Yoon and even convince her to go into business together.But there were reports about Yoon having recently sought to break the ties claiming controlling behavior and demanding schedule as reasons. The CCTV clips released by the detectives showed Choi kneeling and asking for forgiveness just before the tragic event. As per his later confession, he dragged her into her car before killing.After the murder, Choi made an effort to hide his actions, dressing up with a suitcase, and taking several stops to misdirect the police before he left Yoon's body on the mountainside. He was captured 12 hours after the incident. He first proclaimed his innocence but later admitted it when the police found the corpse.The death of Yoon Ji-ah has created a wave of nationwide protests and mourning compared to which the calls for more effective safety measures for content creators against the obsessive online behavior are stronger than ever. Her death serves as a grim reminder of the dangers influencers face, prompting urgent calls for stronger digital safety laws, mental health awareness, and accountability within online communities to prevent similar tragedies. Yoon Ji-ah’s story stands as a haunting reminder of love turned obsession, fame turned fear, and the urgent need to protect those who bring light to the digital world.","Yoon ji-ah, 30, was found dead on a secluded mountain in muju county, north jeolla province, only a few hours after her last live stream.

India On High Alert As Pakistan's Terror Groups Adopt New Tactics After Operation Sindoor Debacle

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday said that the Prime Minister is not bigger than the country and that he went on the Operation Sindoor delegation “not for the Prime Minister, but for the country.”Speaking to the news agency ANI, Owaisi said, ""Political battle will continue to be fought over ideology, and there cannot be two sides of the ocean. But the BJP is not bigger than the country. Neither is the Prime Minister bigger than the country. When such a tragic terrorist attack took place in Pahalgam, and everyone knows that these ISI-trained individuals from Pakistan came and killed people in a military style. Obviously, we are always ready to present the country's side. We did not go for the Prime Minister. We went for the country.""In June, all-party delegations went on diplomatic missions to several countries, discussing India’s firm position against Pakistan-linked terrorism post-Operation Sindoor. The initiative aimed to show national unity in countering terrorism, with opposition members including Owaisi and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor joining ruling alliance representatives to advocate India’s stance internationally.Owaisi visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Algeria. In Bahrain, he said, “Pakistan is an aggressor, not a victim. We presented India’s side and shared data on terror attacks carried out by Pakistan-aided groups, including the Mumbai blasts, train blasts, the suicide attack in front of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, Pulwama, and Pathankot.”","Aimim chief asaduddin owaisi said that the prime minister is not bigger than the country.

Rick Scott, Marco Rubio signed the letter among others.





A letter signed by Donald Trump's close allies, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio , Florida Republican leaders Rick Scott, nominating Maria Corina Machado for the Nobel Peace Prize, surfaced the day the prize was announced and Trump lost despite pushing hard on the Gaza Peace Plan. The letter was dated August 26, 2024, long before the election that elected Trump as the president but now the letter could cause enough embarrassment for Trump's most-trusted aide Marco Rubio.One passage of the letter, held in the archives of Senator Scott, reads, ""María Corina Machado's peaceful resistance to tyrants and her ability to organize and lead a non‑violent movement for democracy and human rights is exemplary."" The letter also states, ""We hope that the Nobel Committee will recognize Venezuelan María Corina Machado's remarkable contributions and grant her the distinction she so rightly deserves. ""Rubio was a senator representing Florida at the time.National security expert Marcy Wheeler posted on Bluesky that Secretary of State Marco Rubio may face awkwardness due to his endorsement of a letter urging the committee to award Machado the peace prize.""Gonna be an awkward day for Secretary of State-National Security Advisor-Acting Archivist Marco Rubio,"" Wheeler wrote.Steven Cheung, White House communications director, said on X, ""President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives. He has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will. The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.""Though Trump lost the prize, Machado dedicated her Nobel Peace Prize to the people of Venezuela, and US President Donald Trump, for his ""decisive support"" for her country's pro-democracy movement. ""I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!"" she wrote on X.""We are on the threshold of victory and today, more than ever, we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our principal allies to achieve Freedom and democracy,"" she added.","A letter signed by donald trump's close allies, like secretary of state marco rubio, nominating maria corina machado for the nobel peace prize surfaced the day the prize was announced.
