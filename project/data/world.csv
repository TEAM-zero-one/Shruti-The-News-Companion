Delhi Earthquake News: Why did the 4.0-magnitude earthquake in Delhi-NCR feel so strong?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-did-the-4-0-magnitude-earthquake-in-delhi-ncr-feel-so-strong/articleshow/118315557.cms,"Why did the tremors feel so strong?



Epicentre within Delhi: Since the earthquake originated beneath the city, seismic waves had less distance to travel, making the tremors feel more intense.

Shallow depth: Earthquakes that occur closer to the Earth's surface generate stronger shaking compared to deeper quakes of similar magnitude.

Urban infrastructure: High-rise buildings in Delhi, Noida, and Ghaziabad sway more due to their height, amplifying the sensation of shaking.

Soil composition: Soft alluvial soil in some areas of Delhi can amplify seismic waves, further intensifying the tremors.

Why did the earthquake occur?

How earthquake intensity changes with magnitude

NEW DELHI: Residents of Delhi-NCR and several parts of northern India were jolted awake early Monday morning as strong tremors shook high-rise buildings , prompting many to rush outdoors. The earthquake, measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale, struck at 5:36 AM IST with its epicentre located within Delhi's Dhaula Kuan, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).Though a 4.0-magnitude quake is considered moderate, its impact felt stronger than usual because of its shallow depth and close proximity to densely populated areas. Earthquakes with epicentres within a city result in more intense shaking since seismic waves travel a shorter distance before reaching structures, amplifying the tremors.Delhi, which falls in Seismic Zone IV , is prone to moderate-to-strong earthquakes, making localised tremors more pronounced as the. Experts noted that buildings, particularly high-rises, sway more due to their design, increasing the perceived intensity of shaking.Authorities have reported no major damage or casualties, but the sudden tremors sparked concern among residents. Seismologists continue to monitor aftershocks and have advised citizens to stay informed about earthquake preparedness measures.However, National Centre for Seismology Director OP Mishra said, ""The epicentre was at Jheel Park in Dhaula Kuan, it was a 4.0 magnitude earthquake . It was in the depth of 5 km, it is called shallow depth, hence people felt the effect. People getting panicked was natural. Seismologically, it is not new region, earthquakes have happened earlier in the region. Earlier, there was 4.6 magnitude earthquake in 6 km periphery, but it was deeper, with 10 km depth. There is a difference. It was not a plate tectonic earthquake, it was due to in situ material heterogeneity, it was due to local effect. We can expect aftershock of around 1 or 1.2 magnitude.""See how close were you from the epicenter: Dhaula Kuan Delhi sits near active fault lines, including the Delhi-Hardwar Ridge and the Mahendragarh-Dehradun fault, making it prone to moderate seismic activity. The tremors were caused by tectonic plate movement along one of these fault lines, where stress builds up over time and is eventually released as an earthquake.The intensity of an earthquake is measured on the logarithmic Richter scale, where each whole-number increase represents a tenfold increase in the amplitude of seismic waves and about 32 times more energy release. This means that even small changes in magnitude can have a dramatic impact.For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 4.0 produces 10 times stronger shaking and releases 32 times more energy than a 3.0. Similarly, a 5.0-magnitude earthquake shakes 10 times more than a 4.0 and releases 32 times more energy. By the time an earthquake reaches magnitude 6.0, the shaking is 1,000 times stronger than a 3.0, and the energy released is 32,000 times greater. This exponential increase is why a seemingly small rise in magnitude can lead to severe destruction, especially in urban areas.","The earthquake, measuring 4.0 on the richter scale, struck at 5:36 am ist. The epicentre was located within delhi's dhaula kuan, according to the national centre for seismology. No major damage or casualties have been reported, but the tremors sparked concern among residents.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118319192,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-4133549,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Delhi's earthquake risk: A seismic hotspot

Residents recall terrifying moments

Authorities respond, urge caution

NEW DELHI: Tremors of magnitude 4.0 on the Richter Scale hit the Northern part of India early Monday morning. The national capital and its neighbouring areas felt the earthquake at 5.36 am first followed by another of the same magnitude that jolted Bihar at 8.02 am.However, the residents of Delhi-NCR recounted the moment and said they also heard a loud sound.As Delhi-NCR was jolted by an early morning earthquake, National Centre for Seismology director, OP Mishra said, ""The epicentre was at Jheel Park in Dhaula Kuan, it was a 4.0 magnitude earthquake. It was at a depth of 5 km, which is called shallow depth, hence people felt the effect. People getting panicked was natural.

There is a difference. It was not a plate tectonic earthquake, it was due to in situ material heterogeneity, and it was due to local effect. We can expect an aftershock of around 1 or 1.2 magnitude.""Seismologists say the booming noise accompanying the tremors was due to the shallow depth of the earthquake. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), high-frequency vibrations from shallow-focus quakes generate sound waves as the ground shakes. The closer the quake is to the surface, the more energy and noise it produces. In some cases, even when tremors are not strongly felt, earthquakes can create booming sounds.Delhi falls under Seismic Zone IV, which signifies a fairly high earthquake risk, as per the Delhi disaster management authority. The region is vulnerable to quakes measuring between 5.0 and 6.0, with occasional tremors reaching magnitudes of 7.0 or higher.The seismic activity in North India is primarily driven by the collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, which store enormous energy before eventually releasing it as earthquakes. Shallow earthquakes, such as the one recorded today, tend to be more damaging due to their proximity to the surface.The Dhaula Kuan area, the epicentre of today's quake, has a history of minor tremors every two to three years, with a 3.3-magnitude quake recorded in 2015.The tremors startled many residents in the early hours, with social media flooded with videos and reactions. CCTV footage from a Delhi residence captured water tanks and wires swaying violently as the quake struck.At New Delhi Railway Station, a passenger likened the tremors to a ""bridge collapse.""""I was in the waiting lounge when everything started shaking. People rushed outside, thinking something had collapsed,"" he said.Another resident described the experience as “one of the most intense earthquakes” they had ever felt.""It was like a train passing right next to my house. Everything was shaking. I've never felt anything like this before,"" they said.Following the quake, the Delhi Police reassured citizens and urged them to remain cautious. ""We hope you all are safe, Delhi. For emergencies, call 112,"" they posted on X (formerly Twitter).","Delhi falls under seismic zone iv, which signifies a fairly high earthquake risk.

PM Modi's adviser on how USAID influenced key policies besides elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modis-advisor-on-how-usaid-influenced-key-policies-besides-elections/articleshow/118332163.cms,"Sanjeev Sanyal (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Sanjeev Sanyal , PM Modi's economic adviser, put light on the surreptitious role the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) had in shaping India's medical and social policies, besides meddling with the Indian elections.Substantiating his claims on X on Monday, Sanyal said USAID ""effectively ran India's National Family Health Survey (NFHS) from the 1990s"" till it was stopped in 2022 by PM Modi's dispensation.He said the USAID not only allowed foreign agencies to ""harvest"" India's medical record but also paved the way for designing surveys and analyses to support certain social narratives.""Those concerned about USAID's interference in Indian elections should be equally concerned about USAID's tentacles in India's medical system and social policies. USAID effectively ran India's National Family Health Survey (NFHS) from the 1990s till it was stopped two years ago. This is the most important medical dataset in India and drives a lot of health policy,"" Sanyal wrote on X.He further wrote: ""Not only were we allowing a foreign agency to harvest our medical data but, by allowing them to design surveys and direct analysis, we were letting them influence our national health responses. Equally worryingly, much of the NFHS questionnaire was deliberately skewed to support certain social narratives. The questionnaire for men, for instance, is only 29 pages but that for women is 94 pages.""Sanyal claimed the questionnaires were ""slyly"" designed to elicit a narrative of intra-family violence against Indian women.""A lot of the additional questions are deliberately worded to elicit a narrative of intra-family violence against Indian women. Must say, very slyly done. Readers will recall that late Bibek Debroy and I strongly pushed back against this (including publicly in newspaper columns). Fortunately, GoI took up the matter and the latest NFHS is being done by health ministry on its own. Note that readers can verify what I am saying easily as it was all done in plain sigh,"" he added.Acknowledging that it took the NDA government long eight years to discontinue the USAID influence in NFHS, Sanyal said ""it is not so easy to upturn a well-established system that went back decades"".""Some people are asking why the USAID did the 2019-21 NFHS survey and was not removed earlier. Well, it is not so easy to upturn a well-established system that went back decades. It takes time to recognise a problem, and build capability to replace it. Nonetheless, GoI has been tightening FCRA over the last decade despite many howls of protest. One can only do more when the Overton Window has moved. The DOGE revelations about USAID has hopefully done that,"" he added.Earlier, the BJP seized upon Elon Musk-headed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), constituted by US President Donald Trump, announcing that it had cancelled many programmes costing hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars, citing $486 million to the 'Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening', which included $21 million for ""voter turnout"" in India.","Pm modi's economic adviser sanjeev sanyal put light on the surreptitious role the united states agency for international development (usaid) had in shaping india's medical and social policies.

On inheritance tax

On 1984 anti-Sikh riots

On Pulwama attack

Nehru vs Ambedkar on Constitution

On Nyay scheme

NEW DELHI: Remember this post on X by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on June 26, 2024:The Congress spokesperson had then put out this clarification to justify/announce the reinstatement of Sam Pitroda of ""Hua to Hua"" and ""South Indians like Africans"" fame as the chairman of the Overseas Indian Congress. This was nearly one and a half months after Pitroda was removed from the post following two controversial statements made during the 2024 Lok Sabha campaign -- first on inheritance tax and then on racial profiling.Well, 8 months down the line, Pitroda forgot the assurance he gave to the Congress and created a new room for yet another controversy to embarrass the Congress. This time his remarks were on China.""I don't know what is the threat from China. I think this issue is often blown out of proportion because the US has the habit of defining an enemy. I think the time has come for all of us to learn, increase communication, collaborate, operate and co-create and not have this command and control mindset. China is around... China is growing .. you know you got to recognise that and respect that ... ,"" Pitroda said in an interview to IANS news agency.As expected, his remarks gave the BJP an opportunity to target the Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi. BJP national spokesperson and MP Sudhanshu Trivedi claimed that Pitroda's comments should not be seen in isolation as he recalled Rahul Gandhi 's positive words in the past for China's growth story and the manner in which it tackled issues like unemployment.What Pitroda has said is a severe blow to India's prestige, diplomacy and sovereignty, the BJP MP said, accusing the veteran Congress functionary of speaking as if it is India which is the aggressor in the conflict with China.Also read: Sam Pitroda's China remark draws BJP's ire Pushed to the corner once again, the Congress, which has learned the art of ""distancing"" from most of Pitroda's remarks, was quick to do it again. So, we had Jairam Ramesh once again taking to X to issue another denial of Pitroda's remarks. ""The views reportedly expressed by Mr. Sam Pitroda on China are most definitely NOT the views of the Indian National Congress,"" Jairam said.""China remains our foremost foreign policy, external security, as well as economic challenge. The INC has repeatedly raised questions on the Modi Govt's approach to China, including the PM's public clean chit to it on June 19, 2020. Our most recent statement on China was on 28th January, 2025,"" he added.The Congress leader added a statement made by him on January 28 targeting the Modi government over China and questioning the disengagement agreement of October 21, 2024.Pitroda has put the Congress in the dock several times in the past. Here's a look at some of his past statements that have embarrassed the party:In the middle of 2024 Lok Sabha campaign, Pitroda backed the idea of an inheritance tax and cited the example of the US. ""Nothing wrong in accumulating wealth but to what point? Let me tell you, in America there's an inheritance tax. So, if let's say one has $100 million worth of wealth, and when he dies he can transfer probably 45% to his children, 55% is grabbed by govt. Now that's an interesting law. It says you, in your generation made wealth, and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public - not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair. In India you don't have that. If somebody is worth $10 billion and dies his children get $10 billion. The public gets nothing. So these are the kinds of issues that people will have to debate and discuss.""Pitroda made a second remark during the course of 2024 LS campaign. ""We are a shining example of democracy in the world...we could hold country together as diverse as India where people in East look like Chinese, people in West look like Arab, people in North look like maybe white and people in South look like Africa. Doesn't matter, we are all brothers and sisters,"" said the chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress.In June 2023, when the country was waiting for the grand Ram Mandir opening, Pitroda gave BJP ammunition to attack the Congress as he said that temples were not going to solve India’s problems of unemployment, inflation, education, and health. ""No one talks about these things. But everyone talks about Ram, Hanuman, and Mandir. I have said that temples are not going to create jobs,"" he said.In May 2019, Pitroda ""hua to hua"" (so what) when he was asked about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. ""Ab kya hai '84 ka? Aapne kya kiya 5 saal mein, uski baat kariye. ’84 mein hua to hua. You were voted to create jobs. You were voted to create 200 smart cities. Aapne wo bhi nahi kiya. Aapne kuch nahi kiya isliye aap yahan wahan gup lagate hain',"" Pitroda had then said.In February 2019, Pitroda kicked up a storm as he raised questions on Balakot air strikes by the Indian Air Force which were carried out in retaliation to the Pulwama attacks. ""I don’t know much about attacks. It happens all the time. The attack happened in Mumbai, also. We could have then reacted and just sent our planes, but that is not the right approach. According to me, that’s not how you deal with the world,"" Pitroda had said.Citing an article by Sudheendra Kulkarni, a former close aide of BJP veteran LK Advani, Pitorda in a social media post had claimed that India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, contributed more than BR Ambedkar in the framing of the Constitution. Pitroda later deleted the post.Pitroda put the Congress party in a tough spot in April 2019 when he said that the middle class should not be selfish. They should be prepared to shell out more taxes to fund the party’s proposed NYAY, a scheme promising a guaranteed minimum income for every poor household, he had said.Clearly Sam Pitroda, who is perceived close to the Gandhis by virtue of being a very close associate of former Prime Minister late Rajiv Gandhi, has a penchant for courting controversies, much to the Congress's discomfort. But Pitroda could do well to keep away from speaking on sensitive issues like China, on which the party is already under attack over repeated remarks made by Rahul Gandhi - the latest one being his criticism of government's drone policy in a video using what appeared as Chinese drones.Rahul's video evoked strong reaction from the president of the Drone Federation of India Smit Shah who said that it is quite discomforting for him and the community to see someone with significant responsibility to say that no one understands drone technology in India.""When someone with significant responsibility takes up a Chinese drone and belittles the entire industry, then young people like me have to speak up. There are over 400 companies in our country and about 40 to 50 drone component companies that are working very hard to deal with all these challenges,"" Samit Shah said.""And then someone whose personality is followed by at least some section of society comes and takes up a Chinese drone and says that we don't understand anything in India and none of these parts are made in India. So it is quite discouraging,"" he added. That explains why Pitroda's remarks on China gives the BJP an opportunity to say that it represents the official mindset of the Congress party.For now, the Congress would do well to remind Pitroda about his promise made in June 2024 and hope that the repeat offender does not do it again.",Sam pitroda was reinstated as chairman of the overseas indian congress. He was removed from the post after two controversial statements made during the 2024 lok sabha campaign -- first on inheritance tax and then on racial profiling. The congress leader added a statement made by him on january 28 targeting the modi government over china and questioning the disengagement agreement.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118332988,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50440,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

He also said China remained the foremost security threat and economic challenge.In an interview, Pitroda, who is head of Indian Overseas Congress, said, ""What is this threat from China? I think it has been blown out of proportion at times as the US has this habit of defining an enemy. Our attitude is that of confrontation from day one and that attitude creates enemies and that attitude creates some support.

""All these things make clear the agenda of harming India.

He added that India wants good relations with every country, adding it will be, however, done by maintaining its prestige and security.Pitroda also said, ""Some nations will grow slowly; some will grow fast. The developed nations will grow faster but such countries will have an ageing population as well. On the other side, developing economies will take time to grow and will have dividend of the demography. It is always good for world leaders to meet each other and bond with each other. It is always good to have more and more foreign interactions. India is a country of 1.5 billion people"".",Bjp says pitroda's statement that the threat from china was blown out of proportion was part of the agenda to harm the country.

Probe US funding of $21 million for India's 'voter turnout': BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/probe-us-funding-of-21-million-for-indias-voter-turnout-bjp/articleshow/118339354.cms,"NEW DELHI: With Elon Musk-led DOGE's (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosure that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout, BJP Monday demanded a probe into the whole affair.""So, DOGE has discovered that USAID allocated $21 million for 'voter turnout' in India, a euphemism for paying voters to cast their votes to effect regime change. Veena Reddy was sent to India in 2021 (ominous?) as head of USAID's Indian mission. Post Lok Sabha elections 2024 (presumably her voter turnout mission done), she returned to US. Pity because investigating agencies here could have asked her some questions about who this money was given to for applying it to voter turnout operations,"" BJP MP Mahesh Jethmalani said on X.This came a day after S Y Quraishi, who has served as chief election commissioner (CEC), confirmed that EC had signed an understanding with USAID. Importantly, however, the former CEC said the arrangement involved no funding by USAID, something which belies the disclosure made by DOGE but may strengthen Musk's case about opaqueness of USAID's funding and functioning.Jethmalani stressed that in July 2021, USAID had named Reddy as its mission director in India, the first Indian-American to hold the post. ""She (Reddy) worked in close tandem here with US ambassador Eric Garcetti in executing the agency's objectives. Doubtless he will plead diplomatic immunity if asked about the voter turnout modus operandi. And of course, USAID's foreign objectives were directed by its ex-secretary of state (Anthony Blinken at the time) who will shed no light on the matter.""Earlier, economist Sanjeev Sanyal, a member of PM's economic advisory council, called USAID the ""biggest scam in human history"". Sanyal also demanded a probe. ""I would love to find out who received the $21 million, the $29 million spent on 'strengthening political landscape in Bangladesh', and the $29 million spent to improve 'fiscal federalism' in Nepal,"" he said on X.BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi played down Quraishi's rejection of the report.

NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday said that the announcement of a trade deal with the US has provided a lot of confidence to businesses on both sides and the agreement can help strengthen economic ties by leveraging the competitive strengths of the two countries.""The Prime Minister has brought back with him an agreement or an understanding to enter into a trade deal by Fall of this year.

During Trump's first term as US president, the two countries had discussed a mini-trade deal, but the plan was shelved by the Joe Biden administration.The decision to engage in negotiations comes amid Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs against countries which impose higher customs duty on American goods than what the US levies. Trump has attacked India and said that govt maintains very high tariffs on imports .India will seek to push for lower import duties on some of its labour-intensive products such as textiles and leather, while allowing more import of American oil, gas and defence equipment to bridge the trade deficit.Goyal said that India is expanding and forging new partnerships across the world through trade agreements with the developed world, including with Australia, UAE, and the European Free Trade Association bloc (comprising Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland).""The progress we are making in other engagements with Europe, and the progress we will soon make with the US as we proceed to finalize a trade deal by fall of this year, are all reflective of India's growing relevance at the global stage,"" he said.Further, he said that the government is taking a series of steps to boost domestic manufacturing. ""The Make in India story is now going to be led by a National Manufacturing mission, which will come up with newer ideas and address the challenges that manufacturing in India faces (by) MSMEs or otherwise, and ensure that making in India becomes more competitive,"" the minister added.

"China military modernization: More about CCP control than war readiness, says new report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/pla-xi-jinping-china-military-modernization-rand-report-china-and-taiwan/articleshow/118326657.cms,"Why it matters

US officials now believe Xi is less likely to contemplate major military action in the coming years than would otherwise have been the case, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing intelligence. The US assessments cited several examples of the impact of graft, including missiles filled with water instead of fuel and vast fields of missile silos in western China with lids that don’t function in a way that would allow the missiles to launch effectively, one of the people said. A report in Bloomberg

The big picture

The PLA has made significant progress in military technology, including advancements in stealth aircraft, submarines, and hypersonic missiles. Some of its weapons systems, such as anti-ship ballistic missiles, are designed to deter US military intervention in the region.

Despite these advancements, the PLA has not fought a war since 1979, when it suffered heavy losses in a brief border conflict with Vietnam. This lack of combat experience raises questions about its ability to effectively deploy its forces in a high-intensity conflict.

The report highlights that the PLA prioritizes political loyalty over battlefield competence. “The PLA remains fundamentally focused on upholding CCP rule rather than preparing for war,” the report states. Political officers oversee military decisions, and promotions are often based on party loyalty rather than merit.

Internal corruption is a significant challenge. The PLA has been plagued by cases of embezzlement, fraudulent procurement, and fake training records, all of which undermine its operational effectiveness. Despite anti-corruption efforts under President Xi Jinping, many analysts believe corruption remains deeply entrenched in the system.

Heavy political indoctrination further weakens the PLA’s combat capabilities. Soldiers are required to spend a large portion of their training on studying party ideology, limiting the time available for realistic combat drills and exercises.

The PLA spends up to 40 percent of its training time on political topics. This dedication mirrors a broader shift in China, in which political indoctrination occupies a growing share of education and learning. RAND report titled 'The Chinese Military’s Doubtful Combat Readiness'

What they’re saying

The report argues that China’s military buildup is designed “first and foremost to bolster the appeal and credibility of CCP rule.” In other words, the PLA’s primary function is to maintain domestic order and deter internal threats to the regime, rather than prepare for external conflicts.

Chinese state media and military leaders frequently emphasize the importance of “combat readiness,” but internal assessments reveal serious deficiencies. “Xi Jinping worries that China’s troops are not ready to fight,” a recent report in The Economist noted, citing concerns within the Chinese leadership about the PLA’s effectiveness.

“Despite those known issues within China and the PLA, I don’t think any military planner in the region is going to just dismiss the PLA as a paper tiger,” Collin Koh, research fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, told CNN.

The PLA’s inability to conduct integrated joint operations is a major weakness. While US forces regularly conduct large-scale joint exercises across multiple branches of the military, China’s drills remain limited in scope. The RAND report notes that “Chinese military forces frequently inflict punishing losses on intervening US forces” in war game simulations, but the real-world ability to execute such operations remains uncertain.

China’s ability to translate that materiel power into combat power remains far from proven. History has repeatedly shown that militaries sometimes fail to effectively use their advanced armaments in battle. For example, Qing dynasty troops equipped with qualitatively superior warships lost the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) to their more-skilful and -determined Japanese adversaries. As China’s decline accelerates, the PLA’s mission of upholding CCP rule will likely gain added urgency, while its mission of improving combat readiness will likely recede even further. RAND report titled 'The Chinese Military’s Doubtful Combat Readiness'

Zoom in: The Taiwan question

One of the biggest concerns surrounding China’s military buildup is whether it will attempt to take Taiwan by force. The RAND report, however, suggests that China’s rhetoric about Taiwan does not necessarily indicate a desire for imminent conflict.

Chinese leaders, including Xi Jinping, have repeatedly stated that Taiwan’s unification with the mainland is a “historical inevitability.” However, Beijing has not set a specific deadline for military action, and its official statements continue to emphasize “peaceful reunification.”

The PLA appears to have done little concrete planning for a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Unlike the US military, which routinely develops and updates detailed operational plans for potential conflicts, “no study on how China’s military could defeat US forces has surfaced in any academy affiliated with the Chinese military,” the report states.

China’s military budget continues to grow, reaching $231 billion in 2024—second only to the US. However, much of this spending is directed toward prestige projects, such as aircraft carriers and space capabilities, rather than the logistics and troop mobilization necessary for a sustained war.

Even if China attempted to invade Taiwan, its military would face enormous logistical challenges. Amphibious landings are among the most complex military operations, requiring extensive coordination between air, naval, and ground forces. Given the PLA’s limited experience with such operations, an invasion could result in heavy Chinese casualties and a prolonged conflict.

The CCP does value Taiwan unification but cares more about urgent, largely domestic social, political, and economic threats to CCP rule. The RAND report

Between the lines: China’s decline may weaken the PLA further

What’s next

US defense planners may need to rethink their approach to China’s military challenge. While the US military remains focused on preparing for a potential conventional war with China, the RAND report suggests that China is more likely to pursue indirect methods of competition.

Rather than engaging in direct military conflict, China may seek to undermine US alliances, expand influence through economic coercion, and increase support for US adversaries such as Russia, Iran, and North Korea.

China’s military may also play a greater role in non-traditional security threats, such as cyber warfare, space operations, and political influence campaigns.

The US may need to shift its defense strategy from preparing for a large-scale war to countering China’s influence in non-military domains, such as economic statecraft, technology competition, and regional diplomacy.

In the end, China’s military power is real, but its ability to translate that power into battlefield success remains an open question.

A new RAND Corporation report has cast doubts on the combat readiness of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), despite the country’s rapid military modernization. While China has built the world’s largest navy and continues to enhance its air force, missile capabilities, and cyber warfare tools, the report argues that the PLA remains fundamentally focused on upholding Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule rather than preparing for high-intensity warfare.These findings challenge the dominant narrative that China’s military advancements make it an imminent military threat to the US and its allies, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. Instead, the report suggests that the PLA’s main priority is internal stability and political control, raising questions about how effectively it could fight a large-scale war.Amid escalating US-China tensions, concerns over a potential conflict—especially over Taiwan—have grown. Some military analysts warn that China could achieve a “decisive military edge by 2027”, possibly tempting Beijing to use force against Taiwan. However, the RAND report suggests that despite its impressive arsenal, China’s military has yet to prove its ability to conduct complex joint operations necessary for modern warfare.As per an earlier Bloomberg report, US intelligence assessments suggest that President Xi Jinping ’s military purge was driven by revelations of deep-seated corruption that threatened his plans to modernize China’s armed forces. The widespread corruption, particularly within China’s Rocket Force and the broader defense industrial base, has raised serious concerns about the country’s military readiness and its ability to engage in a conflict. These findings have cast doubt on the effectiveness of Xi’s efforts to strengthen the military and bolster China’s strategic capabilities.US officials now believe that the scale of corruption has made Xi less likely to pursue major military actions in the near future. The pervasive misconduct within key military sectors has significantly weakened China’s warfighting capabilities, leading to concerns about its operational preparedness. These intelligence insights indicate that rather than advancing aggressive military initiatives, Xi may need to focus on addressing internal weaknesses and restoring confidence in China’s defense infrastructure, the Bloomberg report said quoting US intelligence report.If China’s military remains politically constrained and struggles with corruption and internal inefficiencies, the prospect of a full-scale war with the US may be far less likely than commonly assumed.The RAND report warns that as China’s economy slows and domestic challenges mount, the PLA may become even more focused on maintaining CCP control rather than improving combat readiness.China’s economic growth has slowed significantly, and unemployment, debt crises, and demographic challenges are putting pressure on the government. A struggling economy could lead to increased political instability, making the PLA’s role in domestic security and regime survival even more critical.The PLA’s reliance on financial incentives to recruit and retain personnel suggests that morale could become an issue. The report notes that “frequent increases in PLA pay and benefits suggest that this trend is already well underway.”A weakening China may actually reduce the likelihood of war. Rather than risk a costly military conflict that could backfire, Beijing may choose to wait for a more favorable geopolitical situation before attempting any major action against Taiwan.(With inputs from agencies)","Us officials now believe xi is less likely to contemplate major military action in the coming years than would otherwise have been the case. The pla has not fought a war since 1979, when it suffered heavy losses in a brief border conflict with vietnam. The report highlights that the pla prioritizes political loyalty over battlefield competence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118333105,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148744,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The multiplayer is reinvented with newly added weapons, perks, and gadgets in Black Ops 6. It offers so much for players to enjoy in adapting their loadouts with all possibilities. To help you dominate the rest of the players in the world, here are five of the best loadouts made for great performance depending on the play style.: M4A1 Assault Rifle Build This kind of balanced assault rifle, the M4A1, would be fantastic for players wanting to make their way up close and medium range. The Red Dot Sight, Foregrip, and Extended Mag attachments will enhance your accuracy as well as reduce or control recoil and ammo. Tactical Mask protects you from stun grenades, while Scavenger ensures you never run out of ammo. You can almost bet your adaptability with this configuration.AK-74U Submachine Gun Build This baby is a monster when it comes to up-close engagements. Slap on a Suppressor to stay off the radar, a Laser Sight to improve your hip fire accuracy, then add Flak Jacket to absorb some of that explosive damage, and Gung-Ho for faster movement while shooting. This is a loadout for small spaces and maximum maneuverability over your enemy while quickly clearing objectives.Kar98k Sniper Build For accurate sniping, one would like to think that the Kar98k makes the cut. Variable Zoom Scope for versatility in long-range shoots, Stabilizer for sway reduction, as well as, Ghost to hide from enemy UAVs and Tracker to spot follow the trail of the fallen enemies are some great features. Ideal for those who prefer attacking patients from afar, nailing enemies with surgical precision.M16 Tactical Rifle Build : For those who prefer a more tactical and slower pace of play, the M16 provides high damage and a consistent burst fire. The High Caliber barrel for maximum damage and Quickdraw for faster aiming combine for this tactical loadout. Engineer allows you to see the enemy equipment, while Cold Blooded saves you from enemy targeting systems. Basically, you take control of the game pace with this loadout and keep knocking them at medium range.MP5 Submachine Gun Build The MP5 is the fast shooting, maneuverable submachine gun for the mobility-orientated. Attach a Grip to minimize recoil and a Fast Mag for swift reloading. It allows you to stay in action longer with Tactical Mask, while Dead Silence helps you move silently across the map. Maximizes that capacity to score points in objective-based modes and finish off enemies on the go.Each has its own unique way of taking the game to people who can already dominate in Black Ops 6 multiplayer. Let them suit you up for your play style, and more often than not, you will be at the top of the leaderboard!","The multiplayer is reinvented with newly added weapons, perks, and gadgets in black ops 6.

'Biggest fraud': Elon Musk says millions listed in social security database are over 100 years old,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biggest-fraud-elon-musk-says-millions-listed-in-social-security-database-are-over-100-years-old/articleshow/118343731.cms,"US department of government efficiency head Elon Musk on Monday claimed to discover ""the biggest fraud in history"" after he found over 20 million individuals listed in the Social Security database as centenarians.In a social media post on X, Musk shared a chart showing age distribution from zero to 369 years and noted the number of 'eligible' social security numbers exceeded the US population.""According to the Social Security database, these are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to FALSE!"" Musk said.According to a report by the New York Post, the revelation was previously documented by the Social Security Administration's (SSA) oversight body. A July 2023 audit identified 18.9 million people listed as centenarians in the database, despite only 86,000 actual centenarians living in the US according to Census data.A previous March 2015 audit also found 6.5 million individuals over 112 years old with Social Security numbers but no death records, though only 35 people globally had reached that age.Both audits confirmed that virtually none received Social Security payments, despite records showing individuals born in 1886 and 1893 as living. Approximately 18.4 million hadn't received benefits or reported income for 50 years, suggesting they were deceased.The report attributes this to historical limitations: ""We believe it likely SSA did not receive or record most of the 18.9 million individuals' death information primarily because the individuals died decades ago—before the use of electronic death reporting.""Of those listed, 44,000 were receiving benefits, including 13 over age 112. Salustiano Sanchez-Blazquez, the world's oldest man at 112 - a musician, coal miner and gin rummy enthusiast from western New York - passed away shortly after the first audit commenced.The audits revealed 531 million unique Social Security numbers in circulation, with potential identity fraud cases. The 2015 audit identified roughly $3.1 billion in earnings reported using incorrect Social Security numbers.Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute noted many numbers belonged to ""illegal immigrants paying in, not fraudulent recipients taking out."" He told The Post that migrants were ""stealing identities of people who are deceased but not marked in the Social Security system.""Experts believe Musk accessed the ""Numident"" list, containing all numbers issued since 1936. A former SSA employee explained some individuals have multiple numbers, either due to fraud or as victims requiring new numbers.Other federal agencies have faced similar issues. The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation made $127 million in overpayments to a Teamsters' pension fund with nearly 3,500 deceased members during Joe Biden's presidency, later settling with the DOJ.Ida May Fuller, born in 1874, became the first US Social Security recipient in January 1940, collecting $22,888.92 until her death in 1975.SSA representatives haven't yet responded to comment requests.","Us department of government efficiency head elon musk claims to discover ""the biggest fraud in history"" after he found over 20 million individuals listed in the social security database as centenarians.
