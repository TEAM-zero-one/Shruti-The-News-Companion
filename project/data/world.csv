‘Obey Immigration Laws Or…’: Trump’s Stark Warning After ‘Humiliating’ ICE Raid On U.S. Ally





An immigration judge in Louisiana has ordered pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the US, to be deported to Syria or Algeria for allegedly failing to disclose certain information on his green card application, according to court documents filed Wednesday by his lawyers.Khalil’s attorneys indicated they plan to appeal the deportation order but expressed concern that the process would likely be swift and unfavorable.The ruling by Immigration Judge Jamee Comans comes despite a separate federal court order in New Jersey that blocks Khalil’s deportation while the court considers his claim that his detention and deportation are unlawful retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians, as reported by Politico.Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student who helped organize pro-Palestinian campus protests, was arrested on March 8 at his Manhattan residence and detained in Louisiana.He has not been charged with any crime. His arrest was part of the President Donald Trump administration’s wider effort to target foreign-born pro-Palestinian academics legally studying or working in the US.In a letter to New Jersey Federal Judge Michael Farbiarz, Khalil’s lawyers said they have 30 days from September 12, the date of the Louisiana judge’s ruling, to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).They noted that the BIA process is typically fast and that appeals to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals are rarely successful, particularly for stays of removal for noncitizens.“As a result,” the lawyers wrote, “the only meaningful impediment to Petitioner’s physical removal from the United States would be this Court’s important order prohibiting removal during the pendency of his federal habeas case.” They further added that nothing else would preserve his lawful permanent resident status.In a statement, Khalil, originally from Syria, criticized the Trump administration of using 'fascist tactics'.“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” he said.Earlier this year, Khalil spent more than three months in detention after the Trump administration invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows deportation of noncitizens, even legal permanent residents if the Secretary of State determines their presence harms US foreign policy interests.In June, Judge Farbiarz, a former President Joe Biden appointee, blocked Khalil’s deportation on foreign policy grounds and ordered his release, determining he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. Khalil then returned to New York, reuniting with his wife, a US citizen and their newborn son, who was born during his detention.The Trump administration has since pursued Khalil’s deportation on another basis, alleging that he failed to fully disclose his past employment and memberships in certain organizations on his green card application.","Mahmoud khalil, a former columbia university graduate student who helped organize pro-palestinian campus protests, was arrested on march 8 at his manhattan residence and detained in louisiana.

Islamic Nato? Saudi Arabia-Pakistan defence pact - what it means for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saudi-pakistan-defense-pact-saudi-pakistan-defense-pact-and-india-islamic-nato-pakistan-nuclear-weapons/articleshow/123978246.cms,"For the first time, Israel must plan for a world in which its military actions could invoke a nuclear response-not from Iran, its longtime antagonist, but from a Sunni ally of Washington.

TL; DR: Driving the news

Why it matters

This pact upends the old US-centric security architecture in the Middle East and creates new risks and alliances across three regions.

For Israel: The inclusion of Pakistan’s nuclear umbrella introduces a new deterrent against its regional military actions.

For India: The pact emboldens Pakistan, adds uncertainty in future conflicts, and risks tilting Arab support away from India.

For China: This is a quiet strategic windfall - an opportunity to deepen influence with two key allies while sidelining the US.

For the US: Washington’s credibility as a security guarantor in the Gulf is now under serious question.

Between the lines

Is this the start of an Islamic or Arab Nato?

The Saudi-Pakistan defence pact has reignited talk of a long-dreamed but elusive idea: a collective Muslim military alliance often called an Islamic or Arab Nato. For decades, this concept has surfaced in moments of crisis - and usually faded. This time, the conditions feel sharper.

The symbolism is striking. Saudi Arabia - custodian of Islam’s holiest sites - has formally bound its security to Pakistan, the only Muslim-majority nuclear state. Qatar, directly attacked, may seek similar guarantees.

Turkey, already in Nato, has long envisioned an Islamic bloc.

The Gulf mood has shifted: reliance on US protection feels increasingly hollow after Washington failed to prevent missiles from striking Doha. As the SCMP noted, Arab states now see little choice but to take “real and tangible measures” themselves.

Yet obstacles are formidable. Rivalries among Muslim states - Saudi Arabia versus Iran, Qatar versus the UAE, Turkey versus Egypt - make collective action fragile. The Economist observed that calls for an “Islamic Nato” often ring hollow given how many Arab regimes distrust Iran, one of the loudest voices pushing for such a bloc.

Still, momentum is undeniable. The idea of Gulf and wider Muslim states pooling military resources against a common external threat has more traction now than at any point since the Arab Spring.

Zoom in: Israel’s new deterrence dilemma

For the first time, Israel must plan for a world in which its military actions could invoke a nuclear response-not from Iran, its longtime antagonist, but from an ally of US.

Killed normalization prospects with Riyadh.

Galvanized Islamic unity.

Activated a defence pact with nuclear implications.

Provoking Pakistani retaliation, potentially conventional or cyber.

Drawing condemnation from a unified bloc of Arab states.

*Empowering Hamas and Hezbollah, who can claim new backing from a major Muslim coalition.

Expect Tel Aviv to:

Accelerate defence upgrades (e.g., Iron Dome, Arrow-3, David’s Sling).

Double down on ties with India and the US for strategic depth.

Exercise greater caution before any unilateral action in third-party Gulf states.

Zoom in: India’s uneasy balancing act

We have seen reports of the signing of a strategic mutual Defence pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The Government was aware that this development, which formalises a long-standing arrangement between the two countries, had been under consideration. We will study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability. The Government remains committed to protecting India's national interests and ensuring comprehensive national security in all domains. MEA on Saudi Arabia-Pakistan defence pact

Diplomatic fallout: The MEA said it will “study the implications” of the pact for national security.

Military calculus changes: With Pakistan now seen as having Arab backing, India fears a harder Pakistani posture in any future Kashmir crisis.

Material concern: Saudi money could now strengthen Pakistan’s military, indirectly or directly - via oil subsidies, weapons upgrades, or tech transfers.

Deepen defence ties with Israel (already India’s #2 arms supplier).

Accelerate military modernization - especially missile systems and border defences.

Step up diplomatic outreach in the Gulf to keep Riyadh neutral in South Asian crises.

Our relationship with India is more robust than it has ever been. We will continue to grow this relationship and seek to contribute to regional peace whichever way we can. A Saudi official to AlJazeera

The US on the sidelines-or in the crossfire?

China’s opportunity (and risk)

A stronger Gulf partner distancing from US influence.

A rising role as regional arms supplier and mediator.

Validation of China’s multipolar world strategy, with Washington increasingly sidelined.

Publicly back the pact as defensive unity.

Privately urge restraint - Beijing fears oil disruptions, instability, and escalation.

As SCMP noted, “Beijing benefits from a realignment that validates its approach - diplomacy, deterrence, and development.”

What’s next

US recalibration – Washington will likely attempt to rebuild trust with Saudi Arabia, possibly revisiting defence guarantees. At the same time, it may push Israel to avoid further unilateral escalations.

Saudi balancing act – Riyadh will try to prove the pact doesn’t undermine ties with India, while strengthening its leadership role in the Muslim world.

Pakistan’s rising profile – Expect more joint exercises, visible deployments, and louder rhetoric positioning Islamabad as protector of Muslim states.

Potential domino effect – Qatar, Turkey, or even smaller Gulf states could seek similar arrangements, edging closer to a real “Arab Nato.”

Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a sweeping strategic mutual defence agreement, declaring that an attack on either will be treated as an attack on both.The deal comes just days after Israel’s airstrike on Doha, which killed some senior Hamas leaders amid ceasefire talks - triggering outrage across Arab capitals.Pakistan, a nuclear weapons state, is now officially linked to Saudi defence, reshaping strategic equations in the Gulf and South Asia.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif signed the pact in Riyadh. Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, attended - signaling the military’s endorsement of the pact’s implications.""This agreement... strengthens joint deterrence against any aggression,"" said a joint statement from Saudi and Pakistani officials - seen as a direct response to Israel’s Qatar raid.Saudi officials insist the pact is “not aimed at any specific country.” But regional analysts agree the timing isn’t accidental.The Doha strike was a turning point. It exposed Qatar - home to a major US military base - as vulnerable.Gulf states saw Washington’s silence as complicity.Saudi Arabia, already exploring alternatives to US guarantees, acted swiftly to make permanent its defence relationship with Pakistan - long speculated, now official.Crucially, the pact is deliberately ambiguous about whether Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal is included - a gray area that adds deterrent weight without triggering international red lines.“This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means,” a senior Saudi official told Reuters.While Saudi Arabia has in recent years pursued a cautious rapprochement with Israel, including back-channel talks and limited normalization, the latest developments may put such overtures on hold.The pact with Pakistan, a country with no diplomatic relations with Israel and a history of supporting Palestinian causes, sends a message that Riyadh is willing to hedge its bets and strengthen deterrence against perceived threats, even if it means aligning with states outside the Abraham Accords framework.Israel’s military freedom of action - especially cross-border strikes - just encountered a nuclear tripwire.Israel’s strike on Doha aimed to decapitate Hamas leadership but instead:Now, any future Israeli strike in the Gulf risks:Israeli analysts called the pact a “game-changer” and warned of an “expanded threat matrix.”India faces a sharp strategic squeeze. It has deep ties to both Saudi Arabia and Israel, and a long-standing conflict with Pakistan.The concern is less about direct Saudi involvement in a South Asian conflict and more about symbolism and support. Pakistan, emboldened by Riyadh’s backing, may adopt a harder stance in future crises-whether over Kashmir, terrorism, or water rights. If Saudi financial support flows into Pakistan’s defence modernization, India may find itself facing a better-equipped adversary.This places India in an uncomfortable diplomatic position. It relies on Saudi Arabia as its third-largest oil supplier and a key investment partner. It also enjoys a deepening military relationship with Israel. The challenge now is to maintain both ties without appearing compromised or exposed.India’s likely response? Quiet hedging. Expect tighter defence cooperation with Israel, new military procurements, and back-channel diplomacy with Gulf states to ensure the pact doesn’t tilt against Indian interests.New Delhi’s likely response:The United States, once the unchallenged security guarantor of the Gulf, is watching from the margins. Its muted response to the Qatar strike and lack of visible deterrence has eroded confidence among allies.As Foreign Affairs noted earlier this year, “the US has become both too present and too absent-willing to support military campaigns, but unwilling to restrain them.”The result? Gulf states are hedging. A mutual defence pact with a nuclear partner like Pakistan isn’t just about deterrence; it’s a declaration of independence from a security order many now see as broken.Washington now faces the unenviable task of holding together relationships with Israel, Saudi Arabia, India, and Pakistan-each of which sees the others with growing suspicion.China may be the quietest but biggest strategic winner here. It is already Pakistan’s closest partner (via CPEC) and has deepened ties with Riyadh through Belt and Road, energy deals, and arms sales.Beijing’s gainsChina’s playbook:Several scenarios loom:The longer the Israel-Palestine conflict drags on, the more likely this pact will solidify into the nucleus of a larger coalition.(With inputs from agencies)","Saudi-pakistan defence pact reignited talk of a collective muslim military alliance often called an islamic or arab nato.

Saudi-Pak defence pact: India says will protect national interest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saudi-pak-defence-pact-india-says-will-protect-national-interest/articleshow/123983772.cms,"The Indian government reacted cautiously to the strategic mutual defence pact that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed, saying it’s studying the implications of the development and remains committed to protecting India’s national interests and ensuring comprehensive national security in all domains.The agreement, which states that any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both, may have been triggered by Israel’s actions in the region but has security ramifications for India. It comes just months after India’s Op Sindoor and amid its efforts to impose a “new normal” on Islamabad that stresses no act of cross-border terrorism will escape a military response from India.The government said it was aware that this development, which formalizes a long-standing arrangement between the two countries, had been under consideration. “We will study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, taking note of reports about the defence pact.The agreement was signed Wednesday by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during the former’s visit to Riyadh. It comes in the middle of widespread fear and anxiety in the Gulf over Israel’s aggression, not least the strikes in Qatar to eliminate Hamas leaders, and increasing doubts about the role of the US as a reliable security partner.Saudi Arabia had strongly condemned the Pahalgam terrorist attack. For India, the main concern would be how Pakistan might invoke its new pact with Riyadh in the event of any military escalation with India, a distinct possibility given India’s position that any terrorist attack will be considered an act of war. “This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieving security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defense cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” said a joint Saudi-Pakistan statement, without elaborating further.For the Saudis, it’s significant that Pakistan is a nuclear-armed country, although Islamabad maintains its nuclear weapon programme is India-centric and strongly denied Iranian claim recently that Pakistan would nuke Israel if it launched a nuclear strike on Iran. As part of its post-Sindoor new normal, India maintains any nuclear blackmailing by Pakistan won’t deter Indian response to terrorist attacks.As the MEA said, Pakistan has had longstanding defence cooperation with Saudi Arabia, training Saudi soldiers since 1960s, stationing troops there during the Iran-Iraq war and the Kingdom acting as its chief financial benefactor. They had institutionalized security and defence cooperation through an agreement in 1982. However, there have been a few hiccups in this partnership too with Pakistan in 2015 refusing to join a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.Official sources here said India will wait for more details to emerge before coming to any conclusion about the likely impact of the pact on India, while citing the improvement in India’s own ties with Riyadh in recent times, including in defence and security. A Saudi official was quoted by the CNN as saying that the agreement encompasses all military means, including Pakistan’s nuclear umbrella for Saudi Arabia. However, the official also said that Riyadh’s relationship with India is more robust than it has ever been and “it will continue to grow this relationship and seek to contribute to regional peace whichever way we can. ”An Indian official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Riyadh’s decision to sign the pact was driven by its insecurity over Israel’s actions but added it might have a secondary impact in the form of more money in the hands of Pakistan. India will also closely monitor any possible impact domestically of a possible coalescence of Muslim states. India’s commercial engagement with the Gulf is strong and it’s unlikely to be affected, given how PM Narendra Modi has himself invested so much in building up ties with the region. His strong condemnation of the violation of Qatar’s sovereignty by Isarel’s recent strikes serves as an example.As maritime neighbours, India and Saudi Arabia have extensive naval cooperation and last year, they also conducted their first ever India-Saudi joint land force exercise named EX-SADA TANSEEQ-I. The 2 countries have also signed an agreement for defence exports from India to Saudi. Saudi Arabia is also one of India’s top trading partners and among the most significant sources of crude and petroleum products.","Saudi arabia and pakistan have signed a strategic mutual defence pact.

'Best time would have been 6 am': Why India carried out Operation Sindoor at midnight - CDS General Anil Chauhan reveals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/best-time-would-have-been-6-am-why-india-carried-out-operation-sindoor-at-midnight-cds-general-anil-chauhan-reveals/articleshow/123978384.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Thursday revealed why armed forces decided to carry out Operation Sindoor strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir at night.Speaking at an event in Ranchi, Gen Chauhan said the strike, carried out on May 7, was deliberately executed in the dead of night. ""On the 7th (of May), the terrorist targets we had chosen, we struck them between 1.00 and 1.30 at night… Why did we strike at 1.30 at night? That is the darkest time, it would be the most difficult to get satellite images, photographs, and collect evidence. Yet, we struck at 1 or 1.30 at night,” he said.Gen Chauhan underlined two key reasons for the decision. First, he said, the armed forces had full confidence in their capabilities, including the ability to capture imagery and assess damage even at night. The second, and more crucial reason, he explained, was to avoid harming civilians.""First, we had confidence in our capabilities that even at night we would be able to get imagery. And the second important reason was that we wanted to avoid civilian casualties,"" he said.""The best time would have been 5.30–6.00 am, but at that time, the first azaan or the first prayer takes place, and in Bahawalpur and Muridke, there might have be a lot of civilian movement at that time, so many civilians could have been killed ... We wanted to avoid that, which is why we chose the time between 1.00 and 1.30,"" he said.The CDS’s remarks provide a rare inside view of the strategic and ethical considerations behind such high-risk counter-terror operations, where military precision must be balanced with humanitarian concerns.","Chief of defence staff (cds) general anil chauhan on thursday revealed why armed forces decided to carry out operation sindoor strikes in pakistan and pakistan-occupied kashmir at night.

Yes, it's a serious concern No, it's manageable

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia defence pact, calling it a matter of grave concern for India’s security and another failure of what it described as “personality-driven diplomacy. ”Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, said, “One month after abruptly halting Operation Sindoor, President Trump hosted Field Marshal Asim Munir for lunch at the White House—the very individual whose inflammatory, provocative, and communally divisive statements provided oxygen to the brutal terrorist attacks in Pahalgam in April 2025. Just days after our Prime Minister’s much-publicised visit to China, President Xi Jinping opened the doors of China’s covert military complex to Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari. Now, Saudi Arabia—where the Prime Minister was present during the Pahalgam terrorist attacks on 22 April 2025—has signed a ‘strategic mutual defence’ agreement with Pakistan. This is undoubtedly a matter of grave concern for India’s national security. The Indian National Congress expresses deep concern over this and considers it yet another setback for our Prime Minister’s highly publicised personality-driven diplomacy.”Earlier today, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan announced the signing of a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” during Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to Riyadh.The pact pledges mutual support in the event of external aggression and marks a transition from decades of informal security cooperation to an institutionalised military framework. “This agreement…aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” a joint statement said.Also read - Defence pact: Pakistan-Saudi Arabia declare joint response to any aggression; India reacts A senior Saudi official told Reuters the deal was the result of “years of discussions” and not linked to any recent conflict, while declining to clarify whether Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal was covered under its scope.

External affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, “We have seen reports of the signing of a strategic mutual defence pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.

We will continue to grow this relationship,” the official said.Meanwhile, union minister Piyush Goyal said, ""I am not aware of the details of that. I was busy with my meetings in the UAE. So, I think I will refrain from commenting on this subject. But as far as our relations with the UAE go, they are very strong. They are underpinned by deep relationship between Prime Minister Modi and His Highness the President of UAE.

That was purely for trade. We told them if you want to trade with us, you will have to get along, and they were going at it hot and heavy,” he said. He added he felt “let down” by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he could not add the war in Ukraine to that list.“If the price of oil comes down, Putin will have no choice but to drop out of that war,” he said as he and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed to ramp up the pressure on Putin. “When I found out that the European nations were buying oil from Russia, I am very close to India and to the PM of India, I wished him a Happy Birthday the other day, we have a very good relationship, but I sanctioned them (India). I am willing to do other things, but not when the people I am fighting for are buying oil from Russia.That’s not playing fair with the USA,” he said.He also said the US is trying to get Bagram airbase back from Afghanistan as it is in a strategic position an hour away from where China makes nuclear weapons. “We were supposed to leave with strength and dignity and keep Bagram,” he said.On Gaza, Trump said he opposed a Palestinian state whilst Hamas still had Israeli hostages, calling it a point of disagreement with Starmer.The pair had earlier held bilateral talks, attended a business reception and toured the Winston Churchill Archives. Trump is a big Churchill fan.US tech and finance giants have announced £150 billion (Rs 17.2 lakh crore) in investments in the UK, creating 7,600 jobs to coincide with the state visit, including plans to build in the UK the largest AI supercomputer in Europe.The First Lady and Queen Camilla looked around Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House at Windsor Castle, the largest dolls’ house in the world, designed by Edwin Lutyens.

Melania particularly liked “The Gruffalo”.At the state banquet on Wednesday, Trump hailed the British Empire laying the foundations of “law, liberty, free speech and individual rights virtually everywhere the Union Jack has ever flown”.“Together, we’ve done more good for humanity than any two countries in all of history,” he said.","Us president donald trump said he personally had stopped seven wars since coming to power. “most were not thought to be settleable but we did india, we did pakistan, two nuclear powers.

'I Didn't Do It': Pilot's Last Words Before Air India Crash| Probe Report| Tech Failure or Sabotage?

Poll Do you think the media has played a fair role in reporting on the crash? Yes, they have been unbiased. No, they have sensationalized the story.

NEW DELHI: The father of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the Air India Ahmedabad crash in June this year, has called for a 'formal investigation' by the central government while criticising the findings of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) as well as the ""selective leaks"" that ""tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation"".In the Ahmedabad plane crash, which was one of the worst aircraft accidents in India, 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed. Air India's Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171 to London Gatwick crashed soon after take off from Ahmedabad on June 12.In a letter to the civil aviation secretary and AAIB Director General, 91-year-old Pushkaraj Sabharwal said that selective leaks about the accident had led to speculation that Sumeet (56) was under tremendous psychological pressure and contemplating suicide, PTI reported.""These innuendos have very adversely affected my health and mental setup and the reputation of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal. They tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation, which is a fundamental right guaranteed to a citizen of India under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,"" the letter, dated August 29, said.Pushkaraj has demanded that the central government order a formal enquiry into the accident under Rule 12 of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017, which empowers the Centre to institute a formal investigation into the circumstances of any accident of an Indian-registered aircraft if it appears expedient to hold such a probe.There were no immediate comments from the civil aviation ministry or the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on the letter.Amid speculation about the cause of the fatal crash following the release of its preliminary probe report on July 12, the AAIB had asserted it was too early to draw any “definite conclusions” as the investigation was still on and that the final report would identify root causes. The agency also urged everyone to refrain from spreading premature narratives.""The preliminary report on the contrary does not allude to the 'what' happened or the bare facts of the crash, instead resorting to insinuations on the one hand and offering copious clean chits to the manufacturer/s on the other. The report in its present form is deficient, diversionary & discrepant,"" the letter said.It further alleged that selective information from the preliminary investigation — including contents of the cockpit voice recorder — had been put into the public domain.Pushkaraj also refuted speculation about his son’s mental health. Citing reports, he said it was suggested Sumeet was divorced and that caused him anxiety and depression.""It even ignores the fact that Captain Sabharwal was divorced about 15 years ago. The other speculation relating to the cause for Captain Sabharwal being desirous of committing suicide has been his mother's death. His mother died more than three years ago. After that, Captain Sabharwal had operated more than 100 flights without any incident or accident.""It is most pertinent to note that in over 25 years of flying, Captain Sabharwal had not had a single incident or accident-causing fatalities or otherwise,"" the letter said.He had almost 15,638.22 hours of flying experience, of which 8,596 hours were on the 787-8. He was also designated as a Pilot Trainer — a Line Training Captain — and held the DGCA licence for that purpose.Pushkaraj added that the absence of a formal enquiry under Rule 12, coupled with selective information being provided to the media, was very disturbing and detrimental to him and affected his fundamental rights, including the right to the reputation of his deceased son.In the preliminary report, AAIB had said the fuel supply to both engines of the plane was cut off within a gap of one second, causing confusion in the cockpit soon after takeoff. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut off. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,"" it had said.","Ahmedabad plane crash. 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed.

Chabahar Port in Iran faces uncertainty: US revokes sanctions exemption; what it means for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chabahar-port-in-iran-faces-uncertainty-us-revokes-sanctions-exemption-what-it-means-for-india/articleshow/123978546.cms,"



India's strategic gateway to Afghanistan and Central Asia, the Chabahar Port in Iran, faces mounting challenges as the United States revoked sanctions exemptions previously granted under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA). The move, effective September 29, risks exposing Indian operators at the port to US penalties and raises serious questions about the future of one of India’s most important regional connectivity projects.Since India took operational control of the Shahid Beheshti terminal at Chabahar in 2018 through its state-run India Ports Global Limited, the port has become a linchpin in New Delhi’s strategy to bypass Pakistan and secure trade routes to Afghanistan and Central Asia.The port, situated on the Gulf of Oman, not only facilitates regional commerce but also serves as a critical channel for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Recent years have seen a sharp increase in cargo throughput, with over 8 million tonnes of goods handled and tens of thousands of containers processed. Plans to expand the port’s capacity from 100,000 to 500,000 TEUs and connect it to Iran’s railway network by mid-2026 further underline its growing importance.However, the US Treasury’s recent designation of an international illicit financial network supporting Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the revocation of IFCA sanctions waivers mark a significant escalation in Washington’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.The sanctions target individuals and entities facilitating Iranian oil sales that finance Iran’s military and proxy groups in the region, directly impacting Iran’s shadow banking infrastructure.For India, the revocation of the Chabahar sanctions exception complicates its ambitions.The port’s operations could now come under the risk of US sanctions, threatening the significant investments India has already made—amounting to over $120 million in infrastructure and credit lines for development.This creates a diplomatic conundrum as India balances its deepening partnership with the United States against its strategic and economic ties with Iran.The Chabahar Port project is a vital counterweight in the region to China’s influence through Pakistan’s Gwadar port and aligns with India’s broader goal to expand trade corridors to resource-rich Central Asian countries and Russia via the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). The port’s strategic location near the Strait of Hormuz enhances its importance for ensuring regional stability and securing maritime trade routes.","The united states revoked sanctions exemptions previously granted under the iran freedom and counter-proliferation act (ifca) the move, effective september 29, risks exposing indian operators at the port to us penalties.
