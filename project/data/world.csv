NEW DELHI: US president Donald Trump on Friday said India had agreed to bring tariffs ""way down"", while claiming credit for the move in yet another tirade against several ""high-tariff"" countries.""India charges us massive tariffs, you can't even sell anything in India, it's almost restrictive... By the way, they have agreed to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done,"" he told reporters in the White House.The comments came at a time when an Indian team led by commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal is in the US to work out the contours of a bilateral agreement. So far, govt has remained tight-lipped about the negotiations that are currently underway.Trump's statement came hours after US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick sought a ""grand"" deal that included farm products, while suggesting India stop defence purchases from Russia.

NEW DELHI: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Friday said that the "" boundary question "" and specific differences between India and China must not dictate the bilateral relations between the two countries.While addressing his annual press conference in Beijing, Yi said that Indo-China relations made positive strides over the past year after the successful meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at Kazan in Russia.""As two ancient civilisations, we have enough wisdom and capability to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas pending a fair and reasonable solution to the boundary issue,"" Yi said.""We should never allow bilateral relations to be defined by the boundary question or specific differences to affect the overall picture of our bilateral ties. China believes that as the largest neighbours, both countries should be partners in each other's success,"" he added.The Chinese foreign minister said that the Xi and PM Modi provided strategic guidance for the improvement of ties at the Kazan meetingAfter this, both sides earnestly followed through on the important common understanding of the leaders, ""strengthened exchanges and practical cooperation at all levels and achieved a series of positive outcomes"", he added.This comes months after India and China completed the contentious disengagement process in Depsang and Demchok in Eastern Ladakh, bringing to an end the 54-month-old military standoff in the area, a giant step towards normalisation of bilateral tie.After the finalisation of the pact, Modi and Xi held talks in Kazan on October 23. In the meeting, the two sides decided to revive the various dialogue mechanisms.After that, national security advisor Ajit Doval and Wang held the 23rd Special Representatives (SR) dialogue in Beijing on December 18.On January 26, foreign secretary Vikram Misri travelled to the Chinese capital and held talks with his Chinese counterpart Sun Weidong under the framework of the 'Foreign seccretary-vice minister' mechanism.'We have the responsibility to take the lead'On the ongoing tariff war with US, Wang said that as important members of Global South, India and China must put up joint opposition against hegemonism and power politics""""A cooperative partnership between the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for both sides. There is every reason for us to support each other rather than undermine each other or undercut each other,"" he said, adding that both the countries ""should work with each other rather than guard against each other,"" Yi said.""This is the only path that truly serves the fundamental interests of the two countries. As important members of the Global South, we have the responsibility to take the lead in opposing hegemonism and power politics"" he added in apparent reference to the United States.The remarks came after a recent meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart, Wang Yi, during which Jaishankar praised the cooperation between the two countries in multilateral forums, especially the G20.","Wang yi said that indo-china relations made positive strides over the past year.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday reacted to the recent security breach involving EAM S Jaishankar's convoy in London, acknowledging the UK's condemnation of the incident. However, it emphasised that the sincerity of this condemnation would ""depend on the action taken against culprits"".During the weekly press briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India has conveyed ""deep concern to the UK authorities"" over the incident, stating that there is ""a larger context to the incident"".""We have conveyed our deep concern to the UK authorities about the breach of security arrangements by UK-based separatist and extremist elements during the EAM’s visit.

A group of Khalistani extremists staged a protest, chanting slogans and waving flags, which escalated into a direct confrontation with the minister's convoy.Pro-Khalistan supporters were also seen holding flags and staging a protest outside the venue where Jaishankar participated in a discussion. The incident took place during Jaishankar’s official visit to the UK from March 4-9.UK foreign office also condemned the incident and said that it upholds the right to peaceful protest, any attempts to intimidate, threaten, or disrupt public events are completely unacceptable.""We strongly condemn the incident that took place outside Chatham House yesterday during the External Affairs Minister's visit to the UK.

Pakistan is grappling with a severe resurgence of terrorism with its homegrown Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerging as one of the deadliest terrorist organisations globally, as per the Global Terrorism Index 2025.According to the report, the four terrorist groups responsible for the most deaths globally in 2024 were Islamic State (IS), Jamaat Nusrat Al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and al-Shabaab.Deaths attributed to these groups increased by 11 per cent to 4,204 deaths in 2024, or 80 per cent of deaths that were attributed to a specific group. In 2014, these four groups were responsible for less than 40 per cent of terrorism deaths that were attributed to a group, highlighting the large global shifts in terrorism over the past decade.Islamic State (IS) and its affiliates remained the world's deadliest terrorist group in 2024, and is active in 23 countries, one more than in 2023. Deaths attributed to the group and its affiliates declined by ten per cent, from 1,996 to 1,805 deaths.Of the major terrorist organisations, TTP was responsible for the largest increase in deaths, which rose by 90 per cent to 558 deaths, said the report.The report noted that Pakistan recorded the second-largest increase in terrorism deaths in 2024, with the toll rising by 45 per cent to 1,081.Terrorism has increased significantly in Pakistan since the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan, with the number of attacks increasing fivefold since 2021.The most recent surge in terrorism in Pakistan was primarily driven by increased TTP activity, which is aligned with the Afghan Taliban. Deaths attributed to the group nearly doubled between 2023 and 2024.In 2024, the TTP was responsible for 558 deaths across 482 attacks, marking it as the third deadliest terrorist group globally. This resurgence follows a period of reduced activity between 2017 and 2021. The number of attacks attributed to the TTP reached a record high in 2024, with deaths at their highest level since 2011.The group's activity is largely concentrated along Pakistan’s northern border with Afghanistan, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 96 percent of the TTP's attacks occurred.TTP activity in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa more than doubled in the past year, escalating from 182 attacks resulting in 265 deaths in 2023 to 462 attacks and 545 deaths in 2024. The deadliest attack in 2024 saw TTP militants killing 16 Pakistani soldiers at an army outpost, claimed as retaliation for the killing of senior TTP commanders.The TTP's primary targets align with its anti-state objectives, focusing on police and military personnel, who accounted for 51 percent and 16 percent of attacks, respectively.Civilians were also frequently targeted, comprising 16 percent of attacks and 19 percent of terrorism-related deaths.Armed attacks remain the TTP’s most common tactic, accounting for nearly two-thirds of attacks and 72 percent of deaths. Bombings have also increased, nearly tripling compared to the previous year.The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, was formed in 2007.Sharing a common ideology with the Afghan Taliban, the TTP aims to overthrow the Pakistani government through acts of terrorism against the armed forces and state members. The group operates primarily along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, comprising numerous smaller Islamist armed militant groups.Following the TTP's deadliest attack in December 2014, where 141 people, mostly children, were killed in a school, the Pakistani government launched the National Action Plan (NAP) to combat terrorism.In June 2024, Operation Azm-e-Istehkam was initiated to accelerate the NAP's implementation, involving airstrikes targeting militants and key insurgent leaders. However, these actions have been met with controversy, including claims of civilian casualties during strikes in Afghanistan’s Paktika province.Despite not holding direct territorial control, the TTP maintains significant influence in regions such as North and South Waziristan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The group leverages the mountainous terrain to facilitate movement and sustain operational mobility across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.","Terrorism has increased significantly in pakistan since the taliban's rise to power in afghanistan. The number of attacks attributed to the ttp reached a record high in 2024, with deaths at their highest level since 2011.

NEW DELHI: The United States Supreme Court on Friday rejected the extradition stay request of Tahawwur Rana , a key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks that killed more than 170 people.Rana had approached the US Supreme Court , seeking an emergency stay on his previously allowed extradition.In the appeal application, Rana contended that his survival chances would be insufficient for facing trial in India, citing multiple factors.His petition specifically mentioned that ""if a stay is not entered, there will be no review at all, and the US courts will lose jurisdiction, and the petitioner will soon be dead.""The 26/11 terror attacks suspect alleged that his extradition to India would likely lead to his torture, given his status as a Pakistani-origin Muslim individual.Rana's extradition was greenlit by US President Donald Trump last month.During a joint press conference at the White House with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump had announced the decision and suggested additional extraditions would follow.""We are giving a very violent man (Tahawwur Rana) back to India immediately. There are more to follow because we have quite a few requests. We work with India on crime, and we want to make things better for India,"" Trump had said while acknowledging the ongoing collaboration between both nations regarding criminal matters.Rana, who holds Canadian citizenship and has Pakistani origins, faces charges in India for his involvement in the Mumbai attacks that resulted in over 174 fatalities. He was found guilty in the United States for providing support to the proscribed organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).India has been seeking his extradition for an extended period. In connection with the 26/11 attack, Rana is alleged to have assisted his associate David Coleman Headley, also known as Daood Gilani, who possessed US citizenship through his American mother and Pakistani father. US authorities apprehended Headley in October 2009.Rana's involvement reportedly extended beyond being cognisant of Headley's connections to LeT, the Pakistan-based outlawed terrorist group. He actively supported Headley by providing him with false credentials, which enabled Headley to travel to India and scout potential targets for LeT's 2008 operation.",The us supreme court rejected tahawwur rana's plea to halt his extradition to india.

NEW DELHI: US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick called upon India to open up the agricultural sector for trade, saying ""it just can't stay closed"".The farm sector has remained a no-go area for government that has cited domestic sensitivities, even as US has insisted on greater access for American nuts, fruits and poultry.

: New Delhi is close to having Tahawwur Rana , a former Pakistani Army doctor and 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack accused, brought to justice after US Supreme Court Associate Justice Elena Kagan rejected his emergency application on Thursday to stay his extradition to India .Rana's attorneys immediately bumped up the application to Chief Justice John Roberts, likely the last court of appeal, with little possibility of reprieve after President Trump personally assured his extradition during Prime Minister Modi 's visit to Washington DC last month and the State Department signed off on handing him over to Indian authorities.On Thursday, Rana played the religion and health card, citing possible religious persecution and torture in India on account of his Muslim faith, besides serious medical condition, to forestall the extradition, which he argued through attorneys would be a ""de facto death sentence. "" But Justice Kagan, who serves as the Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit which had earlier upheld the extradition, rejected his ""Emergency Application for Stay Pending Litigation of Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.""“Application…denied by Justice Kagan,” the US SC website said in a terse announcement, without elaborating.Rana has fought the extradition for almost four years purportedly with help from the Pakistani establishment loath to give up one of their own because of the precedent it would set. But the state department has already signed off on handing him over to India, and New Delhi has already made arrangements to take him into custody and fly him back to face justice for one of the most egregious terrorist attacks on Indian soil that also claimed the lives of 26 foreign nationals, including six Americans.","Tahawwur rana is a former pakistani army doctor and 26/11 mumbai terrorist attack accused.

Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?

Imagine this: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump , two of the most larger-than-life figures on the global stage, teaming up not to broker a trade deal or solve world peace, but to help Indian wrestlers smash their way into the WWE. Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena ’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin , opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and More Think about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","Narendra modi and donald trump have a bromance that’s tighter than john cena ’s grip on the wwe championship belt. Wwe has been eyeing india as a massive market for years.

Eat them up.” Draya Michele force-feeds her 9-month-old baby, pointing at scrambled eggs!The 40-year-old girlfriend of Jalen Green , a shooting guard for NBA’s Houston Rockets, recently took to her Instagram to share a few snaps. One of them was Green's infant trying to throw away scrambled eggs. And, we could hear Michele disciplining her baby - not to throw, eat them, and more.What stood apart was, that Michele said, those are expensive! Sending out signals for the 39% raised prices of eggs ever since President Donald Trump took over the reins. Agricultural Secretary Brooke Rollins said, ""People are sort of looking around thinking, 'Wow, well maybe I can get a chicken in my backyard,' and it's awesome. We also want to make it easier for families to raise backyard chickens."" Trump’s administration is trying to combat Bird Flu outbreaks. A report by Food & Water Watch said, “Bird flu has slightly reduced egg production but corporate greed has also played a major role.”Anyway, how is an infant going to understand that surge in prices?

President Trump signs executive order establishing White House Task Force for 2026 FIFA World Cup

President Donald Trump on Friday brushed off concerns that ongoing trade tensions between the US, Mexico, and Canada could affect the 2026 FIFA World Cup . Instead, he claimed the disputes would make the tournament “more exciting.”“Tension is a good thing … it makes it much more exciting,” Trump told reporters at the White House, where he met with FIFA President Gianni Infantino to announce the creation of a World Cup task force .Trump signed an executive order establishing the White House task force, which he will chair, to handle security and logistical preparations. “We’re going to make sure everything runs smoothly,” he said.Infantino, said the 2026 World Cup, along with this summer’s FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, would generate 200,000 jobs and have a $40 billion economic impact. “And more than that, we will give joy and happiness to the entire world, and this is priceless, definitely,” he added. “So thank you, Mr President, for setting up this task force, because it is important that everyone that comes to America feels safe, feels welcome, and that's why it's important that the government puts together this White House Task Force.”Despite Trump’s optimism, his trade policies have strained relations with the US's World Cup co-hosts. He has repeatedly threatened tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, unsettling markets. His past remarks about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican leaders have also added to tensions.The 2026 World Cup will be the biggest in history, with 48 teams playing 104 matches across three nations. The US will host 78 of those matches, while Mexico and Canada will host 13 each. The final is set for July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.","The 2026 world cup will be the biggest in history, with 48 teams playing 104 matches across three nations.

Expressing concern about the deteriorating law and order situation in Bangladesh, exacerbated further by the release of violent extremists who were sentenced for serious crimes, the Indian government reiterated Friday that it's the interim government's responsibility to protect Hindus and other minorities. The govt also said it supports a stable, peaceful, inclusive and progressive Bangladesh in which all issues are resolved through democratic means and by holding inclusive and participatory elections.It also urged Dhaka to probe the perpetrators of killings and arson without making any distinction. ""We have repeatedly underlined that it is the responsibility of the interim govt of Bangladesh to protect Hindus and other minorities, as well as their properties and religious institutions,"" said MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal.""However, only 1,254 incidents out of over 2,374 incidents reported from Aug 5, 2024 to Feb 16, 2025 have been verified by police. Further, 98% of these 1,254 incidents were deemed 'political in nature'. We expect Bangladesh to thoroughly investigate and bring all perpetrators of killings, arson and violence to justice without making such distinctions,'' he added.But the Indian govt backed development cooperation with Bangladesh, in line with the strong people-to-people ties, even as the security situation blocks progress in implementation of Indian projects. ""Development cooperation is a priority area of our relations with the people of Bangladesh. The recent security situation and long-standing local issues have affected the pace of implementation of some of these projects. The official discussions, therefore, focused on rationalising the project portfolio and executing mutually agreed projects in a time bound manner,"" Jaiswal said.","The indian government reiterated friday that it's the interim government's responsibility to protect hindus and other minorities.

Senior US and Ukrainian officials are planning to meet next week to discuss the first steps of a deal that could seek an end to the war in Ukraine, after a week of US moves casting doubt on its support for the country. Both President Trump and President Zelensky of Ukraine confirmed the meeting, which is expected to take place in Saudi Arabia.""Ukrainian and American teams have resumed work, and we hope that next week we will have a meaningful meeting,"" Zelensky said in a statement Thursday.

Donald Trump shares bizarre AI-generated video of 'Trump Gaza'

The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation endorsed the Arab League's counter-proposal to US President Donald Trump 's plan to seize Gaza and displace its residents, on Friday, according to two ministers who spoke to news agency AFP.""The emergency ministerial meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation adopted the Egyptian plan , which has now become an Arab-Islamic plan ,"" Egyptian Foreign minister Badr Abdelatty said.""The next step is for the plan to become an international plan through adoption by the European Union and international parties such as Japan, Russia, China and others. This is what we will seek and we have contact with all parties, including the American party."" Abdelatty added.According to the Middle East Monitor, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) had convened an emergency meeting at its Jeddah headquarters to address the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the calls for displacement, and the urgent need for Gaza's reconstruction.The Arab-backed proposal, led by Egypt, calls for Hamas to relinquish control to an interim administration until a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) assumes governance. Unlike Trump's plan, the Egyptian framework would allow nearly 2 million Palestinians to remain in Gaza.Meanwhile, the Donald Trump-led administration has rejected a long-anticipated Gaza reconstruction plan proposed by Arab leaders, reiterating its own vision for the region.According to CNN, the White House maintains that US President Donald Trump supports a plan that involves expelling Palestinian residents and transforming Gaza into a ""riviera"" under US ownership. In a statement on Tuesday night, White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said, ""The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.""“I think that it’s a big mistake to allow people, the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza, to go back yet another time, and we don’t want Hamas going back. And think of it as a big real estate site and the United States is going to own it and we’ll slowly, very slowly, we’re in no rush, develop it. We’re going to bring stability to the Middle East soon,” Trump had told reporters in the first week of February.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after meeting with Trump last month, had praised the proposal as a ""revolutionary, creative vision,"" claiming it had the potential to reshape the region's future. ""For an entire year, we've been told that in the 'day after,' the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) and the Palestinian Authority must be in Gaza,"" Netanyahu told his cabinet.","The organisation of islamic cooperation endorsed the arab league's counter-proposal to us president donald trump's plan to seize gaza and displace its residents.

Many speakers praised Trump’s approach to digital assets.
