Sarod player forced to flee Bangladesh hiding Indian identity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sarod-player-forced-to-flee-bangladesh-hiding-indian-identity/articleshow/126111929.cms,".

KOLKATA: A Kolkata-based sarod player with family roots in Bangladesh and an illustrious legacy in the world of music had to flee the neighbouring country when the venue was vandalised hours before his programme, leaving him shocked and his tabla player still stuck there.Shiraz Ali Khan had a concert scheduled at Chhayanaut in Dhaka on Dec 19. But hours before the scheduled programme, the culture hub was vandalised amid a nationwide spiral of unrest triggered by the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a radical leader who played a key role in last year's anti-Hasina protests.Shiraz managed to ""flee"" to Kolkata on Saturday evening, suppressing his Indian identity on the way. His tabla player is still stuck there and hoping to return on Monday.Shiraz's father is Ustad Dhyanesh Khan, son of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and grandson of Baba Allauddin Khan. Although based in Kolkata, Shiraz's family has roots across the border. His great-grandfather, Ustad Allauddin Khan, was from Brahmanbaria. ""Some years ago, a college in Ustad Allauddin Khan's name (in Brahmanbaria) was attacked. But the attack on Chhayanaut is an unimaginable assault on our culture and shared values,"" Shiraz said.Shiraz arrived in Dhaka on Dec 16, in time for a jazz concert on Dec 17 in Banani. His major classical music recital was scheduled for Dec 19. ""Despite the small gathering of 17-18 people, the experience (in Banani) was heartfelt. I didn't expect that days later, tragedy would hit our musical community. On the morning of Dec 19, I learned about the attack on Chhayanaut. I couldn't believe the building where I was to perform was destroyed. Seeing the disturbing images was beyond belief, especially as someone who holds music and its sacredness in the highest regard,"" Shiraz told TOI.While trying to leave Dhaka, Shiraz was stopped at a checkpoint. ""I was asked if I had foreign currency. Fortunately, I didn't. For the first time, I didn't mention my Indian identity. Aware of anti-India sentiments, I spoke in the Brahmanbaria dialect. My mother, from Brahmanbaria, settled in India after her marriage in 1968. I learned the dialect from her,"" he said.Shiraz's Khan surname helped. ""People thought I was from Bangladesh, not India. I never thought I'd have to hide my Indian identity. I gave my Indian passport and phone to the driver, who kept them in the car's dashboard. I got them back at the airport. I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't concealed my identity. My mother is still in Bangladesh. My Hindu accompanists are also stranded in Dhaka. I won't reveal their names for their safety,"" he said, adding he ""won't return"" to ""Bangladesh until artists, music, and cultural institutions are respected and protected"".","Shiraz ali khan had a concert scheduled at chhayanaut in dhaka on dec 19.

NEW DELHI: A Hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district on Thursday night following allegations of blasphemy, BBC Bangla reported, amid continuing unrest in the country and growing concerns over attacks on minorities and media institutions.The incident took place in the Dubalia Para area of Square Master Bari in Bhaluka upazila. Police identified the victim as Dipu Chandra Das, who worked at a local garment factory and lived in the area as a tenant.“A group of agitated people caught him and beat him up around 9 pm on Thursday for insulting the Prophet. Then they set his body on fire,” Ripon Mia, duty officer of Bhaluka police station, told BBC Bangla. He said the attackers tied the body to a tree before setting it ablaze.Police reached the spot after receiving information and brought the situation under control.

NEW DELHI: Senior Sikh leader and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday condemned the disruption of a peaceful Sikh Nagar Kirtan procession in South Auckland, New Zealand, expressing concern over the threat posed to religious freedom and communal harmony.Sharing a video of the incident on X, Badal said, “Nagar Kirtan is a sacred Sikh tradition—a joyous religious parade involving the singing of hymns from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, promoting devotion, unity, and sharing of blessings with all humanity. I am glad to note that the Sikh community responded with remarkable restraint and peace despite provocation—true to Guru Sahib’s teachings of ‘Chardi kala’ and ‘Sarbat Da Bhala’. ”“Such intimidation threatens religious freedom and the spirit of universal brotherhood,” he added.Badal further urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene and raise the matter with the New Zealand government to “protect the rights of the Indian diaspora.”On Saturday, a Sikh religious procession in New Zealand was disrupted by a group of ‘Patriot’ protesters. According to reports by the NZ Herald, the group was linked to political leader Brian Tamaki’s Destiny Church, a Christian fundamentalist religious organisation.In a video shared on Tamaki’s social media, members of a group calling themselves the True Patriots of NZ were seen confronting the Sikh procession as it moved along the street. The group described themselves as “Guardians of the Kiwi Way of Life. Defenders of Faith, Flag & Family,” and said they oppose “globalism, mass immigration, and woke ideology.”The protesters displayed a large banner reading, “This is New Zealand not India.” While being kept apart from the Sikh group by police, they linked arms, performed a haka, and chanted “One true God,” “Jesus,” and “God of nation.”Inspector Matt Hoyes said around 50 protesters blocked the road in an attempt to disrupt the parade. He stated, “Police acted swiftly to ensure the parade was able to safely continue and additional officers were called in to escort the parade participants through the remainder of their route.”","Senior sikh leader sukhbir singh badal condemned the disruption of a peaceful sikh nagar kirtan procession in south auckland, new zealand.

India Rejects Dhaka Media Reports On Protest Outside Bangladesh HC, Flags Attack Against Minorities

Bangladesh unrest

NEW DELHI: India on Sunday rejected reports of the Bangladesh media as ""misleading propaganda"" over a protest that took place outside the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi following the “horrendous killing” of Dipu Chandra Das, a member of the minority community, in Mymensingh. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that India is closely monitoring the situation in the neighbouring country and has voiced strong concerns over the continuing atrocities against minorities in Bangladesh.The MEA also clarified that the small group that gathered outside the high commission of Bangladesh was dispersed by police shortly after.In an official statement, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have noted misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident. The fact is that about 20-25 youth gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on 20 December and raised slogans in protest against the horrendous killing of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh, while also calling for the protection of all minorities in Bangladesh. There was no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time. The police stationed at the spot dispersed the group after a few minutes.Visual evidence of these events is available publicly for all to see. India is committed to ensure the safety of foreign Missions/Posts in its territory in accordance with the Vienna Convention.""The MEA added, ""India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh. Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities. We have also urged that the perpetrators of the barbaric killing of Das be brought to justice.”Security was heightened outside the Bangladesh High Commission even as widespread violence spread across Bangladesh following the death of Osman Hadi and the mob lynching of Dipu Chandra Das.Widespread unrest swept across Bangladesh earlier this week following the death of key student activist Sharif Osman Hadi. Large groups of protesters surged through Dhaka and several other cities as anger mounted.Hadi, the spokesperson of Inqilab Mancha, succumbed to injuries after an assassination attempt in Dhaka, according to an official statement issued by the ministry of foreign affairs in Singapore. His death triggered massive uproar, with interim leader Muhammad Yunus vowing justice and “no leniency” for those responsible.Amid this rising turmoil, a Hindu youth, Dipu Chandra Das, was lynched by a mob in Mymensingh over alleged blasphemy, and his body was set on fire on Friday. The brutal killing drew strong outrage and condemnation in India, leading to protests outside the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi.","India is closely monitoring the situation in the neighbouring country.

NEW DELHI: The external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a “very significant change,” suggesting that India has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.Addressing the convocation of an institute in Pune, Jaishankar said the cumulative impact of recent global developments has altered the international pecking order.“The cumulative result of all these happenings is that the global economic and, thereafter, political pecking order has actually undergone a very significant change,” he said, according to ANI.Pointing towards the shifts in the international labour market, the minister said India is increasingly becoming a driver of the global workforce.“We have started to surge in trained human resources at the very time when many developed nations are struggling to find them,” he said, adding, “Since demand and supply invariably develop their own equation, we have entered an era of mobility.”The minister also mentioned that this growing cross-border mobility now places new responsibilities on governments. “We need to ensure welfare, including in conflict situations, and the politics of this mobility needs to be managed,” he said, referring to India’s efforts to protect its citizens abroad.Reflecting on the post-colonial global order, Jaishankar said control over national destinies has shifted back to sovereign states, making policy choices a decisive factor. He noted that while China has “gained the most” since decolonisation, India has “done well, especially in the post-reform era,” and even more so over the past decade.In contrast, he criticised the Western economic model, linking current discontent to past decisions.“Western elites consciously chose to shift production to maximise profits. Their competitiveness has eroded over the years, accelerated by their lifestyle,” he said. “Much of the Western world now feels that they have stagnated, a sentiment that has increasingly come to acquire a political meaning.”Concluding his address, Jaishankar told students that national progress is shaped by leadership and governance. In India’s case, he said, “leadership and governance have led to ups and downs in various phases in our economic growth and in our social transformation,” urging them to see themselves as contributors to a “Viksit Bharat” that is increasingly shaping, not just participating in, the global order.",External affairs minister s jaishankar said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a “very significant change” he said india has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126092509,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-487596,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Bring to justice perpetrators of Dipu’s ‘barbaric killing’, New Delhi tells Dhaka



NEW DELHI: India hit out at Bangladesh and suspended visa operations at its mission in Chittagong on Sunday, amid a wave of protests there with an anti-India hue sparked by the death of radical activist Sharif Osman Hadi , which has seen the lynching of a Hindu man.Describing as ""horrend-ous"" the killing of 25-year-old Dipu Chandra Das, a garment factory worker beaten to death by a mob and set ablaze for alleged blasphemy, MEA slammed attempts in Bangladesh to draw false equivalence between protests targeting its facilities in that country and the one outside the Bangladesh mission in Delhi.India's assistant high commission in Chittagong suspended visa operations over concern for safety of the centre's staff and premises in view of angry protests, which saw demonstrators come close to the diplomatic facility on Thursday despite presence of Bangladesh security personnel.Due to the recent security incident, Indian visa oper-ations at IVAC Chittagong will remain suspended from Dec 21, 2025, until further notice, the Indian Visa Appli-cation Centre (IVAC) said in a statement.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in Delhi urged the interim govt in Dhaka to bring to justice the perpetrators of the “barbaric killing” of Dipu, leading Bangladesh to protest.“The incident should not be conflated with the security of minorities,” foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said in Dhaka, adding, “He was a Bangladeshi citizen who was killed, and Bangladesh took immediate action.Several arrests have already been made.”He also claimed that the protests in New Delhi left the “Bangladesh high commissioner and his family feeling threatened”.The assistant Indian high Commissioner’s residence in Chittagong was pelted with stones by a mob on Thursday, the day Hadi died days after being shot in head by masked gunmen. Thursday also saw massive “anti-India” protests outside the assistant Indian high commissions in Khulna and Rajshahi, and on Wednesday, around the high commission in Dhaka.In an apparent attempt to suggest that the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi faced a security threat of similar severity, media reports Bangladesh said a demonstration by “Hindu extremists” outside the facility over Dipu’s death in Mymensingh threatened its security, drawing a sharp rejoinder from the MEA.India trashed such claims as “misleading propaganda”. There was “no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time,” the MEA said, adding police dispersed the group after a few minutes and visual evidence of these events is publicly available. “We have noted misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident,” Jaiswal said.The MEA said about 20-25 youths had gathered outside the Bangladesh high commission on Saturday and raised slogans in protest against the “horrendous killing” of Dipu.“India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh. Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities,” Jaiswal said.Pictures of the two protests pointed out the contrast as angry protesters came in close proximity to the Indian facility in Chittagong, while a much smaller crowd stood in protest at a safe distance from the Bangladesh high commission.Exiled Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen had on Saturday introduced another dimension to the horrific killing of Dipu, claiming on X that police had initially rescued him from the mob and asked if police with sympathies for extremists handed him back to the violent crowd determined to kill or they were overpowered. “They held a full-blown celebration — beating Dipu, hanging him, burning him — a jihadist festival,” she said.On Sunday, two more persons were held in the Mymensingh lynching case, taking the total arrests to 12.Internal situation has deteriorated in Bangladesh after the death of Haidi, a prominent face in 2024 anti-govt protests that led to then PM Sheikh Hasina abdicating & fleeing to India. Known for his anti-India utterances, he was a leader of radical group Inquilab Mancho & had shared a map of greater Bangladesh that showed India’s north east as part of his country.",India's assistant high commission in chittagong suspended visa operations over concern for safety of the centre's staff and premises.

Everything to know about Brittani, the woman keeping the Steelers QB grounded

For two decades, Aaron Rodgers has lived under a microscope where every throw, feud, and relationship was pulled into public view. Fame followed him everywhere, often blurring the line between his professional brilliance and personal choices. Yet this offseason delivered a surprise no one saw coming. The Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback quietly arrived at training camp wearing a wedding ring, setting off whispers and questions that even seasoned reporters did not anticipate.Rodgers confirmed the news himself. He was married. Not in a splashy ceremony or magazine reveal, but in the most Rodgers way possible, calm and guarded. The identity of his wife stayed mostly out of reach, though one name surfaced quietly. Brittani. And in a career filled with noise, this silence spoke volumes.Aaron Rodgers has made it clear that this chapter of his life is different. Older, more reflective, and more intentional, he no longer treats his private world as public property. During Steelers training camp, he explained how marriage reshaped his outlook, both on and off the field.“When you meet the right one, and you’re with the right one, your whole world changes in a second,” Rodgers told NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt at Steelers training camp this summer.“To have that person who unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there’s no better feeling. I’ve got the most incredible wife. I just really love her. I’m so thankful to have her by my side at the end. When you have that stability and rock behind you at the house, you feel like you can do anything. ”That sense of grounding did not appear overnight. Rodgers’ past relationships played out loudly. From Olivia Munn to Danica Patrick to Shailene Woodley, each connection carried attention, speculation, and eventually pain. Patrick later accused him of being “emotionally abusive.” Woodley reflected on their breakup with quiet sorrow, saying, “I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful.”Rodgers has not dodged accountability. In his 2024 Netflix documentary, he admitted, “I didn’t do myself any favors with some of the girls I dated after that that were in the public eye.”With Brittani, the approach changed. She avoids the spotlight entirely. Rodgers explained the reason plainly on “The Pat McAfee Show.” “It’s a sick society, isn’t it? I lived in the public eye for 20 years. I had a public relationship. How did that work out? Now I’m with somebody’s who private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye, didn’t sign up to be a celebrity.”That privacy seems to have unlocked peace. Teammates see a calmer leader. Coaches see focus. Fans see a quarterback who looks settled at last. As Rodgers enters what could be his final NFL chapter, Brittani’s quiet presence may be the steady force that keeps his world balanced, even as the stadium lights burn brighter than ever.Also Read: Who is Josh Johnson, the Commanders’ emergency QB whose NFL resume includes stops with nearly half the league","Aaron rodgers has kept his wife out of the spotlight.

Candace Owens shares witness claim linking Erika Kirk and Brian Harpole to Fort Huachuca meeting

Erika Kirk’s BIG SLAP To Candace Owens Amid Public Fight On Charlie Kirk’s Death | ‘Egypt Not Here…’





Fresh claims shared by Candace Owens have stirred heavy debate online. On her podcast Candace Owens spoke about a witness who says he saw Erika Kirk in a restricted place just hours before the reported killing of Charlie Kirk . Candace Owens said these claims come from a former special forces operative. The man, identified only as Mitch, said he saw Erika Kirk with Charlie Kirk’s head of security at a military base in Arizona. Owens made it clear this was an eyewitness account shared on her show, not an official finding.Right now, there is no confirmation from police or federal agencies backing these claims. Still, the story has drawn attention because of who is involved and the serious nature of what is being alleged. Candace Owens said she no longer trusts the official version of events and wants answers about what really happened in the final hours before Charlie Kirk’s death.During the podcast, Candace Owens interviewed Mitch, who said he was at Fort Huachuca in early September. He explained that he went there to “get records” and noticed an unusual military presence that day.Mitch said he was questioned by officials and told to leave the area for at least 24 hours.He added that at the time, he did not think much about the people he saw. Everything changed, he claimed, after news broke about Charlie Kirk.“I don’t know these people from TP USA, never been associated with it,” Mitch told Candace Owens. “I could recognise Charlie Kirk, probably.”He continued, “But what I started seeing come across and got more familiar once I saw a picture of somebody in a ponytail with those eyes, that was that person. They were there, and the head of security [Brian Harpole] was one of the people walking out with the congressman.”Mitch said he is “95 to 99 per cent” sure about what he saw. He claimed his confidence comes from strong facial recognition skills. “There’s a picture with Erika Kirk with a ponytail from her past, that person matches who I saw at Fort Huachuca in the lobby,” he said.Candace Owens said these claims raise serious questions about why key people linked to Turning Point USA would be at a secure military site that night. She stressed that she is seeking truth, not politics, and believes the public deserves clear answers.Also Read: “Envious Of Charlie Kirk”: Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro As AmFest Clash Shakes Conservative Media","Candace owens shares fresh witness claim about erika kirk meeting security before charlie kirk death.

The Donald Trump administration suspended the Green Card lottery program after Claudio Neves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national who came to the US through this lottery pathway was found to be the suspect of Brown University shooting and he also killed an MIT professor. Valente was found dead Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot.Valente entered the US throgh the diversity lottery immigrant visa program in 2017 and was granted a green card, Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said adding that the 'heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country'.DV1 program is the Green Card lottery, which is meant for people who are born in countries which have historically low immigration to the US. Green Card lottery is not the Green Card program and the suspension of the program does not affect countries like India, China (mainland), because these countries already have a higher immigration rate to the US.The Diversity Visa lottery was a random selection process where 55,000 individuals were granted Green Cards. Nearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 visa lottery, with more than 131,000 selected when including spouses with the winners.After winning, they must undergo vetting to win admission to the United States. Portuguese citizens won only 38 slots.This is a general list of countries which are eligible for Green Card lottery though the list may change every year.

Anthony Joshua's prize money and tax breakdown



Anthony Joshua Netflix fight salary explained



Anthony Joshua walked out of Miami with his hand raised, and Jake Paul left nursing a broken jaw. However, the biggest blow of the night came after the final bell. The former heavyweight champion delivered a clean knockout in a Netflix-backed spectacle that drew massive global attention. On paper, the win looked like one of the most profitable nights of his career.Behind the scenes, however, the purse numbers tell a more complicated story. While Joshua earned a reported nine-figure purse for the crossover bout, the location of the fight and his residency status triggered a series of tax obligations. By the time every authority takes its share, the victory adds a steep financial cost. Here’s how much AJ actually keeps.Anthony Joshua and Jake Paul reportedly earned about $93 million each for the bout held in Florida. Although Florida does not charge state income tax, the United States still claims federal taxes on earnings made on American soil. That places Joshua in the highest federal income bracket at 37 percent, which accounts for roughly $52 million of his purse. That’s certainly wild.The deductions do not stop once Joshua boards a flight home.As a United Kingdom resident, he must also declare global income. Reports estimate he will owe around $11.3 million to His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, along with approximately $2.8 million in National Insurance contributions. Combined, those obligations push the total tax bill to nearly $66 million.In practical terms, Joshua is expected to retain around $74 million from the fight. It remains an enormous payday, yet it falls well short of the headline figure. Paul, meanwhile, only faces U.S. federal taxes and avoids additional obligations overseas, allowing him to keep a larger share despite losing inside the ring.The fight itself delivered what many viewers demanded. Joshua controlled the action and closed the show with a thunderous right hand that sent Paul to the canvas. The event aired live on Netflix and became one of the most talked-about boxing nights of the year.Joshua has never hidden his understanding of boxing as both sport and business. Speaking about the motivation behind such matchups, he said, “It’s everything. Ever since I came into the game I clocked the hustle. I’m not a YouTuber, a social media expert, I’m a fighter first and foremost.”He added, “I understood how to navigate my way through this industry and from day one, I knew how to make money.” Even so, he later stressed that the opportunity mattered as much as the check, saying, “It’s not even my biggest payday, it’s not about money. For me, it was more about the opportunity. I had to showcase my skills to the world.”Still, both boxers bagged standout salaries.Also Read: Anthony Joshua net worth in 2025: Inside his boxing earnings, career, and payday before Jake Paul fight","Anthony joshua and jake paul reportedly earned about $93 million each for the bout held in florida.

US officials on Sunday confirmed the pursuit of a third oil tanker from Venezuela following the sanctions imposed by Washington on Caracas.

Caracas, however, views it as an attempt to apply pressure and undermine President Nicolás Maduro’s government.Kristi Noem on Sunday shared the video of US forces rappelling from a helicopter onto the deck of the second vessel within two weeks, stating the US' commitment to pursue ""illicit movement of sanctioned oil."" Noem wrote, ""In a pre-dawn action early this morning on Dec. 20, the US Coast Guard with the support of the Department of War apprehended an oil tanker that was last docked in Venezuela.""On December 10, armed US agents intercepted and took control of an oil tanker named Skipper, which was transporting Venezuelan crude, sailing under a false flag, and already under US sanctions for earlier shipments of Iranian oil.","Us officials on sunday confirmed the pursuit of a third oil tanker from venezuela.

Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina reacted to the death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi, accusing the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of presiding over “lawlessness” and claiming the violence reflects a breakdown of governance that has worsened since her ouster.In an email interview with ANI, Hasina said the killing of the youth leader underscored a growing culture of violence under the interim administration, warning that the situation was destabilising Bangladesh internally and straining ties with neighbouring countries, particularly India.“This tragic killing reflects the lawlessness that uprooted my government and has multiplied under Yunus. Violence has become the norm while the interim government either denies it or is powerless to stop it. Such incidents destabilise Bangladesh internally but also our relationships with neighbours who are watching with justified alarm. India sees the chaos, the persecution of minorities, and the erosion of everything we built together. When you cannot maintain basic order within your borders, your credibility on the international stage collapses. This is the reality of Yunus's Bangladesh,” Hasina said.Her remarks came after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader associated with Bangladesh’s 2024 “July uprising” and spokesperson of the political platform Inqilab Mancho.Hadi was shot at close range by unidentified assailants while travelling in a rickshaw in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area on December 12. He sustained a critical gunshot injury to the head and was initially treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital before being shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition worsened.He was later airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment and admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit at Singapore General Hospital.Inqilab Mancho announced Hadi’s death in a social media post, stating that he had fought for his life for six days, according to Bangladesh news outlet Daily Star. An aspiring independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency, Hadi emerged as a prominent political figure following last year’s uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina’s removal from office.Hasina also expressed serious concern over the killing of a Hindu youth amid the unrest, linking the incident to what she described as the interim government’s failure to protect minorities and maintain basic law and order.Referring to the lynching of 27-year-old Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh district, the former PM held the Yunus-led administration responsible. Das was allegedly beaten to death by a mob over accusations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire, triggering nationwide outrage.Hasina said such incidents were contributing to diplomatic strain, particularly with India and accused the interim government of allowing extremists to dictate both domestic and foreign policy.“The strain you are witnessing is entirely of Yunus's making. His government issues hostile statements against India, fails to protect religious minorities, and allows extremists to dictate foreign policy, then expresses surprise when tensions rise. India has been Bangladesh's most steadfast friend and partner for decades. The ties between our nations are deep and fundamental; they will outlast any temporary government,” she said.She further claimed that anti-India hostility was being deliberately fuelled by radical elements emboldened under the current dispensation, pointing to attacks on diplomatic facilities, media houses and minority communities.“This hostility is being manufactured by extremists who have been emboldened by the Yunus regime. These are the same actors who marched on the Indian embassy and attacked our media offices, who attack minorities with impunity, and who forced my family and me to flee for our lives. A responsible government would protect diplomatic missions and prosecute those who threaten them. Instead, Yunus grants immunity to hooligans and calls them warriors,” Hasina alleged.Sheikh Hasina also warned of what she described as the growing influence of radical Islamist forces, claiming the interim government had released convicted terrorists and allowed extremist-linked groups to enter public life, raising alarms about Bangladesh’s secular foundations.""I share this concern, as do the millions of Bangladeshis who prefer the safe, secular state we once were. Yunus has placed extremists in cabinet positions, released convicted terrorists from prison, and allowed groups linked to international terrorist organisations to take roles in public life. He is not a politician and has no experience governing a complex nation. My fear is that radicals are using him to project an acceptable face to the international community while they systematically radicalise our institutions from within,"" Hasina said.Separately, Hasina criticised the interim government’s approach to Pakistan, arguing that major foreign policy shifts were being pursued without democratic legitimacy.She said that Bangladesh had long adhered to a balanced diplomatic principle but accused Yunus of moving hastily to reorient ties after alienating traditional allies.“Bangladesh has always believed in friendship to all, malice toward none. Of course it makes sense for our country to have a stable relationship with Pakistan, but Yunus’ headlong embrace is inappropriate. Having needlessly alienated many of our longstanding allies, he now seems desperate to find a friend on the world stage,” Hasina said.She further stressed that the interim administration lacked the mandate to undertake strategic realignments that could have long-term consequences.“The crucial point is this: Yunus has no mandate to realign Bangladesh's foreign policy. He was not elected, so he has no right to make strategic decisions that could impact generations. Once Bangladeshis can vote freely again, our foreign policy will return to serving our national interests, not the ideological fantasies of extremists who have temporarily seized power. The ties between Bangladesh and India are fundamental and will endure long after this interim government is gone,” she added.",Sheikh hasina has reacted to the death of student leader sharif usman hadi. She accused the interim government of presiding over “lawlessness” and claimed the violence reflects a breakdown of governance. Hasina also warned of what she described as the growing influence of radical islamist forces.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126112709,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1245573,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
