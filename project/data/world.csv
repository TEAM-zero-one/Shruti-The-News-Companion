Walked Out Of Burning Jet, Now Stranded In UK: AI171 Crash Survivor Vishwaskumar Ramesh Speaks Out

AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad airport has undertaken a large-scale wildlife management operation to reduce the risk of bird and animal strikes around the airfield, five months after London-bound AI-171 crashed after take-off on June 12, killing all 241 people on board.In association with the forest department, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport has begun relocating several species of birds and mammals found in and around the premises to areas at least 50–100 km away from the city.Officials said a major translocation drive involving 1,000 large fruit bats is currently underway. The bats, which roost in large numbers near Kotarpur, close to the airport along Sabarmati riverbank, are being captured and released in Polo Forest, a protected habitat about 150 km away.“Giant fruit bats became a particular concern,” said a source. “During night-time inspections, blood stains were often found on the runway or near aircraft, but there would be no feathers, hinting at bat strikes. Following these findings and based on recommendations from the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the decision to translocate certain species was taken during a series of joint review meetings,” added the source.Other species being relocated include the red-wattled lapwing, yellow-wattled lapwing, black kite, Eurasian thick-knee, and blackheaded ibis. Species commonly found around SVPIA — such as the rock pigeon, cattle egret, house crow, Indian roller, and common mynah — continue to be monitored as part of ongoing wildlife hazard management, an official said.","Ahmedabad airport has undertaken a large-scale wildlife management operation to reduce the risk of bird and animal strikes around the airfield.

Marshawn Kneeland’s final messages before the tragedy





More NFL coverage

The final hours of Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland paint a deeply tragic picture of a young life spiraling out of control. The 24-year-old athlete, once celebrated for his explosive power on the field, was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound early Thursday morning, November 6, near a crashed vehicle north of Dallas. His sudden death stunned teammates, fans, and the NFL community who just days earlier had watched him score his first career touchdown on Monday Night Football.According to The Dallas Morning News, Kneeland’s body was discovered in a portable restroom near the intersection of Network Boulevard and Gaylord Parkway in Frisco, Texas. The location was only minutes away from The Star, the Cowboys’ headquarters, and close to the site where his vehicle had crashed along the Dallas Parkway. Investigators said the tragedy unfolded after Kneeland led Texas Department of Public Safety troopers on a brief police chase when he refused to stop for a traffic violation in Addison. Moments later, he collided with a pickup truck near the Dallas Tollway’s access lanes before fleeing on foot. “The driver of the truck was not injured in the accident,” Texas DPS spokesperson Josue De La Cerda told the newspaper.As officers searched the area, authorities began receiving alarming reports suggesting that Marshawn Kneeland was in emotional distress.PEOPLE reported that Kneeland sent a “goodbye” text to his loved ones, prompting his girlfriend, Catalina, to contact police. She warned that he was armed and had a history of mental illness. At nearly the same time, a representative from the NFL called the Plano Police Department with similar information, confirming that multiple agencies were aware of his fragile mental state in the hours leading up to his death.Marshawn Kneeland, a Michigan native and a second-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, was known for his quiet confidence and work ethic. His sudden passing triggered an outpouring of grief across the league. On Sunday, November 9, NFL teams across the country - including in Berlin, Germany, where the Indianapolis Colts faced the Atlanta Falcons - observed a moment of silence to honor his memory. His story now stands as a sobering reminder of the unseen struggles many athletes face behind their public glory. Tributes are still pouring for the Cowboys star.","Tragic final hours before marshawn kneeland’s death reveal heartbreaking details.

Kash Patel’s Jet Scandal Erupts; $60M FBI Plane For Girlfriend’s Show? FBI Chief Slams Critics

3 lawsuits, 3 MAGA voices





Why conspiracy theorists believe Kash Patel's girlfriend is a spy









Kyle Seraphin, Sam Parker and Elijah Schaffer have been sued by Kash Patel 's girlfriend Alexis Wilkins for spreading malicious lies about Alexis that she works for the Israeli spy agency and 'honeytrapped' FBI director Kash Patel. Wilkins sought $5 million from each of them in damages after relentlessly fighting the rumor, claiming she has no connection with Israel. But MAGA has now drawn a line and stood by the conspiracy theorists as they are all MAGA voices, and condemned Wilkins' action against 'freedom of speech'.Though FBI director Patel is not involved with the lawsuits filed by his musician girlfriend, MAGA claimed that Patel's foundation, 'Kash Foundation', is behind the lawsuits. Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent who has been targeting Patel and his girlfriend and is one of the recipients of the lawsuit, claimed that the Binnall Law Group, led by Jesse R Binnall, filed the suit. Seraphin claimed that Binnall is also the president of the Kash Foundation, making it clear that Kash Patel, not as the FBI director, but in his personal capacity, is behind the lawsuits.The court filing against Seraphin said he has maliciously lied about Alexis Wilkins, falsely asserting that she—an American-born country singer—is an agent of foreign government, assigned to manipulate and compromise the Director of the FBI.Then, Wilkins filed a lawsuit against Sam Parker, who is also a former US Senate candidate in Utah. “Parker has repeatedly lied about Wilkins, falsely asserting and suggesting that she—an American-born country singer—is an agent of foreign government, assigned to manipulate and compromise the Director of the FBI,"" the lawsuit against Parker said.The lawsuit against Elijah created a storm as Elijah did not post anything about Patel and Wilkins but shared a post with a photo of them. “Schaffer has perpetuated a malicious lie about Alexis Wilkins, falsely claiming that she—an American-born country singer—is an agent of foreign government, assigned to manipulate and compromise the Director of the FBI,"" the lawsuit against Schaffer said.MAGA activists expressed their disenchantment with Patel as Candace Owens called for Patel's resignation and called him a ""teenager in love"" representing the Federal government. ""Apparently when governments and people in powerful positions get caught lying, their only weapon is to sue people. It is absolutely pathetic and it’s meant to scare us into silence. “We will bankrupt you!” These people should be treated with contempt,"" Candace wrote.One of the main reasons behind this conspiracy theory is Alexis' association with PragerU whose CEO is a former Israeli soldier. Alexis Wilkins asserted that she is a presenter on the platform and she had never been to Israel. She is a Christian American born in the US.Another reason behind the conspiracy theory is the age difference between Kash Patel (45) and Wilkins (26). Conspiracy theorists believe Patel has been honeytrapped. But they have been dating since 2023, before Patel became the FBi director.","Kyle seraphin claimed kash patel's foundation is behind the lawsuits that his girlfriend alexis wilkins filed against maga influencers for 'israeli spy' narrative.

Right-wing podcaster Candace Owens has now called for FBI director Kash Patel's resignation after his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins sued Elijah Schaffer for $5 million. Schaffer, a MAGA podcaster, reposted a thread on the viral conspiracy theory that Wilkins is a Mossad agent and she honeytrapped Kash Patel. Schaffer did not add anything on his part to the viral thread but posted a photo of Patel with his girlfriend.Schaffer became the third MAGA operative to have been sued by Kash Patel's girlfriend -- the other two being Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent, and Sam Paker , an influencer. Wilkins repeatedly dismissed these conspiracy theories about her and asserted that she has no connection with Israel, never been there, and she has been dating Kash Patel before Patel became the FBI director.As the conspiracy theory is being churned by MAGA insiders, it is clear that Patel has been isolated inside MAGA. And now, Candace has openly called for Patel's resignation. ""Kash Patel has to step down. This is excruciatingly embarrassing. He’s a teenager in love representing the Federal government,"" Candace said.Responding to the lawsuit in a post on X, Schaffer called it ""the legal equivalent of your romantic partner getting mad at you for cheating on her in her dream"".""Totally delusional and paranoid legal behavior - still can’t believe Kash is trusted w/ the FBI & sanctioned this stupidity,"" Schaffer wrote. Schaffer also appealed to Elon Musk for help reminding Musk that he once said he would pay for the legal fees of anyone sued for their free speech posts on X.Elijah Schaffer is where MAGA drew the line and pushed back on Alexis Wilkins' lawsuits. MAGA activists ranted that the FBI director has no real job but to fund his girlfriend's lawsuits against people who share some posts on social media.But Patel made it clear before that he would not allow any attack on his family. In a long post that he recently made, he also hinted that the attacks were coming from supposed allies. “The disgustingly baseless attacks against Alexis — a true patriot and the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life — are beyond pathetic. She is a rock-solid conservative and a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes. I’m so blessed she’s in my life.

Antonio Brown pleads not guilty, claims self-defense



More NFL coverage

Antonio Brown is back in Miami -- and this time, it’s not for football. The former NFL star has officially returned to South Florida to face attempted murder charges stemming from a May 2025 incident at a boxing event. Brown, who was detained in Dubai last week and extradited through New York, was seen walking off a private jet in Miami wearing a blue jacket, as captured in a video shared by Andy Slater of Fox Sports 640. Hours later, Brown was booked into the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center, where he posed for a new mugshot.His return marks the latest chapter in a months-long legal saga that began when an arrest warrant was issued earlier this year. Brown, 37, reportedly fled the country before being taken into custody in Dubai. After telling a New Jersey judge he would not contest extradition, Brown was flown back to face charges that could carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years if convicted.Brown’s attorney, Mark Eiglarsh, filed a not guilty plea on his client’s behalf, maintaining that the former wide receiver acted lawfully. According to Eiglarsh, the altercation at the Adin Ross boxing event erupted when Brown was confronted by former friend Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu.The encounter allegedly turned violent before Brown fired shots, an act his defense insists was driven by fear and self-preservation.“Brown was attacked that night and acted within his legal right to protect himself from an individual who had previously committed criminal acts against him,” Eiglarsh said. “The actions he was forced to take were solely in self-defense against the alleged victim's violent behavior.

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement has dominated headlines, but the excitement surrounding their upcoming wedding now comes with a dose of drama. The pop megastar and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, who got engaged before the 2025 NFL season, are reportedly finalizing plans for a 2026 ceremony, one that’s already drawing attention for who won’t be there.According to multiple reports, longtime friends Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds might not make the guest list. The surprising exclusion comes after years of public closeness between the two couples, leaving fans stunned. As Swift focuses on peace and privacy, speculation grows about whether the alleged rift is personal, professional, or both.As planning continues, Kelce remains ecstatic about the engagement, expressing his joy on New Heights. “Exciting, it’s been awesome,” he said. “It’s been so much fun hearing from everybody, seeing the internet go crazy. I still get giddy. It’s been really fun telling everybody who I’m going to be spending the rest of my life with.”Swift, meanwhile, has reportedly handpicked her inner circle for the big day, including Selena Gomez and Gigi Hadid as bridesmaids. However, reports from Yahoo and TheSpun claim that Swift has no plans to invite Lively and Reynolds, once considered part of her “chosen family.”Sources allege that Swift distanced herself after Lively’s name surfaced in relation to Justin Baldoni’s sexual assault case, which briefly mentioned the singer.“Taylor wants zero drama. Sadly, that means Blake’s out,” one insider told Rob Shuter. The news reportedly left Lively and Reynolds “shocked but resigned,” especially considering Swift’s history with the couple, she even used the names of their daughters, James, Inez, and Betty, in her Folklore album.Despite rumors of a smaller, more intimate ceremony, Swift recently hinted she might extend her invitations widely, saying she would invite “anyone I ever talked to.” Still, insiders insist the couple’s focus remains on authenticity, love, and a celebration free from controversy.As Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce prepare for their 2026 wedding, one thing is clear, the singer is prioritizing peace over politics, surrounding herself only with those who truly support her next chapter as Mrs. Kelce.","Taylor swift and travis kelce's 2026 wedding plans are reportedly excluding longtime friends blake lively and ryan reynolds.

Indian-origin Nikki Haley's son Nalin Haley , in his first Fox interview, said that people should not be shocked that he wants Indians out of the country as his loyalty, despite his roots in India, is to America. The 24-year-old son of the former governor of South Carolina recently created a stir because of his extreme views that the US should ban legal immigration as well. He also made news for trashing Republicans like Vivek Ramaswamy, for asserting that MAGA can't rise above religion, as the GOP cares about religion.Speaking about the 'anxiety' of his generation, Nalin Haley said graduates who are around his age have six figures in debt and have not got jobs. He said none of his friends has got a job even after a year and a half after graduation with good degrees. Those who have jobs are employed temporarily or doing jobs that don't require a degree. He said he does pretty well but can't envision buying a house in future.""This isn't normalcy. The American Dream is becoming less and less attainable with each passing day,"" Haley said.America is now prioritizing foreign workers who are coming and taking American jobs, Haley said, adding that companies which are not prioritizing Americans should be punished.Haley was told that his stand on H-1B is surprising to many as he is an Indian-American and H-1B facilitates a lot of indians in US job sectors.""They shouldn't be because I have seen how it has affected my friends and those around me. At the end of the day, my loyalty is to America and that's part of assimilation,"" he said blaming former president Barack Obama for immigrants coming to America and not assimilating.""What we saw with Obama is that we had a lot of immigrants coming here and the thought was that you don't need to change, you don't need to have your loyalty, you could be who you are. No, you need to assimilate. You need to act like an American and support American values and support American workers and American people.

Donald Trump experiences boos, mixed reactions and on-field responsibilities in a high profile Commanders game appearance

Tom Brady’s quarterback advice resurfaces as Donald Trump revisits his early football memories

Donald Trump went on the Fox NFL broadcast during the Detroit Lions win over the Washington Commanders on Nov. 9, and the moment was supposed to be soft and nostalgic. It did not stay that way. Analyst Jonathan Vilma asked the president how many touchdowns he scored at New York Military Academy, and Donald Trump admitted, “I’m not sure I had any.” That single line immediately became the most talked about moment of the visit and gave the Fox booth a rare unfiltered reaction from a president who usually avoids openings like this.Fox showed an old black and white team photo of Donald Trump wearing No. 85 while he talked about playing tight end in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Donald Trump explained that his quarterback could only throw about ten yards and said, “I would say ten yards was a long pass.” He told the crew he loved playing the sport and repeated that he “never tells a lie” when the topic of touchdowns came up again. The moment felt light from his side, but the hesitation made the clip travel everywhere within minutes.Donald Trump became the first sitting president to attend a regular season NFL game since Jimmy Carter in 1978.He arrived after the first quarter of the Washington Commanders loss to the Detroit Lions and the stadium cameras caught him in his suite with House Speaker Mike Johnson. The crowd reacted loudly and not in his favor.The boos continued at halftime when Donald Trump read the Oath of Enlistment during an on-field ceremony for new military recruits. He left before the end of a game where the Commanders dropped to 3-7.During the same Fox NFL segment, Donald Trump brought up a moment involving Tom Brady. He told the crew that the seven time Super Bowl winner once gave him quarterback advice, saying, “You’ve got to put it in their hands.” Donald Trump added that Tom Brady told him quarterbacks need to help receivers instead of firing the ball without feel. Jonathan Vilma laughed and said Brady was “pretty good,” and the exchange added a second viral clip to the booth hit list.Donald Trump also touched on the Washington Commanders stadium project. ESPN reported on Nov. 8 that the president communicated through an intermediary about having his name attached to the new stadium, a project estimated at nearly four billion dollars. On the broadcast he said, “They’re going to build a beautiful stadium. That is what I am involved in. We are getting all the approvals and everything else.”The game was another stop in his long run of sports appearances this year. He attended the U.S. Open, a Yankees game and the FIFA World Cup final. At Sunday’s game, Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon Ra St. Brown even performed the “Trump dance” after his touchdown celebration.

‘Deport Him…’: Team Trump Moves To Strip Mamdani Of US Citizenship After NYC Win

New York will survive, but will get worse before it gets better







Billionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai as he pledged to freeze rents because tenants' incomes have stagnated. Sternlicht who has both commercial and residential holdings in NYC said when one neighbor finds out that their neighbor is not paying, they stop paying and thus NYC will turn into Mumbai.“Over $100 million, every project in New York has to go union, and it’s super expensive. It leads to extremely expensive housing. And other developers have tried to cut deals with the unions, but they rule New York, and that’s one of the key reasons the blue states are so expensive and they’re so difficult to add supply of housing to,” Sternlicht said in an interview with CNBC Property Play, reacting to Mamdani's win.“And then the far left gets really nuts and says the tenants don’t have to pay. Well, you can’t kick them out if they don’t pay. So the neighbor finds out the neighbor isn’t paying, and they don’t pay, and the next guy doesn’t pay, and then you’re basically going to turn New York City into Mumbai,"" he said.Sternlicht said his New York team is considering leaving the city as well.“The core issues are not what he’s focusing on. We need to increase housing.That’s not going to happen easily, right? You need serious subsidies from the government if they want us to work with unions. The unions have to be more accommodative on their work laws and the wages and everything else, otherwise you can’t add economically,"" he said. Sternlicht said rent freezing is not the solution but increasing housing is.Sternlicht said he believed New York will survive but will first gets a lot worse before it gets better. “People are working really hard. Just how do we help others to do well and believe in the American dream? That’s probably a better message for a leader in the city than saying, let’s just tax everyone who’s been successful, force them to leave and then have to rely on Washington for handouts to basically keep the city going,” Sternlicht added.",Billionaire real estate investor barry sternlicht said new york will turn into mumbai under new mayor zohran mamdani's administration.

“If Hasan is going to reach this hard to say that I kickstarted Fuentes’ career, then I am responsible for his career 10x over.

Also, Hasan f*cked a 15 year old when he was visiting that brothel in Berlin, that's why he doesn’t like to talk about it as much now.”

“shocking.”

“It’s common knowledge behind the scenes. If Hasan wants to contest it, he can sue me, but he won’t because truth is an absolute defense against defamation.”





Online streamer Steven Kenneth Bonnell II, better known as Destiny, has once again ignited controversy by making a serious allegation against fellow streamer Hasan Piker, known online as HasanAbi. The claim came shortly after a heated exchange between the two, following Hasan’s remarks about Destiny’s past association with far-right figure Nick Fuentes. In a viral post on X (formerly Twitter), Destiny responded by accusing HasanAbi of inappropriate conduct involving a girl during a visit to Berlin, an accusation that immediately spread across social platforms and streaming communities.The post, which quickly garnered thousands of reactions, quoted Destiny saying:The intensity of Destiny’s statement immediately reignited old tensions between the two, drawing widespread attention from viewers and fellow creators.The allegation surfaced after HasanAbi discussed Nick Fuentes during a recent livestream, where he said he had long avoided covering the controversial political commentator to prevent amplifying extremist voices. Hasan added that figures like Destiny helped give Fuentes a platform through debates and exposure, prompting Destiny’s strong reaction online. Following Destiny’s post, users on X called the accusationandDestiny replied to one comment, stating,HasanAbi has previously acknowledged visiting a Berlin brothel years ago but has never mentioned anything resembling the claims made by Destiny. No credible evidence has emerged to support the allegation, and it currently remains unverified speculation circulating on social media.The feud between Destiny and HasanAbi has now escalated into one of the most heated controversies in the streaming world, with the community divided over the nature and validity of the claims.

Asian equities edged higher on Wednesday following signs that the US government shutdown could end soon and amid data pointing to a cooling jobs market, which has raised expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.Markets, however, remain cautious on technology stocks after a year of strong AI-driven gains.In early Asian trade, major indices rose, with Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 up 0.2% at 50,927, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbing 1.1% to 26,984, and Shanghai’s Composite adding 0.3% to 4,015, as per news agency AFP.Despite the overall positive trend, technology stocks faced pressure after Japanese investor SoftBank sold its entire stake in US chipmaker Nvidia for $5.8 billion, leading to a 3% drop in Nvidia shares and a 10% fall in SoftBank’s Tokyo listing.After the Senate approved a temporary spending bill, the US House of Representatives is set to vote, with President Donald Trump expected to sign the legislation, potentially reopening government services as early as Friday.The shutdown, which began on October 1, left a million federal workers unpaid and delayed key economic data, complicating the Fed’s policy decisions.Private payroll data from ADP showed US companies shed an average of 11,250 jobs per week in the four weeks ending October 25, highlighting weakness in the labour market and increasing bets on a Fed rate cut in December, reported Bloomberg.Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas also reported that October saw the highest level of layoffs in 22 years.Oil prices were largely steady, following gains in the previous session, as traders weighed potential demand increases from a reopening of the US government.Brent crude slipped 8 cents to $65.08 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate fell 7 cents to $60.97, reported Reuters.Analysts noted that restoring government operations could boost consumer confidence, travel, and jet fuel demand ahead of the holiday season.On the supply side, US sanctions on Russian oil producers, including Lukoil and Rosneft, continue to influence global markets, prompting some Chinese refiners to seek non-Russian crude and schedule maintenance disruptions, according to Reuters.Currency and bond markets reflected cautious optimism. The euro dipped to $1.1579, the pound fell to $1.3143, and the dollar strengthened against the yen to 154.37, while US 10-year Treasury yields fell to 4.08% on expectations of looser monetary policy, as per Bloomberg.Asian investors are now monitoring the House vote in Washington closely, with a potential government reopening seen as a key catalyst for equities and crude demand in the near term.","Tokyo's nikkei 225 up 0.2% at 50,927, hong kong's hang seng climbs 1.1% to 26,984.
