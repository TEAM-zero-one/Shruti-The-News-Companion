‘Operation Sagar Bandhu’: India flies 12 tonnes of aid to flood-hit Sri Lanka; island battered by Cyclone Ditwah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sagar-bandhu-india-flies-12-tonnes-of-aid-to-flood-hit-sri-lanka-island-battered-by-cyclone-ditwah/articleshow/125650341.cms,"India flies C-130 J plane carrying approx 12 tons of humanitarian aid to cylcone-hit Sri Lanka



External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday announced that a C-130J aircraft carrying around 12 tonnes of humanitarian aid has landed in Colombo. The delivery is part of India’s Operation Sagar Bandhu, launched on Friday to assist Sri Lanka in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, which has so far claimed 80 lives.Sharing the update on X, Jaishankar wrote, “#OperationSagarBandhu unfolds. @IAF_MCC C-130J plane carrying approximately 12 tons of humanitarian aid, including tents, tarpaulins, blankets, hygiene kits, and ready-to-eat food items, lands in Colombo.”India initiated Operation Sagar Bandhu as part of its immediate response to assist cyclone-affected areas. The first relief consignments were transported by the Indian Navy’s aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and frontline warship INS Udaigiri, which arrived in Colombo on Friday and handed over supplies to Sri Lankan authorities.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, conveyed his condolences to the people of Sri Lanka, expressing grief over the lives lost in the cyclone and extending solidarity with India’s “closest maritime neighbour.” He noted that India had swiftly dispatched relief supplies and critical Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) equipment under the operation.“We stand ready to provide more aid and assistance as the situation evolves,” said PM Modi, adding that the support was guided by India’s Neighbourhood First policy and Vision MAHASAGAR.This comes as India bids to offer help Sri Lanka has been reeling from floods and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah. The island nation is facing one of its most severe disasters in recent years, with widespread damage to infrastructure and rising casualties. According to PTI, more than 80 people have died as the storm unleashed heavy rains across multiple provinces.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) separately reported 61 deaths and 25 people missing, while nearly 44,000 individuals from over 12,000 families have been affected since adverse weather began on November 16.The crisis intensified as Sri Lanka’s Western Province faced warnings of an “unprecedented disaster situation” owing to rising water levels in the Kelani and Attanagalu rivers. Several districts in the Northern, North-Central, Central, North-Western, Sabaragamuwa and Western Provinces are expected to receive over 200 mm of rain, according to the Sri Lankan Meteorological Department. Rainfall above 150 mm is also likely in parts of Trincomalee, Badulla, Galle and Matara. The DMC reported four homes destroyed and more than 600 partially damaged in the ongoing deluge.(With inputs from agencies)","India flies c-130 j plane carrying approx 12 tons of humanitarian aid to cylcone-hit sri lanka.

Parliamentary panel studying ONOE bill to seek extension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliamentary-panel-studying-onoe-bill-to-seek-extension/articleshow/125649577.cms,"NEW DELHI: The parliamentary committee scrutinising the constitutional amendment bill that proposes simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly elections will seek an extension in its tenure from Parliament as it needs more time to gather views of different stakeholders, including national and regional political parties, the panel’s chairperson P P Chaudhary said on Friday.Its current tenure is till the first day of the last week of the coming Winter Session, which is scheduled between Dec 1 and Dec 19.“The committee needs more time,” Chaudhary told TOI, while emphasising that opinions of various constitutional experts make it clear that the Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill, commonly known as one-nation-one-election (ONOE) bill, is not violative of the Constitution’s basic structure, a key argument of opposition parties against the proposed law.NDA govt’s vigorous push for simultaneous polls has also received full-throttle endorsement from Law Commission. The “refreshing concept of synchronising of elections” is in larger national interest and is “squarely within the periphery of amending powers of the Parliament,” it has said, according to sources.In its written opinion to the committee, Law Commission is learnt to have said, “Far from undermining democracy, the proposed bill aims to strengthen it by ensuring stability, reducing the constant drain of elections, and allowing govts to focus on governance.”Its representatives along with those from Election Commission of India are scheduled to appear before the Chaudhary-led committee on Dec 4. It has rejected the arguments of opposition parties and some experts that the bill violates the Constitution’s basic structure and federal character.It has also backed some of the more contentious provisions of the bill, especially related to the sweeping powers given to EC under its Article 82A(5) to defer an assembly poll if the poll body thinks that it cannot be conducted simultaneously with that of Lok Sabha.Besides other experts, some former CJIs too, in their comments to the committee, have questioned the “unfettered” powers delegated to EC in the bill and suggested corrective measures, including the need for parliamentary nod in such cases.Law Commission, in its opinion, has equated EC with judiciary, executive and legislature when it comes to upholding democracy, asserting that Article 324 of the Constitution bestows on it extensive and broad powers and protects it from any external influence.","The parliamentary committee scrutinising the constitutional amendment bill will seek an extension in its tenure from parliament.

NEW DELHI: India on Friday sealed a Rs 7,995 crore deal with the US as part of a “follow-on support” package for the Navy’s fleet of 24 Seahawk helicopters for five years.The signing of the contract comes amid a strain in ties after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariffs on Indian goods in late Aug.The defence ministry said it signed Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOAs) with the US for sustainment support of the MH60R helicopter fleet . Manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation, it is an all-weather helicopter designed to support multiple missions with state of the art avionics and sensors. The LOAs were inked under the foreign military sales programme of the US.India had signed an agreement with the US for procurement of 24-MH 60Rs in Feb 2020. The MH 60R Seahawk is a maritime variant of the Blackhawk helicopter.The sustainment support is a comprehensive package that includes provisioning of spares, support equipment, product support, training and technical support, and repair and replenishment of components, according to the defence ministry.It also provides for setting up of intermediate level component repairs and periodic maintenance inspection facilities in India for the choppers. “In-country development of these facilities will ensure capability build-up in the long run and reduced dependence on the US govt, thus aligning with the vision of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’,” the ministry said. “This would further lead to indigenous product and services development through MSMEs & other Indian firms,” it said in a statement.","India on friday sealed a rs 7,995 crore deal with the us as part of a ‘follow-on support’ package for the navy’s fleet of 24 seahawk helicopters for five years.

When I was young, my aunt often took me to the discourses of Krubananda Variyaar. I remember sitting in crowded halls, listening to him unwrap profound truths with humour.In one, he told the story of a saint who lived on food grown in his garden, cooked his own meals and wanted for nothing. The king, his disciple, kept inviting him to the palace. One day, the saint agreed. A lavish dinner was served, and finally, payasam arrived in a golden cup studded with diamonds.The next day, the palace found the cup missing. The minister went to the saint’s ashram to ask about it, but before he could speak, the saint confessed. “I was going to return it today,” he said. “I kept wondering how such a desire entered my mind. Perhaps when I ate palace food, the thoughts and desires of everyone there seeped into me. Desire made me steal.” Variyaar Swami paused and concluded, “You are what you eat.”Only years later did I fully understand it.Our gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that form a richness as biodiverse as the Amazon rainforest. Good bacteria digest food, produce hormones, control blood sugar and influence our moods. A doctor once told me that 90% of cells are bacterial; only 10% are human. In many ways, we are more microbe than man.No wonder the gut is called the second brain.Thiruvalluvar’s chapter on ‘Medicine’ throws us into a sea of surprise. It does not speak of any branch of practices or procedures. Six out of 10 couplets in this chapter talk about gut health and the need for moderation in eating . Among them,Izhivarindhu UnbaanKann InbanPol NirkkumKazhiperu IrayaanKann Noai.As pleasure dwells with a moderate eater,So is disease with a voracious glutton.He was perhaps aware that gut health is the key to all health.Ilya Mechnikov, the Russian scientist of the early 1900s, accidentally opened the world’s eyes to gut microbes. To prove the body houses vast bacterial populations, he drank a broth of bacteria. He remained fine; his student too. But a third colleague nearly died. That was when Mechnikov realised each person carries a unique microbial world. What nourishes one may endanger another. Balance is the key.Mechnikov would have turned in his grave had he known about the invention of antibiotics. He would have been distressed to see antibiotics destroying good bacteria along with the harmful ones.Indian medical systems, interestingly, did not see microbes as enemies or as causes of illness. They focused on balancing vand. Here again, balance is the key.Modern research now says the gut operates almost independently. The digestive tract contains more than 100 million neurons. Serotonin, our natural antidepressant, is mainly produced in the gut. And that is why we sayOur emotional signals often start in the gut long before they reach the mind.When this delicate system is disrupted through overeating, irregular meals, or processed foods, the results are immediate. Public health experts call obesity the silent second pandemic. Late-night biryani shops, round-the-clock food delivery, and eating at all hours have become routine. And through it all, our gut silently loses its balance.Thiruvalluvar’s rule remains the best remedy: eat what you can digest, and what truly agrees with your system.Science affirms it.Experience repeats it.And our own gut whispers it, quietly, persistently reminding us that well-being beginswith what we choose to place inside.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

Social media response:

Yet you fired a ton of people who took care of that land and want to destroy it for oil.

Sounds like another grift as you kill tourism -- great f****g work!





Are you guys really that stupid to think that tourists will opt to go? You’re going to leave the NPS with a funding shortfall. More stupidity like firing the majority of park workers





So Americans get discounted access, foreigners pay more, and everything’s going digital.

BTW stop tracking us, we don't appreciate it. When you show your American The Beautiful Pass at the gate - they scan BOTH your pass AND your ID. That is a violation of our civil rights.





America really said “tourists pay, patriots play free” and called it progress





A row erupted after the US Department of the Interior announced sweeping changes to national park access, including higher fees for nonresidents and expanded digital passes. Starting January 1, 2026, US residents will pay $80 for an Annual Pass, while nonresidents will be charged $250.Nonresidents without a pass will also face a $100 per person fee to enter 11 of the most visited parks.“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”""The Department of @Interior is making it easier for AMERICANS to enjoy our National Parks: U.S. residents enjoy affordable pricing, while foreigners pay a high rate,"" the White House said in a post on X.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, ""patriotic fee-free"" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before, reported BBC .The Department has also announced a set of resident-only patriotic fee-free days for 2026. These include President’s Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and President Trump’s birthday, the Independence Day weekend, the 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday and Veteran’s Day.Revenue from the revised fee structure will be invested directly back into the national parks, supporting upgrades to visitor facilities, essential maintenance work and improved services across the system. Critics have urged the Department to take a closer look at how the higher nonresident rates affect H-1B and F-1 visa holders. The new charges could disproportionately burden international visitors.","Starting january 1, 2026, us residents will pay $80 for an annual pass, while nonresidents will be charged $250.

DC Shooter’s CIA-Link Sparks Trump's Afghan Immigration Freeze; Biden-Era Policy Under Lens

How Lakanwal came to US

Operation Allies Welcome’s and its flaws

Why was the program created?

After the DC shooting





A federal programme set up during President Joe Biden ’s term is under lens again after officials confirmed that Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the suspect accused of shooting and critically injuring two National Guard soldiers near the White House, entered US through it.The initiative was known as Operation Allies Welcome and was designed to help Afghans fleeing Taliban retaliation after the fall of Kabul in August 2021. A series of reports suggest the system was riddled with errors that may have allowed individuals to enter with little oversight, according to the New York Post.29-year-old Lakanwal lived in Washington state and arrived in the country through Operation Allies Welcome. A Trump administration official said he applied for asylum in December last year and received approval in April. He had no known criminal history. His background came into light because an ID badge going viral online appeared to show links to the Afghan “Zero Units,” which were elite forces trained and equipped by the CIA.The badge referenced the “Kandahar Strike Force,” known as the 03 Unit, and “Firebase Gecko,” a base once used by US intelligence in Kandahar.CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed that the suspect had previously worked “with the US Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.”A former senior Afghan general told CBS News the 03 Unit was “the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA,” and operated entirely under CIA command. These units, while trusted by US agencies, were also feared in Afghanistan for alleged extrajudicial killings during night raids.A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General report released last year revealed eye-catching problems in the programme. The review found a lot of data errors in the systems used to document Afghans arriving in the US. Some individuals were issued multiple identification numbers or had their names spelled incorrectly. The report said that such glitches made it difficult to track “biographic or criminal history data. ”It stated, “[Immigration] personnel must have accurate information on individuals to ensure the integrity of the adjudication and enforcement processes.” It added that data errors could hinder officials' ability to identify individuals “quickly and accurately.”Once arrivals were inside the country, the report said there was no clear process to monitor when their parole expired. “We found DHS does not have a process to monitor parole expiration for individual OAW parolees and has not designated a component to monitor their parole expiration,” the report said. Officials from CBP, USCIS and ICE all said they believed the responsibility belonged to someone else.Operation Allies Welcome was created to resettle Afghans who had assisted the US during the war and were at risk under Taliban rule. The initiative allowed roughly 90,000 Afghans to become eligible for Special Immigration Visas and provided help with processing and resettlement. Many members of the CIA-linked Zero Units were placed high on evacuation priority lists because they were considered prime targets for Taliban revenge.In the wake of the attack, President Trump said his administration would “re-examine” all Afghans who entered the country during Biden’s presidency. The White House has not yet commented on the report’s findings.The Taliban government has also not responded to requests for comment regarding Lakanwal’s arrest.Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed that the two injured soldiers underwent surgery.","Operation allies welcome, a federal initiative meant to aid afghans escaping the taliban, finds itself in a troubling spotlight.

US president Donald Trump said on Thursday that Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two National Guard soldiers shot near the White House a day earlier, had died of her injuries. The second soldier, he said, was “fighting for his life”.Trump called Beckstrom a “highly respected, young, magnificent person” and said he learned of her death just before starting a Thanksgiving video call with US troops.

Projection disguised as commentary





The ending that should disturb all of us









Since Donald Trump announced he would be picking JD Vance to be his running mate, Usha Vance has undergone the kind of scrutiny that has hardly ever occurred to an Indian-American. MAGA folks freaked out that she was a practising Hindu, and it was immaterial that her faith had helped JD find Christ again. Democrats wondered how a person with Usha’s credentials (Yale, academic family) could be with someone like JD or who followed JD’s politics. JD Vance hasn’t helped himself, like the time he told a Turning Point USA audience that he hoped his “agnostic” wife — what a way to erase her religion — would embrace Christ, even doubling down to claim that it was every Christian’s job to help others see the light. But even after all the disparaging rumours aimed at Usha Vance, a recent podcast featuring Joy Reid starkly shows how easy it is for people to dehumanise Indian-Americans.Reid, wearing a t-shirt that says F*** Trump, F*** ICE, Free Palestine, Unoccupy Chicago, and a bunch of other messages which combined explain the dire strait in which the Democratic Party finds itself, casually claims that JD Vance will drop his “brown Hindu wife” Usha for “white queen” Erika Kirk.What makes this moment especially disturbing is how neatly it fits into the rise of anti-India hate online and offline.In recent years, Indians in the West have found themselves cast into every role except that of actual human beings. They are colonial agents one day, fascist foot soldiers the next, tech bros on Monday, caste villains on Tuesday, and accidental beneficiaries of “white adjacency” by the weekend. It is a rotating caricature factory that reduces 1.4 billion people to whichever label best suits the Western cultural mood. And Indian-Americans are often caught at the intersection of all these projections. The same progressives who champion diversity suddenly talk as if Hindu identity is a contaminated category. The same conservatives who praise family values treat brown families as demographic threats. Usha Vance, unfortunately, becomes the perfect canvas for the week’s anxieties. Not because of anything she said, but because her existence unsettles the simplistic narratives both sides prefer.The moment Reid begins to speak, it is clear this is not analysis. It is improvisation dressed up as political insight. “They can’t have the successor to MAGA be the guy with the brown Hindu wife,” she declares, as if she has unlocked a hidden psychological truth about an entire voting bloc. She calls them “Christian nationalists,” insists Usha “won’t work,” and then suggests JD Vance is either sacrificing his wife for ambition or that Usha herself is complicit in the performance.She then fixates on JD Vance’s public hug with Erika Kirk, calling it “slap-and-tickle” and “the weirdest shit,” and pivots to critiquing Erika’s clothing with, “You’re supposed to be a widow. You in leather pants?” These are not the observations of a serious political thinker. They are the lines of someone scrolling through gossip threads and mistaking them for structural analysis.Finally she arrives at the centrepiece of her theory. “Wouldn’t it be the most perfect MAGA fairytale if he finally sees the light that he needs a white queen instead of this brown Hindu.” She adds a quick “I’m not saying that’s happening,” but the narrative is already complete. The hierarchy is drawn. The brown woman is written out.What is most striking about the segment is the contradiction between Reid’s t-shirt and her argument. She wears slogans about liberation, solidarity, resistance and justice. Then she denies every one of those ideals to a brown woman who did nothing except marry someone with different politics.Reid says she is calling out racism, but she ends up performing it. She does not see Usha Vance as a lawyer, a mother, a daughter of immigrants or a woman balancing two faith traditions. She sees her as a demographic problem. A cultural obstacle. An inconvenient symbol of brownness and Hindu identity that, in her mind, cannot fit inside a movement she despises.It is easy to condemn racism when it comes from the other side. It is harder to notice when it slips out while criticising the other side. The t-shirt says “Free Palestine.” The monologue denies empathy to an Indian-American Hindu woman who is, by every measure, as much a minority as anyone Reid claims to defend.Underneath the moral performance, the entire theory comes from three unrelated moments. Erika Kirk, grieving the murder of her husband, said she wished she had been pregnant when he died. It was a moment of pain, not a confession. JD Vance hugged her on stage in full public view. It was sympathy, not symbolism. And Usha Vance appeared without her wedding ring one afternoon. It was an ordinary oversight, not a marital crisis.None of these events belong together. They were stitched into a story only because the internet craves drama. And instead of challenging that logic, Reid absorbed it, embroidered it and presented it as something profound.The widow became an archetype. The wife became a liability. The husband became a character in a political telenovela.It was rumour inflated into racial prophecy.There is a special cruelty in dragging two women into a plot they never agreed to inhabit. Erika Kirk is barely beginning her life as a widow, yet she is recast as a “white queen” waiting in the wings. Usha Vance, who has kept an almost painfully private profile, is turned into an emblem of “brown Hindu” undesirability. Neither woman asked to be the heroine or the villain of this fever dream. Neither deserves to be reduced to the colour wheel of someone else’s political imagination.JD Vance, for all his flaws, becomes a piece on a board. In Reid’s story he is not a husband or father. He is a man conducting a marital reshuffle to please a base that exists only inside her claim.The humanity is lost. What remains is theatre.The problem is not simply that Joy Reid repeated a conspiracy. It is that she treated it as obvious. She began with the assumption that MAGA is racist and ended with the conclusion that its chosen successor must behave in ways that confirm her view. It is commentary built backwards: the conclusion arrives first, the justification later. This is the same logic she spent years accusing right-wing media of using. Start with the villain. Start with the allegation. Fill in the rest. Do not worry about the truth. Worry about the story.When the noise settles, the truth is small and human. A widow missing her husband. A woman who occasionally forgets her ring. A public hug meant as comfort. There is no conspiracy here. Only life happening in its messy, tender, inconvenient way.Yet three people were dragged through a podcast and reduced to plot points. Usha became the wrong kind of wife. Erika became the tempting “other woman.” JD became the protagonist of a love triangle that never existed.And this was said on a platform that presents itself as political thought.Imagine, for a moment, the mirror image. Imagine a conservative podcaster declaring that Michelle Obama was the “wrong kind of wife,” and that Barack Obama needed a “white queen” to be more acceptable to America. Imagine the outrage. Imagine the editorials. Imagine the rightly furious conversations about racism, misogyny and the dehumanisation of Black women.Now imagine what Usha Vance felt hearing her marriage framed the same way. This was not commentary. It was a small, callous story told with the confidence of someone who assumed there would be no consequences. It revealed how quickly empathy collapses when the woman in question does not belong to your political tribe. It showed how easily the language of justice can be used to justify the erasure of someone else’s dignity. The podcast will fade. The clip will scroll away. But the message remains. It tells us that for some commentators, solidarity is conditional. Dignity is selective. And some women are granted humanity only when their politics align. That should trouble us far more than any rumour ever could.","Since donald trump announced he would be picking jd vance to be his running mate, usha vance has undergone the kind of scrutiny that has hardly ever occurred to an indian-american. A recent podcast featuring joy reid starkly shows how easy it is for people to dehumanise indian-americans.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125617773,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-119368,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Untold Bravery in Operation Sindoor: CISF Reveals It Foiled Pakistan Attack on Uri Hydro Power Plant

NEW DELHI: India has secured third rank in the Asia Power Index, giving it the status of 'major power'. India has secured this ranking in the Lowy Institute study based on its performance in Operation Sindoor The first two ranks of 'superpowers' were retained by the United States and China, respectively.In 2024, India was ranked among the 'middle powers', with a comprehensive score of 38.1, whereas in this year's reports, India scored 40 out of 100. It stands ahead of Japan and Russia, which hold the fourth and fifth positions, scoring 38.8 and 32.1, respectively. However, the nation still sees a large aspirational gap as compared to China, which has 73.7 points on the index. The US topped the rankings with 80.5 points.As per the detailed assessments, India's rank is backed by its growth in terms of economic and military capabilities. Notably, India rose to ninth place in economic relationships, driven by increases in inward investment.The Lowy Institute said the modest advances in India’s geopolitical relevance were measured through international connectivity, leverage, and technological development.It also highlighted India's military capabilities to have grown steadily.""For the most part, these gains were from improved expert appraisals of its capability, which were likely influenced by India's performance in Operation Sindoor, launched in May 2025, which added to India's recent combat experience,"" the institute said.India saw its sharpest decline in terms of defence networks, dropping its rank to 11th position. It dropped two ranks lower as compared to the 2024 rankings, which were overtaken by the Philippines and Thailand.According to the index, India overtook China as the country attracting the most inward investment after the United States, an indicator capturing 10-year cumulative flows.Overall, the institute concludes that India’s recent military experience and economic momentum have strengthened its regional standing, even as challenges persist in building defence partnerships.The Australia-based think tank study assesses a nation's ability to influence its external environment among the power states in Asia.","India has secured third rank in the asia power index, giving it the status of'major power' india has secured this ranking in the lowy institute study based on its performance in operation sindoor.

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Friday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , asking whether he would take up South Africa’s cause with his “good friend” Donald Trump This comes after the US President announced that South Africa would not be invited to next year’s G20 Summit in Miami.In a post on X, Ramesh wrote: ""President Trump has announced that South Africa will not be a part of the next G20 Summit in the USA.

He claimed the South African government was failing to address alleged human rights abuses against white communities, accusations that Pretoria has firmly rejected.Ramesh said that South Africa has been a G20 member from the very beginning because it is the continent’s largest economy by GDP, not because of any favour from the US. He stressed that the country has been a “valued presence” in every G20 Summit since the first meeting in Washington DC in 2008.The Congress leader also highlighted the deep ties between India and South Africa, through groupings such as BRICS , IBSA and BASIC and referred to India’s historic role in supporting the anti-apartheid struggle.“South Africa and India share a special relationship. They are part of the original BRICS group also involving Brazil, Russia, and China. They are also part of IBSA along with Brazil and of BASIC as well along with Brazil and China.""Ramesh also invoked historical ties between India and South Africa, highlighting the shared legacy of struggle and cooperation.“It has often been remarked that an Indian lawyer went to South Africa in the late 19th century and returned home as a revolutionary in the early years of the 20th century to lead India’s independence movement,” he further wrote, referring to Mahatma Gandhi.Another senior Congress leader, Anand Sharma, also criticised Trump’s decision, calling it a violation of the G20’s founding principles of equality among nations. He urged India to take a “firm position” and rally the Global South against “new imperialism.”""It is an insult to the African continent and the Global South. India has a moral duty to take a firm position and mobilise the Global South to collectively reject the new imperialism,"" Sharma said.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa labelled Trump’s move “regrettable”, saying it was driven by misinformation rather than diplomatic engagement.

NEW DELHI: In a development that will be closely followed across Western capitals, Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to India next week - on December 4-5 - for the 23rd India-Russia Annual Summit, the government announced Friday. Putin is expected to arrive on December 4 in the evening and head into the summit with PM Narendra Modi the next morning.Several agreements and MoUs spanning across a range of areas are expected to be signed during the visit that will help India reassert its strategic autonomy by underscoring the defence and trade partnerships with Moscow. However, the summit will also test India’s ability to navigate a delicate situation and balance competing interests as it works to ensure that the outcomes don’t act as a deal-breaker in its ties with the US and the EU.Announcing the visit, the Indian government said in a statement that it will provide an opportunity for the leadership of India and Russia to review progress in bilateral relations, set the vision for strengthening the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest.This will be Putin’s first visit to India since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Unlike the last time Putin travelled to India – in December 2021 – for the annual summit, this will be a State Visit during which President Droupadi Murmu will also host a banquet in his honour. Putin’s last visit, in the middle of a Covid wave, lasted only for a few hours. China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia are among the countries Putin has visited since the war started.While the visit allows both sides to reinforce the importance they attach to the relationship, which is defined by longstanding trust, India will be mindful of how the outcomes, especially in defence and energy, are seen in Washington and European capitals. India is looking to conclude negotiations in the next few weeks for a bilateral trade agreement with the US, which has imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on India for its oil purchase from Russia, and of immediate priority also is the EU-India summit that New Delhi will host in January.The EU summit is expected to yield several significant takeaways including an FTA and an ambitious defence and security partnership. It’s important for India to not allow the summit with Russia to indicate – not at this moment anyway - that its ties with Moscow far outweigh its relations with other important partners with whom it’s looking to boost, among other things, trade and defence industrial cooperation.In the meeting, India is likely to seek ways to address the increasing trade deficit with Russia and discuss a proposal to acquire 5 more squadrons of S-400 air defence systems. Russia said in its own announcement that the visit carries significant importance, offering an opportunity to review “the entire spectrum of the #RussiaIndia special and privileged strategic partnership – from politics, trade and the economy to science, technology, and cultural and humanitarian cooperation”.",Vladimir putin will travel to india next week for the 23rd india-russia annual summit.

NEW DELHI: India believes in peace and dialogue, but it does not “compromise” when it comes to the sovereignty and security of the nation, defence minister Rajnath Singh said here on Friday.Speaking at the Chanakya Defence Dialogue, Rajnath said, “India's economic growth, technological capabilities and principled foreign policy have made it a voice of balance and responsibility in the changing global environment, with countries across the Indo-Pacific and the Global South viewing us as a reliable partner. ”Emphasizing that a stable India contributes to a stable global economy. the minister said that through Atmanirbharta, the Centre is building a defence industrial ecosystem that encourages innovation, supports industry and reduces external dependencies. He asserted that India is shaping global discussions with a sense of responsibility, strategic autonomy, and confidence rooted in civilisational values.India has earned global trust due to path-breaking reforms, and its consistent stand for respect of the sovereignty of nations and rules-based order, he said. ""We are strengthening border and maritime infrastructure to support security and connectivity. We are modernising our forces through new platforms, technologies, and structures,"" the minister said.“We are reforming procurement processes to ensure speed, transparency, and accountability,” the minister said, adding India is investing in start-ups, “deep-tech capabilities, and research and development that will shape the battlefields of the future,"" Singh said.He emphasised that the geopolitical uncertainty and challenges such as terrorism, cross-border support to extremist elements, attempts to alter the status quo, maritime pressures, and even information warfare require constant vigilance & clarity of purpose, with reforms becoming a strategic necessity more than a choice. “Reforms strengthen the adaptability of institutions, enhance the agility of the armed forces, and give the nation the confidence to shape its own destiny,” he said, while enumerating the steps taken by the Modi govt to build a ‘Sashakt, Surakshit and Viksit Bharat’.Singh said the contribution of the armed forces goes far beyond defending the borders. “Our armed forces bring stability where it is needed most. They support civil authorities in times of disaster. They safeguard our maritime interests. They strengthen our international partnerships through joint exercises and peacekeeping. Their professionalism builds confidence — not only within India, but also among our friends around the world. That’s why reform and modernisation in the armed forces are not just administrative tasks; they are investments in India’s long-term future,” he said.The minister added that the contribution of the armed forces goes far beyond defending the borders. “Our armed forces bring stability where it is needed most.

The CDS cited ‘Operation Sindoor” as an example, demonstrating how modern weapons can target an adversary's entire natural, network, economic, and information spaces. He emphasised that these trends will continue to shape the future of warfare. Chauhan pointed out that these trends are evident in conflicts like Eastern Europe and West Asia, where borders are being redefined.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is likely to visit Jordan and Oman in mid-December amidst ongoing efforts by West Asian countries to uphold the fragile ceasefire in Gaza. While this would be Modi’s second visit to Oman, which is among the countries that India is expected to soon sign a free trade agreement with, the only time he visited Jordan earlier was in 2018 when he transited through the country on his way to Ramallah, becoming the first Indian PM to visit Palestine.Modi had last visited Oman in 2018. India and Oman have concluded negotiations for a free trade deal but a formal signing of the agreement is still awaited. If Oman authorities are able to complete all domestic formalities in the next few weeks, the agreement could become the highlight of Modi’s visit.The Gaza issue is likely to figure prominently in Modi’s engagements with both King Abdullah II of Jordan and Oman Sultan Haitham bin Tariq, who had visited India in 2023. With a large diaspora and considerable energy and connectivity interests in the region, India has been consistent in its support for efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, including the Trump peace plan, ensure release of hostages and return to dialogue and diplomacy. India also sees Trump's peace plan as in line with its long-standing support for a negotiated two-State solution.Both countries earlier this year strongly condemned the Pahalgam terrorist attack with the Jordanian king expressing condolences and seeking an end to terrorism in all its forms and manifestation in a phone call with Modi.Apart from efforts to boost trade and investment, talks in Amman could also focus on IMEC with Jordan looking to act as a key transit country for the Corridor. According to the Indian government, trade and investment cooperation between the two sides has broadened, with India emerging as the 4th largest trading partner of Jordan in 2023-24 with bilateral trade worth $ 2.8 billion.In the case of Oman, according to the Indian foreign ministry, it is also India’s closest defence partner in the Gulf region and defence cooperation has emerged as a key pillar of the strategic partnership between India and Oman.

They are expected to resume flying by next Monday or Tuesday. Globally about 6,000 aircraft are likely to be impacted.The upgrade is in wake of an American low cost carrier JetBlue’s A320 operating from Cancun to Newark on Oct 30, 2025, “unexpectedly pitch(ing) downward without pilot input.” The uncontrolled descent “likely occurred during an ELAC (flight control computer) switch change,” according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

For the new A320 family planes, the work requires about half an hour on each plane through “loading facility.” On older A320s, some hardware upgrade will also be required and hence the overall work will take longer.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has issued an emergency airworthiness directive (EAD) for Airbus A320 family of planes which “may unfortunately cause disruption to flight schedules and inconvenience to passengers. As is always the case in aviation, safety is paramount.”In India, almost all IndiGo A320 family planes are the new variants. The older A320s are in single digits. So IndiGo, which has over 350 A320 family planes in its fleet, upgrade on the required 250 aircraft should be over by Monday or Tuesday, said sources. Air India, which has about 120-125 A320 family planes, should also have the same situation, with over 100 impacted.Air India said on X early Saturday morning: “We are aware of a directive from Airbus related to its A320 family aircraft currently in-service across airline operators. This will result in a software/hardware realignment on a part of our fleet, leading to longer turnaround time and delays to our scheduled operations. Air India regrets any inconvenience this may cause to passengers till the reset is carried out across the fleet. ”Airbus said in a statement: “Analysis of a recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls. Airbus has consequently identified a significant number of A320 family aircraft currently in-service which may be impacted. Airbus has worked proactively with the aviation authorities to request immediate precautionary action from operators via an alert operators transmission (AOT) in order to implement the available software and/or hardware protection, and ensure the fleet is safe to fly. This AOT will be reflected in an emergency airworthiness directive from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).”Airbus “acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers” and apologised “for the inconvenience caused”. The European airspace major said it “will work closely with operators, while keeping safety as our number one and overriding priority.”In its emergency airworthiness directive regarding the issue, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) gave the reason for the same: “An Airbus A320 aeroplane recently experienced an uncommanded and limited pitch down event. The autopilot remained engaged throughout the event, with a brief and limited loss of altitude, and the rest of the flight was uneventful. Preliminary technical assessment done by Airbus identified a malfunction of the affected ELAC as possible contributing factor. This condition, if not corrected, could lead in the worst-case scenario to an uncommanded elevator movement that may result in exceeding the aircraft’s structural capability. To address this potential unsafe condition, Airbus issued the alert operators transmission, providing instructions to install a serviceable ELAC.”","In india, over 350 a320 family planes of indigo and air india group will be grounded. Globally about 6,000 aircraft are likely to be impacted. The upgrade is in wake of an american low cost carrier jetblue’s a320 operating from cancun to newark on oct 30, 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125649376,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-503489,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
