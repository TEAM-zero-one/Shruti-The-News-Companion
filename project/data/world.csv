Gold Card versus EB-5



EB-5's rising momentum



MUMBAI: With a waiting queue running into several decades for an employment-linked Green Card, a growing number of Indians continue to resort to a faster way to live permanently in the US.The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it-despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card. The EB-5 program also finds favour among high networth individuals (HNIs) in India, who are looking at securing their children's future in America. Investors initially obtain a conditional Green Card, which is later converted into a permanent Green Card. (See table).Applicants are required to invest $800,000 (about Rs 7.1 crore) or $1,050,000 (about Rs 9.3 crore), depending on the project's type and/or location, and must create or preserve at least 10 full-time American jobs. Most investors route their funds through regional centers (USCIS-designated entities) that pool EB-5 capital into large-scale projects. Over 90% of EB-5 investments in recent years have been made through these centers rather than via direct investments.Soon after being sworn in as US president, Donald Trump announced he would launch a 'Gold Card'; commerce secretary Howard Lutnick added this could replace the EB-5 program with Gold-Card funds going directly to the US govt. This led to jitters among the EB-5 investors and those aspiring for a Green Card under this investment-linked route.On Sept 19, Trump signed an executive order to introduce the 'Gold Card' visa program. Individuals wishing to qualify for Gold Card must make an unrestricted gift of $1 million (about Rs 8.4 crore) to US Department of Commerce. If a corporation or similar entity makes the gift on behalf of the individual, the required amount rises to $2 million (about Rs 16.8 crore).The modalities of the Gold Card are yet to be rolled out. A key difference between the two programs lies not just in the amounts to be paid, but the fact that the Gold Card entails a 'fee', whereas the EB-5 program requires an 'investment'-with a return on capital.As things stand, the long-term future of the EB-5 program remains unclear. Immigration attorneys point out that the EB-5 Regional Center (RC) Program has been reauthorised until 2027 by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) of 2022. Those who have invested, or plan to invest, before Sept 2026 will be protected from future lapses in the program owing to the RIA's grandfathering clause. The clause seems to have eased initial jitters among aspiring investors. Many of India's high networth families are turning to this path to secure long-term US residency for their kids. Mid-career professionals already in the US on H-1B visas -where Green Card backlogs stretch to decades-are increasingly joining them.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, the EB-5 program drew $4.1 billion in the first three quarters of FY2025- nearly matching investment for the entire previous year.Since the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) came into effect in 2022, around 1,050- 1,150 Indians have filed EB-5 applications, according to USCIS filing data. This places India as the second-largest EB-5 applicant group globally, accounting for roughly 20- 22% of all new post-RIA filings. The demand has remained consistent month-to-month, driven by both H-1B families already in the US facing decades-long Green Card wait times and by high networth families in India planning long-term residency and education pathways for their children.""Most people still believe that once their child gets into a decent US university, they can build a career there,"" said Piyush Gupta, vice-president of CanAm Enterprises, which operates several licensed regional centers. However, uncertainties arising out of ever-changing and tightening H-1B policies prompts many to explore EB-5, he added.For Prahlad Purohit, a 43-year-old Google engineer from Mumbai, the decision was driven by family rather than finance. After nearly a decade in the US, he feared his two India-born children would lose their dependent status when they turned 21. ""My son couldn't even apply for internships because he wasn't a resident,"" Purohit said over a call from San Francisco. ""Both my children grew up here, they don't know the system in India. That's when I chose EB-5.""Speaking to TOI on a Zoom from Mountview, California, he recalls how he selected his investment. ""It's like the Wild West, with many claiming they're the best and promising exorbitant returns on top of the Green Card-from almond farms to hotel chains,"" he said. ""I finally chose a real estate development in Manhattan that was building a corporate skyscraper.""Despite the high approval rate for applications, the EB-5 route remains a high-stakes bet: a blend of financial investment, immigration strategy, and faith in the American market. As Gupta put it, ""For many of our clients, this isn't about returns-it's about certainty. They'd rather invest in a project than a house, if it means their family never has to rely on H-1B visa lottery again.""","Investment-linked green card program (eb-5) comes in handy for those h-1bs who can afford it.

More coverage on the NBA -

Dwyane Wade and his wife, popular Hollywood actress Gabrielle Union , try to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy their luxurious and comfortable life with their daughter, Kaavia Wade, and the NBA legend’s other children. But Gabrielle Union has also never been afraid of sharing her strong opinions.While Gabrielle Union has managed to establish herself as one of the most talented and hard working actresses in Hollywood, she has never been shy to admit the racism she has faced in the industry. In 2021, Gabrielle Union wrote a book, ""Supreme Actresses: Iconic Black Women Who Revolutionized Hollywood,"" where she opened up about Hollywood.According to Good Morning America, the “Being Mary Jane” actress wrote, “Historically, for all the triumphs of women of color in Hollywood, there are as many setbacks. There are moments when there is enough work for each of us, and moments when it feels like there is none…”Gabrielle Union added, “When I first came on the scene, there were all these white teen shows and Black teen shows…then there was a drought until Halle Berry won the Oscar for ""Monster’s Ball.""However, that did not help Gabrielle Union that much. The popular actress continued, “That created more work, but not as many starring roles for anyone who wasn’t Halle. I go from starring in ""Bad Boys II,"" which opens at $55 million—“Oh my God, you’re the It girl”—to my next role as the fifth or sixth lead on ""City of Angels,"" a CBS medical procedural…”However, despite the things that Gabrielle Union has faced in her career, she has never let it get in her way and has always proved her worth.After having worked in a number of successful films in a career spanning over two decades, Gabrielle Union has built a huge fan base and is regarded as one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in the industry.Gabrielle Union has continued to work on new projects even after the popular actress went through one of the most harrowing experiences of her life when Dwyane Wade was diagnosed with cancer, a few years ago.Fortunately, Dwyane Wade completely recovered and the two have gone back to living their quiet lives.","Dwyane wade's wife, gabrielle union, opened up about facing racism in hollywood.

Erika Kirk broke her silence amid several controversies surrounding her after her emotional hug with Vice President JD Vance at the recent Turning Point USA event went viral. At the event, Eika also said that there were many similarities between her late husband and JD Vance. In an interview with Fox News, which is yet to be aired, Erika spoke how her every movement, every smile has been captured by the camera but there will be restrictions on the media coverage of the court proceedings of Tyler Robinson, the accused in Charlie Kirk's murder.“There were cameras all over my husband when he was murdered,” Kirk told Fox News’ Jesse Watters in a clip posted on X.“There have been cameras all over my friends and family, mourning.

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold



Also Read |





For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The asian arowana (scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

Is Nancy Pelosi quitting politics? Democrats brace as 85-year-old former House Speaker prepares to exit stage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-nancy-pelosi-quitting-politics-democrats-brace-as-85-year-old-former-house-speaker-prepares-to-exit-stage/articleshow/125066647.cms,"'Shut Up': Nancy Pelosi's On-Cam Meltdown Goes Viral After Reporter Presses Her On Capitol Riots

'I wish she would stay'



Who is running for her seat?



Pelosi stays focused on Prop 50



End of an era







Democrats are quietly preparing for the possible retirement of Nancy Pelosi, the long-time face of the party in Congress and one of the most formidable political figures in modern American history.At 85, the Speaker Emerita is expected to announce her future plans after Tuesday’s elections, which will include a key ballot measure, Proposition 50, that could reshape California’s congressional map.Pelosi has represented San Francisco for almost four decades and has yet to say if she will run again in 2026. Still, talk is growing among Democrats in Washington and back home in California that she might finally call it a day.Multiple party insiders told NBC News they believe Pelosi will not seek another term. “I wish she would stay for 10 more years,” said one California Democrat. “I think she’s out. She’s going to go out with Prop 50 overwhelmingly passing, and what a crowning achievement for her to do that.”If confirmed, Pelosi’s departure would close a chapter in American politics marked by her skill in managing legislative deals, uniting Democrats, and raising record funds.The first woman to ever hold the speaker’s gavel, she became both a trailblazer and the Republican Party’s favourite target, particularly during Donald Trump’s presidency.“She’s preparing to exit the stage,” a Democratic leadership aide told NBC. “We will not fully appreciate the time we have spent with her until she’s gone.”Despite having more than $1.5 million in her campaign account and raising over $2 million this cycle, Pelosi has made no move to deter two Democrats already running for her seat: state Senator Scott Wiener and former tech executive Saikat Chakrabarti, a onetime chief of staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Pelosi’s spokesman, Ian Krager, dismissed talk of retirement as “pure speculation,” insisting her focus remains on Tuesday’s “Yes on 50” campaign. The measure is strongly backed by governor Gavin Newsom and Democrats, and aims to redraw congressional districts in their favour.“Proposition 50” (Prop 50) refers to a California ballot measure that would redraw the state’s congressional districts to give Democrats an advantage in upcoming elections.“Speaker Pelosi is fully focused on her mission to win the Yes on 50 special election in California on Tuesday,” Krager said. “She urges all Californians to join in that mission on the path to taking back the House for Democrats.”In a recent interview with the San Francisco Examiner, Pelosi herself hinted that no decision would come until after the vote. “Here’s the thing: We must win the House. If you talk about ‘no kings,’ we must win the House to put a stop to this. We won’t be able to get many things done, but we’ll be able to stop a lot of the poison that he’s putting there,” she said, referring to Donald Trump.“There’s a lot riding on this because this is the path to our winning the House,” she added. “We will win the House regardless, but winning it big, and we want to win Nov. 4 big.”Pelosi’s leadership has been defined by toughness and strategic brilliance. Known for saying she “eats nails for breakfast,” she mastered both negotiation and persuasion.Ro Khanna, another California Democrat, called her “a stateswoman who, as they say about Lincoln, belongs to the ages. Generations to come will be reading about her contributions to America.”Ashley Etienne, who worked for both Pelosi and former vice president Kamala Harris, praised her as “a pragmatist who hammered out deals in the interest of the nation.”“Pelosi’s loss is bigger than even to the Democratic Party; it’s a loss to the institution,” Etienne said. “She’s not just redefined the speakership, but she’s also demonstrated what real sound, principled leadership looks like, man or woman, but definitely as a woman. Pelosi is a beast. She’s the best to ever do it.”If Pelosi steps down, the race for her San Francisco seat could become one of the most-watched in the country.","At 85, the speaker emerita is expected to announce her future plans after tuesday’s elections, which will include a key ballot measure, proposition 50.

A fall from grace



8 Hours in Hell: A Shocking Firsthand Experience of What Really Awaits in the Afterlife.

In his book Eight Hours in Hell: A Journey Through Death and Back, Steve Kang recounts his terrifying descent and miraculous return.

“I was in hell”



Redemption and faith



Belief, doubt, and the unexplained







Ever since the first flicker of human consciousness, one question has haunted civilisation: what happens after we die? From ancient myths to modern neuroscience, humanity has been trying to decipher the mystery of what lies beyond. With scientific advancement came desperate attempts to map the unseeable: studies measuring brain activity moments after death, experiments tracking flickers of consciousness as the body shuts down, and near-death research probing the line between the physical and the spiritual. Yet despite decades of effort, science has barely begun to scratch the surface.And then came a case that defies reason.For Steve Kang, the story began not with faith, but with despair, and what followed has baffled even those who study the limits of human awareness. Raised as a practising Buddhist with no exposure to Christianity or the Bible’s depictions of heaven and hell, Kang says that when he attempted to take his own life in 1998, he found himself in a place that mirrored the Biblical description of hell, a world of darkness and torment that he could not have imagined.His account, unsettling and eerily consistent with Christian theology despite his unfamiliarity with it, would later mark a profound turning point in his life.What began as a near-fatal act of hopelessness led him to reevaluate his beliefs and eventually embrace Christianity, a transformation that continues to intrigue psychologists, theologians, and scientists alike, as they grapple with what consciousness might truly encounter after death.1998 had been a devastating year for Steve Kang. His father, once a successful businessman in South Korea, lost everything in the country’s financial collapse. At just 19, while studying at the University of California, Irvine, Kang suddenly found himself on his own, scrambling to find work, a scholarship, and somewhere to live.Up until then, he had been a diligent student and a devout Buddhist. But hardship drove him into darker places. “During that entire summer,” he told The Daily Mail, “I do not remember being sober for more than an hour here and there. We partied and got into trouble.”By the time the fall semester began, he was too addicted and disoriented to attend classes. Then, at a college party, Kang made a mistake that would change his life forever. He smoked what he thought was marijuana, but the bong contained a lethal mix of heroin, cocaine, and PCP, a combination known as a “death bowl.”“Something in there messed with my brain,” he recalled. “I stayed awake for ten straight days. I didn’t get a second of sleep after that.”Ten days without sleepBy the fifth day, his sense of reality began to crumble. “I didn’t know what time of the day it was,” he wrote in his book“By the sixth and seventh day, when I looked in the mirror I saw that my pupils were so big and black, the white parts of my eyes were hardly visible.”He phoned Buddhist monks back in Korea, his mentors, seeking help. Their reply cut deep: “We are in the middle of a silent prayer. We cannot help you.”“It was a very dark time,” he said. “My birthday fell during those ten days, and friends would be like, ‘Steve, happy birthday,’ and I couldn’t reply. I still attended classes, but when teachers and my friends were talking to me, I could not process even a sentence of what they were saying.”He described feeling haunted, cups falling, metallic noises echoing from a temple poster, convinced he was under a spiritual attack.Then, on the eighth day, a vision appeared. An elderly Asian man with a long white beard, what Kang believed to be a Buddhist spirit, told him that if he “sacrificed his body,” he would receive “50,000 fewer years in hell.”“It sounded like a good deal at the time,” Kang said.He wrote his mother a letter of apology. Two days later, he stabbed himself repeatedly in the stomach and neck with a kitchen knife. His terrified mother found him in a pool of blood and immediately called 911.As surgeons fought to keep him alive, Kang felt himself falling, not rising, as if pulled down an endless, echoing shaft. “I knew I was dying,” he said. “It was like a roller coaster, an elevator, just falling. The fear and the anxiety kept building. After what felt like five minutes, I landed and looked around. I was in hell.”The Asian grandfather he thought would guide him toward nirvana was nowhere to be found. Instead, Kang sensed a dark, overpowering presence, and in that moment, he realised the truth. The figure who had once urged him to take his life was not a guide at all, but Satan himself. “I felt betrayal right away. I felt so lonely,” he said.As doctors worked to restart his heart, Kang said he was fighting for his soul, trapped in a place of unbearable darkness that he had never imagined could exist.The world he described was one of bleak desolation, a cracked, barren wasteland. “For some reason, I could still see,” he said. “People ask me, ‘How can you see if there's no sunlight?’ But you can still supernaturally see. There's sand pebbles everywhere. There's no grass, there's no flowers, there's no plants, there's no food, there's not even a drop of water.”“To the left, I saw purplish-red cliffs. There were people on top of the cliff, on the bottom of the cliff. When I looked up, evil spirits were there, not small, like in cartoons. These things were really tall, as tall as buildings, wearing capes. And I knew they were in charge of this place.”He said the agony was worse than anything imaginable. “It’s not a place you want to go,” Kang said. “I almost feel like I don’t even want Kim Jong-il or Hitler to go there. I don’t want my worst enemies to go there.”“You're just in this agony, and there's no ability to converse with people. It was so much pain, so much accusation, so much fear. It was like anxiety multiplied, fear of condemnation multiplied.”For eight hours, surgeons worked on him, repairing torn arteries and blood vessels. Doctors told his mother to prepare for the worst. But she refused.“She prayed to every god she could think of, Allah, Buddha, Muhammad, Confucius, Taoist gods, Shinto gods,” he recalled. “Then she remembered her friend in California, Mrs Kim, was a Christian. And she called her.”“No more Buddhism, no more drugs… I love you”Kang says it was those prayers that pulled him back. “I heard a voice in my heart,” he wrote. “A voice I have never heard before. He said, ‘No more Buddhism, no more drugs… I love you.’”He believes that voice was Jesus.“The doctor said it was a miracle that I awakened,” he said. “There were staples holding my skin together around my stomach and neck, and tubes going in and out everywhere.”The recovery took a decade. Kang suffered constant panic attacks and insomnia, relying on 20 medications, including Xanax, Lithium Carbonate, and antidepressants, just to function. “For ten years, I never slept one night normally. I had visions of demons laughing at me.”Then, around Christmas 2012, he said he experienced what he called a “heavenly visitation.”“I was standing on the top of a hill, and before my very eyes, the mountains, fields, and valleys stretched out,” he said. “A heavenly, bright light shone in all directions. I clearly heard the voice of the Father God with my own ears. I even heard the heavenly choir of angels worshiping God… no human choir could sing that beautifully.”He threw away his pills and, for the first time in years, slept peacefully. He later joined the US Army as a chaplain and met his wife, Goeun Kim.Now 47, he lives in California as an evangelical pastor, his body still marked with scars, his faith forged from trauma. “God saved me from hell,” he said, “to help prevent other people from attempting suicide.”Sceptics have suggested that Kang’s experience was merely a hallucination brought on by trauma and drugs. Kang disagrees.“That can be a common objection,” he said. “I love objections. I love having a good dialogue. They use the same argument for the resurrection of Jesus Christ, they say the disciples hallucinated because they wanted to see him so much. For me, evidence is everything.”He referenced research by megachurch pastor John Burke, who interviewed nearly 1,000 people claiming near-death experiences. “Same exact story,” Kang said. “Same turnaround of life. So, I respect everyone’s beliefs and the scepticism, but what they saw is what I saw, and it’s what is in the Bible.”As a man raised outside Christianity, Kang finds that fact hard to ignore. “I had no idea how the Bible described hell,” he reflected. “So, it can’t be a hallucination.”His story, one that straddles faith, psychology, and the mysteries of human consciousness, raises the same question that science still cannot answer: what really happens when we die?","After his 1998 suicide attempt, steve kang claimed he descended into a place identical to the biblical hell, despite never reading the bible. In his book eight hours in hell: a journey through death and back, kang recounts his terrifying descent and miraculous return.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125059230,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1061166,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Kash Patel’s Jet Scandal Erupts; $60M FBI Plane For Girlfriend’s Show? FBI Chief Slams Critics

Patel uses $60 million jet to fly to his girlfriend's event, fires senior FBI official



'Patel flew from Mar-A-Lago to Nashville'







FBI director Kash Patel is MAGA's target this week as MAGA commentators did not like Patel's statement shielding his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins from troll attacks. Patel said he, in his public role, is open to criticism, but his girlfriend is not. Calling her a true patriot, Patel sent a strong message to people who are attacking her, suggesting that they are supposed allies. Right-wing commentator Candace Owens disapproved of Kash Patel's defence of his girlfriend only because Alexis Wilkins is not Patel's wife. ""I don’t care about Alexis one way or another but I want to point out that the head of the FBI is tweeting out in defense of his girlfriend. Not a wife— but a girlfriend. We are just not a serious nation whatsoever,"" Candace said.Some social media posts claimed that Kash Patel's girlfriend said that additional sleeper cells are preparing to launch attacks across the United States. This led to fresh speculations that Wilkins is a spy -- a narrative that never died and continued to find fans. ""I have long been a political commentator in my own right. It is clear that through Biden’s open border policies, we have had an influx of terrorists funneled into our country, which results in grave danger for American citizens,"" Wilkins said, defending her apparent statement.Amid a row over Alexis' statement, Patel flew to Pennsylvania to attend a pro-wrestling event where Alexis performed. This was pointed out by ex-FBI agent Kyle Seraphin who hammered home the discrepancy between Patel's extravagance and government officials not getting their salaries because of the ongoing shutdown. FBI pushed back and issued a statement that whenever Patel uses government jets for personal use, he make advance reimbursement.But FBI also fired a senior official, Steven Palmer , who was in charge of FBI's aviation units.Kyle Seraphin, who had already been sued by Alexis Wilkins for claiming that she is a spy, claimed that Patel blocked public tracking of his government-owned jet and again traveled from Mar-A-Lago to Nashville. ""Kash blocked access to OUR taxpayer funded FBI jet (so I paid extra to keep tracking it). Last night, he flew down to Mar-A-Lago (allegedly to be yelled at). And then, after firing Stephen Palmer, flew direct to Nashville,"" Seraphin posted.","Maga targets kash patel as he speaks up for his girlfriend alexis wilkins.

Random Musing: Why Zohran Mamdani will find it hard to be another Barack Obama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/random-musing-why-zohran-mamdani-will-find-it-hard-to-be-another-barack-obama/articleshow/125060895.cms,"New York Is Not America





Nepo Baby vs Outsider





The Identity-Box Gamble vs a Real Constituency

Obama Was a Moderate; Mamdani Is Not





The Kamala Harris Cautionary Tale





Islam, Socialism and the American Ceiling





The Israel Factor: New York Exceptionalism





A Movement Candidate, Not a Messiah









Since Barack Obama became the first Black president of the United States — and the patron saint of slightly deracinated global liberals who feel increasingly alienated as global politics lurches right — liberals have been waiting for the next Obama: the Aragorn who will again lead the righteous army and rid America of the evil forces of Sauron.The latest to have that mantle thrust on him is Zohran Mamdani — a reel champion who has borrowed from the Trump playbook, turning authenticity into theatre and populism into performance. As political analyst Ross Barkan noted in a recent profile: “He is, like a young Obama, very compelling, has a great back story. He has a real charm, a way with people. He has great social media, but you need the charm to make the social media work.”Ironically, Mamdani even wrote that he was Black and Asian in his SAT application where he scored 2140 — below the median for Columbia — before going on to study Africana Studies at Bowdoin College. That one slightly clumsy sentence is a neat metaphor for why Mamdani cannot be another Obama. Obama made the system bend to his will. Mamdani, on the other hand, is trying to game a system that still resists seeing someone like him as fully American.The Obama analogy flatters everyone — liberals nostalgic for 2008, Mamdani himself, and commentators desperate for a “narrative.” But it is also wrong, for reasons that have less to do with Mamdani’s talent and more to do with where he is, who he is, and the country he is trying to win.Obama came out of Chicago but ran as the candidate of the United States. His coalition stretched from Black voters in Detroit to white retirees in Florida. His Yes We Can message resonated across demography and geography.Mamdani, by contrast, is the frontrunner to run a very specific city — post-pandemic, Trump-era New York. His campaign is built on an affordability crisis that is genuinely apocalyptic here: freeze the rent on nearly a million rent-stabilised apartments, make buses free, promise universal childcare funded by higher taxes on the rich.That programme speaks directly to tenants in Queens, overworked parents in Brooklyn and young professionals wondering why they need three roommates and a side hustle just to afford groceries. It does not automatically speak to a homeowner in Arizona whose mortgage is fixed and whose main worry is crime and gas prices.New York’s electorate is younger, more immigrant, more secular and far more accustomed to left-of-centre rhetoric than the rest of America, which just rehired Donald Trump and JD Vance after a campaign powered by a visible rightward shift.Obama’s genius was to make Chicago feel like a metaphor for America. Mamdani’s politics are aggressively, proudly local. That works brilliantly for Gracie Mansion. It is not a dry run for the White House.Read: Why some liberals think Mamdani is the new Obama For all his outsider rhetoric, Zohran Mamdani is not the self-made underdog that Barack Obama was. Obama’s rise from a single mother’s son in Hawaii to the first Black president was powered by intellect, discipline and rhetorical grace. Mamdani, by contrast, was born into Manhattan’s liberal intelligentsia: the son of Oscar-nominated filmmaker Mira Nair and scholar Mahmood Mamdani. He grew up surrounded by art, activism and academia — the politics of someone who can afford to play with fire without being burned by it. Obama adapted to the establishment before being adopted by it; Mamdani was born into it.Mamdani’s Columbia application, where he ticked both “Asian” and “Black,” has become a symbol of how different his relationship to race is from Obama’s. Critics spun this as a teenager’s attempt to find the least-hostile category in a hostile system. Strip away the outrage and you’re left with something more telling.Obama was Black in the way America understands Blackness — a Black man in a Black church on the South Side of Chicago, married to a Black woman, rooted in a historically oppressed constituency. That did not make his life easy, but it made his claim to represent Black America undeniable and authentic.Mamdani, born in Uganda to Indian parents and raised in New York, is something else: East African, South Asian, Muslim, cosmopolitan. His attempt, at 17, to tick every box that might approximate that messiness has now been retrofitted into a morality play about elite hypocrisy. Obama’s identity anchored him to a massive, motivated voting bloc. Mamdani’s identity is an essay question that can be — and is being — pulled apart on cable news.Obama ran on “hope and change,” but his agenda was packaged as pragmatic and centrist. He annoyed the left almost as much as the right.Mamdani is not selling technocracy. He is an open democratic socialist who talks about rent freezes, public housing, free buses and taxing the rich, rooted in years of movement work around foreclosure, taxi debt and Palestine activism. He went from campus protests to a 45-day taxi strike.This is not “Obama 2008 but browner.” It’s Bernie with a Spotify playlist.Since Obama’s victory, the centre of American politics has shifted right. Trump’s 2024 win over Kamala Harris was powered by gains among Latino, Asian and even some Black voters. Obama surfed a liberalising wave. Mamdani is trying to swim against a conservative tide — a very different current.If you want proof that America is not in the mood to manufacture another Obama, look at Kamala Harris.On paper, she was the sequel: Black and South Asian, prosecutor turned progressive, the first woman and first Asian-American vice president, then the Democratic nominee against Trump in 2024. She had Obama’s blessing, Biden’s incumbency and the full strength of the Democratic armada. She still lost, as Trump improved his margins across demographics and sliced into Democratic strongholds.Harris’s identity and moderate progressivism were not enough to withstand a right-leaning electorate furious about inflation, immigration and culture wars. If a former vice president with the full weight of the party behind her cannot replay the Obama script, the idea that a Muslim socialist mayor from Queens will do so in a harsher climate starts to look like fan fiction.Obama’s middle name was Hussein, and the right still tried to turn him into a secret Muslim. His project was to reassure white America that he was safe, respectable and Christian. Even then, the birther conspiracy lasted years.Mamdani does not have that luxury. He is openly Muslim, prays, and refuses to sandpaper that identity down. He is also explicitly socialist. In an America shaped by 9/11, Gaza and Trump, that is a double burden in national politics.In New York, a critical mass of voters hears “Muslim socialist” and thinks: finally, someone speaking to tenants and immigrants. In most of America, it still sounds like the villain in a Homeland reboot.Obama faced racism and hysteria but had the armour of moderation and churchgoing normalcy. Mamdani walks into the same minefield wearing a DSA badge and a keffiyeh.Then there is Israel-Palestine, the issue that has turned Mamdani into a folk hero on the left and a bogeyman for much of organised Jewish America.His record as an anti-Zionist activist is not a footnote. He has defended the phrase “globalise the intifada,” accused Israel of genocide and apartheid, and once said the NYPD boot “has been laced by the IDF.”In New York, this hasn’t destroyed him. Some Orthodox and progressive Jews still support him because they like his housing agenda or stance on policing. The city’s unique mix of anti-Netanyahu liberals and transactional machines gives him enough space to be radioactive on Israel and still viable.That is not the country. In a presidential race, his Israel record would be on loop in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia. A line that energises Brooklyn leftists becomes electoral napalm in suburban synagogues.Obama calibrated his Israel criticism carefully enough to drive Netanyahu mad while keeping AIPAC on side. Mamdani is the opposite: morally consistent from the left, politically lethal outside deep-blue enclaves.None of this is to deny Mamdani’s skill. He has borrowed from the Trump playbook and inverted it: constant social media, viral stunts like diving into the Atlantic in winter to dramatise “freeze the rent,” campaign rallies that feel like concerts, and an army of first-time volunteers who talk about him the way 2008 kids talked about Obama.He’s fused old-school organising with meme-literate aesthetics. In New York, that looks like the future of politics.But he is an organiser who legislates, not a national messiah. His project is to prove that a Muslim socialist can run the capital of capitalism and have the sky remain intact. That’s radical enough; demanding that he also be the next Obama is unfair to him and unserious about America.Obama was a once-in-a-generation convergence of biography, temperament, timing and a country briefly willing to believe in its better angels. Mamdani is the product of a harsher, more polarised era.That is important work. It just isn’t the same story. Zohran Mamdani can be many things — New York’s first Muslim mayor, a proof-of-concept for left urban governance, even a future senator. But he cannot be another Obama, because there are no more Obamas to be had. The age of liberal messiahs is over; the age of contested mayors with messy SAT forms and even messier coalitions has begun.Barack Obama was, like Bill Clinton before him, a spanner in the works, upsetting the applecart. He rose up to his level through grit, gumption, and intellect, not to mention remarkable oratory skills. He has the kind of voice that would make Morgan Freeman jealous, a promise of assurance even in the deadliest of storms. And yet, he became the reason that the Democratic party finds himself at the crossroads. But his rise inevitably created Trump’s. And at this moment, assuming ceteris paribus, which is always a faulty thing to assume, it seems quite unlikely that Zohran Mamdani is messiah the Democrats need or deserve right now.","Zohran mamdani is the frontrunner to run a post-pandemic, trump-era new york. His campaign is built on an affordability crisis that is genuinely apocalyptic here. Obama’s genius was to make chicago feel like a metaphor for america. Mamdani was born in uganda to indian parents and raised in new york.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125061003,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-65016,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

What is the Hindu-Christian row?



'She Has No Plans To Convert': JD Vance Clarifies Amid Row Over Remark On Wife's Faith

Dinesh D'Souza stirs controversy with his story of conversion







The Hindu-Christian row triggered by Vice President JD Vance refuses to die down as commentators unravel several aspects of what he said about his religion and his wife's religion, and then what he said in defence. Indian-origin Christian MAGA activist Dinesh D'Souza who supported JD Vance in his hope that Usha Vance one day embraces Christianity said Hindus should have no problem if Usha Vance converts to Christianity if Hinduism is truly inclusive.At a Turning Point USA event, JD Vance said he hopes to see his wife embrace his faith. “As I’ve told her, and as I’ve said publicly, and as I’ll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends: do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing I was moved by in church? Yes. I honestly do wish that, because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope that eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,"" JD Vance said.""But if she doesn’t, God says that everybody has free will, so that doesn’t cause a problem with me. That’s something that you work out with your friends, your family, the person you most love,"" JD Vance said.Two major criticisms followed: one, as he called his Hindu wife an agnostic and two, overall for undermining his wife's Hindu faith.JD Vance defended what he said and explained that Christians do want to share their faith with others and it is a completely normal thing. ""My Christian faith tells me the Gospel is true and is good for human beings. My wife--as I said at the TPUSA--is the most amazing blessing I have in my life. She herself encouraged me to re-engage with my faith many years ago. She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many people in an interfaith marriage--or any interfaith relationship--I hope she may one day see things as I do. Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she's my wife,"" JD Vance said, repeating that he would love it if Usha Vance converts to Christianity.Mumbai-born MAGA activist Dinesh D'Souza, in his attempt to support JD Vance, created another controversy as he spoke about the conversion of his ancestors to Christianity. He said they must have been so oppressed because of being low cast that they chose to convert to Christianity. However, this account was proved to be false as he himself wrote in his book that his grandfather told him they were Brahmins.","Vice president jd vance said he hopes to see his wife embrace his faith.

'I've Been Stabbed': Man With Large Knife Goes On Rampage Inside London-bound Train





A 32-year-old man from Peterborough has been charged after a mass stabbing on a high-speed train in Cambridgeshire, eastern England which left 11 people injured.Anthony Williams faces 11 counts of attempted murder, one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two counts of possession of a bladed article, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said, as reported by the Guardian. Two victims remain in life-threatening condition following the attack.The attack occurred on Saturday evening, aboard the 7.04 pm London North Eastern Railway (LNER) service from Doncaster to London King’s Cross.The train made an emergency stop at Huntingdon station after reports of multiple stabbings. Armed officers from the British Transport Police (BTP) and Cambridgeshire Police arrived within minutes and arrested two men.One of them, a 35-year-old from London, was later released without charge.Supt John Loveless of the BTP briefed reporters about the incident.“At approximately 7.42pm yesterday evening, there were calls to the police service in relation to multiple stabbings which took place onboard a train service. Officers immediately attended Huntington station alongside paramedics, where armed police officers from Cambridgeshire police boarded the train and arrested two people within eight minutes of the 999 call being made.”Authorities confirmed that the attack is not being treated as terrorism, but investigations are ongoing. Eleven victims were taken to hospital, with four later discharged. Police said two remain in critical condition.Tracy Easton, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Direct, said prosecutors had worked overnight to file the charges.“We know the devastating impact the events on Saturday’s train has had and how the incident shocked the entire country. Our thoughts remain with all those affected,” she said.The attack prompted an increased police presence across the national rail network, with disruptions continuing between King’s Cross and Peterborough through Monday.Messages of sympathy and support poured in following the tragedy. In a statement from Buckingham Palace, King Charles expressed his shock and condolences.“My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place onboard a train in Cambridgeshire last night.Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones. We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident,” he said.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood also commended the emergency response and the courage of passengers.“My deepest thanks go to the British Transport Police, Cambridgeshire Police, Fire and Rescue Service, and the East of England Ambulance Service. They responded rapidly, with the utmost professionalism, and saved lives,” she said.","Anthony williams faces 11 counts of attempted murder, one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two counts of possession of a bladed article.

Walked Out Of Burning Jet, Now Stranded In UK: AI171 Crash Survivor Vishwaskumar Ramesh Speaks Out





LEICESTER: Four-and-a-half months after the June 12 crash of Air India flight AI 171 from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick, the only survivor, 39-year-old Viswashkumar Ramesh, remains physically injured, financially strained and deeply traumatised.Viswashkumar, who was in seat 11A next to the emergency exit, walked away from the burning wreckage that killed 241 of the 242 people on board (230 passengers and 12 crew). His younger brother Ajaykumar, seated in 11J, was among the dead.

"Former Prince Andrew brought 40 prostitutes to hotel in Thailand using taxpayer money, reveals historian; 'spectacular fall from grace'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/former-prince-andrew-brought-40-prostitutes-to-hotel-in-thailand-using-taxpayer-money-reveals-historian-spectacular-fall-from-grace/articleshow/125022496.cms,"'No moral boundaries'





Furious Sandringham Residents Slam Andrew’s Move; “He’s A Horrible Man, We Don’t Want Him Here!”

Prince Charles predicted Andrew would 'chase women and play golf'





Why was Andrew stripped of his titles?





Disgraced royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor allegedly had 40 prostitutes brought to his five-star hotel over just four days during an official taxpayer-funded trip to Thailand, according to royal historian Andrew Lownie.Speaking on the Daily Mail podcast Deep Dive: The Fall of the House of York, Lownie accused Andrew of using his role as the UK’s Trade Envoy to “chase women and line his pockets”. He claimed the former prince “had no moral boundaries” and often turned official visits into private holidays.Lownie described what he called Andrew’s “spectacular fall from grace” and said British diplomats allowed the alleged incidents to happen.Andrew went to Thailand to celebrate the birthday of the King.“There was a famous trip to Thailand for the birthday celebrations of the King. Andrew is representing his country and insists on staying in a five-star hotel rather than the embassy, which he always did,” Lownie said. “Andrew had 40 prostitutes brought in the space of four days. This was all enabled by diplomats and others.”The historian told podcast host Sarah Vine that his information was verified by multiple sources, including a Reuters correspondent and a member of the Thai royal family.Lownie also claimed that then-Prince Charles had warned against giving Andrew the Trade Envoy role back in 2001, fearing he would “just chase women and play golf.” Despite the warning, Lownie said Charles was overruled by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his close ally Peter Mandelson.He described Andrew at the time as “a man in the middle of a midlife crisis.” “In 2001, Andrew is 41, he's having his midlife crisis and he basically starts chasing lots and lots of women,” said Lownie.“He uses the excuse of his role as Trade Envoy, paid for by the taxpayer, to go off on these trips. He always puts in two weeks of ‘private time’. So, we pay for his holiday and then he goes off and does things,"" Lownie added.Beyond the claims of sex-fuelled trips, Lownie said his greater concern was Andrew’s alleged misuse of his trade role for personal gain. He accused the former prince of using the position to further business interests for himself and his associate David Rowlands.Prince Andrew was first stripped of his military titles and royal patronages in January 2022 after facing a civil sexual assault lawsuit in the United States, filed by Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abusing her when she was 17 — allegations he denied. His association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had already severely tarnished his public image.Earlier this week, King Charles III went further, removing all of Andrew’s remaining royal titles and honours and evicting him from his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge. The decision followed renewed public outrage after revelations in Giuffre’s posthumous memoir about Epstein’s network and Andrew’s alleged involvement.",Andrew mountbatten-windsor allegedly had 40 prostitutes brought to his five-star hotel over just four days during an official taxpayer-funded trip to thailand.

Lester Jones allegedly used Atlanta Hawks’ funds for lavish spending spree



Audit uncovers relationship and questionable gifts



A shocking scandal has rocked the Atlanta Hawks’ front office after longtime executive Lester Jones was charged with wire fraud and embezzlement. Federal prosecutors allege that Jones, who served as the team’s senior vice president of financial planning and analysis, stole nearly $3.8 million over several years by manipulating team credit card accounts and falsifying records.The 46-year-old was indicted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia last week following a months-long investigation sparked by an internal audit.According to reports, Jones allegedly diverted team funds to finance a lavish lifestyle that included luxury trips, concert tickets, and even a Porsche. The fraudulent activity came to light after he allegedly submitted a $229,968.76 American Express bill, falsely claiming it was tied to the Hawks’ travel expenses during the NBA Cup semifinals in Las Vegas. Prosecutors say that bill — and several others — were completely fabricated.Federal investigators say Lester Jones abused his authority over the Atlanta Hawks’ corporate credit accounts to enrich himself. He reportedly issued multiple team American Express cards under his name and charged them with personal purchases, from high-end vacations to the Bahamas and Switzerland to expensive gifts.Prosecutors claim that one example of his deception involved altering an email from American Express to show the $229,968.76 charge as a payment to the Wynn Las Vegas hotel.The money, however, went toward Jones’s personal spending. “At least I know the Wynn’s number is right,” Jones allegedly wrote in an internal message after submitting the falsified documents.The Hawks have not issued a public comment on the case, and Jones’s attorney has not responded to media inquiries. The former executive has pleaded not guilty and was released on a $10,000 bond.Sources told The Athletic that Jones was romantically involved with another team employee and used some of the stolen funds to buy her expensive presents. Both individuals are no longer employed by the franchise. While it remains unclear whether the woman was aware of the embezzlement, investigators believe her relationship with Jones may have played a role in his spending patterns.Jones’s alleged actions have drawn attention beyond the NBA world, as they follow other high-profile legal troubles in professional sports. With the case now moving through federal court, the former Hawks executive faces severe penalties if convicted, marking one of the most damaging internal scandals in recent NBA history.Also Read: Cooper Flagg gets unwavering support from billionaire Mark Cuban amid Dallas Mavericks’ tough stretch","Lester jones allegedly used atlanta hawks’ funds for lavish spending spree.
