As a ""special government employee"" in the Trump administration, the Tesla and SpaceX founder can collaborate with the federal government without full-time employment or remuneration. This arrangement has raised questions about his policy influence and potential conflicts of interest.The billionaire also heads the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with reducing federal expenditure.His role in reshaping federal agencies, particularly his efforts to dismantle the US Agency for International Development (USAID), has intensified concerns about business interests influencing public administration.Critics contend that his expanding governmental influence grants him disproportionate, unregulated control over policies. His opponents contend that as an unelected wealthy individual, he exercises authority meant for public servants, influencing significant programmes with minimal oversight.The White House has verified that under his new position, Musk has received a government email address and office accommodation, although the specific scope of his duties remains undefined.""He has abided by all applicable federal laws,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, adding that she didn't know the status of Musk's security clearance or whether he had completed a background check.While special government employees must comply with financial disclosure rules, their reporting requirements are less comprehensive than full-time federal officials. Some may only need to submit confidential rather than public disclosures, reducing transparency regarding their financial interests.","The mural shows an anarchist symbol and the words ""deny, defend, depose"" musk has received widespread criticism over his role in the trump administration.

DC Plane Crash Latest News: Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high but it had complex flying conditions: New revelations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blackhawk-helicopter-was-flying-too-high-but-it-had-complex-flying-conditions-new-revelations/articleshow/117954087.cms,"An Army helicopter crashed into an American Airlines plane killing 67 people in DC last week.

Older-model Blackhawk lacked certain safety technologies



The Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport was flying about 100 feet higher than what was authorized but it was also dealing with a set of complex flying conditions, reports based on the new revelations of the investigation into the DC plane crash said. The Blackhawk crashed into an American Airlines plane killing 67 people leaving no survivor.The National Transportation Safety Board said in an update Tuesday that it obtained data clearing showing that the helicopter was flying at roughly 300 feet at the time of the collision. But what prompted the helicopter to change its altitude is not yet known.According to experts, 200 feet is a low altitude for the bust airspace, in proximity to other aircraft. The lighting conditions around the Potomac River are tough and there's not many place in the world where all these conditions are present all at once.The Army crew was flying an older-model aircraft that lacked certain safety technologies in its cockpit. The Blackhawk left its home base, Fort Belvoir in Virginia, after dark last Wednesday to conduct a training mission to allow co-pilot Captain Rebecca Lobach to perform a required annual evaluation flight.It was a moonless night at a busy airspace which might have compounded the complex situation that the helicopter found it self in, experts told the New York Times.""Captain Lobach was most likely in the right-hand seat, said a senior Army official who has flown the National Airport helicopter routes repeatedly but requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly,"" the NYT report said.""This is significant, the official said, because if the instructor pilot was busy or distracted with something, Captain Lobach’s seat on the right side of the aircraft might have put her in poor position to view the descending American Airlines flight on her left.""""Still, other experienced military pilots said they were puzzled at the crash, given that military pilots are trained to be ready for such hazards,"" the report said.",The national transportation safety board said in an update tuesday that it obtained data clearing showing that the helicopter was flying at roughly 300 feet at the time of the collision.

Joe Rogan has now claimed that Kamala Harris' campaign is lying about what happened over the former vice president's supposed appearance on his show. Rogan's statement came as a new book to be published on April 1 claimed that Kamala Harris made all attempts to be on Joe Rogan's show and even planned a Houston rally while there was no need for it -- as Texas is not even a battleground state -- but finally it could not take place as Donald Trump was scheduled to sit down with Rogan on the same day -- October 25.Fight: Inside the wildest battle for the White House, written by Jonathan Allen of NBC News and Amie Parnes of The Hills apparently put the blame on Joe Rogan for the miscommunication.Kamala Harris apparently canceling on youth's favorite Joe Rogan was blamed for losing out on young votes where Trump believed to have scored a huge win. A lot of analyses went on dissecting why Kamala Harris did not appear on Joe Rogan's show -- how Kamala Harris's aides did not want her to go on the show etc. But as the forthcoming books set a new narrative that it was Joe Rogan who did not accommodate Kamala Harris, Joe Rogan put out his clarification.""They (Kamala Harris campaign) supposedly talked to 150 people about her getting on the show.

'Donald Trump heard free Palestine and said sold': Social media reacts to Trump saying US will 'take over the Gaza Strip',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-heard-free-palestine-and-said-sold-social-media-reacts-to-trump-saying-us-will-take-over-the-gaza-strip/articleshow/117952401.cms,"In the 2007-08 season, Cristiano Ronaldo had his first goal-scoring peak, netting 42 goals as Manchester United clinched both the Premier League and the European Champions League. Throughout the season, Ronaldo delivered such outrageous goals that even seasoned commentators were left speechless, wondering: Is there any end to this boy’s talent? The same could be said for Donald Trump , who is waltzing from one major controversy to another, not giving his critics any time to launch a defence.However, no controversy seems to match the seismic shock of Trump’s latest declaration concerning the Gaza Strip . In a move bound to ignite global debate, US President Donald Trump announced that America will take over and develop Gaza, asserting long-term ownership of the beleaguered territory. Standing shoulder to shoulder with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a joint press conference, Trump boldly proclaimed his vision for “long-term US ownership” of Gaza, contingent upon the resettlement of Palestinians to neighbouring countries.Netanyahu, never one to miss a historic moment, lauded Trump's audacity, describing it as a transformative idea poised to reshape Gaza’s future.Gaza, ravaged by relentless conflict between Israel and Hamas since October 2023, now lies in ruins. Once home to 2.1 million people, the narrow strip has been reduced to rubble, its infrastructure decimated, and its population displaced en masse. The destruction has left Gaza resembling more a post-apocalyptic wasteland than a bustling enclave on the Mediterranean coast.“We will own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site,” Trump declared, sounding less like a diplomat and more like a real estate mogul eyeing prime beachfront property. His grandiose plans include levelling the ruins and fostering “economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area.” When questioned about the potential deployment of US troops to fill any security vacuum, Trump remained characteristically brash: “We’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that piece, we’re going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it’ll be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of.""As one X user put it: “Trump heard ""Free Palestine"" and said ""Sold!""Trump even hinted at plans to visit Gaza, Israel, and Saudi Arabia during an upcoming Middle East tour, though, in typical fashion, he avoided committing to a specific timeline. Netanyahu, ever the seasoned statesman, praised Trump for “thinking outside the box with fresh ideas” and demonstrating a “willingness to puncture conventional thinking.”However, Trump conspicuously sidestepped the elephant in the room: under what legal authority can the US claim long-term ownership of Gaza, a foreign land with its own fraught history and sovereignty issues? Details, it seems, are for others to worry about.Only time will reveal the consequences of this audacious gambit, but one thing is certain: Trump’s Gaza announcement has not just overturned an apple cart—it’s set the entire orchard on fire.Here are some social media posts on Trump announcing:","Us president donald trump announced that america will take over and develop gaza.

'Extraordinary man'

Prince Karim Al-Hussaini , known as Aga Khan IV , has passed away at the age of 88. He was a well-known spiritual leader of millions of Ismaili Muslims and a prominent figure in philanthropy and business.Khan died on Tuesday in Portugal, surrounded by family, according to a statement from the Aga Khan Development Network and the Ismaili religious community.His burial will take place in Lisbon. His successor has been named in his will, which will be read in the presence of family and religious leaders before the name is made public.Aga Khan IV was born on 13 December 1936 in Creux-de-Genthod, Switzerland, and became the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims in 1957 at the age of 20 while he was an undergraduate at Harvard University. His grandfather, Aga Khan III, chose him over his father, Aly Khan, saying that the community should be led by someone “who has been brought up in the midst of the new age.”Under Khan's leadership, the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) expanded its work in healthcare , education, housing, and rural development across more than 30 countries, with an annual budget of around $1 billion. Hospitals and schools named after him now operate in countries like Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.“We have no notion of the accumulation of wealth being evil,” Khan told Vanity Fair in 2012. “The Islamic ethic is that if God has given you the capacity or good fortune to be a privileged individual in society, you have a moral responsibility to society,"" he added.The Ismailis, a sect with roots in India that has spread across Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East, give up to 12.5% of their income as a religious duty. His wealth was estimated to be in the billions.Aga Khan IV was also known for encouraging dialogue between Muslim societies and the West. While he mostly stayed out of politics, he remained an influential figure. In 1957, Queen Elizabeth II granted him the title “His Highness.”""Few persons bridge so many divides — between the spiritual and the material; East and West; Muslim and Christian — as gracefully as he does,"" Vanity Fair wrote in its 2013 article praising Khan.He supported Islamic culture through architecture and the arts, creating the Aga Khan Award for Architecture and helping restore historic Islamic sites worldwide. He was also known for his interest in horse racing.Khan lived in France for much of his life before moving to Portugal in recent years, where he continued to oversee his philanthropic and development projects.His death brought tributes from around the world. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called him “an extraordinary man of vision, faith, and generosity” and “a very good friend.”UN secretary-general António Guterres took to X to give his tribute, calling Khan ""a symbol of peace, tolerance and compassion in our troubled world.""Aga Khan IV is survived by three sons, a daughter, and several grandchildren.

Was her name kept a secret?

The name of Rebecca Lobach , the third pilot of the military Blackhawk that crashed with an American Airlines plane, was not released until yesterday while identities of the other two pilots were revealed earlier. There was no survivor in the deadly crash as the remnants of both aircraft fell onto the frozen Potomac River. The reason of the unusual mid-air crash is still unknown while minutes before the crash the military helicopter was warned about the passenger plane.After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusivity) hiring policy (of the military) behind the mishap, the Blackhawk pilots came on the radar.Social media users claimed that Rebecca Lobach's identity was withheld because her social media accounts were being deleted. ""They deleted Rebecca Lobach’s social media accounts before releasing her name. It wasn’t to grieve,"" one wrote. ""They didn't withhold Rebecca Lobach's name to ""grieve"", they kept it secret while they scrubbed her social media,"" another wrote.Right-wing commentator and conspiracy theorist Laura Lommer said Rebecca Lobach was a Biden aide who attended Pride events. ""So yes, DEI was very much involved in this crash. Trump was right,"" Loomer wrote hinting that Lobach was a lesbian.""PART TIME Blackhawk pilot, Capt. Rebecca Lobach, was the name being withheld.

USPS suspends parcel deliveries from China and Hong Kong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-temporarily-suspends-parcel-deliveries-from-china-and-hong-kong-is-trumps-trade-policy-to-blame/articleshow/117935603.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

The United States Postal Service (USPS) announced on Tuesday that it is temporarily suspending the acceptance of incoming international parcels from China and Hong Kong, effective immediately and until further notice.The suspension follows the imposition of new trade measures by US President Donald Trump, but USPS has not provided an official explanation linking the two. In a statement, the USPS said that letter deliveries will not be affected by this halt, as per AFP.The move comes just days after Trump's executive order which eliminated the ""de minimis"" exemption for low-value goods, a long-standing policy that allowed parcels worth $800 or less to enter the United States without being subject to tariffs or inspections.The de minimis rule had been used to facilitate low-cost imports, especially from Chinese-based e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu, which have seen rapid growth by capitalising on this loophole.The decision to end the duty-free exemption is likely to impact millions of such parcels, affecting both consumers and businesses in the e-commerce space, according to the New York Times.The suspension of parcel acceptance follows Trump's executive order, which took effect on Tuesday and imposed a 10% tariff on all imports from China, alongside the scrapping of the de minimis rule. This order is part of the administration’s broader strategy to address trade imbalances with China and to curb the entry of illicit goods, including fentanyl.By requiring detailed information and the payment of tariffs on these packages, the change in rules will now subject low-value parcels to the same scrutiny as higher-value imports.While the USPS has not explicitly linked the suspension to these new regulations, experts suggest that the increase in parcel inspections could result in significant delays in shipments.Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which manages the inspection of packages entering the country, already struggles with the sheer volume of international shipments, and the change in policy is expected to further strain resources.FedEx and UPS, which manage many of these low-value parcels, have also expressed concerns about potential delays and supply chain disruptions due to the changes, as per the New York Times.E-commerce companies like Shein and Temu may face challenges due to new regulations. These changes could hamper cross-border shopping, especially for American shoppers who depend on low-cost products from other countries.Amazon could also be impacted, although it has not yet publicly commented on the situation, reported AFP.",Usps suspends acceptance of incoming international parcels from china and hong kong.

The adult education centre is about 200 km (125 miles) west of Stockholm.Several media outlets reported that the suspected assailant had turned the gun on himself. While police did not confirm this, they stated that five people had been injured by gunfire, including one believed to be the shooter.“One of the injured persons is a person whom we suspect may be the assailant,” Orebro police chief Roberto Eid Forest said at a press conference.“We can't rule out other suspects, and that's something we are continuing to work on in this intensive phase now – why it happened and if there are other possible suspects.”Forest added that police received the first reports of a school shooting at 12:33 pm (1133 GMT) but could not confirm how the attack unfolded or whether it occurred inside or outside the school.Two Campus Risbergska teachers, Miriam Jarlevall and Patrik Söderman, told Dagens Nyheter:“Students came and said someone was shooting. Then we heard more shooting in the hallway. We didn't go out, we hid in our offices.”“There were a lot of gunshots at first and then it was quiet for a half-hour and then it started again. We were lying under our desks, cowering.”Some witnesses told Swedish media they heard what sounded like automatic gunfire.Meanwhile, Swedish TV channel TV4 reported that police raided the suspect’s home in Orebro late on Tuesday afternoon.The suspect was reportedly around 35 years old, had a licence to carry a weapon, and had no criminal record.
