Following due diligence as per established SOPs, it has bought shares across half a dozen listed companies of Adani Group, whose book value stands at Rs 38,658.85 crore and invested another Rs 9,625.77 crore in debt instruments of the conglomerate.“Ministry of finance does not issue any advisory/direction to LIC in connection with matters related to investment of LIC fund,” she said in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha.

Former B’desh PM Zia reported to be in a critical condition; PM Modi offers assistance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/former-bdesh-pm-zia-reported-to-be-in-a-critical-condition-pm-modi-offers-assistance/articleshow/125707351.cms,"With former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia reported to be in a very critical condition, PM Narendra Modi expressed concerns about her failing health and offered all possible assistance to her. Modi’s gesture is significant as Zia has had a troubled past with India in contrast to her rival Sheikh Hasina’s warm and friendly ties with India. Zia’s party BNP accused the Indian govt of undermining democracy in Bangladesh by backing an “authoritarian” Hasina who was deposed last year and forced to flee to India.“Deeply concerned to learn about the health of Begum Khaleda Zia, who has contributed to Bangladesh’s public life for many years. Our sincere prayers and best wishes for her speedy recovery. India stands ready to extend all possible support, in whatever way we can,” said Modi in a post on X.Significantly, a team of Chinese doctors, apparently sent by Beijing, arrived in Dhaka on Monday to help in Zia’s treatment.This is not the first time Modi has reached out to Zia and her party. He had a meeting with her during his visit to Dhaka in 2015 that govt described as “full spectrum outreach” on Bangladesh.Modi’s message will also be seen as an acknowledgement of the new reality in Bangladesh - and re-evaluation of India’s position - which goes to polls early next year and the possible return to power of BNP, which is expected to gain majorly from Hasina’s ouster. According to a local survey last week, as reported by Prothom Alo, there’s a tight race currently between the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami, with the BNP holding a slight three-point lead. India has on several occasions said in the recent past it seeks fair and inclusive polls in Bangladesh.With his outreach, Modi is also doubling down on India’s position that it remains committed to the best interest of Bangladesh, including peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country and will continue to engage with all stakeholders. BNP too has said it wants “balanced and respectful” ties with India.",Former bangladesh pm khaleda zia reported to be in a very critical condition.

Winter Session Of Parliament: Bills On Atomic Energy, Excise On Agenda; Oppn Gears Up For SIR

NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar on Monday informed that India has been invited to chair the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA) for the first time, gaining recognition for its electoral process.Commenting on this achievement, he said, ""The world recognises the successful conduct of free, fair and transparent elections in India. Therefore, for the first time in its history of 30 years, the group of 37 democratic countries of the world have invited India to chair the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, International IDEA,” said Kumar.“This is a moment of immense pride for the citizens of India and all the Election Commission officials,” he added, as quoted by ANI.The Election Commission stated that Kumar will formally assume the Chair of International IDEA on December 3, 2026, in Stockholm, Sweden, representing India. The organisation comprises 37 democratic nations.Founded in 1995, International IDEA is an inter-governmental body with 35 member nations, while the United States and Japan participate as Observers. It has held observer status at the UN General Assembly since 2003.India, a founding member, has played an active role in shaping governance frameworks, conducting electoral research, and implementing training and capacity-building programmes.As the world’s largest democracy, India brings experience managing over 90 crore registered voters. This expertise is expected to strengthen Election Management Bodies worldwide during its tenure as Chair.Within the organisation’s membership and observer nations, India has the largest number of registered voters, with 991 million, representing 44.5 per cent of the total electorate of 2,225,549,481. The United States comes next with 234,504,358 voters, followed by Indonesia with 204,421,612.Other major contributors include Brazil, Japan, Mexico, and the Philippines, while smaller countries such as Luxembourg, Cabo Verde, and Barbados have far fewer electors.","Chief election commissioner gyanesh kumar on monday informed that india has been invited to chair the international institute for democracy and electoral assistance.

"Asia’s arms race shift: India climbs, China slides on PLA graft charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sipri-2024-arms-report-india-and-china-arms-race-xi-jinping-pla-purge/articleshow/125696987.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

China’s disrupted march

The bottom line

Global arms revenues surged to an all-time high of $679 billion in 2024, up 5.9% in real terms, according to the latest SIPRI Top 100 ranking. While Europe and the US drove most of the increase, Asia and Oceania stood out as the only region to post a decline—largely due to a dramatic drop in Chinese arms company revenues, the SIPRI report said.India, though still far from being a global arms giant, posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies. In sharp contrast, Chinese arms revenues fell 10%, a setback tied to a wave of high-profile corruption scandals and major contract delays that rattled Beijing's defense establishment.India’s three Top 100 firms-Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders-together pulled in $7.5 billion in arms revenue in 2024, up from $6.9 billion in 2023.BEL led the growth with a 24% revenue jump, hitting $2.47 billion. The boost came from domestic orders, particularly in radar systems and electronic warfare equipment, both prioritized in India’s military modernization drive.HAL, India’s top-ranked defense firm at rank 44 globally, earned $3.81 billion, a marginal 0.3% decrease from the previous year. The company faced delivery lags, but remained a cornerstone supplier to the Indian Air Force and Navy.Mazagon Dock, focused on naval shipbuilding, recorded $1.23 billion in arms revenue, with a 9.8% year-on-year increase, thanks to continued submarine and destroyer production.India is pressing ahead with its “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) campaign in defense production. While not grabbing global headlines, its incremental gains highlight an emerging industrial base that could challenge traditional suppliers over time.“The combined arms revenues of the three Indian companies in the Top 100 increased by 8.2 per cent to $7.5 billion on the back of domestic orders,” the SIPRI report said.The picture in China couldn’t be more different. For the first time in years, China’s eight arms producers in the SIPRI Top 100-previously hailed as key enablers of President Xi Jinping’s military modernization push-lost major ground.The steepest fall came from NORINCO, China’s primary land systems manufacturer, which saw its revenue plunge 31% due to corruption scandals and leadership upheaval.CASC, China’s aerospace and missile systems leader, dropped 16% following delays in military satellite programs and the removal of its president amid graft allegations.Even AVIC, the country’s biggest defense company, slipped 1.3%, hampered by delays in aircraft deliveries.“A host of corruption allegations in Chinese arms procurement led to major arms contracts being postponed or cancelled in 2024,” said Nan Tian, director of the SIPRI military expenditure and arms production programme.China’s top-down, state-controlled defense sector may be big-but its opacity leaves it vulnerable to internal shocks. Political purges tied to Xi’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign disrupted procurement and leadership pipelines across several top defense firms.Only two of China’s eight arms producers recorded revenue growth-CSSC, the shipbuilding powerhouse, was one, rising 8.7%, aligned with China’s naval buildup in the South China Sea.India’s slow, state-driven growth might lack flash, but it also avoids the internal disarray seen in Beijing. Its procurement is transparent, aligned to strategic plans, and largely free of major political scandal.China, meanwhile, is still far ahead in sheer scale but vulnerable to top-level instability.While China dragged down the region’s total, other Asian powers picked up slack:South Korean arms producers rose 31% to $14.1 billion, driven by booming exports.Japan posted the largest jump in Asia: a 40% increase in arms revenues across five firms, reaching $13.3 billion, reflecting Tokyo’s shift toward proactive defense spending amid regional tensions.US firms remain the backbone of the global arms industry. The 39 American companies in the Top 100 generated $334 billion in arms revenues in 2024, a 3.8 per cent increase that leaves them with just under half of global Top 100 sales. Lockheed Martin alone booked $64.7 billion, while RTX, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics each sat comfortably above $30 billion.Yet the American giant is struggling to turn money into timely capability. Programmes such as the F-35 fighter, the Columbia-class nuclear submarine and the Sentinel ICBM are all running late and over budget. Lockheed’s F-35 deliveries in 2024 were delayed by an average of 238 days per aircraft, and the programme’s projected sustainment costs have ballooned towards $1.6 trillion over its life. Northrop’s Sentinel programme has breached US cost-growth thresholds by around 80 per cent versus its original estimate.SIPRI’s Xiao Liang warns that “The delays and rising costs will inevitably impact US military planning and military spending… This could have knock-on effects on the US government’s efforts to cut excessive military spending and improve budget efficiency.” In plain terms, even as the US spends more, it risks getting less capability per dollar.European producers surged by 13%, reaching $151 billion, as countries rearm in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.Russia’s corporate footprint in the SIPRI Top 100 remains surprisingly small—just two entities, Rostec and United Shipbuilding Corporation—but their combined arms revenues jumped 23 per cent in 2024 to an estimated $31.2 billion. Domestic demand linked to the Ukraine war more than offset shrinking exports. Russian plants have ramped up output of artillery shells, missiles and armoured vehicles; SIPRI cites reports of 1.3 million 152-mm shells produced in 2024, a more than fivefold increase over 2022.Where Russia is constrained, the Middle East is expanding. For the first time, nine companies from the region appear in the Top 100, with combined arms revenues of $31.0 billion, up 14 per cent where comparable data exist. Israeli firms alone generated $16.2 billion, a 16 per cent increase, fuelled both by the Gaza war and strong demand for uncrewed systems and missile defence worldwide.For India:Expect a continued push for domestic procurement and local manufacturing under the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP).India may look to expand exports, especially to Africa and Southeast Asia, but lacks the global competitiveness of Korean or Israeli systems.For China:Beijing still accounts for around 13 per cent of total Top 100 arms revenues, and its shipyards and missile producers have been central to the rapid expansion of the PLA Navy and rocket forces over the past decade.But the 2024 rankings hint at a temporary pause or re-ordering in its modernisation drive just as tensions over Taiwan and in the South China Sea remain high.Recovery will depend on restoring procurement integrity, managing talent loss, and containing political fallout.For Asia:The regional arms race is far from over.The pivot from importing to building continues—but success will depend on supply chain resilience, governance, and geopolitical alignment.India is climbing slowly, but surely-fueled by trust in institutions, steady demand, and political will.China, long considered an unstoppable defense juggernaut, now faces turbulence not from outside threats, but from within.In the evolving landscape of Asian defense, discipline may matter more than dominance. And for now, India is playing the long game.","India posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three top 100 companies.

NEW DELHI: The feud between Shashi Tharoor and the Congress saw a new high after he skipped the party's key huddle a day before the start of the Winter Session of Parliament.Chaired by Sonia Gandhi , the Congress on Sunday held a strategic group meeting to discuss the party's strategy for the Winter Session.Tharoor, however, clarified that he did not intentionally skip the Congress huddle, claiming that he was on a flight returning from Kerala when the meeting took place.""I did not skip it; I was on a plane, coming from Kerala,"" Tharoor said.Additionally, Tharoor's office said that ""he was travelling with his 90-year-old mother from Kerala, making it impossible for him to reach Delhi in time.""""Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal was also unable to attend due to his engagements in local body election campaigning in Kerala,"" his office added.This comes just days after the Thiruvananthapuram MP missed a Congress meeting on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) issue earlier, citing ill health.

NEW DELHI: The first day of Parliament Winter Session 2025 witnessed a Mallikarjun Kharge vs JP Nadda showdown in the Rajya Sabha over the leader of opposition's reference to ""sudden exit"" of former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar.The sharpest moment came when leader of the House JP Nadda advised Kharge to “visit a doctor” to deal with their political frustrations, insisting the House stay focused on the agenda at hand.The leader of opposition in the Upper House, during his welcome address to the Rajya Sabha chairman CP Radhakrishnan, brought up his predecessor's ""completely unexpected and sudden exit from the office of the Chairman, Rajya Sabha.""""I hope you will not mind that I am constrained to refer to your predecessor's completely unexpected and sudden exit from the office of the Chairman, Rajya Sabha,"" he said amid opposition from the BJP members.""The chairman, being custodian of the entire house, belongs as much to the opposition as to the government. I was disheartened that the house did not get an opportunity to bid him a farewell. Regardless, wish him, on behalf of the entire opposition, a very healthy life,"" Kharge said.The statement did not go down well with the leader of house JP Nadda who called the remarks ""irrelevant"".""We must maintain the dignity of the felicitation program, and it would be good if we discuss it accordingly. If we start discussing the issue that our Leader of the Opposition brought up today, the farewell, and all the other topics, I think it's irrelevant,"" he said.""There will also be discussions from here that you moved a no-confidence motion against him, not once but twice...I think our Leader of the Opposition is very respectable. The defeat in Bihar, Haryana, and Maharashtra has caused you considerable pain. But you should express your pain and suffering to a doctor. You should speak to a doctor when the time comes,"" he added.Earlier this year, Dhankhar’s abrupt resignation as Vice President, officially citing health reasons with two years still left in his term, had triggered a flurry of speculation and conspiracy theories across political circles.His decision, announced on the very first day of Parliament’s Monsoon Session, was highly unusual—making him only the third Vice President after VV Giri and R Venkataraman to step down before completing a full tenure.","Kiren rijiju, jp nadda slam kharge over rajya sabha remarks on jagdeep dhankhar's exit.

How to maintain a close relationship with Russia while avoiding a rift with the West?

Inside Jaishankar’s Kremlin Briefing To Putin As India Shapes Agenda For India-Russia Annual Summit

Why the S-400 is still important to Delhi?





Russia's stealth sweetener, the Su-57, and India's 'strategic options'





Rewiring the money pipes: The rupee, Mir, and RuPay



Mir payments from Russian tourists in Goa or Kerala.

Over time, merchants in both countries have started to settle through local currency corridors instead of dollar-clearing hubs.

It's about something bigger:

New sanctions and lower oil prices



Putin’s visit sends a clear signal on the part of both New Delhi and Moscow that they each have powerful friends. It suggests that India can still count on various forms of Russian support, including access to sophisticated weaponry. Russia, in turn, can demonstrate that despite its estrangement with much of the Western world, it enjoys a cordial relationship with an emerging power. An article in Foreign Policy

Strategic independence or strategic isolation?



What the summit will really mean?





(With help from agencies)

When Russian President Vladimir Putin's plane lands in Delhi on December 4, it will be his first trip to India since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022. The optics will be simple: two longtime partners shaking hands again after a rough few years. The reasons for those smiles are anything but simple.There are two big bets on the table. One is hard power: India wants five more S-400 Triumf air defense squadrons on top of the ones it has already ordered from Russia and tested in Operation Sindoor this year. The other is financial plumbing: A plan to connect India's RuPay and Russia's Mir payment networks and make the rupee-rouble systems work better so that trade can keep going even as Western sanctions get tighter around Moscow.The combination of missiles and financial pipelines highlights the primary challenge facing India's foreign policy in 2025:India signed the original $5.5 billion S-400 deal in 2018, but it did so under a lot of pressure from the US under CAATSA, the law that punishes big defense purchases from Russia. In the end, Washington made an exception for India in 2022, quietly admitting that punishing Delhi would hurt its own Indo-Pacific strategy.Things have changed on the ground since then, but not in India's skies. China is still upgrading its air force and missile stockpile, while Pakistan is still an unpredictable secondary front. The S-400 is one of the few systems that can lock down Indian airspace like this. It has a long range and layered radar. We all read how S-400 successfully shot down several Pakistani drones during Operation Sindoor along the western front earlier this year. This only adds to the platform's ""game-changer"" reputation in Delhi.That's why the Modi government still wants five more S-400 squadrons, a new missile order, and is may also consider Moscow's offer to co-produce the Su-57 stealth fighter, even though there has been a lot of talk about moving away from Russian equipment. For Indian planners, this isn't about nostalgia; it's about filling in real gaps in their capabilities faster and, in many cases, cheaper than Western vendors will let them.But for Washington and Brussels, another big S-400 deal could be a warning sign. Analysts have said that adding to the original deal could start the CAATSA debate all over again, just as the US Congress and European capitals are already upset about India's purchases of Russian oil.Every extra S-400 battery India buys is more than just a missile system; it's a test of how far the West is willing to go to ""special treat"" Delhi.There are other big things in the air besides missiles. As Putin arrives, Moscow is also showing off the Su-57 stealth fighter, which is more futuristic.A recent article in the South China Morning Post says that Russian officials have said they are willing to give India unusually deep localization and technology transfer on the export version of the Su-57. They even hinted at the possibility of licensed production in India.The message to the Kremlin is clear: even though Western partners are hesitant to share cutting-edge combat aircraft technology, Russia is still willing to open the black box. The possible Su-57 deal is another way for India to show that it has ""strategic options."" It isn't stuck in one camp, even though trade, tariffs, and Ukraine issues sometimes make relations with the US tense.There is still a question of whether the Indian Air Force really wants a lot of Su-57s. The stealth-jet offer is a political subplot to the Modi-Putin summit. It shows how Moscow is trying to keep India's defense budget and attention from drifting too far toward American, European, and Indian systems.Payments are the lifeblood of India-Russia ties, while S-400s are the metal spine.Since the invasion of Ukraine, trade between the two countries has grown to almost $70 billion in 2024–25, mostly because of cheap Russian oil. But moving money from point A to point B has gotten harder and harder because US and European sanctions have hit Russian banks, oil companies, and shipping.India and Russia put together a rupee-based settlement system using Special Rupee Vostro Accounts (SRVAs) in Indian banks to keep trade going. This is a modern version of the old rupee-rouble trade from the 1950s. In August, the Reserve Bank of India made rules easier so that Russian companies could invest their extra rupees in Indian government bonds, stocks, and infrastructure. This way, the money isn't just sitting in bank accounts.Still, the system is creaking. Indian exporters have said that they are having more and more trouble getting paid for goods they send to Russia because banks are worried about secondary sanctions. Some trade groups have asked Delhi to make the rupee-rouble rate and guarantee framework clearer to help people trust the system again.That's where the idea for RuPay-Mir comes in. At the summit, negotiators want to get at least a political green light and maybe even a roadmap for both sides to agree to each other's domestic card networks.In real life, that could mean that Indian tourists in Moscow can use a RuPay card without needing a Visa or Mastercard.a world where Western financial systems aren't the only ones that work. That means staying alive for Russia, which is cut off from most of the Western banking system. For India, it's a strategic insurance policy that shows it can help build alternative circuits without officially joining any ""anti-dollar"" bloc.The crude truth of oil is behind the financial engineering.Before the war in Ukraine, Russia supplied India with almost no crude oil. By the middle of 2025, it was supplying about 35–40% of India's crude oil, making it the country's biggest supplier and saving Delhi billions of dollars in import costs thanks to big discounts.But that deal is now running into a wall of tougher sanctions. A new US-EU-UK package aimed at Russian companies like Rosneft and Lukoil is making Indian refiners rethink how much they are exposed. According to Reuters, Indian imports of Russian crude rose to about 1.85 million barrels per day in November, a last-minute rush to stock up. In December, however, they are expected to drop to nearly 600,000-650,000 bpd, the lowest level in three years, as sanctions take effect.Reliance, India's largest private refiner, has already stopped using Russian crude at its SEZ refinery, which is focused on exports. However, it is still processing some Russian oil for use in India.This is the other ""tightrope"" that Modi walks. Cheap Russian barrels helped keep India's inflation in check and protected families from price spikes around the world. But the same flows made the West more and more angry, and now they have led to sanctions that make it harder to get money, ship things, and get insurance.Washington and Brussels will now see every move India makes to protect payments—like RuPay-Mir, changes to the rupee-rouble exchange rate, and new investment options for Russian businesses—through the lens of these energy sanctions. Are they smart hedging, or are they a way for Moscow to get away with it?Delhi says that nothing important has changed, at least officially. Since 2022, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has said that India is against the war, supports dialogue and diplomacy, and stands for the UN Charter and territorial integrity. However, India will not be told who to buy oil or weapons from.Indian strategists call this ""multi-alignment"" or ""strategic autonomy."" It means working with the US and its allies more on technology and the Indo-Pacific while keeping strong defense and energy ties with Russia and dealing with a difficult relationship with China.But in the capitals of the West, people are less patient than they were in the first few months of the war. A recent article in Foreign Policy said that India's style of strategic independence is starting to look ""aloof,"" even opportunistic, at a time when Europe and the US see Ukraine as a fight for survival.That doesn't mean a crisis is going to happen. India is still a key part of the US plan to keep China in check in Asia. Washington has already shown that it is willing to put up with some discomfort to keep Delhi close, as seen by the 2022 CAATSA waiver and a number of defense tech projects.Still, every new action—more S-400s, deeper trade between the rupee and the rouble, and integration of the card system—adds weight to a set of scales that are already very well balanced.A successful visit from Putin will probably be seen as proof that India can't be pushed around. It buys what it needs from whoever it wants and makes its own financial plans. The S-400 has a special meaning: it was a system that India bought despite public warnings from the US, and it seems to have worked well in battle.People at home who don't like the idea will have other problems. Does India's long-term goal of diversifying and indigenizing slow down when it renews its dependence on Russia for big-ticket defense items? Are Indian banks and exporters being asked to take on too much risk as sanctions get tougher? And what if a future US government decides that waivers and quiet agreements have gone too far?The Modi government seems to think that India's economic power and usefulness in world politics give it some freedom of action for now. That basic bet won't change because of the 23rd annual summit. What it will do is raise the stakes even higher, with more hardware in the air and more plumbing in the financial system.When Modi and Putin meet in Delhi this week, the news will be about missiles and credit cards, fighter jets, and oil flows. The real story is below: Can India make a partnership with a sanctioned Russia without damaging its relationship with a cautious West?","India wants five more s-400 triumf air defense squadrons on top of the ones it has already ordered from russia. India may also consider moscow's offer to co-produce the su-57 stealth fighter, even though there has been a lot of talk about moving away from russian equipment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125687827,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-33192,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

You can’t dictate timeline for govt call on

SIR debate

, Rijiju tells oppn

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties disrupted proceedings in Lok Sabha and walked out of Rajya Sabha on the first day of the winter session after govt refused to concede their demand to immediately allow a debate on the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls being conducted by Election Commission.They rejected the stand of parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju that the demand for debate over SIR was under consideration but govt could not be tied to a timeline.The forthcoming days are likely to see more disruptions as there is no indication that the govt might relent on its stand not to discuss the functioning of Election Commission, an independent body. The opposition is determined to force the issue and chose the path of confrontation despite misgivings among smaller INDIA bloc parties.There are signs suggesting that Trinamool is ploughing its own furrow in the matter (special intensive revision of electoral rolls being conducted by Election Commission) rather than following Congress. At a meeting of the grouping, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, is learnt to have repeated his “vote manipulation” charge — a clear sign that Congress would remain hewed to its stand opposing special intensive revision.There were repeated adjournments in the first half of the session as opposition shouted slogans disregarding Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s appeal not to do so. “You can raise slogans outside but not in the House,” he said. A bill introduced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to implement amendments to GST law in Manipur was passed in Lok Sabha amid the din.Sitharaman also introduced in Lok Sabha two new bills that seek to repurpose levies on ‘sin goods’ such as tobacco, pan masala and related products. However, with opposition persisting with its slogan shouting, the House had to be adjourned for the day in the second half.In Rajya Sabha, opposition MPs were on their feet to press their demand soon after the felicitation of chairman C P Radhakrishnan, who chaired the proceedings for the first time since his election as Vice President in Sept this year.TMC member Derek O’Brien said that parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju had promised them on Sunday to get back to them on their demand that SIR should be taken up under the broader agenda of “electoral reforms”. Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, and CPM’s John Brittas joined in the demand.They cited suicides by booth-level officers (BLOs) due to alleged workload, with Kharge calling for taking up the debate on SIR first as they have been demanding it since last session.Rijiju reiterated that their demand is under govt’s consideration and that he would get back as soon as possible. “Nobody is undermining the matter taken up by opposition. It is under consideration of govt. But you cannot impose conditions like taking up the discussion today. There are opposition parties other than a dozen (demanding debate on SIR), who represent different states and want discussion on other issues,” he said. Opposition MPs told Rijiju that he had promised on Sunday to convey to them govt’s decision by 9pm the same day. Rijiju, however, said opposition cannot dictate a timeline.“Timeline is not the problem. But there is a trust deficit,” retorted Derek. Opposition members then staged a walkout in protest, following which the Chair took up special mentions and Zero Hour.Opposition functionaries said that they will continue to stick to their demand for SIR discussion on Tuesday and will take stock of the situation on Wednesday amid slender hope in its ranks that govt could agree.INDIA bloc will protest against the SIR at the Parliament entrance on Tuesday morning, in what will be reminiscent of the Monsoon session that was washed out over protests against ‘vote chori’.Many eyebrows were raised when Trinamool did not join the meeting of INDIA bloc held at Congress’s initiative. Also, smaller parties from Kerala like CPI, CPM, RSP and IUML felt that complete washout of proceedings should be avoided as there were important issues to be highlighted.Congress president Kharge sympathised with them, but said the issue of SIR is important and govt should accept the demand for discussion even if it is under some other subject like “electoral reforms”.But, sources said, a difference of views was the reason why opposition has decided to take a fresh look at the issue after two days.",Opposition parties disrupted proceedings in lok sabha and walked out of rajya sabha on the first day of the winter session.

Winter diseases you must be careful about as days get colder

Parts of NW, NE & Himalayan foothills may see hotter days

NEW DELHI: The upcoming winter (Dec-Feb) is likely to be colder in most parts of central India (Madhya Pradesh, north and east Maharashtra and parts of Gujarat) and parts of adjoining northwest ( Punjab , Haryana, Delhi, east and southeast Rajasthan, and west and south UP) and peninsular India (Telangana), with below normal day and night temperatures and 4-5 additional cold wave days, IMD said on Monday.These states normally get 4-6 days of cold wave days during Dec-Feb, but this time the region may get a total of 8-11 cold wave days. Parts of northeast India may also get additional cold wave days.Most of these states are also likely to experience below normal temperatures in Dec, with one to three additional cold wave days. This means there could be 3-6 days cold wave days during the month.The season’s first spell of cold-to-severe-cold wave conditions started early this year and were observed at isolated pockets over west, central and adjoining east India.Cold-to-severe-cold wave days were recorded in northeast Rajasthan, south Haryana, north Madhya Pradesh, south UP and north Chhattisgarh during Nov 8-18, and over north interior Maharashtra on Nov 15 and Nov 20. A cold wave is declared when the minimum (night) temperature of a station is 10 degrees Celsius or less for plains and 0 degree Celsius or less for hilly regions, and it is below normal by 4.5-6.4 degrees Celsius.Underlining the impact of such weather, IMD said above-normal cold wave conditions may increase health risks for vulnerable groups, including senior citizens, children and individuals with underlying medical conditions.“Early morning fog could reduce visibility and disrupt road, rail and air transportation, while stagnant atmospheric conditions may further deteriorate air quality in some urban areas. Weather-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, horticulture and daily-wage labour may face operational challenges during extended cold spells,” it said.“During the upcoming winter season (Dec 2025 to Feb 2026) normal to below-normal minimum (night) temperatures are likely over most parts of central India and adjoining peninsular and northwest India... However, some regions, including parts of northwest India, northeast India and areas along the foothills of the Himalayas, are likely to experience above-normal maximum (day) temperatures,” said IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.While releasing the outlook for the cold weather season, he said, “The occurrence of cold waves during Dec is likely to be above normal over parts of northwest, central and northeast India.”Referring to the forecast, the Met department advised authorities to maintain heightened preparedness. “Both the public and agencies concerned are encouraged to regularly monitor the impact-based forecast (IBF) issued through IMD’s daily early-warning services for timely updates,” it said.","The upcoming winter (dec-feb) is likely to be colder in most parts of central india.

BSF warns of 120 terrorists on LoC launch pads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bsf-warns-of-120-terrorists-on-loc-launch-pads/articleshow/125702016.cms,"BSF IG Warns Of Looming Threat As 120 Terrorists Wait In PoK Despite Dip In Infiltration Attempts

SRINAGAR: Around “120 terrorists” positioned on 69 launch pads across the LoC are under close watch and the next phase of Operation Sindoor will be activated without hesitation if Pakistan attempts any “misadventure”, BSF Kashmir frontier IG Ashok Yadav said Monday.Yadav said during the border force’s annual briefing that Pakistan shifted several launch pads deeper inside its territory after Indian air and artillery strikes between May 7 and May 10, when Op Sindoor hit terrorist sites in retaliation for the Pahalgam massacre that killed 26 civilians on April 22.“We caused heavy damage during Op Sindoor. Some launch pads were moved from forward areas so they remain out of firing range of Indian Army and BSF,” Yadav said, adding that despite relocation, these sites remain under surveillance. “Whenever there is any misadventure from Pakistan, we are ready to give a befitting reply.”During the May offensive, Yadav said BSF units and Army formations executed “heavy and accurate” fire assaults on Pakistani posts and launch pads. “Our units, including artillery regiments, inflicted huge casualties on Pakistani troops, damaged forward posts and destroyed several terrorist pads along the LoC.”Asked why the 69 pads were not struck earlier, he said terrain and distance limited firing solutions.“We had them under radar. Location and depth from the LoC matter. From some points it is difficult to target all launch pads,” he said.Yadav reported a sharp drop in infiltration attempts. Four attempts were recorded this year in the Kashmir frontier — two before and two after Op Sindoor — involving 13 infiltrators. “Eight were eliminated by the Army, five retreated,” he said. While the broader infiltration pattern remains unchanged, he acknowledged emergence of new tracks. “We receive inputs on new routes and cover them with the Army,” he said.Inside Kashmir valley, BSF has 13 companies working with the Army and police. Yadav flagged “silent recruitment” of terrorists and said the force is focusing on institutions functioning as “radicalisation centres”. Alerts are passed to agencies responsible for the hinterland, he said, adding that “complete synergy” exists among security forces.Following the Pahalgam attack, specialised BSF teams were deployed in the Gulmarg bowl to reinforce tourist security. “Our teams are operating professionally and effectively,” Yadav said.Despite harsh terrain, snowbound stretches, threats of sneaky strikes by Pakistani Border Action Team (BAT), sniping, ceasefire violations and fidayeen strikes, BSF personnel continue LoC duties with “full zeal and devotion”, he said.","Bsf ig warns of looming threat as 120 terrorists wait in pok despite dip in infiltration attempts. “whenever there is any misadventure from pakistan, we are ready to give a befitting reply,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125702047,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1169991,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Our greatest fear is that something irreversible is being hidden from us"" Kasim added.Kasim and his older brother Suleiman Isa Khan, who live in London with their mother, Jemima Goldsmith, have kept a distance from Pakistan's dynastic politics.The brothers, who call him ""Abba"", have spoken publicly only sparingly mainly about Khan's imprisonment.Kasim added that the last time they saw their father was in November 2022, when they visited Pakistan after he survived an assassination attempt.The family has repeatedly sought access for Khan's personal physician, who has not been allowed to examine him for more than a year, he added.Meanwhile, a jail official told Reuters that Khan was in good health, adding that he was not aware of any plan for a move to a higher-security facility.Controversy swirls around the health of cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan due to a lack of transparency about his confinement conditions.
