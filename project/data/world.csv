"Zelenskyy seeks Modi’s support, restricted oil flows from Russia; Leaders plan meeting in September",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/zelensky-dials-pm-seeks-support-ahead-of-trump-putin-meet/articleshow/123247202.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke Monday as efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war gained momentum ahead of President Donald Trump’s meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska. As India faces US sanctions for oil imports from Russia, Modi had spoken to Putin last week and called for conflict resolution through political and diplomatic means.While Modi reaffirmed India’s “steadfast and consistent” position for peaceful settlement of the conflict and backed efforts for the earliest restoration of peace, Zelenskyy told him it’s necessary to limit the export of Russian energy, particularly oil, to reduce its potential and ability to finance the continuation of this war.“It is important that every leader who has tangible leverage over Russia sends the corresponding signals to Moscow,’’ said Zelenskyy.Zelenskyy also said that he discussed in detail the sanctions against Russia during the “long” conversation. There was no mention of sanctions in the Indian statement that only said Zelenskyy briefed Modi about Ukraine-related developments and Modi thanked him.The president’s office said Modi backed Ukraine’s efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace and shared Zelenskyy’s position that everything concerning Ukraine must be decided with Ukraine’s participation.Reports from Washington have said that the White House is considering inviting Zelenskyy for the Trump-Putin meeting.Modi himself said he conveyed India’s consistent position on the need for an early and peaceful resolution of the conflict. “India remains committed to making every possible contribution in this regard, as well as to further strengthening bilateral ties with Ukraine,” he said in a post on X.According to the Ukrainian president, the leaders planned a personal meeting in September on the sidelines of the UNGA in New York. India has not officially said that Modi will be visiting the US in September but Modi is listed as one of the speakers at the upcoming General Assembly session.His talks with Modi took place amid the president’s efforts to mobilise international support for more pressure on Putin, and not allow concessions to the “killer”. Zelenskyy has stressed that Ukraine won’t give up land even as Trump says there will be some swapping of territories.Along with China, India remains one of the few major countries to have not condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has maintained that for any peace initiative to succeed, it’s important to engage both sides. During his visit to Ukraine last year, Modi called for sincere and practical engagement between all stakeholders to develop innovative solutions that would have broad acceptability and contribute towards early restoration of peace.According to Ukraine, Zelenskyy emphasised Russian bombing of a bus station in Zaporizhzhia on Sunday, saying this happened at a time when a diplomatic opportunity to end the war had emerged. “Yet instead of demonstrating readiness for a ceasefire, Russia is showing only its desire to continue the occupation and killings,” said Zelenskyy.","Pm narendra modi and ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy spoke on monday.

'Press badge isn’t a shield for terrorism': 5 Al Jazeera journalists killed in Israeli strike; IDF alleges Hamas link,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-gaza-war-five-al-jazeera-journalists-killed-in-israeli-strike-idf-claims-one-correspondent-was-a-terrorist-cell-leader-in-hamas/articleshow/123225024.cms,"Gaza: Al Jazeera Staff Killed In Relentless IDF Bombardment, Journo’s Final Message Reveals Horror

Five Al Jazeera journalists, including well-known correspondent Anas al-Sharif, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in Gaza City on Sunday. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, accusing al-Sharif of being a Hamas operative who “posed as a journalist” and led a terrorist cell responsible for rocket attacks.Al Jazeera condemned the killings as a “targeted assassination” aimed at silencing independent reporting from Gaza, where international media access remains heavily restricted. The strike marks one of the deadliest incidents for the network since the war began nearly two years ago, during which over 200 media workers have been killed, according to press freedom groups.Al Jazeera confirmed that five of its staff died in the attack: correspondent Anas al-Sharif, fellow reporter Mohammed Qreiqeh, and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa.Also read: Journalist or Terrorist? Who was Anas al-Sharif? Al Jazeera reporter killed in Israeli strike The group had been sheltering in a tent opposite Al-Shifa Medical Complex, a site long used by media crews. Al-Sharif, 28, was one of the most recognisable Arabic-language reporters covering the conflict, known for his frontline reports from northern Gaza. Hours before his death, he posted footage on X showing nearby Israeli strikes. The killings have deepened concerns about journalist safety in Gaza, where local reporters provide most coverage due to the ban on foreign press entering without Israeli military escort.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described Anas al-Sharif as a “Hamas terrorist” who used journalism as cover. They claimed intelligence from Gaza — including rosters, training records, and salary documents — proved his affiliation. According to the IDF, al-Sharif led a Hamas cell responsible for organising rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and troops. “A press badge isn’t a shield for terrorism,” the statement read. The military also accused Al Jazeera of integrating Hamas operatives into its reporting teams. Israel has long accused the Qatar-based network of bias, while Al Jazeera says such claims are politically motivated attempts to justify attacks on its journalists.Al Jazeera condemned the attack as a “blatant and premeditated assault” on press freedom. The network accused Israel of deliberately targeting its journalists following repeated incitement by Israeli officials. It said the slain reporters were among the last to remain in Gaza, providing live, unfiltered accounts of the humanitarian crisis. The broadcaster warned that the killings were part of a wider campaign to “silence the truth” about the war. Calling for urgent international action, Al Jazeera argued that immunity for perpetrators fuels further attacks and urged governments to pressure Israel to halt the targeting of media workers.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was “appalled” by the deaths, warning that Israel’s practice of branding reporters as militants without public evidence raises “serious questions about its respect for press freedom.” CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah stressed that journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) noted that over 200 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the war began, making it one of the deadliest conflicts for media in recent decades. Both organisations called for an independent investigation into the strike and for the protection of reporters working in conflict zones.Israel and Al Jazeera have had a strained relationship for years. The Israeli government has banned the broadcaster from operating inside the country, accused it of incitement, and raided its offices. The latest war in Gaza has heightened tensions, with Al Jazeera frequently challenging Israeli narratives about military operations. Qatar, which funds the network, also hosts the political leadership of Hamas and has mediated indirect talks between Israel and the group. Critics say this fuels Israeli mistrust of the channel, while supporters argue it remains one of the few outlets providing on-the-ground coverage from Gaza.With Gaza sealed off from most international journalists, global news organisations rely heavily on local reporters like al-Sharif for coverage. These journalists face extreme danger, lacking the protection afforded to embedded foreign correspondents. Many live under constant bombardment, while also coping with shortages of food, water, and medical care. The deaths of prominent figures such as al-Sharif further diminish the flow of independent reporting from the enclave. UN agencies and rights groups have warned that the loss of these voices leaves the world reliant on official statements and severely limits scrutiny of military actions.Before the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed foreign media, defending Israel’s expanded military operations in Gaza. He insisted Israel must “finish the job” by dismantling Hamas strongholds, not only in Gaza City but also in the central refugee camps and Muwasi. Netanyahu promised “safe zones” for civilians, though similar areas have been bombed in the past. He also announced plans to bring more foreign journalists into Gaza under military supervision. Critics, including the UN, warned that the expansion risks worsening the humanitarian disaster in the territory, which is already facing severe food shortages and mass displacement.The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting after Netanyahu’s announcement, but no concrete action was agreed. The United States defended Israel’s right to act against Hamas, rejecting allegations of genocide. China condemned the “collective punishment” of Gaza’s population, while Russia warned against a “reckless intensification” of hostilities. UN humanitarian official Ramesh Rajasingham said starvation was already occurring, with conditions “beyond horrific. ” Rights groups argue that targeting journalists undermines transparency and accountability in such a crisis, making independent reporting all the more crucial.Gaza’s health ministry reports more than 61,000 Palestinians killed since the war began, with roughly half being women and children. The conflict has displaced the majority of Gaza’s population and driven parts of the territory into famine. The ministry says at least 100 children and 117 adults have died from malnutrition-related causes since June. Aid delivery remains chaotic, with incidents of gunfire reported near distribution sites. Israel denies pursuing a policy of starvation, blaming shortages on Hamas. Humanitarian agencies say access restrictions and ongoing fighting are preventing sufficient relief efforts.Palestinian officials, press freedom advocates, and humanitarian organisations have called for the killings of al-Sharif and his colleagues to be investigated as war crimes. They argue the strike fits a broader pattern of silencing journalists who document alleged abuses. Al Jazeera says its slain reporters embodied the “courage and resilience” of Gaza’s press, working despite personal risk to expose the war’s impact. As the conflict nears its second year, the network warns that without independent witnesses, the humanitarian crisis will unfold largely unseen — and those responsible will face even less scrutiny.","Anas al-sharif, mohammed qreiqeh, ibrahim zaher, mohammed noufal, and moamen aliwa were killed in an israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in gaza city on sunday.

Rahul Gandhi's 'Vote Theft' Bombshell On EC Ignite BJP Vs Cong War Of Words

NEW DELHI: Congress leader KN Rajanna resigned as Karnataka Cooperation Minister on Monday after the party’s high command asked him to step down.This followed his critical remarks about his own party, where he expressed concern that they had failed to address alleged lapses in the electoral rolls before the election. He stated that the party “should feel ashamed” because these “irregularities happened right in front of our eyes. ”While he supported the party's ""irregularity"" charge, Rajanna also questioned the alacrity of the Congress party, saying the voter list was prepared when Congress was in power."" At that time, was everyone just sitting quietly with eyes closed?"" he asked, adding that the party ""should feel ashamed"".""Look, if we just start talking about such things casually, there will be different opinions. When was the voter list prepared? It was prepared when our own government was in power. At that time, was everyone just sitting quietly with eyes closed? These irregularities did take place — that’s the truth. There is nothing false in this. These irregularities happened right in front of our eyes — we should feel ashamed,"" the Karnataka minister told news agency PTI.The leader further said that at a time when the party should have filed objections, ""it kept quiet"".""We didn’t take care of it at the time.

A young suitor followed. The scrub and dust of Ranthambore's Zone 6 bore witness Saturday evening to a spectacle even veteran trackers blinked at - the national park's oldest living tigress T-39, aka Noor, mating at an age when most big cats have long hung up their claws.Estimated to be 17 to 18 years old, Noor already holds the Ranthambore record for breeding at the oldest age ever seen in the wild. In 2022, she produced a litter - her ninth - defying the norm that tigresses stop breeding by 12 or 13. In May 2023, conservation biologist Dharmendra Khandal saw her litter weak and emaciated, her udder dried up.Yet here she was - glowing coat, canines intact - mating with T-101, with reports she had also paired with another male days earlier. ""Mating at this age has not been observed in the wild,"" former honorary wildlife warden Balendu Singh said. ""She is healthy. At present, she is the oldest living tigress in the wild without intervention.""Noor's longevity and reproductive fire point to formidable genetics.

""Not a cat in hell's chance,"" said a veterinary officer, adding there's no documented case of a tigress birthing at or after 17 even in captivity.But in the wild, as Khandal put it, there's always ""a rare push against nature's limits"".Sometimes it's male pressure, sometimes it's her choice.

"After Operation Sindoor, IAF seeks more Rafales to stem depletion of fighter squadrons",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-operation-sindoor-iaf-seeks-more-rafales-to-stem-depletion-of-fighter-squadrons/articleshow/123223125.cms,"NEW DELHI: IAF has strongly pitched for a government-to-government deal with France to procure more Rafale fighters under its long-pending project to acquire 114 multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA), in which the bulk of the jets are supposed to be manufactured domestically with foreign collaboration.IAF will move the MRFA case for initial acceptance of necessity (AoN), the first step in the long-winded procurement process, to be approved by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) within a month or two, top defence sources told TOI.""Government will take the final decision when the MRFA case comes to DAC. But yes, IAF has projected an urgent need for additional Rafales to stem the depletion in the number of its fighter squadrons,"" a source said.The IAF move comes three months after military hostilities with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, during which the 4.5-generation Rafales were extensively used for long-range strikes across the border.While India has not declared its fighter losses, it has dismissed Pakistan's claim that it shot down six IAF jets, including three Rafales, on May 7. Pakistan used Chinese-origin jets like J-10s, armed with PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles with ranges over 200km, against IAF fighters on that day.With the MRFA case hanging fire for the last seven-eight years after an initial cost estimate of over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, IAF is now grappling with a depleted strength of 31 fighter squadrons (16-18 jets in each). The number will go down to the lowest-ever figure of 29 squadrons after the retirement of the MiG-21s next month.This when IAF is authorised 42.5 squadrons to tackle the collusive challenge from China and Pakistan, which was strongly reinforced during Sindoor. Moreover, China is set to supply Pakistan with at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation stealth jets in the near future.IAF has also projected the requirement for two to three squadrons of 5th-gen fighters, with the Russian Sukhoi-57 and the American F-35 being the contenders, till the indigenous AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft) is ready for production by 2035. ""But no official talks have begun with either Russia or the US yet,"" an official said.The IAF argument is it would make ""much better economic and logistical sense"" to go in for more Rafales through a government-to-government deal in the MRFA project. ""The deal can be concluded faster than going in for an open global tender,"" another source said.IAF inducted 36 Rafales, acquired under the Rs 59,000 crore inter-governmental contract with France in Sept 2016, which are deployed at the Ambala and Hasimara air bases. ""Both air bases already have the infrastructure and storage capacity to base at least one more Rafale squadron each,"" the source said.Navy is also slated to get its 26 Rafale-Marine jets, which will operate from aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, in the 2028-2030 timeframe under the Rs 63,887 crore (almost 7 billion euros) deal inked with France in April. ""There will be a commonality in platforms and equipment if more Rafales are acquired,"" he said.The push for the MRFA comes after a high-level committee, led by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, recently chalked out a detailed roadmap for IAF's ""all-round accelerated capability enhancement"" to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner, with greater participation from the private sector to complement the ongoing efforts of the DRDO and defence PSUs.",Iaf will move the mrfa case for initial acceptance of necessity (aon) the first step in the long-winded procurement process is to be approved by the rajnath singh-led defence acquisition council (dac) iaf is grappling with a depleted strength of 31 fighter squadrons.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123223197,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-12280,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday called for for “zero defect and zero effect” manufacturing for ' Make in India ', meaning flawless products with no environmental harm.Speaking at a public event in Bengaluru, PM Modi emphasised that India’s economy has climbed from 10th place to the top five in the past 11 years, and urged the youth of Bengaluru and Karnataka to lead the ‘Make in India’ and ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ initiatives.""We have to strengthen the presence of Bengaluru and Karnataka in 'Make in India'. I urge that our products should be of the standards of 'Zero Defect, Zero Effect'. That is, there should be defect-free products, and their manufacturing should also not have any negative impact on the environment. I expect that the talent of Karnataka will lead this vision of 'Aatmnirbhar Bharat'"", the Prime Minister said.The Prime Minister said the next big focus should be a “Tech Atmanirbhar Bharat,” pushing for innovation and self-reliance in technology. “Now is the time to give more priority to the needs of India and move ahead faster in developing new products,” he said.He further said that India’s economy is advancing at a rapid pace and is on course to become the world’s third-largest and credited the progress to the government’s “reform, perform and transform” approach, clear intentions, and honest efforts.“We are rapidly moving towards becoming the top third economy,” he said.“This speed came to us from the spirit of reform, perform, and transform. This speed came to us from clear intention and honest efforts.”Highlighting infrastructure gains since 2014, the Prime Minister noted that metro services have expanded from just five cities to more than 1,000 km of network in 24 cities. Rail electrification has doubled from 20,000 km to over 40,000 km, airports have risen from 74 to over 160, and operational national waterways have increased from three to 30.Citing the recent success of Operation Sindoor , PM Modi credited the achievement to indigenous defence technology and the role of Karnataka’s youth. “The success of Operation Sindoor is due to our technology and the power of ‘Make in India’ in defence. The youth of Bengaluru and Karnataka have contributed a lot to this,” he said, adding that Bengaluru has become a symbol of the new India’s rise.""We are seeing Bangalore emerging as a city that has become a symbol of the rise of the new India... A city that has put India's flag on the global IT map. If there is anything behind Bangalore's success story, it is the hard work and talent of its people,"" the Prime Minister said.This was PM Modi’s first visit to the city since the operation, and he praised India’s ability to destroy terrorist hideouts deep across the border, forcing Pakistan “to its knees” within hours.Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister inaugurated Bengaluru Metro ’s Yellow Line from RV Road (Ragigudda) to Bommasandra, part of the Rs 7,160 crore Phase-2 project.According to news agency ANI, the 19 km route with 16 stations will extend the city’s metro network to over 96 km, benefiting more than six lakh daily commuters. PM Modi also laid the foundation stone for the Rs 15,610 crore Phase-3 project and flagged off three Vande Bharat Express trains, underlining the government’s push for modern, world-class rail travel.However, his comments came amid escalating trade tensions with the United States.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday took a veiled jab at US President Donald Trump over the recent tariff hikes on Indian goods, accusing unnamed global powers of trying to derail India's economic momentum. Without naming Trump, Singh said, ""Some 'boss' is jealous, unable to accept India's growth; trying to disrupt the country’s economy"".“There are some people who are not happy with the speed at which India is developing. They are not liking it. ‘Sabke boss toh hum hain’, how is India growing at such a fast pace?” Singh told a gathering.The comments came after Washington imposed a 25% tariff on Indian goods, along with an additional 25% penalty in response to New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil.The US President also threatened further tariff hikes, dismissed India’s economy as “dead,” and faced criticism from New Delhi after aides accused India of financing Russia’s war in Ukraine.Also Read: India’s 50% tariff is actually a US sanction in disguise. Why that makes it worse Singh alleged that some countries were trying to ensure “products made in India, by Indian hands, become more expensive than those made in other countries, so that when prices rise, the world will stop buying them.” But he insisted, “India is advancing so rapidly that I say with full confidence: no power in the world can now stop India from becoming a major global power.”Pointing to defence exports as an example of resilience, Singh said, “We are exporting defence items worth more than Rs 24,000 crore. This is the strength of India, this is the new defence sector of the new India, and exports are continuously increasing.” He added that the sector had not been impacted by the tariff dispute.","Defence minister rajnath singh accuses unnamed global powers of trying to derail india's economic momentum.
