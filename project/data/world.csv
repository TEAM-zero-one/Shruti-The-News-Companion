"India, US press ahead with deal but challenges remain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-us-press-ahead-with-deal-but-challenges-remain/articleshow/127897451.cms,"Transactional Model Of Relationship

“Deal Is A Key Priority For Both Sides” Us Expert Lauds India-Us Trade Pact

NEW DELHI: The India-US trade deal allows both sides to get the relationship back on to an even keel, but whether it can lead to long-term stability in ties remains open to question.The importance of the agreement, even if conditional, cannot be overstated as it allows India and the US to avert an immediate crisis. India just managed to rid itself of an albatross around its neck that was threatening to smother cooperation with its most important strategic partner even in other areas. However, the estrangement with the US since Donald Trump’s return to the White House has not been about trade alone. There are several other friction points.The first is the India-Pakistan re-hyphenation Trump has brought upon India through his courting of Rawalpindi. It is here US ambassador to India Sergio Gor, who seems to have found a way out of the trade impasse within weeks of arrival, may have an important role to play. Suspense still looms over his dual role as Trump’s special envoy for south Asia and any false move bracketing India with Pakistan, let alone playing sheriff, will be met with resistance.Bilateralism has been the leitmotif of India’s Pakistan policy and, as far as India is concerned, there’s no Nobel Peace Prize for any third party to win.The second concern is related to the US commitment to the Indo-Pacific under Trump, who wants to engage his counterpart Xi Jinping for a “stable peace, fair trade and respectful relations”. Trade differences between India and the US were seen as blocking any forward movement by Quad and a US-India reset must surely clear the ground for a summit meeting. While the US 2026 National Defence Strategy underlines the goal of a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific , it makes no mention of Quad or India.Thirdly, India’s strategic autonomy will likely continue to act as a limiting factor. India will continue to use the same to navigate geopolitical complexities, especially in its relations with the US, Russia and China. India may have, according to Trump, promised to stop buying Russian oil but it will continue to work closely with Moscow in defence and in forums like the SCO and BRICS. India would like Russia to see its energy pivot as a blip caused by market conditions, not as an ebbing of its strategic autonomy.For India, the structural shift in how the US handles the H-1B visa programme remains a major irritant that it hopes Washington will address.Finally, India will also be concerned about the transactional relationship that the US under Trump seeks with India. Many claims made by Trump in his announcement India saying no to Russian oil, agreeing to buy energy and other products worth $500 billion from the US, zero tariff on US products have not yet been confirmed by Indian govt, suggesting there might be a devil in the details. India will hope that some of Trump’s claims are just political signalling, not an ultimatum.","The india-us trade deal allows both sides to get the relationship back on to an even keel, but whether it can lead to long-term stability in ties remains open to question.

Lower Tariffs, Bigger Claims, And Russian Oil Pressure: Inside The New India-US Trade Agreement

India-US Trade Deal: What PM Modi, Trump said

US President Donald Trump has reportedly agreed to remove the 25% tariff America imposed on India for its crude oil imports from Russia. A New Delhi–based source quoted in a Bloomberg report said that the US has agreed to withdraw the 25% penal tariff for India’s Russian oil procurement. Reuters also reported a White House official saying that the 25% punitive tariff will be removed, but an official confirmation is awaited.A White House official told ANI on Monday (local time) that the United States will remove the additional 25% tariff imposed on Indian imports over New Delhi’s procurement of Russian oil. However, the official stressed that India is expected to completely stop, rather than merely scale back, its purchases of Russian crude.Responding to ANI’s question on whether the tariff rollback included the 25% penal tariff, the official was quoted as saying, “""Yes, although the agreement is that India will cease, not just reduce, Russian oil purchases. ""In the meantime, India and the US have announced a trade deal, with the Trump administration lowering the tariffs on Indian exports to 18%. Trump took to social media platform Truth Social to announce the trade deal, which was later confirmed by PM Narendra Modi confirming it via X (Twitter). However, India is yet to confirm the details of the trade deal shared by Trump in his post. He also said that the 18% tariff rate is effective immediately, and that India would buy $500 billion worth of US energy, coal, technology and agricultural products.Also Read | India-US trade deal announced by US President Donald Trump; check details US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor also told a TV channel that the final figure of tariff on India will be 18%, indicating that the 25% penal tariff linked to Russian crude has also been removed.Russia has been the largest supplier of crude for India since the start of the former’s war with Ukraine. The share in India’s oil import basket has gone up to almost 40%. But recently, after US sanctions on Russian oil firms, Indian refiners had been forced to reduce Russian crude oil purchases.PM Modi posted on X, “Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement. When two large economies and the world’s largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation. President Trump’s leadership is vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity. India fully supports his efforts for peace. I look forward to working closely with him to take our partnership to unprecedented heights.”Before Trump had posted on social media, “It was an Honor to speak with Prime Minister Modi, of India, this morning. He is one of my greatest friends and, a Powerful and Respected Leader of his Country. We spoke about many things, including Trade, and ending the War with Russia and Ukraine. He agreed to stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela. This will help END THE WAR in Ukraine, which is taking place right now, with thousands of people dying each and every week!

They will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO. The Prime Minister also committed to “BUY AMERICAN,” at a much higher level, in addition to over $500 BILLION DOLLARS of U.S. Energy, Technology, Agricultural, Coal, and many other products.

NEW DELHI: As the united opposition raised an alarm over the US trade deal “selling away the blood and sweat” of Indian farmers, Congress neta Rahul Gandhi Tuesday said PM Narendra Modi is “compromised” because of the court case against Adani in the US and the Epstein files. He said the PM suddenly signed off on the trade deal because he is under “pressure”.Rahul said the case against Adani basically targets the PM because the business leader represents the financial structure of Modi and BJP, while the US has not yet released the full material they have on Epstein Files. “These are the two pressure points, and the country should understand that the PM is compromised,” he told reporters.The leader of opposition in Lok Sabha said the issue about General M M Naravane’s purported memoirs that he wanted to speak on in the House is a “sideshow”. “The country has to think hard about why the PM is compromised, and who has compromised him,” he remarked.Sharpening his attack, Rahul said Modi signed the US trade deal after it was stuck for four months, and on which nothing had changed. He said, “Modi is scared. He is under tremendous pressure, and the balloon of his image that has been created by spending crores, can burst.”Rahul added, “Indian farmers must understand that Modi has sold off their hard work and their blood and sweat through this trade deal. And he has done so because he is compromised. And he has not only sold off the farmers but sold off the country.” Samajwadi Party , DMK , Left parties, TMC and others joined hands in raising questions about the Indo-US deal. MP Randeep Surjewala said announcements by the US agriculture secretary and US President Donald Trump have made it clear that “Americal agricultural products will come to India on zero tariffs and flood the Indian markets, to the detriment of Indian farmers.”The opposition demanded that the trade deals with the US and the European Union be tabled in Parliament and debated.AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh underlined that the deal was announced by Trump Monday night, just like he had announced the halting of Operation Sindoor. “From the information President Trump has provided, it is abundantly clear that PM Modi has — like he did on May 10, 2025 — completely surrendered. He has most definitely appeased President Trump.

NDA MPs Felicitate PM Modi For India-US trade Deal At Parliamentary Party Meeting

NDA known for carving lines in stone, says Modi

NEW DELHI: With a couple of big-ticket trade deals in his bag within a matter of days, PM Modi asserted on Tuesday that the world is recognising India’s strength and according it renewed respect, even as he cautioned governing alliance MPs against any sense of complacency over the govt’s achievements.Addressing the BJP-led NDA parliamentary party meeting where he was felicitated for India’s trade agreements, including with EU and US, Modi said India is at the centre of an uncertain world as past alliances give way to new alignments, emphasising that the new year has been particularly encouraging for India, sources said.In this context, Modi praised the Budget for its farsightedness and strengthening India’s prospects to become developed by 2047, with FM Nirmala Sitharaman briefing MPs on its highlights. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said MPs exuded happiness over the conclusion of nine trade deals covering 39 countries and credited Modi’s leadership.Modi’s early morning post on X quoting a Sanskrit shloka to emphasise the power of self-confidence was seen as a reference to last-night’s announcement of an Indo-US trade agreement by US President Donald Trump and him.“Self-confidence is the strength that makes everything possible. This power is going to be of great help in realising people’s dreams of a Viksit Bharat,” the PM said.An MP said Modi personified confidence at the meeting, which observers pinned on the success of trade negotiations with the US, and recalled the numerous steps India took following the Covid outbreak in 2019 that have since begun bearing fruit. With India being seen as a reliable partner by many leading countries, he said his govt had stuck to its strategy and kept patience.Besides painting a bright future for the economy at the meeting, Modi expressed confidence over NDA’s political prospects, noting its triumph in a series of polls, including in assemblies and local bodies in different parts of the country.At the same time, sources said, he reminded NDA MPs that while it is easy to carve a line in butter, NDA is known for carving a line in stone. The winning streak must be maintained, Modi said, urging the parliamentarians to continue their work for the masses.He spoke of NDA’s expansion in Tamil Nadu and BJP’s win in Thiruvananthapuram Municipal Corporation poll in Kerala to stress the alliance’s increasing acceptability.Modi said some students clear one exam in junior grade and then believe they will face similarly easy tests in senior classes, only to end up failing, remarks which some MPs interpreted as a dig at Rahul Gandhi even though he did not name anyone.Emphasising the need for MPs to remain dutiful, he praised the contribution of Rajya Sabha member C Sadanandan Master, who wears prosthetic legs after losing his limbs in a brutal attack, allegedly by Left members, to BJP.","Pm modi was felicitated for india’s trade agreements, including with eu and us.

Amid Trade Tensions, Jaishankar To Visit US Next Week To Attend Critical Minerals Ministerial Meet

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday met US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Washington, ahead of the critical minerals ministerial scheduled for February 4.The meeting came during Jaishankar’s three-day visit to the United States and a day after India and the US announced a trade deal under which Washington agreed to cut tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent.The United States is set to host the inaugural critical minerals ministerial on Wednesday (local time) in Washington DC, bringing together delegations from more than 50 countries to deepen cooperation on securing and diversifying global critical mineral supply chains, according to a notice issued earlier by the US State Department’s Office of the Spokesperson.Earlier in the day, Jaishankar also met US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, with the two sides discussing ways to advance the India-US economic partnership and strengthen strategic cooperation.“Pleased to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Washington DC today. Had a useful discussion on advancement of India - US economic partnership and strategic cooperation,” the External Affairs Minister said in a post on X.Ahead of the ministerial, the US Department of State said Secretary Rubio will convene partners from across the world to bolster collaboration on critical mineral supply chains. Rubio will chair the ministerial, with participation expected from delegations representing over 50 nations.The gathering has been described as a landmark effort to build collective momentum for cooperation on securing critical minerals that are vital for technological innovation, economic growth, and national security. The event will open with remarks by US Vice President JD Vance, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and other senior US officials.Jaishankar’s visit also comes against the backdrop of the India-US trade agreement announced on Monday following a phone conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump. Under the agreement, the US will lower reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent from 25 per cent, with immediate effect.Welcoming the deal, Jaishankar said it would boost job creation, spur economic growth, promote innovation, and strengthen India’s ‘Make in India’ initiative.In a post on X, the External Affairs Minister said, “Welcome the announcements on bilateral trade following the conversation between PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump. This will create more jobs, spur growth and promote innovation in both economies. It will strengthen 'Make in India' endeavours and encourage trusted technology ties. The opportunities in our economic engagement are truly vast and we are confident of realising them.

Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi launched a broadside against Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, accusing him of being ""compromised"" and selling out India's hard-earned progress in the recently announced trade deal with the US.While talking to reporters outside Parliament, the Congress leader claimed that the Prime Minister signed the trade deal with the US “under immense pressure”.Read Also | 'PM under pressure': Rahul Gandhi links Adani, Epstein to India-US trade deal “Prime Minister Modi is rattled. You saw that the trade deal which had been stalled for the last four months — nothing had changed for four months — for reasons I know and Narendra Modi knows, was suddenly signed by Narendra Modi yesterday evening,” Rahul said.“There is pressure on Narendra Modi—immense pressure. And the image bubble of Narendra Modi, which was built by spending thousands of crores of rupees, could burst. The issue is not slogans or statements—this is a sideshow, and they know it. I know it too. The main issue is that our Prime Minister has been compromised. Who has done it and how it has been done is for the people of India to think about,” he added.This comes after Rahul Gandhi was snubbed in Parliament after he quoted excerpts from the memoir of former Army chief General MM Naravane, triggering objections from the treasury benches.Subsequently, opposition MPs raised slogans, leading to the adjournment of proceedings.Outside Parliament, Rahul also slammed the government for not letting him speak in Parliament on the President’s address.“For the first time in history, the Leader of the Opposition has not been allowed to speak on the President’s address. You can ask me to speak outside—that will happen automatically. But you must understand this, and all the farmers of India must understand this: in this trade deal, Narendra Modi has sold your hard work, your blood and sweat. And he has done this because he is compromised. He hasn’t just sold you; he has sold the country. That is why I am not being allowed to speak there,” Rahul said.Rahul also said that PM Modi is “scared”, claiming that the “people who built his image have now begun to dismantle it”.“Narendra Modi is scared because the very people who built his image have now begun to dismantle it. You should understand what this pressure is. There are 1,111 cases against Adani in the United States. They are not targeting Adani alone; they are targeting Narendra Modi’s financial structure. That is one pressure point,” Rahul said.“The second pressure point is the Epstein files. There is more material in the Epstein files that has not yet been released. The entire country wants to know what is in them, but the United States has not released them yet. And then there is the case against Adani, which is effectively a case against Modi, because Adani is the BJP’s financial structure—Modi’s financial structure. So these are the two pressure points. And the country must understand this: the Prime Minister has been compromised, and that is the central issue,” he added.Earlier on Monday, the Lok Sabha witnessed a major showdown after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah objected to Rahul Gandhi for quoting excerpts from the unpublished memoir of former Army chief General MM Naravane.The Congress leader, however, insisted that the document he was referring to was “authentic” and that he was well within his rights to quote from it. He said he had not originally intended to raise the issue but decided to do so after BJP MP Tejasvi Surya questioned the patriotism of the Congress party earlier in the debate.“No debate on who is patriotic and who is not. Our patriotism is not buried,” Rahul said.Rajnath Singh countered the reference, maintaining that the memoir had not been published and therefore could not be brought into parliamentary proceedings.","'pm modi under pressure from trump': rahul gandhi claims as trade deal debate paralyses lok sabha.

Air India Grounds Dreamliner After Pilot Flags Fuel Control Switch Issue in London-Bengaluru Flight

What happened at Heathrow?

UK incident challenges claim AI fuel switch movement was manual: Expert

MUMBAI: In a development with direct implications for the investigation into the June 12 fatal Air India Boeing 787 Ahmedabad crash, another Air India Dreamliner saw a fuel control switch move from “run” to “cut-off” after a crew member pressed it to check whether it was locked.The switch moved without the required lift action, suggesting the safeguard meant to prevent fuel supply cut off and inadvertent engine shutdown did not function as designed, sources said. The London incident challenges the controversial narrative that the Ahmedabad crash resulted from a deliberate pilot act, pointing instead to a possible and critical technical flaw in the aircraft’s fuel switch design.The incident occurred on Feb 1 at London Heathrow during engine start of B787 (VT-ANX) operating the 9.05pm Air India flight AI-132 to Bengaluru. The fuel control switches on the 787 require a two-step action: they must be lifted before they can be moved between “run” and “cut-off”. The safety feature is intended to prevent inadvertent fuel shutdown.“The pilot lightly pushed the left fuel control switch to check if its lock feature was working and found it was not because the switch moved though it was not lifted first,” the source said. It again failed to lock the second time.But the third time the switch stayed locked and did not move without lifting. The aircraft departed at 9.40pm for Bengaluru, where it is currently grounded.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report released last July, said that both fuel control switches on the ill-fated aircraft had moved from “run” to “cut off” seconds after takeoff. The report said one pilot asked the other why did he cut off the fuel, to which the other responded that he did not do so.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report, added that no technical or design flaw was found with the aircraft so far, implying pilot action. Therafter, the DGCA mandated an inspection of the fuel switch locking system. Air India later announced that it completed these inspections and found no faults. But the London incident brings back to fore the unresolved question around switch design, its locking integrity and the possibility of inadvertent activation, said sources.A senior commander said: “The London incident directly challenges the assumption that fuel switch movement in the Air India crash was manual. Until now, the cut-off transition was treated as near-conclusive evidence of pilot action. The London event shows that uncommanded switch behaviour, through mechanical detent failure, signal corruption or other causes, is a credible failure mode. That places the DGCA’s earlier claim of fleet clearance under sharp scrutiny, as a defect appearing months later suggests inspections may have been visual, non-diagnostic, or incomplete. For the AAIB, the implication is clear: fuel cutoff can no longer be equated with intent, the investigation must widen to fleet-level and component analysis, and attribution of deliberate pilot action without fully eliminating system anomalies is no longer defensible.”Air safety expert Capt Amit Singh said: “The London incident is particularly concerning because in 2018 the US aviation regulator cautioned that fuel control switches on Boeing 787s could malfunction and lead to inadvertent engine shutdown. Occurring after Air India said its fleet’s fuel control switches have been checked, and amid the ongoing June 12 B787 crash investigation, it raises serious questions about inspection adequacy and demands the highest level of regulatory scrutiny. ”Air India, in a statement, said: “We are aware that one of our pilots has reported a possible defect on the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 aircraft. After receiving this initial information, we have grounded the said aircraft and are involving the OEM to get the pilot’s concerns checked on a priority basis. The matter has been communicated to the aviation regulator, DGCA. Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA, and had found no issues. ” Boeing said: “We are in contact with Air India and are supporting their review of this matter”.",Incident occurred on feb 1 at london heathrow during engine start of b787 (vt-anx) air india flight ai-132 to bengaluru.

DGCA Rules Out Fault in AI’s Boeing 787

MUMBAI: Checks carried out on the Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner grounded in Bengaluru found its fuel control switch lock to be satisfactory, said the ministry of civil aviation on Tuesday, even as another AI Dreamliner was grounded over technical reasons, this time in Dubai.The latest grounding involved B787 (VT-ANN) scheduled to operate an 8.40pm departure from Dubai to Delhi, flight AIC 916, on Feb 2. The aircraft took off on Feb 3 at 5.30pm. It was grounded due to what has been described as a “technical reason”. It is not yet known whether the issue involves a fuel switch lock-related problem. Air India did not comment.The first grounding occurred on Feb 1 after a malfunction was registered by the crew of B787 (VT-ANX) during engine start to operate flight AI-132 from London to Bengaluru. The incident was critical as the fuel control switch locking mechanism has been at the centre of the investigation into the June 12 Air India Ahmedabad crash.Referring to the London incident, the ministry said the crew observed on two occasions that the left engine fuel control switch did not remain positively latched in the “RUN” position when light vertical pressure was applied. On a subsequent attempt, the switch latched correctly and remained stable and the crew went on to operate the flight in Bengaluru.In Bengaluru, during the check, “both left and right switches were checked and found satisfactory, with the locking tooth fully seated and not slipping from RUN to CUTOFF,” the ministry said. “When full force was applied parallel to the base plate, the switch remained secure. However, applying external force in an incorrect direction caused the switch to move easily from RUN to CUTOFF, due to the angular base plate allowing slip when pressed improperly with finger or thumb,” it added. AI as been advised to circulate Boeing’s recommended procedures for the operation of the fuel cut-off switch to its flight crew, it said.Air safety expert Capt Amit Singh pointed out that even if force is applied in the incorrect direction, the switch should not move unless it is lifted.The ministry statement also said based on Boeing’s communication, the pull-to-unlock force was checked on the fuel control switch using the recommended procedure on the involved fuel cut off switch, the fuel control unit to be installed and fuel cut off switch of another aircraft. In all cases the pull-to-unlock force was found within limits.",The fuel control switch locking mechanism has been at the centre of the investigation into the june 12 ahmedabad crash.

Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

NEW DELHI: Centre on Tuesday told Supreme Court that all procedural safeguards were followed while ordering detention of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk and action against him was taken for instigating people in the sensitive border area of Ladakh.Continuing with his earlier submission on Monday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale that Wangchuk’s speech was intended to provoke people to indulge in violence against govt and justified his detention under National Security Act.“This court is dealing with a person who is instigating people in a border area, adjacent to Pakistan and China, where regional sensitivity is involved,” he said.Referring to the activist’s speech, the solicitor general said he had stated that Ladakhis could not choose their own representatives while China and Tibet etc have autonomous rights which is highly objectionable.“This is a preventive action so that he doesn’t keep repeating the things he (Wangchuk) said. The detention strikes at the very purpose for which the NSA was enacted. It will have a contextual meaning. Every state has region specific sensitivities,” Mehta said.SC was hearing the plea moved by Wangchuk’s wife Gitanjali Angmo against his preventive detention.Wangchuk has been detained under the NSA following protests in Leh in Sept 2025 over demands of statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the UT of Ladakh.",Ladakh saw violent protests last year over demands for statehood and greater autonomy.

'PM Modi Under Pressure From Trump': Rahul Gandhi Claims As Trade Deal Debate Paralyses Lok Sabha

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday wrote a letter to Speaker Om Birla, registering his ""strongest protest"" on not being allowed to speak on the President's address during the ongoing Budget session of Parliament.Gandhi described this as a ""blot on our democracy.""On Monday, the treasury benches objected to the Congress MP quoting an excerpt from an unpublished book by General MM Naravane (retired) on the India-China military clashes in Ladakh in June 2020. They argued that House rules prohibit a member from citing a book that has not yet been published.Naravane was the Army Chief at the time. The excerpts were recently published by an online portal.“By long-standing convention, a member who wishes to refer to a document in the House is required to authenticate it and affirm responsibility for its contents. Once this requirement is fulfilled, the Speaker allows the member to quote or refer to the document. Thereafter, it becomes the responsibility of the government to respond, and the role of the Chair stands concluded,” Gandhi wrote in his letter to Birla.The Raebareli MP added that being “prevented” from speaking is not only a violation of this convention but also reflects what he called a “deliberate attempt” to stop him from addressing the House in his capacity as the LoP.“The right of the LoP and of each member to speak is integral to our democracy. The refusal of these basic democratic rights has led to an unprecedented situation. For the first time in parliamentary history, on the behest of the government, the Speaker has been forced to prevent the LoP from speaking on the President’s address. This is a blot on our democracy, against which I register my strongest protest,” he added.Gandhi has alleged that the government is “scared” of what is written in the book. He attempted to speak on the issue on Tuesday as well but was again unable to do so.","Gandhi described this as a ""blot on our democracy.

Air India Grounds Dreamliner After Pilot Flags Fuel Control Switch Issue in London-Bengaluru Flight

NEW DELHI: Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Tuesday said both switches of an Air India Boeing 787-8 aircraft were found to be “satisfactory” after the pilots reported a possible defect in the fuel control switch upon landing in Bengaluru from London.The incident occurred earlier this week. In response, Air India grounded the aircraft and initiated a fleet-wide inspection of fuel control switches on its Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner fleet.“Both left and right switches were checked and found satisfactory, with the locking tooth/pawl fully seated and not slipping from RUN to CUTOFF. When full force was applied parallel to the base plate, the switch remained secure. However, applying external force in an indirect direction caused the switch to move easily from RUN to CUTOFF, due to the angular base plate allowing slip when pressed improperly with a finger or thumb,” the DGCA said in a statement, according to ANI.The aviation regulator further stated, citing its communication with the manufacturer Boeing, that the US-based aircraft maker had checked the pull-to-unlock force using the recommended procedure, and in all cases, it was found to be within limits.The DGCA noted that these checks were conducted in the presence of its officers.Meanwhile, according to sources, an issue was identified with a “specific component” of the jet, with the component set to be replaced.“Air India will send the impacted Fuel Control Switch module to the OEM for further checks. The total life of the component in question is 20,000 hours, but the total hours used so far are only 3,440. The component has been used for less than 20% of its total lifespan,” the sources said.As per the DGCA, on February 1, an Air India B787-8 aircraft operating flight AI132 from London to Bengaluru experienced a fuel control switch issue. During engine start in London, the flight crew observed on two occasions that the switch did not remain positively latched in the “RUN” position when light vertical pressure was applied. The switch engaged correctly on the third attempt and remained stable. Before continuing with the rest of the procedure, the crew performed a physical verification to confirm that the switch was fully and positively latched in the “RUN” position.“No abnormality was observed during engine start or anytime thereafter. The operating crew member was briefed on the observation, unnecessary contact with the switch was avoided, and engine indications and alerting systems were closely monitored by the crew for the remainder of the flight, which was completed without any incident,” the statement read.Upon landing in Bengaluru, the matter was referred to Boeing, which recommended checking the serviceability of the fuel control switch, the DGCA added.In June last year, an Air India Boeing 787-8 was involved in a fatal crash in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, marking India’s worst aviation accident in three decades. Flight AI171 crashed shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad for London, hitting a nearby hostel. Of the 12 crew members and 230 passengers on board, only one passenger survived. On the ground, 19 people were killed and 67 others were seriously injured.","The possible defect was flagged by a pilot.

NEW DELHI: Addressing a meeting of the BJP-led NDA parliamentary party on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi termed the India–US trade deal a “big decision” that would “benefit everyone in the country.”The NDA coalition partners congratulated PM Modi on the trade agreements with the European Union, signed on January 27, and the United States, announced by President Donald Trump on Monday, saying the deals would boost Indian manufacturers, exporters, and entrepreneurs.Briefing the media on the prime minister’s remarks, Union minister Kiren Rijiju said PM Modi told the ruling coalition that its electoral successes were driven by “people-friendly policies” and ""sustained hard work.""Quoting PM Modi, Rijiju noted that the NDA was “winning one after another elections due to its good work. Elections can’t be won without being on the ground. We have to be on the ground and do good work for the welfare of the people.”He added that the prime minister also urged the NDA MPs not to get “complacent” after victories in various polls, including local body elections, but to continue with the good work.Rijiju further stated that the PM gave “broad guidelines” to the NDA MPs in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to carry forward their parliamentary responsibilities and welfare work.MPs from the BJP, TDP, JD(U), LJP (R), Shiv Sena, JD(S), and other constituents of the alliance were present at the meeting.India and the United States have agreed to a trade deal under which Washington will reduce the reciprocal tariff on Indian goods to 18% from a total of 50%.The deal was announced following a telephonic conversation between PM Modi and President Trump, after which the US leader took to his Truth Social platform to declare that the agreement would take effect “immediately.”While the finer details are yet to be disclosed, Trump noted that Washington would levy a reduced reciprocal tariff, cutting it from 25% to 18%. New Delhi, he added, would bring down its tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the United States to zero.He further claimed that India has committed not to buy oil from Russia - half of the 50% tariffs on India were because of its purchase of Russian oil.Trump also claimed that India would now buy “much more oil” from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela — a Latin American nation where US forces carried out a military operation on January 3 that resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.",Nda mps felicitate pm modi for india-us trade deal at parliamentary party meeting.

'PM Modi Under Pressure From Trump': Rahul Gandhi Claims As Trade Deal Debate Paralyses Lok Sabha

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday intensified his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , linking the India–US trade deal to what he called “two pressure points”.He alleged that the Prime Minister was “under pressure” because of cases involving industrialist Gautam Adani and the release of material related to Jeffrey Epstein.“There's a case against (Gautam) Adani in US courts. They are not targeting Adani, they are targeting PM Modi's financial structure. The second thing is there is still a lot to be revealed from the Epstein files which the nation wants to know. The US has not released it till now and there is pressure on PM Modi over this. The case on Adani is like a case on PM Modi because he is the financial structure behind PM Modi and the BJP. So these are two pressure points,” he said.Earlier, the ministry of external affairs had rejected any references made to PM Modi in the files, with spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal saying references beyond the Prime Minister’s 2017 Israel visit were “trashy ruminations of a convicted criminal”.Rahul further accused PM Modi of “being compromised” and “selling the country” through the India–US trade deal. Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Rahul Gandhi said, “Modi ji is rattled.The (US–India) trade deal, which was stalled for the past few months, was signed by Narendra Modi last night. There is extreme pressure on him. Narendra Modi ji’s image can get damaged. The main thing is that our PM is compromised. The public needs to think about this. For the first time, the LoP was not allowed to speak on the President’s speech.”“Narendra Modi ji has sold your hard work in this trade deal because he is compromised. He has sold the country. Narendra Modi ji is scared because those who shaped his image are now breaking this image,” he added.This followed the India–US trade agreement that reduced tariffs on Indian exports to 18 per cent from 25%. Congress has demanded full details of the deal, questioning claims about opening up the agriculture sector, calls for tariffs to be reduced to “zero”, and a pause on the purchase of Russian oil, as claimed by US President Donald Trump.",Congress mp and leader of opposition rahul gandhi intensified his attack on prime minister narendra modi.

Air India Grounds Dreamliner After Pilot Flags Fuel Control Switch Issue in London-Bengaluru Flight

NEW DELHI: Air India has launched a fleet-wide inspection of fuel control switches on its Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft after a malfunction was reported on a flight from London Heathrow to Bengaluru.The move follows an incident earlier this week in which a pilot flagged a defect in the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 aircraft after landing in Bengaluru. The aircraft, which operated the London–Bengaluru flight, was immediately grounded for detailed checks.Confirming the action, Air India’s senior vice president for flight operations, Manish Uppal, informed Boeing 787 pilots that the airline had initiated a precautionary re-inspection of the entire Dreamliner fleet.“Following the reported defect involving a fuel control switch on one of the B787 aircraft, our engineering team has escalated the matter to Boeing for priority evaluation,” Uppal said in an internal communication, PTI quoted sources.“In the interim, while we await Boeing’s response, our engineers — out of an abundance of caution — have initiated precautionary fleet-wide re-inspection of the Fuel Control Switch (FCS) latch to verify normal operations,” he added.Uppal further informed pilots that no adverse findings had been reported so far on the aircraft that have already undergone re-inspection.He also directed crew members to promptly report any defects noticed during operations and to ensure that all mandatory checks are completed before accepting an aircraft for service.At present, Air India operates 33 Boeing 787 aircraft. These include 26 Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners from the legacy Air India fleet and seven Boeing 787-9 aircraft, of which six were inducted from Vistara and one is a custom-made plane added to the fleet in January this year.The latest inspections come amid heightened scrutiny of the aircraft’s fuel control system. The functioning of the fuel control switch has been under focus since a fatal crash involving a Boeing 787-8 last June, in which 260 people lost their lives. The preliminary investigation report into that accident had pointed to a possible fuel supply cutoff soon after take-off.Air India had carried out similar inspections last year following the tragic crash.The airline has now assured that all necessary precautions are being taken and that the issue has been escalated to Boeing for further technical evaluation.",Air india has launched a fleet-wide inspection of fuel control switches on its boeing 787 dreamliner aircraft.
