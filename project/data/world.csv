NEW DELHI: Pakistani forces on Monday night breached ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir for the fifth consecutive night, with Indian forces responding in a ""measured and effective"" manner.The exchange of fire occurred amidst heightened tensions between both nations following the recent terrorist incident in Pahalgam, affecting areas opposite Kupwara and Baramulla districts, alongside the Akhnoor sector.""During the night of April 28-29, the Pakistan Army resorted to unprovoked small arms firing across the Line of Control in areas opposite Kupwara and Baramulla districts, as well as the Akhnoor sector.

'Rogue state fuelling global terrorism': India blasts Pakistan at UN over Pahalgam attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rogue-state-fuelling-global-terrorism-india-blasts-pakistan-at-un-over-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/120713371.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Monday hit out at Pakistan at the United Nations, highlighting Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif's ""open confession"" about his country's role in supporting and training terrorists.Speaking at the UN, India's Deputy Permanent Representative Yojna Patel condemned Pakistan for misusing the international platform to spread propaganda and make unfounded allegations against India. She specifically referenced Asif's televised confession about Pakistan's history of terrorist support.""It is unfortunate that one particular delegation has chosen to misuse and undermine this forum. To indulge in propaganda and make baseless allegations against India. The whole world has heard Pakistan's Defence Minister, Khwaja Asif, admitting and confessing Pakistan's history of supporting, training and funding terrorist organizations in a recent television interview,"" Patel said.""This open confession surprises no one and exposes Pakistan as a rogue state, fueling global terrorism and destabilizing the region. The world can no longer turn a blind eye,"" she added.Also read: Pahalgam massacre: Pakistani terrorist former para commando, says probe Patel highlighted India's status as a victim of cross-border terrorism , noting that the recent Pahalgam attack resulted in the highest civilian casualties since the 2008 Mumbai attacks . She also expressed gratitude for the international community's solidarity and support following the Pahalgam incident, which claimed 26 lives.""India deeply appreciates and values the strong unequivocal support and solidarity extended by leaders and governments across the world in wake of the recent terrorist attack at Pahalgam Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. This is a testimony to the international community's zero tolerance for terrorism. The Pahalgam terrorist attack represents the largest number of civilian casualties since the horrific 2611 Mumbai attacks in 2008,"" Patel said.""Having been a victim of cross border terrorism for decades, India fully understands the long lasting impact such acts have on victims, their families and society. As the UN Security Council in its statement has said, perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of reprehensible acts of terrorism must be held accountable and brought to justice,"" she added.This comes days after Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif admitted on Sky News that Pakistan harbours and funds terror organisations, saying that it has been “doing the West’s dirty work for decades”. He also said the Pakistan-based terror groups are “not multiple organisations” but “one single organisation religiously organised with different faces”.He said terror groups in Pakistan were “used as proxies by the USA”, and earlier the same terror groups had been treated like VIPs in Washington. “When we were fighting the war on their side in the ’80s against the Soviet Union, all these terrorists of today, they were wining and dining in Washington. Then came 9/11. Again the same situation was created. I think our government then made a mistake.Asif also said that his country would respond “in kind” to any attack by nuclear rival New Delhi in retaliation for Pahalgam and called on US President Donald Trump to “bring sanity to the situation”.After the Pahalgam attack claiming 26 lives, the government implemented several diplomatic responses, including shutting down the Attari ICP, cancelling the SVES for Pakistani nationals with a 40-hour departure notice, and reducing diplomatic staff at both High Commissions.","India's deputy permanent representative yojna patel condemned pakistan for misusing the international platform.

Washington in touch with both sides to defuse tension



NEW DELHI: Amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terrorist attack , the United States said it remains in touch with both countries at multiple levels and urged them to work towards a ""responsible solution"". The state department also said the US stands with India and strongly condemns the terrorist attack in J&K's Pahalgam.Both US President Donald Trump and Vice President J D Vance had spoken to PM Modi last week to condemn the April 22 attack and to express support for India's efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice.This is an evolving situation and we are monitoring developments closely. We have been in touch with govts of India and Pakistan at multiple levels. The US encourages all parties to work together towards a responsible resolution,"" a state department spokesperson told Reuters in Washington.Washington has remained in touch with both sides to defuse the situation but without publicly saying it's mediating. In fact, Trump said on Saturday that he's close to both India and Pakistan and ""they'll get it figured out one way or the other"". In talks with Modi a day after the attack, Trump strongly condemned the terror attack and ""expressed full support to India to bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous attack"". The US, however, has so far not explicitly criticised Pakistan for the attack or called upon Islamabad to bring the perpetrators to justice.The state department's remarks came shortly after Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi spoke to his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar and supported Pakistan's sovereignty and its ""legitimate"" security interests.",The state department also said the us stands with india and strongly condemns the terrorist attack in j&k's pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: For the Congress , it is perhaps an unfortunate sense of deja vu. The grand old party has once again been pushed to the backfoot with some motormouths making insensitive and unwarranted statements on the Pakistan-backed Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 innocent civilians.While the Congress leadership has been trying to make that delicate balance between support to the government in the fight against terror and simultaneously questioning any of its attempts to gain political mileage, irresponsible remarks by some have forced the party to distance itself from these leaders.On Monday, the Congress distanced itself from the controversial comments of some of its leaders on the Pahalgam terror attack, saying that only the recent CWC resolution and the views expressed by AICC chief Mallikarjun Kharge Rahul Gandhi and authorised AICC office-bearers represent its position.""Some Congress leaders have been speaking to the media. They speak for themselves and do not reflect the Congress' views,"" Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.""There should be absolutely no doubt whatsoever at this most sensitive of times that the CWC resolution, the views expressed by Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi and the views of authorised AICC office-bearers ALONE represent the position of the Congress (sic),"" Ramesh said.So, why was the Congress forced to issue such a statement? Here is what some of the party leaders said on the Pahalgam attack :""We are being told that terrorists ascertained religion and then killed people. Do terrorists even have so much time to go close to someone and whisper in ears? It is highly controversial, because some are claiming such things did happen while others are denying it. Do not plan anything around it. Terrorists do not have caste or religion.""""Is that the unresolved questions of the Partition reflected in the terrible tragedy... in Pahalgam on April 22? He further questioned whether Muslims in India today feel “accepted, cherished and celebrated,” noting that differences in value systems among leaders like Gandhi, Nehru, Jinnah, and others had led to Partition.""Obviously, there was no full proof intelligence. There was some failure... But we have got the example of Israel, the world's best intelligence services according to everybody, which were taken by surprise on October 7, just two years ago. It seems to me, just as Israel is waiting till the end of the war before they demand accountability, similarly, I think we too should see the present crisis through and then demand accountability from the government. No country can ever have a foolproof 100 per cent intelligence.""""What happened in Pahalgam was tragic and unacceptable. Every Indian should adopt the line that the Prime Minister has adopted. If Pakistan says it is not involved, let us accept that argument for now and rely on our investigating agencies, who will know better. India and Pakistan are two neighbours; the neighbourhood cannot be changed, whatever you do. Ultimately, what will prevail between India and Pakistan is dialogue. Dialogue and discussion. No military solution, no arms, no sword. Nothing will work except word of mouth, that is dialogue.""One can look at some of these statements and know why the grand old party was forced to firefight once again. The BJP was quick to allege that some from the opposition party were speaking ""Pakistan's language"".The BJP questioned Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and party leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday over the comments of several of their colleagues, some of whom have questioned the need for a war with Pakistan and the Pahalgam terror attack victims' account that the terrorists had marked out non-Muslims, asking if their call for national unity was merely a formality.""Do Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge have no control over their party? Or both of them made pro-forma comments while letting others the freedom to speak as they wished?"" BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad asked, adding that the remarks of the opposition leaders are being used in Pakistan, including by its media, to defame India. Has any warning been given to these Congress leaders or have they been asked to apologise, Prasad asked of the opposition party's leadership.Ironically, it was businessman Robert Vadra, who is the husband of Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi, who had made the first discordant remark by linking the Pahalgam terror attack to BJP government's Hindutva push. Vadra on Monday clarified his remarks and stated that his intentions were ""misinterpreted"", further stating that it was his responsibility to clarify them.Taking to Facebook, he wrote in a post ""Because my intentions have been misinterpreted, I understand it is my responsibility to clarify them. I am committed to clarifying myself with honesty, transparency, and respect. I decided to wait in silence for a few days, but this should not be construed as silence, indifference or lack of patriotism. In fact, it is because of my deep love for my country, my deep respect for truth and my commitment to dedication that I took the time to reflect before speaking.""Since 2014, when Mani Shankar Aiyar put the party on the back foot with his derogatory remarks against the BJP’s then prime ministerial candidate, to today, when some Congress leaders continue to embarrass the party with their comments, not much has changed for the grand old party. What is more worrying is the lack of action against habitual offenders.","The congress has distanced itself from the controversial comments of some of its leaders on the pahalgam terror attack. The bjp was quick to allege that some from the opposition party were speaking ""pakistan's language"" has any warning been given to these congress leaders or have they been asked to apologise, prasad asked of the opposition party's leadership.ironically, it was businessman robert vadra, who is the husband of congress mp priyanka gandhi, who had made the first discordant remark.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120704828,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-41446,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI Ceasefire along the Line of Control with Pakistan continues to fray, with the exchange of fire between the rival armies for the first time spreading from Kashmir to the Jammu region as well in the aftermath of the Pahalgam massacre .The operational situation, however, has not yet escalated to the deadly artillery duels that were regular before the fresh ""understanding"" reached between the Indian and Pakistani director-generals of military operations in Feb 2021 to maintain peace and tranquility along the 778-km LoC.Defence minister Rajnath Singh met PM Modi Monday morning to discuss the overall situation, as govt contemplates military action in the shape of limited punitive strikes against Pakistan.As the gun duels, with assault rifles and light machine guns continued along the LoC for the fourth consecutive night, Indian Army said that Pakistan Army had initiated ""unprovoked"" small arms fire across LoC at its posts in Kupwara and Poonch districts, among other places.""Firing till now was taking place in Kashmir region like Tutmari Gali, Rampur, Uri, Gurez & Sunderbani sectors. But now, it has taken place in Poonch in Jammu region as well,"" a senior officer said.The Army has recorded at least a dozen ""clear-cut"" ceasefire violations (CFVs) by the Pakistan Army in the last four days, all of which have been responded to ""in double measure"". A CFV is generally said to occur when over 25 rounds of small arms fire are witnessed in one particular place.Any use of heavy-caliber weapons like 155mm artillery guns or 120mm mortars, of course, constitutes a violation. ""There was just one CFV in 2022, zero in 2023 and two in 2024,"" another officer said.Before Feb 2021, India often used targeted artillery and heavy-mortar fire on Pakistan Army posts and bunkers to impose costs for actively aiding and abetting infiltration of terrorists from launch pads into J&K, often by giving ""covering fire"".""The Army has the capability to conduct strikes against terror launch pads, camps and staging areas along the LoC. The military pressure on Pakistan Army can certainly be enhanced with concentrated artillery barrages as well as sniping operations to disrupt their patrols. Then, there are shallow cross-border raids that can be conducted,"" another officer said.","The indian army has recorded at least a dozen ""clear-cut"" ceasefire violations (cfvs) by the pakistan army in the last four days.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif on Monday said that India's ""incursion was imminent"" in the wake of the bloody Pahalgam terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir that took 26 lives, mostly tourists.In an interview with the news agency Reuters, Asif said: ""We have reinforced our forces because it is something which is imminent now. So in that situation some strategic decisions have to be taken, so those decisions have been taken.""The Pakistani defence minister said that Islamabad was on ""high alert and that it would only use its arsenal of nuclear weapons if there is a direct threat to our existence"".Asif's remark comes at a time when the central government prepares for decisive action against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism that has threatened peace in the region of Jammu and Kashmir.Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, the Prime Minister’s official residence.The meeting happened a day after Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) general Anil Chauhan briefed the defence minister on key decisions taken to counter terrorism.This discussion followed an all-party meeting held three days earlier in the Parliament premises, which Singh chaired, to address the security situation after the attack.The Pahalgam attack, which occurred on April 22, left 26 people — mostly tourists, including one Nepalese national — brutally gunned down at Baisaran meadow around 2 pm.It was one of the deadliest assaults in the region since the 2019 Pulwama attack, which claimed the lives of 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel.Also, the teams from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have been stationed at the attack site since April 23, intensifying efforts to gather evidence. Meanwhile, the Indian Army has launched multiple search operations and remains on high alert to neutralise the terrorists responsible.On April 23, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) convened to review the situation. In its meeting, the CCS strongly condemned the attack, expressed condolences to the families of the victims, and wished a speedy recovery to those injured.Nationwide protests have erupted, demanding strong action against Pakistan for its role in supporting terrorism.On April 23, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) convened to review the situation. In a detailed briefing, the CCS condemned the attack, offered condolences to the victims' families, and highlighted the incident’s apparent cross-border links, especially against the backdrop of Jammu and Kashmir’s recent peaceful elections and economic progress.","Pakistan defence minister khawaja asif said that india's ""incursion was imminent"" in the wake of the bloody pahalgam terrorist attack in jammu and kashmir that took 26 lives, mostly tourists.

NEW DELHI: India will get its first Rafale-Marine jet in mid-2028 and all 26 by 2030 under the mega Rs 63,887 crore (almost Euro 7 billion) deal inked with France on Monday for the omni-role fighters that will primarily operate from indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant’s deck.The delivery of nine Rafale-M jets with their decidedly deadly weapons package in 2028, 12 in 2029 and 5 in 2030 will bolster Indian aircraft carrier operations in the Indian Ocean and beyond at a time when China ’s ever-expanding naval forays and hunt for logistical bases in the region have become a clear and present threat, officials told TOI.“The Rafale-M is a carrier-borne combat-ready aircraft with proven operational capabilities. It will be a potent force multiplier, substantially boosting India’s air power at sea,” an official said.These omni-role 4.5-generation maritime strike and reconnaissance jets will add to the 36 Rafales, which are also capable of delivering nuclear weapons, already inducted by the IAF under the Rs 59,000 crore contract inked in Sept 2016. They are deployed at the Ambala and Hasimara airbases to cater for the Pakistan and China fronts.The two major Rafale deals make the French fighter the frontrunner in the long-pending project to manufacture 114 multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration in India, which was initially estimated to cost Rs 1.25 lakh crore and is now being fast-tracked, as reported by TOI earlier.Apart from the inter-governmental agreement (IGA) on the Rafale-M jets, inked remotely by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart Sébastien Lecornu, the aircraft supply protocol with fighter-manufacturer Dassault Aviation and weapons protocol with missile-maker MBDA were also signed here.The exchange of documents took place in the presence of defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, Navy vice chief Vice Admiral Krishna Swaminathan and French ambassador Thierry Mathou, among others.The direct acquisition of 22 single-seater Rafale-M jets and four twin-seater trainers includes training for Indian pilots and technicians, a simulator, associated equipment, weapons and five-year performance-based logistics. It also includes additional equipment for the existing 36 Rafales of the IAF.The Rafale-M jets will be armed with long-range precision strike weapons like the IAF fighters. In addition to the 70-km range Exocet AM39 anti-ship missiles, they will have the over 300-km range `Scalp’ air-to-ground cruise missiles and the top-notch Meteor air-to-air missiles, which have a strike range of 120 to 150-km to take on enemy jets.While there is no overall transfer of technology in the deal, the IGA includes the integration of indigenous weapons like the Astra air-to-air missiles and the naval short and medium-range anti-ship missiles (NASMs) being developed by DRDO with the Rafale-M fighters in the future.It also includes setting up of a production facility for aircraft fuselage as well as MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) facilities for engines, sensors and weapons in India. “The Rafale-M’s procurement will substantially enhance joint operational capability, besides optimizing training and logistics for both Navy and IAF,” the official said.The Navy currently has only 40 of the 45 MiG-29K jets, inducted from Russia at a cost of $2 billion from 2009 onwards, to operate from the decks of its two over 40,000-tonne aircraft carriers, the older Russian-origin INS Vikramaditya and the new indigenous INS Vikrant. Moreover, the MiG-29Ks have also been dogged by poor serviceability and other problems over the years.China, incidentally, already has three aircraft carriers, the 60,000-tonne Liaoning, the 66,000-tonne Shandong and the over 80,000-tonne Fujian, and is fast building more such warships with nuclear-propulsion.","India will get its first rafale-marine jet in mid-2028 and all 26 by 2030 under the mega rs 63,887 crore (almost euro 7 billion) deal inked with france on monday.

NEW DELHI: Amid growing signs of an imminent retaliation against Pakistan over the Pahalgam terror attack , Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.“It is now your duty to strengthen the nation’s economy; it is your duty to strengthen the country’s internal security; it is your duty to develop modern infrastructure; and it is your duty to bring about fundamental improvements in the lives of workers,” he said on Saturday while distributing employment letters to little over 51,000 new recruits at a virtual event.The exhortation came days after the PM publicly declared his determination to avenge the terror attack by “tracking and pursuing” the perpetrators and the masterminds of the plot until the “end of earth” to hand them a punishment they could not have imagined. It was being seen as an attempt to rally people for any eventuality.The PM said he was confident of the new recruits discharging their responsibilities with utmost devotion.In his address, Modi said govt is taking several steps to create new opportunities for employment and self-employment. He added that it’s time for unprecedented opportunities for youngsters while mentioning that the International Monetary Fund has said India will remain the fastest-growing major economy.The PM said in recent times, the production and exports have achieved new milestones, particularly in the automobile and footwear industries, sectors that provide substantial employment to young people. Highlighting the achievement in transportation of cargo through inland waterways, Modi said goods transport through inland water transport has surged to 145 million tonnes (MTs) from 18 MTs before 2014.On women taking the lead in every field, Modi cited the recent UPSC results where the top two positions were secured by female candidates, and three out of the top five toppers were women. “Women are reaching new heights in fields ranging from bureaucracy to space and science. Our govt is focused on empowering rural women through initiatives like self-help groups, Bima Sakhis, Bank Sakhis, and Krishi Sakhis, which have created new opportunities,” he said.Earlier, personnel minister Jitendra Singh said that nearly 28% of the new recruits (14,796) are women.","Pm modi highlights manufacturing mission, youth opportunities during rozgar mela.

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday lashed out at Pakistani leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari , who had threatened that ""blood would flow"" in the Sindhu river if India stopped water under the suspended Indus Waters Treaty Reminding Zardari of the repercussions of terrorism, Owaisi asked: ""Who killed your mother?""""He is new to politics. He should first think about who killed his mother. His mother was killed by homegrown terrorism. If he cannot understand that, how can anyone reason with him? If terrorism killed his mother, then the attacks that took the lives of our mothers and daughters are also terrorism. He needs to understand this,"" said the Hyderabad Lok Sabha MP.Benazir Bhutto, former Prime Minister of Pakistan, was assassinated on December 27, 2007, after addressing a rally in Rawalpindi. As she was leaving the venue, a gunman fired at her and then detonated a suicide bomb, fatally injuring Bhutto.While the Pakistani government blamed the Pakistani Taliban and militant leader Baitullah Mehsud for the attack, serious suspicions have persisted about the involvement of elements within Pakistan’s military and intelligence services, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Zardari, who is a former Pakistani foreign minister, threatened India days after New Delhi formally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, following the deadly terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam that killed 26 people, mostly tourists.""India has accused Pakistan of the Pahalgam incident, with Modi making false allegations to conceal his own weaknesses and deceive his people. He has unilaterally decided to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, under which India had acknowledged that the Indus belongs to Pakistan. Standing here in Sukkur by the Indus, I want to tell India that the Indus is ours and will remain ours. Either water will flow in this Indus, or their blood will,"" Bhutto, speaking in Sukkur alongside the Indus River, had said.Before Owaisi, Union minister Hardeep Puri had flayed Bhutto, saying the PPP chief needs to get his ""mental condition checked"".“Enough is enough,” Mr. Puri said, warning that India’s patience has worn thin.“Tell him to get his mental condition checked, what kind of statements he is giving... We will no longer tolerate this. Now wait for a few days,” Mr. Puri said, while speaking to news agency ANI.Union minister for commerce Piyush Goyal also slammed Bhutto and expressed confidence that many Pakistani nationals would not even agree with the ex-Pakistan foreign minister's views.""Pakistan is a despondent country and they don’t have any priority apart from spreading terror. It is unfortunate for the world that there is a presence of such politicians in it. I condemn this and I am sure Pakistani nationals also don’t agree with such statements,” Goyal said.","Bilawal bhutto zardari had threatened that ""blood would flow"" in the sindhu river if india stopped water under the suspended indus waters treaty.

""We should never allow bilateral relations to be defined by the boundary question or specific differences to affect the overall picture of our bilateral ties. China believes that as the largest neighbours, both countries should be partners in each other's success,"" he said.India and China completed the difficult disengagement process in Depsang and Demchok in Eastern Ladakh, effectively ending the 54-month-long military standoff in the region and marking a significant step toward normalizing bilateral relations.Meanwhile, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken over the investigation into the terror attack, intensifying its efforts to collect evidence and question eyewitnesses to unravel the conspiracy.

‘Turkey With Terroristan’: After Arms Aid, Ankara’s ‘Red Line’ Threat To India; ‘Pak Is Our Outpost’

NEW DELHI: India and France on Monday signed a mega Rs 63,000 crore deal to buy 26 Rafale Marine aircraft for the Indian Navy . During the agreement, the Indian side was represented by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, where Navy vice chief admiral K Swaminathan was present.The deal, which comes amid the heightened tension between India and Pakistan, was cleared by the PM Modi-led cabinet committee on security earlier this month. The jets will primarily operate from the deck of the indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant The government-to-government contract for the 22 single-seat Rafale-M jets and four twin-seat trainers includes some weapons, simulators, crew training and five-year performance-based logistics support.The 26 Rafale-M fighters, designed for maritime strike, air defence and reconnaissance missions, will be delivered in 37 to 65 months, which will involve India paying an initial 15% instalment of the total cost of the deal.“The new IGA mirrors the one inked in the IAF deal. All the 26 jets are to be delivered by 2031,” an official had told TOI.The omni-role 4.5-generation Rafales, incidentally, are also capable of delivering nuclear weapons. In addition to the 70-km range Exocet AM39 anti-ship missiles, the Rafale-M jets will be armed with long-range precision strike weapons like the IAF variant.They include the over 300-km range 'Scalp' air-to-ground cruise missiles and the top-notch Meteor air-to-air missiles, which have a strike range of 120 to 150-km to take on enemy jets.The Rafale-M had emerged as the frontrunner over the American F/A-18 Super Hornet after extensive trials conducted by the Navy in 2022. The French fighter, in any case, had a head start on logistical, commonality of spares and maintenance after the IAF inducted its 36 Rafales.The Navy currently has only 40 of the 45 MiG-29K jets, inducted from Russia at a cost of $2 billion from 2009 onwards, to operate from the decks of its two over 40,000-tonne aircraft carriers, the older Russian-origin INS Vikramaditya and the new indigenous INS Vikrant.Moreover, the MiG-29Ks have also been dogged by poor serviceability and other problems over the years. With the indigenous twin-engine deck-based fighter (TEDBF) likely to take at least a decade to become operational, the Navy had pushed for the 26 Rafale-M jets as an interim measure.","India and france on monday signed a mega rs 63,000 crore deal to buy 26 rafale marine aircraft for the indian navy.

NEW DELHI: Hashim Musa , a Pakistani terrorist identified behind the Pahalgam massacre , is a former para commando of Pakistan army's special forces, investigations into the terror conspiracy have confirmed.Sources told TOI that Musa, now a hardcore terrorist working with Pakistan-based LeT , was sent by outfit masterminds to J&K to unleash terror attacks on non-locals as well as security forces.""It is possible that he was loaned by Pakistan special forces, like Special Service Group ( SSG ), to LeT,"" an officer of the security establishment here said in what further underlines the nexus between jihadi outfits and Pakistan's state actors.Para-commandos of the Pakistani special force, SSG, are highly-trained in unconventional warfare and specialise in covert operations. The intensive and rigorous training regimen focuses on physical conditioning and mental fitness, besides strategic thinking. SSG commandos are adept at handling sophisticated weapons as well as in hand-to-hand combat, and have high navigation and survival skills.A senior officer said Musa's army background - confirmed during the questioning of 15 Kashmiri overground workers (OGWs) who have emerged as key suspects in the Pahalgam attack probe for facilitating the Pakistani assailants by arranging logistics and helping in reconnaissance - is being seen as evidence of ISI's role in the Pahalgam terror attack, as also in earlier strikes in Kashmir.The latter include Oct 2024 terror attacks at Gagangir, Ganderbal, in which six non-locals and a doctor were killed, and at Buta Pathri, Baramulla, which left two army personnel & two army porters dead.Musa has emerged as the common perpetrator in all three attacks.

'India ready to restart work on Afghan projects, invest in infra'



NEW DELHI: As it looks to mobilise international opinion against Pakistan's support to cross-border terrorism, the govt briefed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan about the common neighbour's links with the April 22 Pahalgam attack . Sources said Taliban's acting foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi strongly condemned the attack and underscored the need to punish the perpetrators.Muttaqi met an Indian delegation headed by MEA joint secretary Anand Prakash. The visit came amid soaring India-Pakistan tensions over the Pahalgam attack.India's ties with the Taliban dispensation in Kabul have improved dramatically in the recent past, contrary to the fear in Aug 2021 - after the Taliban took over Kabul - that the armed militia would act as a proxy govt run by the ISI.Pakistan's ties have seen a steady deterioration, mainly because of the activities of Pakistan Taliban (TTP).The Taliban, in fact, had categorically condemned the Pahalgam attack last week too, saying such incidents undermined efforts to ensure regional security and stability. Given the current circumstances, Afghanistan is unlikely to allow Pakistan the ""strategic depth"" it has always sought in the country in the event of a military conflict with India.Prakash was in Kabul on Sunday to review progress in bilateral ties and was reported to have conveyed to Muttaqi that India was ready to restart work on its projects in the country and also invest in other infrastructure projects. The Taliban have on several occasions in the past few years assured Indian officials of enough security to allow them to work fearlessly in the country.As per Kabul, the two sides discussed bilateral political relations, trade, transit and recent regional political developments and Muttaqi again underlined the need for normal issuance of Indian visas to Afghan businessmen, patients and students.Muttaqi emphasised the expansion of diplomatic and economic relations between Afghanistan and India and stated that there were currently good opportunities for investment in Afghanistan. He encouraged Indian investors to take advantage of these opportunities and invest in the country, according to an Afghan readout, while seeking facilitation of movement of people between Afghanistan and India.Prakash, according to Afghanistan, said India valued its relations with Afghanistan and hoped to further expand ties in various areas.""He mentioned that India will continue its cooperation with Afghanistan and wishes to invest in some infrastructure projects, as well as resume work on some projects that have been stalled for some time,"" the readout said.Both sides stressed on expanding relations, facilitating exchange of delegation.",Taliban's acting foreign minister mawlawi amir khan muttaqi strongly condemned the attack and underscored the need to punish the perpetrators.muttaqi met an indian delegation headed by mea joint secretary anand prakash.

Taliban Wants To Help India Fight Pakistan? Stunning Move After Islamabad 'Runs To' China | Pahalgam

NEW DELHI: India is the fifth-largest military spender globally, spending almost nine times more than Pakistan. But it also has to contend with China, another nuclear-armed neighbour which spends almost four times more.With the global military expenditure registering the steepest year-on-year increase since the end of the Cold War to reach a record $2,718 billion due to ongoing conflicts and geopolitical turmoil, India is ranked after the US, China, Russia and Germany.The global military expenditure increased by 9.4% in real terms in 2024, with the top five spenders accounting for 60% of the total with a combined spending of $1,635 billion, as per the latest data released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday.The report comes at a time when the ceasefire along the Line of Control with Pakistan has frayed after the Pahalgam terror massacre, while China continues with its forward deployment of over 100,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control though disengagement has taken place in eastern Ladakh.""India is probably the only country with two active and long unresolved borders with nuclear-armed neighbours. We must cater for both,"" a senior Indian military officer told TOI.SIPRI said the 10 largest military spenders are US ($997 billion), China ($314 billion), Russia ($149 billion), Germany ($88 billion), India ($86 billion), UK ($82 billion), Saudi Arabia ($80 billion), Ukraine ($65 billion), France ($65 billion) and Japan ($55 billion). Pakistan was placed at the 29th spot with $10bn.India may be a big military spender but somewhat flounders in getting the biggest bang for its buck despite the two-front challenge. Just around 22% of the Rs 6.8 lakh crore ($80 billion) annual defence budget for 2025-26, for instance, is earmarked for capital procurements of new weapon systems and platforms. The rest is gobbled up by salaries and day-to-day operational costs for the 1.4-million-strong armed forces as well as the huge pension bill for over 3.4 million ex-servicemen and defence civilians.India spends just 1.9% of its GDP on defence when at least 2.5% is needed to effectively deal with the collusive threat from China and Pakistan. Apart from the relatively weak defence-industrial base, which makes India the second largest arms importer in the world, another major problem is the relative absence of concrete long-term plans to systematically build military capabilities in tune with the country's geopolitical aspirations.Consequently, the armed forces continue to grapple with major operational shortages on several fronts, ranging from fighters, submarines and helicopters to air defence systems, anti-tank guided missiles and night-fighting capabilities.Also read: 'This time no compromise, Pakistan will be brought to its knees': Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri China is rapidly modernizing its two-million-strong military across the traditional domains of land, air and sea as well as nuclear, space and cyber, recording its 30th consecutive year-on-year hike in its official military budget, which experts say is far less than what it actually spends. Pakistan also is no pushover.""China, the world's second-largest military spender, allocated an estimated $314 billion to its military in 2024, up by 7% from 2023. This was the largest year-on-year percentage increase in China's military spending since 2015,"" SIPRI said.China ""unveiled"" several improved military capabilities in 2024, including new stealth combat aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and uncrewed underwater vehicles. ""China also continued to rapidly expand its nuclear arsenal in 2024 and moved to strengthen certain types of counter-space and cyberwarfare capabilities. It established separate aerospace and cyberspace forces in 2024,"" it added.","India is the fifth-largest military spender globally, spending almost nine times more than pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Security tensions and terror attacks on India have been taking a heavy toll on Pakistani patients desperate for advanced treatment across the border with the issuance of visas crashing from over 1,600 in 2016 to barely over 200 in 2024. It could shudder to a halt altogether after the latest terrorist atrocity.A significant disruption came in 2017 with the clash over Indian citizen Kulbhushan Jadhav , whom Pakistan had convicted as an Indian spy, refusing to release him despite a full-blown diplomatic crisis and India urging his release.The medical visas issued to Pakistani nationals in 2016 were 1,678, but the number fell sharply after the Jadhav episode.However, things got complicated further in 2019 as India was rocked by the Pulwama terror attack which brought the two countries to the brink of an armed confrontation. Between 2019 and 2024, data available with TOI shows, only 1,228 medical visas were issued to Pakistani nationals - 554 in 2019, 97 in 2020, 96 in 2021, 145 in 2022, 111 in 2023 and 225 in 2024.In the wake of fresh escalation in the already fraught relationship following the Pahalgam terror attack , healthcare industry experts say the latest tit-for-tat measures between the two countries may sound the death of medical tourism from Pakistan to India, at least in the foreseeable future. Medical visas issued to Pakistani nationals will be valid only till 29 April 2025, the ministry of external affairs announced last Thursday in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.In the aftermath of sentencing of Jadhav in 2017, govt had announced new rules for issuance of medical visas to Pakistani nations which mandated a recommendation letter from adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, to process genuine and urgent cases.""Patients from Pakistan used to visit India mostly for advanced surgeries such as liver transplant and treatment of birth defects that aren't widely available in their country and would cost a lot in other developed nations such as the US or the UK. But in the last six to seven years, the numbers have reduced drastically and now after the Pahalgam incident it is unlikely to go up anytime soon,"" said an official of a medical travel assistance company.""Until 8-9 years ago, many patients from Pakistan came to us for liver transplantation every month. However, their numbers have dwindled over time. We have transplanted just two patients from there in the past year - the last one seven months ago,"" Dr Arvinder Soin, chairman and chief surgeon, Medanta Institute of Liver Transplantation, said.A source at Fortis healthcare also confirmed that Pakistani nationals visiting their hospitals for treatment has reduced significantly over the years. ""We have only had a few Pakistani embassy officials visiting us for routine health issues recently,"" the source said. Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi said they do not have any Pakistani patient under treatment at the moment.","The medical visas issued to pakistani nationals in 2016 were 1,678, but the number fell sharply after the jadhav episode.
