From CEPA To Space: India And UAE Chart A New Growth Map Together, Trade Pact Expands To FDI

NEW DELHI: The UAE remained the leading travel destination for Indian nationals in 2024, followed by Saudi Arabia, the US, Thailand, Singapore, the UK, Qatar, Canada, Kuwait and Oman. Together, these top 10 countries accounted for approximately 71.1% of all Indian Nationals' Departures (INDs) during the year.The data, part of the India Tourism Data Compendium 2025 released by the ministry of tourism, shows that overall, Indian nationals travelled abroad primarily for leisure and recreational purposes (42.5%), followed closely by visits related to the Indian diaspora (34.6%). Business and professional travel accounted for 14.9% of total departures, while pilgrimage (3.9%), education (2.4%) and other purposes (1.4%) comprised the remaining share.""INDs from India have shown a strong upward trend over the past three decades, rising from 1.9 million in 1991 to 30.8 million in 2024, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7%,"" it is stated in the compendium.While the Covid-19 pandemic caused a decline of nearly 73% in travel in 2020, a strong recovery began as restrictions eased, with departures rising by 152.6% in 2022 and surpassing pre-pandemic levels in 2023, reaching 27.8 million - a 29% year-on-year increase.In 2024, India continued its upward trajectory, recording growth of 10.7% over the previous year.Higher disposable incomes, improved air connectivity and greater exposure to global destinations are among the factors that contributed to Indian nationals travelling abroad in greater numbers.The data on traveller profiles shows that in 2024, Indian nationals travelling abroad were predominantly from the working-age population, with the 25-34 age group accounting for the highest share (27.4%), followed closely by the 35-44 age group (24.5%). As far as gender distribution is concerned, while females accounted for 34.1% of travellers in 2024, males made up the remaining 65.8%.If one looks at the data on destination countries visited by Indian nationals for the years 2019, 2023 and 2024, all three years saw the UAE ranked first. In 2024, approximately 7.8 million Indians travelled to the UAE, accounting for 25.2% of total departures - the figure has seen a steady increase, being 6.3 million in 2019 and 7.2 million in 2023.Saudi Arabia maintained its second position, attracting 3.4 million Indians in 2024, up from 3 million in 2023.The US ranked third across all three years, with 2.1 million departures in 2024. However, its percentage share declined slightly from 7.2% in 2019 and 7.3% in 2023 to 6.9% in 2024, despite growth in absolute numbers. Travel to Thailand, which held fourth position, witnessed revival in 2024 with 1.9 million departures, as against 1.4 million in 2023.","The uae remained the leading travel destination for indian nationals in 2024.

Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country will soon announce some proposals to take in foreign workers for whom the American dream is now too costly because of the $100,000 H-1B visa fee. ""Not as many H1B visa holders will get visas in the US. These people are skilled, and this is an opportunity for Canada... We will soon bring a proposal on this,"" Carney said, adding that these people are enterprising and willing to move for work.In a major overhaul of the employment-based visa system, the Donald Trump administration has imposed a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas which will make it difficult for companies to hire foreign workers, as tech companies will now have to pay this fee if they want to hire foreign workers. The move is aimed at saving jobs for Americans, while it will hurt foreign workers from India and China.Several countries, including Germany and the UK, have seized the opportunity and reached out to Indian talent.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is said to have started exploring proposals to abolish visa fees for top global talent even before Trump's major H-1B move. Starmer has a global talent task force that has been developing ideas to draw the world's best scientists, academics and digital experts to Britain.One option being weighed is a zero-fee system for applicants who have studied at the world’s top five universities or won prestigious prizes.German Ambassador to India, Dr Philipp Ackermann, recently made an open call to highly skilled Indians to work in Germany. ""The average Indian working in Germany earns more than the average German. Because a high salary means Indians are contributing big time to our society and our welfare.

We started by worrying about our supply chain and our sources of production. When we said let's de-risk the world and hedge against uncertainty, it meant having more production centres, more resilient, redundant supply chains. ""He further said: ""We also have to protect ourselves against the uncertainty of market access... Almost the entire economic chain has become far more risky... The central proposition in diplomacy and international relations is how to de-risk, hedge, and become more resilient, safeguarding oneself against unforeseen contingencies, and then build policy and plans around it.It is a huge challenge for the entire world. ""In a veiled but pointed critique of both the United States and China, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday flagged growing trade protectionism, tariff unpredictability, and coercive supply chain practices by major global powers.Addressing the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), he cautioned that such actions were eroding trust in the international system and disproportionately hurting the Global South.While not naming countries directly, Jaishankar’s remarks appeared to take aim at recent moves by Washington and Beijing, calling out what he described as ""trade hypocrisy"" and selective responses to global crises.“We now see tariff volatility and uncertain market access as a result.

NEW DELHI: India’s cheetah reintroduction programme will notch a historic first on Monday when Mukhi, a female cub born at Kuno National Park, becomes the country’s first India-born cheetah to reach adulthood- a crucial milestone in creating a self-sustaining population.“Mukhi, a female cub born to Namibian cheetah Jwala on March 29, 2023, will reach adulthood, as it will turn 915 days or 30 months old, on Monday, ready to contribute to increasing the cheetah population in India,” Project Cheetah director Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI.Her survival is notable. “Of the four cubs Jwala delivered, three died due to extreme heat, but Mukhi survived and has grown well. Today our efforts have yielded encouraging results,” Sharma said.Project Cheetah began on September 17, 2022, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the release of eight Namibian cheetahs into a designated enclosure at Kuno—the world’s first inter-continental relocation of a large wild carnivore. Another 12 cheetahs arrived from South Africa in February 2023.India now hosts 27 cheetahs, of which 16 were born in the country. At Kuno, 26 cubs have been born since the project began, but 19 cheetahs—nine imported adults and 10 India-born cubs—have died so far, leaving 24 animals at Kuno and three at Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.Amid those losses, India today has seven more cheetahs than were initially imported, and Kuno’s cub survival rate stands above 61 per cent, exceeding the global average of 40 per cent.Officials call the progress a “big success” and are negotiating with African nations, including Botswana and Namibia, to bring in 8–10 more cheetahs by December to strengthen the gene pool.","Mukhi, a female cub born at kuno national park, will become the country’s first india-born cheetah to reach adulthood.

Leh Protests: DGP Explains Wangchuk Arrest, Pakistan Connection Under Scanner

Police cite foreign links, wife counters

'Peaceful protest escalated due to CRPF action '

Defence against financial charges

Call for 'mindful development'

NEW DELHI: Jailed climate activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife, Gitanjali Angmo, dismissed allegations of Pakistan links and financial irregularities against him, insisting that he has always advocated in the “most Gandhian way possible. ”Wangchuk, a prominent face of the five-year-long agitation for Ladakh’s statehood and inclusion under the Sixth Schedule, was detained under the National Security Act (NSA) on Friday. His arrest came two days after violent protests in Leh on September 24 left four dead and 90 injured. He has since been lodged in Jodhpur prison in Rajasthan.Speaking to news agency PTI over the phone, Angmo, co-founder of the Himalayan Institute of Alternative Learning (HIAL), said she has not been able to contact her husband since his detention. “They promised to send [the detention order] on Friday. We will take legal recourse,” she said.Ladakh DGP SD Singh Jamwal said Wangchuk is being investigated for alleged links with Pakistan following the arrest of a Pakistani Intelligence Operative last month, who reportedly circulated videos of his protests. The police also flagged Wangchuk’s “suspicious” overseas trips, including a visit to Pakistan to attend an event organised by The Dawn.Angmo, however, said their recent visit across the border was purely professional and focused on climate issues. “We attended a conference organised by the United Nations, and it was on climate change. The glacier on the top of the Himalayas is not going to see whether I'm flowing into Pakistan or India,” she said.She added that the ‘Breathe Pakistan’ conference in February was hosted by the UN Pakistan and Dawn Media, with international participation. “There are organisations like the ICIMOD, which bring together all the eight Hindu Kush countries and work on different issues. We are part of the ICIMOD’s Himalayan University Consortium,” she explained.Angmo also pointed out that Wangchuk had praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the event. “The Nepal and Bangladesh reference being bandied around is actually an example Sonam gave, i.e., ‘when governments are not responsive, it leads to a revolution’. We should avoid the interpretations,” she said.Angmo strongly contested the NSA charges, arguing that Wangchuk has a long track record of peaceful protests. “I think it is a very wrong charge. Sonam certainly is not a threat to any public order,” she said.She insisted that the Leh Apex Body protest was peaceful until security forces intervened. “We have videos to show that the students and the youth were just there for a peaceful protest. Sonam did not even know about (a non-peaceful plan)… But when the CRPF personnel fired tear gas shells, the youth reacted by pelting stones, and the whole situation escalated.”Questioning the force’s response, she asked: “My question is, who gave the CRPF the right to open fire? Why should you open fire on your own people, on your own youth?”On allegations that Wangchuk delivered a provocative speech, she said his words were mistranslated. “He just said that ‘when change has to happen, it can start with one individual, or with the death of one individual and that individual could be me; I'm happy to give my life for it’,” Angmo explained.Angmo also rejected allegations of financial irregularities involving Wangchuk’s institutions, presenting details on HIAL’s funding, UGC registration, and land allotment.She said HIAL did not receive foreign donations without FCRA clearance, clarifying that payments were made for services. “We have the service agreements, which say this is a consulting assignment that we're giving to HIAL for which we will be paying them,” she said.According to her, HIAL, where 400 students study free of cost, covers expenses through innovations such as ice stupas and passive solar buildings, and does not patent its technologies. She added that the institute applied for UGC registration in 2022 and deposited ₹15 lakh, but the process has been stalled.Angmo said the lease for HIAL’s land remains unresolved due to the UT administration’s lack of a category for such institutions. “While questions are being raised on HIAL, the Sindhu Central University, which started in 2021, still doesn't have a building,” she noted.Angmo stressed that her husband is not against development, but supports giving Ladakhis a say in shaping it under the Sixth Schedule. She highlighted HIAL’s proposal to use translucent solar panels in Changtang to both generate electricity and grow fodder for Pashmina goats.“This kind of mindful development is what he’s talking about... HIAL is at the forefront of innovation. It is not that he’s anti-development,” she said.Meanwhile, the Union home ministry has cancelled the FCRA licence of the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL), an organisation founded by Wangchuk, citing alleged financial discrepancies.",Sonam wangchuk was detained under the national security act (nsa) on friday.

Ladakhi Sonam Wangchuk , said to be the inspiration behind the endearing character essayed by Aamir Khan, has since gained a reputation more as a political provocateur than a proponent of philosophical life hacks.Wangchuk, variously described as an innovator, activist and climate warrior, did not stumble into politics overnight.Four months after the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, he released a video thanking PM Narendra Modi for making Ladakh a Union territory, albeit with a veiled warning. ""People here have started asking whether UT status was granted to exploit Ladakh's vast resources, and whether our resources will be exploited the way China does in Tibet,"" Wangchuk said, urging the Centre to safeguard the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.In January 2023, he announced a five-day climate fast at Khardung La, one of the world's highest passes, where winter temperatures plunge to minus 40 degrees Celsius. The administration prevented him from reaching the site, forcing him to pitch tent in Leh instead. The protest, complete with political speeches, music, solidarity gatherings and anti-establishment rap, galvanised Wangchuk's mission.A year later, in October 2024, he ended another 16-day fast only after the Union home ministry agreed to resume talks with Ladakhi organisations.After negotiations stalled, he launched a new 35-day hunger strike on Sept 10 this year, demanding statehood for Ladakh with Sixth Schedule safeguards. ""It's possible that we might die. If we survive, we will return for another hunger strike of six weeks,"" he declared.Last Wednesday, he called off the fast after violent protests erupted across the region, leaving four dead and dozens injured.Born in 1966 in a village near Leh, Wangchuk had been homeschooled until he was nine. In 1975, after his father Sonam Wangyal became a minister in the then J&K govt, the family moved to Srinagar. He later studied engineering at NIT Srinagar and got another degree from CRATerre School of Architecture in Grenoble, France.In 1988, Wangchuk co-founded the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh to reform the education system. He argued that Ladakhi children, struggling with textbooks designed for other regions, were being unfairly labelled poor performers.Wangchuk's activism and political discourse in Ladakh now run parallel. The roots of the present turmoil lie in the 2020 Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council polls, when most political parties called for a poll boycott until Sixth Schedule protection was granted.By 2021, the Leh Apex Body and the Kargil Democratic Alliance emerged, uniting religious and political groups to demand safeguards for Ladakh's indigenous people. Though Wangchuk acted independently, both organisations supported his campaign.","Ladakhi sonam wangchuk has gained a reputation more as a political provocateur than a proponent of philosophical life hacks.

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday dismantled Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s claims on Operation Sindoor and the recent conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Delivering India’s Right of Reply, First Secretary at India’s Permanent Mission accused Pakistan of shielding terrorist outfits and peddling falsehoods while attempting to portray defeat as victory.She reminded the UNGA that during Operation Sindoor, Pakistan’s military had “pleaded” with India for a cessation of hostilities after its airbases were devastated. “If destroyed runways and burnt-out hangars look like victory, as the Prime Minister claimed, Pakistan is welcome to enjoy it,” Gahlot said in a sharp rebuttal.Petal Gahlot, who delivered India’s powerful reply at the UNGA, is a career diplomat with a background in political science, translation, and international affairs.The first secretary also recalled Pakistan’s move at the UN Security Council earlier this year to shield ‘The Resistance Front’ (TRF), the group responsible for killing 26 civilians in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam attack.

Kirk Killing: Candace Owens Accuses FBI Of Faking Evidence; Says Tyler Robinson’s Texts are Fabricated

Candace's earlier theory of Israel, Bill Ackman







Candace Owens has now come up with a new conspiracy theory claiming that she now has sources confirming that Tyler Robinson was framed and he was not the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk. Candace said everything the Feds said about the case so far and about how Tyler Robinson was caught is a lie, including that Tyler Robinson is suicidal.“I want to break this news immediately because it feels important and I think if I don’t break it immediately, something bad might happen,"" Candace said teasing a big reveal on Monday giving a weekend cliffhanger for her viewers.“Tyler Robinson is not suicidal. The entire narrative that was placed in the media about him having been suicidal is completely fictional, as are many other aspects of what we have been told… His father having “turned him in after a confession” is also complete fiction. To the contrary, Tyler Robinson maintains his innocence and has never even been to the UVU campus,” she said.“Which is why they have produced nothing other than a blurry image which Tyler’s family knows is not him,” she continued. “…The federal government is lying about absolutely everything except for the fact that it is her gun…”Candace earlier claimed that Kirk was pressured to visit Israel by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.Candace said Ackman threatened Kirk during a high-stakes ""intervention"" in the Hamptons, weeks before the murder.Ackman called Candace out for defaming him. “For the record, at no time have I ever threatened Charlie Kirk, Turning Point or anyone associated with him,” Ackman said. “I have never blackmailed anyone, let alone Charlie Kirk. I have never offered Charlie or Turning Point any money in an attempt to influence Charlie's opinion on anything. In fact, my interactions with Charlie Kirk have been extremely cordial, albeit limited, regretfully so, as I was very impressed by him and his work and I will sadly never see him again. ”","Candace owens claims tyler robinson did not kill charlie kirk and everything told about robinson and his arrest is a lie. “tyler robinson is not suicidal.
