"Just 3,000 left in wild, IUCN classifies Indian wolf as 'potential distinct species'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/just-3000-left-in-wild-iucn-classifies-indian-wolf-as-potential-distinct-species/articleshow/124514592.cms,"The Indian wolf, commonly known as gray wolf, is found across India and Pakistan

DEHRADUN: In a significant development in animal classification, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has for the first time evaluated the Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) separately, suggesting that it may be classified as a distinct species within the Canis genus - a move that could elevate its global conservation priority.According to IUCN's global panel of canid experts, the Indian wolf population is estimated to be around 3,093 (2,877-3,310) across India and Pakistan, putting it in the ""vulnerable"" category on the Red List. The canid experts noted that the trend of decline in its population is mainly due to habitat loss and persecution.The Indian wolf represents one of the most ancient wolf lineages globally - having evolved in the subcontinent long before humans arrived. Unlike the tiger, which is found in 11 countries, this wolf's range is almost entirely restricted to India, with Pakistan having just about 10 to 20 left.""While tiger numbers are stabilising, the Indian wolf's population continues to decline since it lives largely outside protected areas and is exposed to anthropogenic disturbances and threats. This species urgently needs focused conservation efforts,"" said Bilal Habib, senior scientist at the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII).Commonly known as Gray wolf (Canis lupus), the 'genus' currently has seven species recognised by the IUCN. Ex-dean at WII, YV Jhala, said, ""With the inclusion of the Indian wolf, this will be the eighth recognised species of Canis genus."" The other seven species of Canis genus are Canis lupus (wolf), Canis latrans (coyote), Canis aureus (Golden jackal), Canis simensis (Ethiopian wolf), Canis familiaris (domestic dog), Canis rufus (red wolf) and Canis lupaster (African wolf).The IUCN assessment of Indian wolf reads, ""Analysis indicates that only 12.4% of the Indian wolf's distribution is encompassed within protected areas across India and Pakistan. Most of its population is found outside of designated protected areas, where they are not subject to formal protection or management efforts by governmental bodies. As a result, the majority of the population is directly exposed to anthropogenic disturbances and threats. Given current trends, threats are anticipated to persist and intensify in the coming decade...""On the recent incidents of man-wolf conflicts in UP, Jhala said, ""Removing the problematic ones expediently and professionally wins community support, hence it becomes even more important to conserve the species.""","Iucn has for the first time evaluated the indian wolf (canis lupus pallipes) separately.

'Didn't do for Nobel': Trump repeats tariff claim on India-Pak war; calls Gaza truce his 8th solved conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/didnt-do-for-nobel-trump-repeats-tariff-claim-on-india-pak-war-calls-gaza-truce-his-8th-solved-conflict/articleshow/124514540.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)





US President Donald Trump on Sunday once again reiterated his claim that he has played a key role in resolving several long-standing conflicts worldwide, including the dispute between India and Pakistan, as he flew to the Middle East.Trump also referred to the ongoing conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan, alluding that he would resolve the issue as he is good at “solving war.” He went on to claim that the Gaza ceasefire will be the eighth conflict which he has ended.“This will be my eighth war that I have solved, and I hear there is a war now going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan. I said, I’ll have to wait till I get back. I am doing another one. Because I am good at solving wars,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.“Think about India, Pakistan. Think about some of the wars that were going on for years. We had one going for 31, one going for 32, one going for 37 years, with millions of people being killed in every country, and I got every one of those done, for the most part, within a day. It’s pretty good…,” he added.Trump also spoke about the Nobel Peace prize, stating, “It’s an honour to do it. I saved millions of lives. In all fairness to the Nobel committee, it was for 2024.This was picked for 2024. But there are those who say you could make an exception because a lot of things happened during 2025 that are done and complete and great. But I did not do this for the Nobel. I did this for saving lives.”He further claimed that he resolved some conflicts using economic measures, including trade and tariffs.“I settled a few of the wars just based on tariffs. For example, between India and Pakistan, I said, if you guys want to fight a war and you have nuclear weapons, I am going to put big tariffs on you both, like 100 per cent, 150 per cent, and 200 per cent. I said I am putting tariffs. I had that thing settled in 24 hours. If I didn’t have tariffs, you could have never settled that war,” Trump added.However, New Delhi has consistently rejected the notion that the United States intervened in Operation Sindoor or the resulting ceasefire with Pakistan.Since the ceasefire was announced following Operation Sindoor in May 2025, Trump has repeatedly asserted that he was instrumental in halting the India‑Pakistan conflict - often attributing this to his use of trade and tariffs as leverage.India maintains that the decision to pause hostilities was reached via direct talks between the two sides’ military leadership, without third-party mediation.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has categorically stated in Parliament that no country asked India to halt its counter‑terror operation. The ministry of external affairs has affirmed that trade or tariff negotiations with the US had nothing to do with Operation Sindoor.The conflict was triggered after a dastardly terror attack on April 22 in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives, mostly tourists. Backed by groups believed to be from across the border. In response, on May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor, striking multiple terrorist camps in Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Pakistan.A ceasefire was announced on May 10, after direct dialogue between the directors general of military operations (DGMOs) of both countries, on request of Pakistani DGMO.The remarks come as Trump embarks on a Middle East trip, to mark the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.

NEW DELHI: Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand landed in New Delhi on Sunday evening for a three-day visit aimed at boosting diplomatic and economic ties with India, as part of her broader tour of the Indo-Pacific region that includes Singapore and China.During her stay in the national capital, Anand will meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar and commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal. The meetings, scheduled for Monday, are expected to focus on advancing a framework for strategic cooperation covering trade diversification, energy transformation, and security. She will later travel to Mumbai to meet Indian and Canadian business leaders working to deepen investment and job creation across both economies.Announcing the trip earlier, the Canadian government said the visit was part of efforts to “advance bilateral relations and cooperation” with key Indo-Pacific partners. “For Canada to be strong at home, we need strong, stable partnerships abroad. I am building bridges and increasing cooperation with India, Singapore and China,” Anand said in a statement. “In line with Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy, I will be working to advance efforts to position Canada as a trusted, reliable partner of choice for Indo-Pacific countries and their economies.The ministry of external affairs confirmed Anand’s official schedule, with meetings set at Hyderabad House and Vanijya Bhavan before her departure for Mumbai on Monday evening.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal welcomed Anand on her first official visit to India, describing it as an opportunity to “build on the positive momentum in India-Canada relations by revitalising our bilateral mechanisms, deepening economic cooperation, and further strengthening the enduring people-to-people ties that anchor our partnership.”The visit comes amid cautious efforts by both sides to normalise engagement following a period of strained relations last year. Canada and India share more than 75 years of diplomatic ties, underpinned by strong community and business links. Two-way trade between the countries stood at $33.9 billion in 2024, with Canada’s exports to India totalling $5.3 billion, Ottawa said.Anand will continue her tour with stops in Singapore, marking 60 years of diplomatic relations, and in China, where she will meet foreign minister Wang Yi to mark 55 years of Canada-China diplomatic ties.",Canadian foreign minister anita anand lands in new delhi for three-day visit.

Pak fumes as Taliban back India’s sovereignty over J&K; Muttaqi says Af has options if Pak doesn’t back peace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-fumes-as-taliban-back-indias-sovereignty-over-jk/articleshow/124511439.cms,"Pakistan fumes as Taliban back India’s sovereignty over J&K

NEW DELHI: The Taliban have backed India’s sovereignty over Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) drawing a blistering response from Pakistan over the issue amidst its already tense relationship with Afghanistan that was exacerbated further by heavy border clashes in the past few days. Amidst an outrage in Pakistan, Taliban officials pointed to the fact that India and Taliban backed each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the joint statement issued after external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s meeting with Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.Pakistan sees Afghanistan as opening a new front in the strained relationship by endorsing a mention of J&K in the joint statement as located in India. Pakistan has lodged a formal protest with Afghanistan saying the mention violates UNSC resolutions and legal status of J&K but New Delhi sees the joint statement as underscoring its position that India and Afghanistan are contiguous neighbours because the PoK shares a 106-km long border with Afghanistan.Jaishankar, in fact, reiterated in his remarks in the meeting that as a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in Afghanistan’s development and progress.Islamabad summoned the Afghanistan ambassador to say that the joint statement was highly insensitive. President Asif Ali Zardari accused the Taliban of turning away from the Kashmiri people and doing injustice to ""history as well as Muslim Ummah"".Meanwhile, as the Afghanistan-Pakistan clashes intensified, Muttaqi in a press conference in the Afghan embassy accused “certain elements” in Pakistan of fomenting trouble with Afghanistan and said if Pakistan doesn’t want peace, Afghanistan has other options as well.Denying that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has any presence left in Afghanistan, Muttaqi said the people of Pakistan, a vast majority, are peace-loving and want good relations with Afghanistan. Dozens have been killed in the clashes that erupted while Muttaqi was on Indian soil but the minister said the situation, after Taliban’s retaliation, was now under control.“Afghanistan will safeguard its borders and its national interest, and that is why it immediately retaliated to the escalation from Pakistan. We achieved our military objectives last night, and our friends, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, have expressed that this conflict should come to an end, so we have paused it from our side for the time being,” said Muttaqi.“The situation is now under control. We only want good relations and peace. Afghanistan is finally free and is working for peace...Pakistan doesn't want good relations and peace, then Afghanistan has other options as well,” added the minister.On Pakistan’s claims that the TTP is being sheltered by the Taliban, Muttaqi said the border was 2400-km long and neither “chengez (Genghis Khan)” nor “angrez (Englishmen)” were able to control it. “Strength alone cannot control it. If Pakistan wants peace, they have a bigger army and better intelligence - why are they not controlling it? This fight is inside Pakistan. Instead of blaming us, they should control the problems on their soil,” said the minister.",Pakistan fumes as taliban back india’s sovereignty over j&k.

JALANDHAR: Former Union home minister P Chidambaram has stirred unease within Congress by calling Operation Blue Star a ""mistake"" and saying ex-PM Indira Gandhi ""paid with her life for it"". His remarks mark the first time a senior party functionary outside Punjab has openly condemned the 1984 military operation in the Golden Temple, long a politically fraught subject for the party.""No disrespect to any military officers here, but that (Blue Star) was the wrong way to retrieve the Golden Temple.

But that mistake was a cumulative decision of the Army, police, intelligence and civil service. You cannot blame it only on Mrs Gandhi.""Congress has maintained an ambiguous silence on the operation that triggered Gandhi's assassination and the anti-Sikh riots that followed.Chidambaram's divergence from party line is not new. Over the years, he has publicly contradicted Congress's positions on issues ranging from economic reforms to internal security, including claiming UPA govt didn't retaliate against Pakistan after 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks due to global pressure.BJP swiftly seized on his latest remarks. Party spokesperson RP Singh posted on X: ""As a nationalist, I strongly believe that Operation Blue Star was completely avoidable, as rightly mentioned by ex-home minister P Chidambaram. A more strategic approach, like Operation Black Thunder, could have achieved the objective without desecrating the sanctity of Sri Harmandir Sahib or causing loss of innocent lives.""PM Narendra Modi, during his reply to the no-confidence motion in Parliament in Aug 2023, had referred to Operation Blue Star as ""an attack on Akal Takht"".Within Congress, few functionaries have ever publicly questioned the operation.

Congress leadership 'upset' with Chidambaram



Not the first time



NEW DELHI: Congress leader P Chidambaram on Saturday reflected on one of India’s most debated chapters — Operation Blue Star — calling it ""the wrong way” to reclaim the Golden Temple and saying that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ""paid with her life"" for that decision.Speaking at the Khushwant Singh Literary Festival 2025, Chidambaram said the operation, carried out in June 1984 under Gandhi’s leadership, was a collective decision of the Army, police, intelligence, and civil services. The former Union home and finance minister contrasted it with Operation Black Thunder, which took place a few years later, and said that it was the right approach as it kept the Army out of the Sikh holy shrine.He said, ""No disrespect to any military officers here, but that (Blue Star) was the wrong way to retrieve the Golden Temple. A few years later, we showed the right way to retrieve the Golden Temple by keeping out the Army.""""Mrs Gandhi (former PM Indira Gandhi) paid with her life for that mistake. It was a cumulative decision of the Army, Police, intelligence and the civil services. You cannot blame it only on Mrs Gandhi,"" he added.Chidambaram made the remarks while speaking at a session on ‘They Will Shoot You, Madam: My Life Through Conflict’ with author Harinder Baweja.Operation Blue Star was a military action carried out from June 1 to June 10, 1984, when the Army entered the Golden Temple in Amritsar to remove militants led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. The operation was ordered by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi after reports that Bhindranwale and his armed supporters had stored weapons inside the temple complex.Bhindranwale, the head of the Damdami Taksal, and several of his followers were killed during the operation. Months later, on October 31, 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated at her New Delhi residence by her Sikh bodyguards, Beant Singh and Satwant Singh.Meanwhile, the Congress leadership expressed its displeasure over Chidambaram's remarks. Congress leader Rashid Alvi questioned whether Chidambaram is being coerced into making statements against the party, as criminal cases against the latter are still pending.Speaking to news agency ANI, Alvi said, ""Whether Operation Blue Star was right or wrong is a different matter. But what compels P Chidambaram to attack the Congress party, Indira Gandhi, claiming she took the wrong step, after 50 years? He's doing the same thing the BJP and the Prime Minister would do. It's unfortunate. Chidambaram ji's repeated attacks on the Congress party are raising many doubts and misgivings. Criminal cases against him are still pending. I wonder if he's under any pressure to continue attacking the Congress party.""News agency PTI, quoting party sources, said said the Congress leadership was of the view that ""senior leaders, who have got everything from the Congress party, should be more careful in making statements that create embarrassments for the party. And, this cannot become a habit"".Chidambaram also stirred a controversy earlier after his remarks on 26/11 terror attacks last month, when in an interview he suggested that he personally favoured military retribution against Pakistan following the ghastly terror attack but the government led by the then prime minister Manmohan Singh decided to go by the external affairs ministry's view to resort to diplomatic measures against the neighbouring country.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also attacked the Congress party following Chidambaram's statement. Speaking at a function after the opening of the first phase of the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), Mumbai metro's Aqua Line and other projects, he blamed the Congress-led UPA government (2004-14) for ""weakening the fight against terror,"" which he alleged had ""paid a heavy price"" on the nation.""A Congress leader, who has also been Union home minister, has said a country prevented India's military retaliation post-26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in 2008. The party should clarify,"" the prime minister said.Chidambaram however dismissed PM's claims as ""terribly wrong"" and accused him of twisting facts for political gain. Sharing a post on X, the Congress leader said, ""I quote the Hon'ble PM's words (as reported in ToI): "".....has said India was ready to respond after 26/11, but because of the pressure exerted by some country, then Congress govt stopped India's armed forces from attacking Pakistan."" ""The statement has three parts, and each one of them is WRONG, terribly WRONG. It is disappointing to read that the Hon'ble prime minister of India imagined the words and attributed them to me,"" he added.","Congress leader p chidambaram reflected on one of india’s most debated chapters — operation blue star.

SRINAGAR: Accused of promoting “land jihad” through her proposed land regularisation bill, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti struck back Sunday — charging BJP with “embracing the Taliban” while allegedly branding Indian Muslims as extremists.“In the garb of accusing people of waging ‘jihad’, Muslims were lynched and demonised. Yet today, this government salutes the Taliban ,” she told supporters at Eidgah in Srinagar. She accused BJP-led Union government of engaging with the same Taliban it once branded terrorists.“BJP once wanted to lock Darul Uloom Deoband, now takes Afghan ministers there to shower them with flowers. If it can talk to the Taliban, why can’t it talk to its own people in J&K?”Her remarks came days after the BJP’s J&K unit described PDP’s proposed J&K Land Rights and Regularisation Bill, 2025 as an act of “land jihad and legislative jihad”.PDP’s draft legislation, unveiled by Mehbooba on Oct 8, seeks to regularise land holdings of people and institutions in continuous possession for more than 30 years. It also aims to prevent arbitrary evictions and ensure ownership security — provisions BJP claims could legitimise alleged illegal encroachments.Taking to social media, Mehbooba alleged that under slogans such as “love jihad”, “land jihad”, “vote jihad”, and “cow jihad”, BJP has been targeting Muslims and vilifying an entire community.“India, which calls itself the mother of democracy, is now embracing the Taliban — the father of jihad — under BJP rule,” she wrote.Mehbooba cited India’s recent outreach to Afghanistan, including educational scholarships for Afghan students, as evidence of what she called government's “contradictory” approach. “While maintaining good relations with Afghanistan may be strategically important, India’s own Muslim population — who have contributed to the country’s identity and progress — are being deprived of rights and opportunities,” she said.She urged government to focus on dialogue within J&K. “Building international relations is important, but peace and harmony must begin at home,” Mehbooba said.BJP has yet to respond officially to her latest remarks, but party functionaries have earlier said the proposed bill is an attempt to “legitimise illegal occupations under the guise of reform”.","Pdp chief mehbooba mufti accuses bjp-led union government of engaging with the same taliban it once branded terrorists. “in the garb of accusing people of waging ‘jihad’, muslims were lynched and demonised,” she told supporters at eidgah in srinagar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124509916,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-621777,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Although the protection was briefly reinstated later, it was again removed when he was sent to Sitapur jail.With a steady flow of visitors thronging his residence after his recent release, authorities reviewed and restored his security cover yet again in view of potential law and order concerns, considering Khan's political influence and high-profile status in Rampur, said sources.Following formal orders to reinstate his protection detail, security personnel and gunners assigned to Khan resumed duty Saturday, official sources said. Khan's security was enhanced with a Gypsy vehicle and seven armed personnel deployed for his protection. Four guards were assigned to safeguard his residence, while three personnel will always stay with him.","Azam khan's y-category security had been withdrawn after his conviction by a court and subsequent disqualification from the state assembly.

IDF launches Operation “Returning Home”



All dead hostages may not be back on Monday







Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday acknowledged divisions over the Gaza ceasefire deal but urged citizens to unite ahead of the expected release of hostages held by Hamas under the prisoner exchange agreement.“This is an emotional evening, an evening of tears, an evening of joy, because tomorrow our children will return to our borders,” Netanyahu said in a televised address, quoting a biblical verse. “Tomorrow is the beginning of a new path - a path of rebuilding, a path of healing, and, I hope, a path of united hearts.”The Prime Minister’s remarks came amid criticism from both sides of Israel’s political spectrum - from families of hostages who accused him of prioritising military goals over their release, and from right-wing members of his coalition who opposed freeing Palestinian prisoners.“This is a historic event that mixes sorrow over the release of murderers with joy over the return of hostages,” Netanyahu said.“I know there are many disagreements among us, but on this day ... we have every reason to put them aside, because together we achieved tremendous victories,” he added.Netanyahu also said Israel was ready to receive the hostages expected to be freed on Monday. “Israel is prepared and ready for the immediate reception of all our hostages,” he said in a separate statement issued Sunday.He added that while Israel had made “tremendous victories” during two years of conflict, the fight was not over: “Together we achieved tremendous victories, victories that amazed the whole world... But at the same time I must tell you, the fight is not over,” Netanyahu said. “Very large security challenges still lie before us.”Meanwhile, the Israel defense forces (IDF) announced the launch of Operation “Returning Home” to bring back the hostages. “In a few hours we will all be reunited - one people, embraced and united,” said Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, Israel’s Chief of the General Staff, in a statement posted on X.He said the operation followed two years of sustained military and diplomatic pressure. “The military pressure we applied over the past two years, together with the complementary diplomatic measures, constitute a victory over Hamas,” Zamir added. “We will continue to act in order to ensure the Gaza Strip no longer poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians.”An Israeli Military official said that they are expecting that not all dead hostages may return to Israel on Monday.""Unfortunately this is something we anticipate that not all fallen hostages will be returned tomorrow,"" the official told reporters during a briefing late on Sunday.Earlier Sunday, Shosh Bedrosian, spokeswoman for the prime minister's office, had said an ""international body"" would be established to locate the remains of captives not returned as part of Monday's exchange.Israel, however, will not send a representative to the US-led peace summit on Gaza scheduled Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh, co-hosted by President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, according to a statement to AFP by Netanyahu’s spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian.(With inputs from agencies)",Israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on sunday acknowledged divisions over the gaza ceasefire deal.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday said the plan to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports remains in place for November 1, but hinted that the timeline could changeWhen asked by reporters whether, ""100% tariffs on China on November 1st still the plan?"" Trump replied, “Yeah. Right now it is. Let’s see what happens.""Further referring to the deadline he added,"" For me, November 1st is an eternity.”This comes as Trump, on Friday, announced further 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese products from November 1 after China restricted exports of rare earth minerals. ""Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position... the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,"" Trump said on Truth Social.This came after he called China’s restrictions “very hostile” and criticised the country for sending letters to nations worldwide outlining controls on “each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths.”As response, Beijing has warned Washington that it will retaliate if Trump proceeds with his tariffs threat, as global investors brace for fresh turbulence in trade relations between the world’s two largest economies.China’s commerce ministry accused the United States of escalating tensions after Trump announced on Friday that he would impose the additional tariffs on Chinese exports, along with new restrictions on critical software, by November 1.“Wilful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,” a spokesperson for the commerce ministry said on Sunday, according to the state news agency Xinhua. “China’s position on the trade war is consistent. We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it.“If the United States insists on going the wrong way, China will surely take resolute measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests.”Despite the sharp rhetoric, Trump and senior administration officials on Sunday signalled that talks with Beijing remained possible, even as US market futures pointed to another decline amid fears of an intensifying trade conflict.","Us president donald trump on sunday said the plan to impose 100 per cent tariffs on chinese imports remains in place for november 1, but hinted that the timeline could change.

Afghanistan-Pakistan conflict: Will Saudi Arabia step in? Here's what Kingdom said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/afghanistan-pakistan-conflict-will-saudi-arabia-step-in-heres-what-kingdom-said/articleshow/124493897.cms,"Pakistan Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed-bin-Salman after signing the defence pact.





Heavy fighting along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border has reignited fears of broader regional instability. Pakistani forces and the Taliban have been engaged in repeated clashes, with Islamabad accused of air strikes and retaliatory operations. The Taliban regime has condemned these actions, warning of escalating conflict that could spill over beyond the border.Amid this growing tension, attention has turned to Saudi Arabia ’s newly signed defence pact with Pakistan , formalised in September 2025. Under the agreement, both nations commit to collective security, an attack on one is considered an attack on both. Saudi Arabia has explicitly pledged to defend Pakistan against external aggression, a move analysts say could have profound implications for regional geopolitics.So far, Riyadh has publicly called for restraint, urging both sides to avoid escalation and prioritise dialogue. However, the pact positions Saudi Arabia as a strategic backstop for Pakistan. While the kingdom has not openly declared it would intervene militarily against Afghanistan, the formalisation of the agreement signals a willingness to support Islamabad if the conflict intensifies.“The kingdom calls for restraint, avoiding escalation, and embracing dialogue and wisdom to contribute to reducing tensions and maintaining security and stability in the region,” the Saudi Foreign Ministry said.“The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security, which will achieve stability and prosperity for the brotherly Pakistani and Afghan peoples,” it added.Yet, there might be a potential strategic calculation behind Riyadh’s measured public stance. While Saudi officials have stopped short of committing to direct military involvement in Afghanistan, the defence pact clearly positions the kingdom as Pakistan’s security backstop.In case the border clashes intensify, Saudi Arabia could be drawn into supporting Islamabad, maybe not out of immediate desire for confrontation, but as a strategic move to protect alliances and regional stability.The pact also reflects broader shifts in Middle Eastern foreign policy. Saudi Arabia appears to be embracing extended deterrence, signalling to regional actors that it will actively defend its partners against external threats, particularly in volatile zones like South and Central Asia. While diplomacy remains the preferred route, the kingdom’s commitment to Pakistan cannot be dismissed lightly.Meanwhile, Trump's desire to regain control of Afghanistan’s Bagram Air Base adds a significant geopolitical layer to the Saudi-Pakistan defence pact and the ongoing Pak-Afghan conflict. Trump has expressed a clear and forceful interest in reclaiming this strategic military base, citing its vital importance for projecting power in the region, particularly as a counterbalance to China, which he considers a primary strategic rival.Bagram Air Base, abandoned by US forces during their 2021 withdrawal, remains a rare foothold in Afghanistan capable of supporting large military operations due to the country’s challenging mountainous terrain.It cannot be ruled out that the United States could leverage its strategic ties with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to build pressure on Afghanistan regarding the Bagram Air Base. Pakistan, given its complex relationship with Afghanistan and its defence pact with Saudi Arabia, could serve as a tool to put pressure on the Taliban-led Afghan government.However, such pressure would be delicate, considering Saudi Arabia’s public calls for restraint amid the newly escalated Pak-Afghan border clashes and its preference for diplomatic solutions so far. Additionally, regional players like China, Russia, and Iran are strongly opposed to renewed foreign military presence in Afghanistan, complicating any overt coercive move.While Riyadh has publicly called for restraint and dialogue, the combination of the defence pact, the intensifying Pakistan-Afghanistan clashes, and the strategic interests of Saudi Arabia suggests that military support for Islamabad remains a plausible scenario if regional tensions escalate further. For now, analysts caution that the pact is both a diplomatic warning and a potential military guarantee, leaving the region on edge.","Heavy fighting along the pakistan-afghanistan border has reignited fears of broader regional instability.

The Man Who took the life of TikToker Yoon Ji-ah — The Dark Truth Behind “Black Cat”

The digital world in South Korea is mourning after losing Yoon Ji-ah who was known for being a TikToker and live streamer with more than 300,000 fans. On September 11, she was found dead on a secluded mountain in Muju County, North Jeolla Province, only a few hours after her last live stream. The terrifying circumstances of her passing have once again raised the issues of the dark side of fan communities and influencer security in the era of the internet.Police have indicated that Yoon Ji-ah met with her death about 30 minutes after cutting off her last stream. The 30-year-old digital star was pronounced dead with serious physical injuries inflicted on her body through beating, strangling, and asphyxias. Later, the medical examiner declared the cause of death to be suffocation from neck compression.Initially, the fan's affection reportedly transformed into obsession. Choi, who presented himself as a CEO enjoying success, was actually an individual who had gotten into deep financial trouble and lost his home through auction. He had created a fake persona and was financially supported which led him to create a close bond with Yoon and even convince her to go into business together.But there were reports about Yoon having recently sought to break the ties claiming controlling behavior and demanding schedule as reasons. The CCTV clips released by the detectives showed Choi kneeling and asking for forgiveness just before the tragic event. As per his later confession, he dragged her into her car before killing.After the murder, Choi made an effort to hide his actions, dressing up with a suitcase, and taking several stops to misdirect the police before he left Yoon's body on the mountainside. He was captured 12 hours after the incident. He first proclaimed his innocence but later admitted it when the police found the corpse.The death of Yoon Ji-ah has created a wave of nationwide protests and mourning compared to which the calls for more effective safety measures for content creators against the obsessive online behavior are stronger than ever. Her death serves as a grim reminder of the dangers influencers face, prompting urgent calls for stronger digital safety laws, mental health awareness, and accountability within online communities to prevent similar tragedies. Yoon Ji-ah’s story stands as a haunting reminder of love turned obsession, fame turned fear, and the urgent need to protect those who bring light to the digital world.","Yoon ji-ah, 30, was found dead on a secluded mountain in muju county, north jeolla province, only a few hours after her last live stream.

Here are 10 things to know:

What Pakistan claimed



What Taliban said





Bone of contention: TTP







Fifteen Pakistani soldiers were killed in a ""retaliatory"" operation by Afghan forces in Helmand province on Saturday night, Kabul based news outlet Hurriyat Radio reported.Maulvi Mohammad Qasim Riaz, spokesperson for the Afghanistan's Helmand provincial government, told the media that Afghan forces carried out the operation near the Durand Line in the Bahramcha district. Afghan troops also captured three Pakistani security posts during the attack.Riaz added that a number of weapons and ammunition were seized by Afghan forces in the operation.The Afghan forces conducted attacks on Pakistan i posts across Helmand, Kandahar, Zabul, Paktika, Paktia, Khost, Nangarhar, and Kunar provinces in response to Pakistan’s recent air strikes in Kabul and Paktika. The operations concluded at midnight.Earlier in the week, Afghan authorities accused Pakistan of bombing the capital, Kabul, and a market in the country’s east. Pakistan did not claim responsibility for the assault.1. The violence began when Taliban forces allegedly opened fire on several Pakistani border posts late Saturday.2. The firing took place at several key posts, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Baramcha in Balochistan, The Express Tribune reported, as cited by the news agency ANI.3. Pakistan Security sources said that the firing was aimed at facilitating the illegal entry of Khwarij -- the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- into Pakistani territory, as reported by The Express Tribune.4, ""The counteroffensive effectively targeted and destroyed multiple Afghan posts at border. Dozens of Afghan soldiers and Khwarij were killed in retaliatory fire,"" news agency ANI reported, citing Express Tribune.5. Pakistani Minister of Interior Mohsin Naqvi called the Afghan attacks ""unprovoked"" and said that Pakistani forces were responding ""with a stone for every brick"". ""Firing by Afghan forces on civilian population is a blatant violation of international laws. Pakistan’s brave forces have given a prompt and effective response that no provocation will be tolerated,"" he said in a post on X.Also read: Clashes break out between Pak army & Taliban along border 6. Afghanistan’s Taliban forces said they launched armed reprisals against Pakistani soldiers along the border, accusing Islamabad of air strikes on their soil.7. ""In retaliation for air strikes carried out by the Pakistani army on Kabul,"" Taliban forces are engaged ""in heavy clashes against Pakistani security forces in various areas"" along the border, the Afghan military said in a statement, as citeb by AFP.8. Later, Taliban defence ministry spokesman Enayat Khowarazm told news agency AFP the ""successful"" operations had ended at midnight. But he warned: ""If the opposing side violates Afghanistan's territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly.""9. Pakistan did not acknowledge carrying out Thursday's attacks but urged Kabul ""to stop harbouring the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) on its soil.""10. The TTP, which has received combat training in Afghanistan and shares the Afghan Taliban’s ideology, is accused by Pakistan of killing hundreds of its soldiers since 2021.The heightened tensions from Pakistan come as Afghanistan’s foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is on a week-long visit to India, marking the first high-level trip from Kabul since the Taliban took power in August 2021.","Fifteen pakistani soldiers were killed in a ""retaliatory"" operation by afghan forces in helmand province on saturday night.
