Balen's message for Nepali youth





With Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stepping down amid the deadly student-led “GenZ protests,” attention has shifted to Kathmandu’s young mayor, Balendra Shah, as online campaigns promote him as the Himalayan nation’s next leader.Popularly known as “Balen,” the 35-year-old is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022. He won as an independent candidate, becoming the first to hold the post without party backing.An engineer by training, Balen holds a degree in civil engineering and has an India connection - he pursued structural engineering at Visvesvaraya Technological University in Karnataka. Before entering politics, he was active in Nepal’s underground hip-hop scene, using his music to highlight corruption and inequality.In June 2023, he drew national attention by banning the screening of Indian films in Kathmandu over a dialogue in the movie Adipurush.In a Facebook post, Shah on Tuesday appealed to protesters to exercise restraint, noting that their demand for the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and other ministers has already been met.He cautioned against further damage to public and private property, saying, “The loss of the country’s wealth is, in reality, a loss of our own property. It is now essential that we all act with restraint.”Shah’s appeal comes as nationwide “GenZ” protests intensify, with young demonstrators demanding accountability over corruption, restrictions on freedoms and police violence. A security forces crackdown has left at least 19 dead and more than 500 injured in clashes around the Federal Parliament and other parts of Kathmandu over the past two days.","Balen shah, 35, is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as kathmandu’s 15th mayor since may 2022.

Utah Valley University locked down







Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative political activist and a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was shot dead while speaking at Utah Valley University on Thursday.Kirk was addressing students under a tent decorated with slogans reading “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong” when a single gunshot was fired, striking him in the neck.Disturbing video footage from the scene shows him clutching his wound as students screamed and fled the area.Trump confirmed Kirk’s death shortly after the incident and announced that American flags would be flown at half-mast until Sunday as a mark of respect.Authorities have not yet released details on the shooter or the motive behind the attack.FBI Director Kash Patel said that the suspect, who was detained, has been released after interrogation.He had announced the arrest of a person from the scene, praising law enforcement’s quick action. “The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody,” Patel had written on X.Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said officials believe only one “person involved” in the shooting death of Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus. “No information suggests a second person,” he stated Wednesday.However, investigators are still seeking anyone with more details. A person of interest is currently in custody and being interviewed, according to the governor.President Trump, who counted Kirk as a key political ally, paid tribute to him both on Truth Social and in an interview with the New York Post.“No one understood or had the heart of the youth in the United States better than Charlie,” Trump wrote online. “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me.”Trump ordered American flags flown at half-mast until Sunday evening after the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk. On Truth Social, @Trump shared that the ""Legendary"" debater had been killed, expressing condolences to his wife Erika and young family. He has been closely monitoring the situation as it develops and acknowledged Kirk's impactful legacy.Trump described Kirk as “a very, very good friend” and “a tremendous person,” urging supporters: “We must all pray for Charlie Kirk.”Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, who was present at the event, said Kirk had just taken a question from the audience when the shot rang out.“As soon as I saw Charlie go back, you realise that it was a shot,” Chaffetz told Fox News. “It wasn’t as if there was a whole bunch of gunfire. It was one shot.”He added that security at the event appeared light, with only a small police presence.Videos posted to social media show panic erupting as the shot was fired. Students screamed, ducked for cover, and rushed across a nearby fountain to escape the courtyard.Some in the crowd attempted to rush to Kirk’s aid as security hustled him away. A woman in a red “MAGA” hat was seen in tears, while others were filmed praying near the scene.Images circulating online showed an older white man being led away by police, with one officer reportedly heard saying, “He said he shot him, but I don’t know.”However, law enforcement later clarified that this individual was not the suspect. Confusion remains over whether the gunman fled the campus or is still in hiding.Politicians from across the spectrum denounced the shooting. Vice President JD Vance wrote: “Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour.” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said disputes should be resolved “through debate, not violence.”Democratic leaders also expressed support. California Governor Gavin Newsom called the attack “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible,” while former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: “Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.”UVU, Utah’s largest public university with nearly 47,000 students, was closed after the attack. Administrators confirmed the campus would remain under tight security while the search for the shooter continued.The event had already been controversial: a petition calling on the university to bar Kirk from speaking attracted nearly 1,000 signatures. Officials defended the appearance as an exercise in free speech and debate.","Charlie kirk, a 31-year-old conservative political activist and a close ally of us president donald trump, was shot dead while speaking at utah valley university.

Shashi Tharoor post

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday expressed concern over the victory of the Jamaat-e-Islami’s student wing in the Dhaka University (DU) student union polls, questioning whether India may soon have to deal with a Jamaat-led government in Bangladesh.“This may have registered as barely a blip on most Indian minds, but it is a worrying portent of things to come,” the former diplomat wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of a news report on the win.Tharoor noted that voters were increasingly turning to the Jamaat-e-Islami not out of religious zeal but because they saw the party as untainted by the corruption and misgovernance associated with the two traditional rivals — the now-banned Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). “How will this play out in the February 2026 general elections? Will New Delhi be dealing with a Jamaat majority next door?” he asked.According to Bangladeshi news outlet Prothom Alo, candidates backed by Islami Chhatra Shibir, contesting under the banner of the Oikkoboddho Shikkharthi Jote (United Students’ Alliance), won nine of the 15 key posts, including vice president (VP), general secretary (GS) and assistant general secretary (AGS).For the VP post, Abu Shadik Kayem secured 14,042 votes, defeating his closest rival — BNP student wing leader Abidul Islam Khan — who polled 5,708 votes.The report noted that during the Awami League’s 15-year rule, Shibir could not operate openly on the Dhaka University campus, with its suspected activists often facing assaults in residential halls.But following the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina-led government in August 2024 after a student-led movement, the Shibir resurfaced publicly. Bangladesh is currently under a caretaker administration headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which banned the Awami League in May.Hasina has been living in India since her ouster.",Congress mp shashi tharoor expressed concern over the victory of the jamaat-e-islami’s student wing in the dhaka university (du) student union polls.

His remarks assume significance, especially as developing countries are gearing up to fight for more predictable climate finance for the global south when they assemble in Brazil for COP30 in Nov.At last year’s COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, developed countries had agreed to mobilise merely $300 billion annually by 2035, far short of the $1.3-trillion target set by developing countries for implementation of their climate action pledges.Yadav, in his speech, said India will require more than $10 trillion by 2070 to meet its net-zero target and called for global financial systems to unlock private capital, noting that public money cannot and would not be sufficient to address the scale of the problem at hand.Referring to the RBI’s estimates in 2023, he said India will spend about $1.05 trillion by 2030 to adapt industries to climate norms.Calling ‘green finance’ the backbone of resilient and competitive economies, he said, “Green financing is not simply about mobilising money for environmental projects. It is about restructuring the flow of capital so that every investment in infrastructure, industry, transport, or agriculture contributes to sustainability rather than undermining it.”",India on thursday said financial support of $300 billion annually to the global south by 2035 is ‘insufficient’ developed countries have the “moral responsibility’ to support developing countries.

""India stands firmly in support of peace and stability in the region, and against terrorism in all its forms and manifestation,"" said the PM in a post on X.PM appreciated the role being played by Qatar in promoting regional peace and stability, including its mediation efforts in Gaza to achieve ceasefire and release of all hostages.This was a rare, if not unprecedented, condemnation of Israel's action by India, coming as it did at the highest level, & suggests the importance govt attaches to its ties with Qatar. Israel has taken full responsibility for its action against the ""top terrorist chieftains of Hamas"".Modi has personally developed a good rapport with Al-Thani and the latter further deepened this bond with his special gesture last year of pardoning eight Indian Navy veterans who were arrested by Doha for allegedly spying for Israel.India and Qatar upgraded their relations to a strategic partnership during Al-Thani's visit to India earlier this year.India has been one of the principal backers of Israel's right to defend itself from Hamas terrorism but, amid mounting global outrage over Israel's actions in Gaza, it has also condemned killing of civilians while underlining the need to follow the international humanitarian law. At the SCO summit earlier this month, India joined other members in condemning Israel & US attacks on Iran and its nuclear facilities.India had hours after the attack on Tuesday expressed concern and urged restraint but that clearly wasn't enough. According to a Qatar readout, Modi affirmed solidarity with Qatar and its ""strong condemnation of the cowardly Israeli attack that targeted the residential headquarters of a number of Hamas leaders, stressing that it is a flagrant violation of all international laws and norms, and that it is a serious threat to the security of the State of Qatar and the countries of the region"".""The Indian PM also stressed his categorical rejection of any aggression that threatens the security and safety of the State of Qatar and its people and undermines the security and stability of the region,"" said the Qatar govt.Al-Thani stressed in the conversation that Qatar will take all measures to protect its security and maintain its sovereignty against the ""blatant Israeli attack, expressing his thanks to the PM for his sincere feelings and India's appreciated solidarity with the State of Qatar and its people"".","India has been one of the principal backers of israel's right to defend itself from hamas terrorism.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has always stuck to the cardinal constitutional principle of separation of powers, a five-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai said Thursday, following the Centre's emphasis on the executive, legislature and judiciary sticking to their domains. ""Judicial activism"" should not become ""judicial terrorism"", the CJI said.The bench of CJI Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said, ""We believe in the separation of powers between the executive, legislature and judiciary. However, if one wing ...fails to discharge its duties, Supreme Court as custodians of the Constitution and protector of rights, cannot remain a mute spectator.""This response from SC came after solicitor general Tushar Mehta repeatedly pleaded with bench that SC fixing timelines for the President and governors to act on bills, not specified in Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution, would amount to judiciary amending the provisions, a task exclusively reserved for Parliament.Before reserving its opinion on the Presidential Reference which sought SC's opinion on 14 questions relatable to an unprecedented April 8 decision of a two-judge SC bench fixing timelines for the President and governors, the CJI B R Gavai said, ""I am a strong believer in separation of powers.I have been declaring in public that judicial activism should not turn into judicial terrorism.""Interestingly, the bench said it disagreed with an argument of opposition-led states that SC, in its jurisdiction to render opinion to the President under Article 143, cannot reverse the two-judge bench's April 8 judgment, which apart from fixing timelines for the President and governors, had granted deemed assent to 10 bills pending for a long time with the Tamil Nadu governor.The bench said, ""We will answer the President's queries and will declare the law, which will hold the field for future. We will not decide the facts of the case and the correctness of the decision of the two-judge bench. But the interpretation of Articles 200 and 201 by the two-judge bench is a view which is not binding on the five-judge bench.""Mehta said the President is not questioning the correctness of the April 8 judgment and is only seeking opinion of the apex court on the correctness of the law laid down by the two-judge bench on timelines and whether the judiciary can grant deemed assent to bills which is the sole prerogative and discretion of governors and the President.Both attorney general R Venkataramani and Mehta acknowledged that governors cannot sit idle on a bill indefinitely. However, they argued that in certain situations, a governor is entitled to use his discretionary power to withhold assent to a bill if, in his view, it could subvert or undermine the Constitution, erode democracy, have national implications, or trigger a dispute with other states.Venkataramani said the constitutional mechanism under Articles 200 and 201 has worked smoothly for over 75 years in which more than 94% of bills have been assented to by governors or the President. Why would the court disturb the settled mechanism which has worked well because of some stray instances of delay by governors, he asked.The AG argued that if because of certain instances of delay or withholding of assent SC enters the Parliament's domain to snip or add words to these two provisions, it would lead to a 'Procrustean bed' phenomenon (originating from Greek mythology in which a bandit used to force travellers to fit the length of the bed by either amputating their limbs or stretching them), which would encourage states to rush to SC for moulding of constitutional provisions for every small aberration in future.","Supreme court has always stuck to the cardinal constitutional principle of separation of powers, a five-judge bench led by cji b r gavai said.

The announcement followed PM Narendra Modi's bilateral meeting with his counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam in Varanasi.The two countries signed several other agreements aimed at helping Mauritius improve infrastructure and healthcare, augment maritime security and enhance defence preparedness, while allowing India to expand its footprint in Indian Ocean. The projects announced under the package, along with budgetary assistance of $25 million, are together worth $680 million.The PM said both sides will work towards enabling trade in local currencies. Modi also said the projects, based on both grant and grant-cum-line of credit basis, are designed to support Mauritius' needs and priorities, adding India will advance projects such as the Chagos Marine Protected Area, ATC Tower at the international airport and the expansion of highways and ring roads.""This package is not assistance. It is an investment in our shared future,"" said Modi after the meeting, adding Mauritius was not a partner but family for India.The PM also announced signing of an agreement for cooperation in the field of hydrography, saying that over the next five years, the countries will work together on joint surveys, navigation charts, and hydrographic data of the Mauritius EEZ.The Mauritius EEZ has expanded significantly after its recent treaty with the UK established its sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India was Mauritius' preferred partner in the latter's pursuit of protecting and securing its interests in the region. ""It has many more responsibilities now. It needs maritime resources, and to be able to fully develop and exploit those resources, it will need assistance, and India is its preferred partner,"" said Misri.India had strongly backed the transfer of Chagos sovereignty to Mauritius through the treaty that also allowed the UK to retain control of Diego Garcia island from where UK and US operate a key military base.Ramgoolam appreciated India's support, saying, ""We want to visit the Chagos Islands, including Diego Garcia, to plant our flag. The British offered us a vessel, but we said we preferred one from India because, symbolically, it would be more meaningful.""Modi also said a free, open, secure, stable, and prosperous Indian Ocean is a shared priority. ""In this context, India remains fully committed to strengthening the security of Mauritius's EEZ and enhancing its maritime capacity,"" said the PM, adding India has always stood as the first responder and a net security provider in the Indian Ocean region.The PM congratulated Ramgoolam for the Chagos Agreement, calling it a historic milestone for Mauritius' sovereignty.

Nepal protests: Sanjeev Sanyal flags similarities in regime falls; calls it 'same toolkit',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nepal-protests-sanjeev-sanyal-flags-similarities-in-regime-falls-calls-it-same-toolkit/articleshow/123833413.cms,"PTI photo

NEW DELHI: Sanjeev Sanyal, a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), questioned the violent protests in neighbouring Nepal, noting their uncanny resemblance to regime changes in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other countries in recent years.Sanyal raised suspicion over these regime changes that occurred on the back of violent protest, saying: ""It does raise the question of how ‘organic’ these things are.”“Irrespective of what one thinks of PM Oli’s regime or his future, the same toolkit gets used suspiciously often in the neighbourhood. We saw students being used as fodder in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and more recently in Indonesia. It does raise the question of how ‘organic’ these things are,” Sanyal wrote on X.In Dhaka, students took to the streets in August 2024 against a controversial job quota system, a movement that snowballed into nationwide protests and the eventual fall of Sheikh Hasina’s government. Hundreds died in the crackdown before Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was chosen to head an interim government, with the army playing mediator.Sri Lanka too witnessed mass protests between March and July 2022, fuelled by an economic meltdown of inflation, blackouts, and crippling shortages.Demonstrators stormed government buildings and clashed with troops, leading to Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s ouster. Like in Nepal, a ban on social media only fanned the anger.Experts suggest the violent protests in Nepal may have more to them than meets the eye.“The conspirators in Nepal have lit the fire but have little control over the means to douse the flames,” said CK Lal, author and political analyst told news agency PTI.“Going by the nature of coordinated attacks that have happened across the country, it seems some preparations have been made behind them for quite some time. The social media ban lasted for only four days. There’s no way such violent repercussions could have been orchestrated across the country in such a short span,” he added.“To normal people like you and me, stability and harmony in a country are desirable for neighbouring nations because prosperity spills over. But policymakers think differently. They feel that unstable powers are easier to manipulate and control. Their logic and reasoning are different from those of ours,” said Ramesh Parajuli, Senior Researcher with Nepal-based NGO Martin Chautari.The protests, led largely by Gen Z activists, escalated after 19 demonstrators were killed on Monday. Clashes injured more than 200 people, with reports of bullet wounds despite official claims that live ammunition had not been authorised.Police used tear gas to disperse crowds, while the Nepali Army was deployed to secure Tribhuvan International Airport, which was shut down due to the violence.According to The Kathmandu Post, protesters also attacked the homes of Minister for Communication and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel, Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Biswo Paudel, and former Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak.The immediate trigger was a government-imposed social media ban, lifted late Monday night, but the unrest has since broadened into a movement against alleged corruption and political mismanagement.","Sanjeev sanyal, a member of the economic advisory council to the prime minister (eac-pm), questioned the violent protests in neighbouring nepal.

He stated that the international community understands this deceptive behaviour.He emphasised that India's calculated response to the Pahalgam incident demonstrated that neither India nor the world would forget such actions.""We need no lessons from a terror sponsor; no sermons from a persecutor of minorities; no advice from a state that has squandered its own credibility,"" he stated.He observed that Pakistan's regular misuse of the forum and manipulation of the OIC as its spokesperson has become predictable, noting that its obsession with India appears to provide it validation.Tyagi concluded by affirming India's commitment to protecting its citizens and sovereignty, whilst continuing to expose the deceptive practices of a failed state dependent on terror activities.","Permanent mission of india cousellor kshitij tyagi delivered a strong rebuke to pakistan.

Tavia Hunt and Randi Mahomes react to the tragedy

“As a society, we must be reminded that human life is sacred and never disposable.

We must learn again to disagree with words, not weapons. That is exactly what Charlie Kirk modeled — he met opposition with dialogue, not violence, and proved that conviction and civility can walk hand in hand. Evil does not have the final word. Jesus does. And because of Him, Charlie’s voice still echoes — calling us to live with conviction, courage, and hope.

Well done good and faithful servant.”
