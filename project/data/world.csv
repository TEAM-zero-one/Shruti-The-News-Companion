Retail inflation inches up to 3-month high of 1.3% in December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/retail-inflation-inches-up-to-3-month-high-of-1-3-in-december/articleshow/126495039.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Retail inflation inched up to a three-month high in Dec, led by narrowing deflation in some food prices and fading favourable base effect, but remained below the Reserve Bank of India ’s (RBI) tolerance level for the fourth month in a row.Data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Monday showed retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 1.3%, higher than the 0.7% in Nov and below the 5.2% in Dec 2024.Food inflation contracted 2.7% in Dec and there is an increase of 120 basis points compared to Nov. Rural inflation was at 0.8% while urban was at 2% during Dec.Core inflation, which excludes food and fuel, soared to a 28-month high of 4.8% during the month, up from 4.4% in Nov, led by a sharp spike in gold and silver prices, which surged 69% and 97% year-onyear, respectively. Excluding these metals, core inflation moderated to 2.3% in Dec.The increase in overall inflation and food inflation during Dec was largely attributed to increase in inflation of personal care and effects, vegetables, meat and fish, egg, spices and pulses and products. Personal care and effects, which includes gold and silver, rose 28.1% in Dec.“Looking ahead, headline inflation is expected to edge higher but remain below the RBI’s 4% target for the rest of FY26.For FY26 and FY27, CPI inflation is projected to average around 2.1% and 4% respectively, based on the current CPI basket. The rollout of the new CPI series with a 2024 base year next month will be an important development to watch,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at ratings agency CareEdge.“From a monetary policy standpoint, the recent uptick in inflation is unlikely to trouble the RBI. While inflation projections leave room for a further 25 basis points rate cut, we expect the monetary policy committee (MPC) to pause and conserve policy space, opting to ease only if growth conditions deteriorate,” said Sinha.","Food inflation contracted 2.7% in dec and there is an increase of 120 basis points compared to nov.

Vaping case: Birla hints at action if charge established,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vaping-case-birla-hints-at-action-if-charge-established/articleshow/126494641.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Action is mandated if an MP violates Parliament's dignity, Speaker Om Birla asserted on Monday, hinting at proceedings against a Trinamool member accused of vaping inside Lok Sabha, in case the charge is established.Birla recalled that parliamentarians have been even stripped of their membership for misconduct, though insisting that it is for LS, and not him, to make the decision after a parliamentary committee recommends action. The probe into BJP MP Anurag Thakur's complaint against the opposition MP, who was not named, for e-smoking during proceedings in the last session is nearing completion, he added.Birla confirmed finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her ninth Budget on Feb 1. Though govt had indicated that it will stick to the convention of presenting the Budget on Feb 1, Birla's is the first official voice to declare the same. Parliamentarians are meant to work all the time and should not be seen as employees, the Speaker added.On Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth (CSPOC), which India will host after 16 years, he said Pakistan will not be a part of it, nor will Bangladesh, as the latter has had no Speaker since dissolution of its parliament by the interim govt, which has announced a fresh election.India will be hosting the biggest edition of CSPOC, with 42 of 56 member nations, including UK, Australia and Canada, having confirmed their participation.Asked if Lok Sabha has followed the rules in constituting an inquiry committee to probe the charge of corruption against Justice Yashwant Varma, Birla said it has put forth its views in Supreme Court, which has reserved its decision on the Allahabad HC judge's legal challenge.Varma has argued that since a notice for his removal was submitted in RS on the same day as in LS, both Houses should have been part of the consultation process and the speaker should not have announced the committee unilaterally. RS has told SC that it had never admitted the opposition-sponsored notice as it was ""defective"" on many counts.","Birla confirms finance minister nirmala sitharaman will present her ninth budget on feb 1.

'Real Friends Can Disagree, But...': US Envoy Sergio Gor On India-US Ties, Comments On Trade Deal

India-US trade deal: The new US Ambassador to India, Sergio Gor on Monday shared an important update on the India-US trade deal progress, saying that the two sides will hold a fresh round of talks tomorrow. ""Many of you have asked me for an update on the ongoing trade deal negotiations. Both sides continue to actively engage. In fact, the next call on trade will occur tomorrow,” he said after assuming charge.“India is the world's largest nation. So it's not an easy task to get this across the finish line, but we are determined to get there and while trade is very important for our relationship, we will continue to work closely together on other very important areas such as security, counter-terrorism, energy, technology, education, and health,” he added.“No partner is more essential than India. In the months and years ahead, it is my goal as ambassador to pursue a very ambitious agenda. We will do this as true strategic partners, each bringing strength, respect, and leadership to the table,” he said.India currently faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the US, 25% of which are penal tariffs for its crude oil imports from Russia. Both sides have been engaged in discussions for the first tranche of the trade deal to be finalised but a breakthrough is still elusive.In the meantime, US President Donald Trump has threatened higher tariffs on India if it doesn’t stop buying Russian crude and a new bill that proposes 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil has received his nod and will be up for vote in the Senate soon.Talking about the bond between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gor said, “.I've travelled all over the world with President Trump, and I can attest that his friendship with Prime Minister Modi is real. The United States and India are bound not just by shared interest, but by a relationship anchored at the highest levels. Real friends can disagree, but always resolve their differences in the end.”""I spoke with President Trump just yesterday, and I bring his warm wishes to all the people of India, especially his dear friend, the incredible Prime Minister Modi.""... It is great to be here as the United States' Ambassador. I come to this remarkable nation with profound respect and a clear mission: to take the partnership between our two nations to the next level. This is the intersection between the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy... During my last dinner with him, President Trump recounted his last visit to India and also his great friendship with the great Prime Minister of India. I hope the President will be visiting us soon, hopefully in the next year or two,” he added.","'real friends can disagree, but...': us envoy sergio gor on india-us ties, comments on trade deal.

PMO likely to move to Sewa Teerth complex in next one week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pmo-likely-to-move-to-sewa-teerth-complex-in-next-one-week/articleshow/126491874.cms,".

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is likely to move to his new office at the newly built Sewa Teerth complex near Vayu Bhawan in the next one week. This will be the first time since independence when the PMO moves out of the seat of power at South Block built by British architect Herbert Baker.Officials said the office housing the PMO is fully ready. They added that the new PMO will be operational any time between Jan 14 (Makar Sankranti) and Jan 23 (Subhas Chandra Bose Jayanti). “Kharmas, considered inauspicious in Vedic astrology to avoid new ventures, is ending with Makar Sankranti on Wednesday. So, the shifting of PMO to the new building can happen anytime from Wednesday onwards. All preparations have been completed in the past two weeks,” said an official.South Block and North Block situated in the Raisina Hills were built in 1931. The history of PMO traces from a small PM’s Secretariat (PMS) in 1947 to provide basic administrative help to the PM. The first major structural change happened in 1964 after Lal Bahadur Shastri became PM when PMS got statutory status via Allocation of Business Rules. The authority of the office increased significantly during Indira Gandhi’s tenure and in 1977 this was officially renamed the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) during the Morarji Desai administration.The Cabinet Secretariat has shifted from Rashtrapati Bhawan to ‘Seva Teerth-2’ in September and ‘Seva Teerth-3’ is designated for the National Security Adviser’s (NSA) office. The NSA is likely to shift to the new complex in the next one week as well.The PMO and subsequently defence ministry moving out of South Block in the next few weeks will mean the country's power centre completely shifting out of Raisina Hills, which officials said is another example of govt’s thrust on getting rid of the colonial past and “mentality of slavery”. The North Block has been vacated completely with ministries moving out of the iconic building to new Bhawans that have come up along Kartavya Path.",Pm narendra modi is likely to move to his new office at the newly built sewa teerth complex near vayu bhawan.

PM Modi, Merz jointly condemn Delhi, Pahalgam terror attacks

As PM Modi hosted German Chancellor Friedrich Merz for bilateral talks in Ahmedabad, the two countries agreed to significantly boost their defence, trade and critical and emerging technology ties with the formalisation of 19 agreements. There were eight other announcements meant to ramp up cooperation in areas ranging from people-to-people contact to Indo-Pacific and green development, including visa-free transit for Indian passport-holders through Germany.Amongst the highlights was a joint declaration of intent on strengthening bilateral defence industrial cooperation with Modi saying both sides will also work on a roadmap to enhance cooperation between their defence industries, opening new opportunities for co-development and co-production.""The growing cooperation in defence and security is a symbol of our mutual trust and shared vision. I express my heartfelt gratitude to Chancellor Merz for simplifying processes related to defence trade,"" said Modi. Four pacts were inked to boost cooperation in critical and emerging tech, including semiconductors and critical minerals.India and Germany are working together to build secure, trusted, and resilient supply chains.MoUs being signed today on all these areas will give new momentum and strength to our cooperation, said PM Modi. The PM and Merz discussed a range of global and regional issues. “The two reiterated their concern over the ongoing war in Ukraine, which continues to cause immense human suffering and negative global consequences. They expressed support for efforts to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in accordance with international law and principles of UN Charter,” said a joint statement.On Gaza, both backed a two-state solution while underlining the need for unhindered and at scale delivery of humanitarian aid to the enclave as well as unimpeded access for humanitarian organisations. “They reaffirmed their readiness to support efforts towards just and durable peace and reiterated their call for a just, lasting and comprehensive resolution of conflict in West Asia in the form of a negotiated two-state solution,” said the statement. Agreeing that terrorism is aserious threat to all humanity, both said India and Germany will continue to fight the menace together. They unequivocally and strongly condemned terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism.“They called for concerted international efforts to combat terrorism in a comprehensive and sustained manner. They condemned in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22, 2025, and the terror incident in Delhi on Nov 10, 2025,” said the joint statement. The PM also announced the launch of a consultation mechanism to boost cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, saying both sides will continue to work together to support development in the Global South. “The strength of our friendship is visible on the global stage. Our trilateral development partnership, through joint projects in countries such as Ghana, Cameroon and Malawi, is a successful model for the world,” he said.Reaffirming their strong support to India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, the two emphasised its transformational potential in reshaping and promoting global commerce, connectivity and prosperity. “In this context, they look forward to the first IMEC ministerial meeting to take concrete steps for advancing this initiative,” said the statement.","Pm modi hosted german chancellor friedrich merz for bilateral talks in ahmedabad.

PSLV fails for 2nd time in 9 months; 3rd-stage glitch costs 16 satellites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pslv-fails-for-2nd-time-in-9-months-3rd-stage-glitch-costs-16-satellites/articleshow/126492197.cms,".

Things started going wrong 8 min after launch, says Isro chairman

SRIHARIKOTA/BENGALURU: India's first space mission of 2026 failed on Monday after Isro's workhorse PSLV suffered a glitch in its solid-propellant third stage (PS3), costing 16 satellites and an ambitious project of strategic, diplomatic and commercial importance.The PSLV-C62 failure comes nine months after a glitch in the same third stage of PSLV-C61 prevented EOS-09, another strategic satellite, from reaching orbit on May 18, 2025. This is also the first time PSLV has failed consecutively. The main satellite was EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a DRDO satellite designed to give India's military sharper eyes in space through a hyperspectral imaging payload.Towards the end of the third stage we saw a little more disturbance in the vehicle roll rates and subsequently there was a deviation in the flight path. We are analysing the data,” Isro chairman V Narayanan said. Isro is yet to make public the failure analysis report of the PSLV-C61 mission. All appeared good on Monday when the 44.4-m PSLV, flying its fifth mission in dual strapon configuration, lifted off from SDSC’s first launch pad at 10.18 am, about 1.30 minutes after the scheduled time.About 8 minutes and 40 seconds later, between the thirdstage shut-off and fourthstage (PS4) ignition, something went wrong.Soon, Narayanan announced the mission had failed. It also carried a satellite (Munal) for Nepal and a technology demonstrator (AyulSat) from start-up OrbitAID aimed at cracking on-orbit refuelling, along with 13 other payloads.AyulSAT, which was to demonstrate fuel transfer internally and later act as a target satellite for OrbitAID’s chaser satellite planned about six months later, would have put India a step closer to testing on-orbit refuelling. China is the only country which now has on-orbit refuelling technology. OrbitAID founder and CEO Sakthikumar R told TOI on Monday: “We are now forced to launch both the target and chaser satellites together. We hope to do that later this year.”The rocket also carried satellites from the UK, Brazil, Thailand and Spain, apart from payloads developed by Indian startups demonstrating several technologies, including AI processing in orbit, store-andforward communication systems, IoT services, radiation measurement, agricultural data collection, and a re-entry capsule to be deployed after re-start and deorbit of the PS4 stage. This failure is the third launch setback for Isro since Jan 2025 — GSLV-F15, which carried the NVS-02 navigation satellite, failed to place the satellite in geostationary orbit due to a propulsion system malfunction.","India's first space mission of 2026 failed on monday after isro's workhorse pslv suffered a glitch in its solid-propellant third stage (ps3) the main satellite was eos-n1 (anvesha), a drdo satellite designed to give india's military sharper eyes in space through a hyperspectral imaging payload.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126492200,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-884577,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Why the German Type-214NG was selected



Make in India at the core



Pakistan, Karachi and the logic of sea denial



China’s expanding undersea footprint



Strategic timing of Merz’s visit



French-origin Scorpene follow-on plan put on hold as Project-75I gained priority



Long-term impact on India’s naval posture



NEW DELHI: More than five decades after Indian naval strikes crippled Karachi during the 1971 war, undersea power is once again at the heart of New Delhi’s strategic thinking. As German Chancellor Friedrich Merz began his visit to India on Monday amid a more volatile regional and global security environment, discussions around Project-75I have acquired fresh urgency.The Indian Navy’s plan to induct six next-generation conventional submarines equipped with air-independent propulsion reflects a convergence of hard lessons from history, renewed friction with Pakistan following recent crises, and China’s expanding undersea presence in the Indian Ocean. Together, these factors are pushing India towards one of its most consequential naval procurement decisions in years, one that blends deterrence, indigenisation and long-term strategic signalling.Project-75I is the Indian Navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel-electric submarines equipped with fuel-cell-based air-independent propulsion, advanced sensors, torpedoes and missile systems. The Ministry of Defence issued the Request for Proposal for the project in July 2021 under the Strategic Partnership Model, describing it as a key pillar of the government’s Make in India push, according to a PIB statement.The project envisages indigenous construction, long-term technology transfer and the creation of a domestic submarine-building ecosystem. The estimated cost was over Rs 40,000 crore at the RFP stage, with current assessments placing the final contract value closer to $8 billion, or about Rs 72,000 crore, based on configuration and lifecycle support.For the Indian Navy, the programme addresses a critical gap. Its conventional submarine fleet is ageing even as undersea activity by China and Pakistan increases in the Indian Ocean and along India’s maritime approaches.The Indian Navy has selected the German Type-214 Next Generation submarine, edging out Spain’s S-80 Plus offered by Navantia, defence sources said. The decision was driven primarily by the maturity of the German fuel-cell-based AIP system, acoustic stealth and lower lifecycle risk.AIP allows submarines to remain submerged for weeks without surfacing or snorkeling, reducing detection risk. In contested waters, endurance and silence are decisive. The Type-214’s AIP technology is widely regarded as operationally proven, while competing systems are still undergoing validation.In undersea warfare, reliability and survivability often outweigh novelty. That calculus appears to have guided the Navy’s choice.Under the proposed framework, all six submarines will be built in India at MDL, with TKMS providing design authority, engineering expertise and technical consultancy. Indigenous content is expected to start at around 45 percent and rise to nearly 60 percent by the final boat, aligning with Atmanirbhar Bharat goals.TKMS and MDL signed a memorandum of understanding in June last year to jointly pursue the project, laying the groundwork for the partnership. MDL’s prior experience building Scorpène-class submarines under the earlier Project-75 strengthened its case as the Indian strategic partner.The ministry of defence has repeatedly stressed that Project-75I is not only about acquiring platforms but about absorbing complex submarine design and construction technologies, as outlined in the 2021 PIB release.India’s emphasis on undersea capability is rooted in history. During the 1971 war, the Indian Navy’s attacks on Karachi port crippled Pakistan’s maritime logistics and fuel supply, accelerating Islamabad’s defeat. That episode stressed how control of the seas can shape outcomes on land.The relevance of that lesson resurfaced during Operation Sindoor in May 2025, when tensions with Pakistan escalated following a major terror provocation. Between May 8 and May 11, India placed its naval forces on heightened readiness, with Karachi again emerging as Pakistan’s most critical vulnerability.Karachi handles the bulk of Pakistan’s maritime trade and energy imports. India’s ability to credibly threaten that hub, even without firing a shot, highlighted the deterrent value of naval and undersea power. New submarines with extended underwater endurance would sharpen that leverage.Beyond Pakistan, China looms large in India’s maritime threat assessment. The People’s Liberation Army Navy operates a rapidly expanding submarine fleet, including nuclear-powered platforms that have increasingly deployed into the Indian Ocean.Chinese submarines have docked at regional ports and conducted patrols close to Indian waters, while Pakistan, with Chinese assistance, is also upgrading its submarine arm. For Indian planners, this twin challenge has made restoring conventional submarine strength an urgent priority.Project-75I is designed to plug that gap by giving India a survivable, persistent undersea capability suited to monitoring choke points, tracking adversary submarines and conducting sea-denial operations.Chancellor Merz’s visit from January 12–13 comes amid a broader effort by Germany to expand its strategic footprint in the Indo-Pacific. Berlin and New Delhi are also working toward an EU-India free trade agreement, as noted by AFP.For India, the potential submarine deal fits into a wider diversification of defence partnerships beyond legacy suppliers such as Russia. For Germany, it represents an opportunity to anchor a long-term industrial and security relationship with the world’s largest democracy.According to informed defence sources cited by idrw.org, the final contract is not expected to be signed during Merz’s visit but could be concluded within the next three months, with the high-level engagement expected to provide political momentum.In October 2025, India put on hold plans to build three additional French-origin Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, even as it moved decisively to push ahead with Project-75I, which envisages the construction of six new-generation German-origin diesel-electric submarines at the same shipyard, The Times of India reported.Top government sources told TOI that the proposal for the three additional Scorpenes, estimated to cost around Rs 36,000 crore, “was not being pursued” at the time, although a formal decision to scrap it had not been recorded. While cost negotiations for the Scorpene follow-on order had concluded in the previous fiscal, final clearance from the Prime Minister-led Cabinet Committee on Security remained on hold.Officials told TOI that the German submarines under Project-75I were considered “a generation ahead” in terms of technology and capability. Concerns also existed about MDL’s ability to simultaneously execute two complex submarine construction programmes. The six original Kalvari-class submarines had already been built at MDL under the earlier Project-75 contract signed in October 2005, with the first boat INS Kalvari commissioned in December 2017 and the sixth, INS Vagsheer, inducted in January 2025.All six Kalvari-class submarines were slated to be retrofitted with the DRDO-developed air-independent propulsion system to improve underwater endurance. AIP allows a diesel-electric submarine to remain submerged for nearly two weeks, compared to boats without the system that must surface or snorkel every few days to recharge batteries.In contrast, the submarines planned under Project-75I, to be built in partnership with Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, were designed to incorporate AIP from the outset, along with land-attack cruise missiles and other next-generation technologies, TOI reported.Sources told TOI that the decision to proceed with final techno-commercial negotiations for the six German submarines, with an option for three more at a later stage, followed extensive deliberations involving the defence ministry, the Navy and the National Security Council Secretariat. Formal contract negotiations began in September 2025.“These new-generation boats under P-75I will come with design ToT (transfer of technology) and a greater indigenisation level of around 60%. The project will serve as a bridge to the future P-76, under which conventional submarines will be constructed based on totally indigenous design,” a source told TOI.Despite the pause on the Scorpene extension, officials indicated that France’s broader strategic partnership with India remained strong. Negotiations progressed on additional Rafale fighters for the Indian Air Force’s proposed 114 multi-role fighter aircraft programme, as well as a collaboration to co-develop a powerful jet engine with French major Safran for India’s fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft was nearly finalised.At the time, the Navy’s conventional submarine strength stood at six Scorpenes, six ageing Russian Kilo-class boats and four German HDW submarines, alongside two nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. China, by comparison, operated more than 50 diesel-electric and around 10 nuclear submarines and was in the process of supplying eight Yuan-class AIP-equipped submarines to Pakistan, a development seen as a major capability boost for Islamabad, TOI reported.Once inducted, the six Type-214NG submarines will significantly enhance the Indian Navy’s capacity for covert surveillance, sea denial and precision strike missions. Their sensors, weapons and endurance will form a key layer of India’s maritime deterrence architecture.Equally important is the industrial legacy. By absorbing advanced submarine technologies, India positions itself for future indigenous designs and follow-on projects. MDL’s role would be strengthened, and a specialised domestic supply chain would be deepened.Project-75I marks one of the most consequential naval procurement decisions India has taken in years. It addresses hard lessons from 1971, recent operational realities with Pakistan, and the growing challenge posed by China’s undersea expansion.As Germany’s chancellor arrives in India, the submarine negotiations underscore how defence industrial cooperation has become central to New Delhi’s foreign policy. From Karachi’s burning docks in 1971 to the silent depths of the Indian Ocean today, India’s maritime strategy is being reshaped through capability, indigenisation and strategic foresight.","Project-75i is the indian navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel-electric submarines equipped with fuel-cell-based air-independent propulsion, advanced sensors, torpedoes and missile systems.

NEW DELHI: Lauding India's Gen Z, PM Narendra Modi on Monday said it is full of creativity as he emphasised that his govt's reforms have opened countless opportunities for them in contrast with the stifling rules of the previous UPA govt that caught them in a web of compliances and curbed their entrepreneur spirit.Speaking at Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue to commemorate Swami Vivekananda 's birth anniversary, he said no country can develop without self-confidence and told the largely young audience that it is their responsibility to end the ""slave mindset"" that afflicted a generation of Indians due to the education policy of Thomas Macaulay.His laudatory words for Gen Z, which has ruled global headlines for a while largely due to a string of anti-govt protests it has spearheaded in different countries, including in neighbouring Bangladesh, have come against the backdrop of a few opposition leaders referring to their agitations outside and seeking to coopt them in their agitation against the PM Modi govt. The Rahul Gandhi-led Congress campaign against alleged ""vote chori"" reached out to the young generation in its bid to ""save"" democracy.PM Modi said that India's youth with its innovative ideas, energy and purpose is at the forefront of nation-building. Ruing the ""slavery mindset"", he said imported products were seen as a ""guarantee"" of quality, while Indian goods and traditions were looked at with an inferiority complex, urging the young generation to follow Vivekananda who was open to best practices from abroad but took on the misconception spread about India's heritage.Turning to the rich legacy of Indian storytelling, including epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata, he suggested that the new crop of entrepreneurs in the gaming sector can develop mythological stories into games and take them global. ""Our Hanuman ji can dominate gaming in the world,"" he said, adding that it will export Indian culture in a modern way.He contrasted the opening of a string of sectors ranging from space to nuclear power and defence and easing of regulations and taxes ushered by his govt with the UPA era, which, he said, was accused of policy paralysis and its inability to implement things on ground.So many rules and restrictions existed at the time that youth had few choices, and even applying for a job or a loan from banks demanded a web of compliances, he added.He said, ""As a CM and now as PM, I have put a lot of trust in the young generation, your capability and talent.""

Supreme Court to examine immunity for CEC & ECs after PIL flags 'law unto itself' risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-examine-immunity-for-cec-ecs-after-pil-flags-law-unto-itself-risk/articleshow/126492154.cms,"NGO’s S N Shukla said Supreme Court, in the M S Gill case, had ruled that it should not make Election Commission a law unto itself

, NGO tells SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has agreed to test the constitutional validity of a law giving lifelong immunity to the Chief Election Commissioner and election commissioners from civil and criminal prosecution after a PIL alleged it would make the Election Commission a law unto itself, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.After hearing arguments from S N Shukla for NGO 'Lok Prahari', a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi issued notices to the Union govt and EC, and sought their responses. ""We will examine whether it is constitutionally permissible to give CEC and ECs (election commissioners) such immunity from prosecution,"" the bench said Monday.NGO ‘Lok Prahari’ challenged Section 16 of CEC and Other ECs (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023, which provided that “...no court shall entertain or continue any civil or criminal proceedings against any person who is or was a chief election commissioner or an election commissioner for any act, thing or word, committed, done or spoken by him when, or in the course of acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty or function”.The NGO’s S N Shukla said Supreme Court in the M S Gill case, while giving Election Commission independence and autonomy to conduct elections, had ruled that it should not make EC a law unto itself.The present provision would enable the CEC and election commissioners to act in an unaccountable manner and could jeopardise free and fair elections, which is the basic requirement of a democracy. The NGO alleged that Section 16 was not part of the original bill tabled in Parliament in Aug, 2023 and was surreptitiously introduced “as an afterthought in the last-minute amendment to the bill at the time of debate on the bill in Dec, 2023 without giving any valid reason and adequate justification in support of it”.Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, had recently targeted the CEC and election commissioners by saying if Congress and its allies came to office at Centre, it would disband this immunity and change the law retrospectively to hold them accountable for any past wrongdoings in the conduct of elections.The NGO said Section 16 is against the settled law that no one is above the law, and pointed out govt gave no reason for hurried inclusion of immunity clause for CEC and election commissioners. The petitioner claimed that such immunity is not available to the President, governors or judges. The NGO alleged the offending clause was not discussed during the debate on the bill and that “the amendment was put to vote in a rushed hush hush manner”. The petitioner said, “Evidently, the approval of the House on the said amendment was obtained and given without application of mind.” It said, “The blanket permanent immunity from all civil or criminal proceedings against any present or former CEC or election commissioners is not only against the constitutional scheme and the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.”","Ngo’s s n shukla said supreme court, in the m s gill case, had ruled that it should not make election commission a law unto itself.present provision could jeopardise free and fair elections, ngo tells sc.

Once implemented, this move will partially undo the impact on Indian (and many other foreign) travellers caused by Brexit six years ago.At the time of Brexit to “hurt” each others’ airlines, the UK and EU mandated a transit visa will be required for travelling to one via the other. Which means, an Indian going from Delhi to London via Frankfurt will require a transit Schengen visa to get on the connecting flight. Similarly, an Indian travelling from Mumbai to Munich via London will require a transit UK visa to take the connecting flight.The UK is a huge market for Lufthansa and Air India. Once implemented, this development will again enable Lufthansa to fly travellers (both flying it and code share ones on Air India) from India via its hubs in Germany to the UK. There are also some other visa-free destinations also which Indians can now travel to & from by transiting from Germany, like those in the Caribbean.Transit visa requirements must be kept in mind while booking tickets. There have been numerous cases when people booked via some unscrupulous agents or online travel agencies (OTAs) by just seeing the lowest price. For instance, travelling from India to Canada on an American carrier (for just transiting via the US) means the passengers must have a US visa.Similarly, going from India to the US via Canada means a transit visa for the latter is required.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manish Tewari said that there should be a deep study of Gen Z protests that brought down govts in three South Asian countries in last three years to check if they were organic movements arising out of grievances.Tewari said these movements should be examined for critical difference between autonomous agitations over grievances, and agitations driven by narratives where grievances may have been weaponised. Though he did not point at any country which could have virtually carried out coups in Asia in the name of youth protests, his remark suggested that suspicions could not be simply brushed off. Starting with Sri Lanka, protests brought down elected govts in Nepal and Bangladesh - all in the Indian neighbourhood.The note of caution came as Tewari spoke about the turbulent contemporary world, from Venezuela to Bangladesh to Greenland to Ukrainian invasion, at the launch of his new book, 'A World Adrift'. The book was released by former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha at IIC, and the gathering included P Chidambaram, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Vivek Tankha, Mukul Wasnik, and a host of foreign delegates, among others.Tewari dismissed the belief that ""India has lost Bangladesh"" after protests toppled the Sheikh Hasina govt that set in motion developments which have increased the friction between India and Bangladesh. He said India invested blood and treasure in creating Bangladesh under Indira Gandhi, and ""that reality is not lost on people of Bangladesh"".

Ahmedabad: Kites, colour and camaraderie defined Monday morning at the Sabarmati Riverfront as Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed German Chancellor Friedrich Merz to the International Kite Festival 2026. Sharing an open vehicle, the leaders tried their hand at kite-flying, drawing cheers from spectators.What followed was a sweeping visual of global participation, with kitists from over 50 countries filling the skyline. The event blended diplomacy, tradition and spectacle into a single, soaring narrative.The two leaders moved through the festival arena, pausing to steady their kites against strong gusts and exchanging smiles with cheering spectators. At one point, they stopped to interact with a kitist team from Germany, underscoring the cultural connect the event seeks to foster.The high-profile inauguration followed the leaders' visit to Sabarmati Ashram, where they paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi. As Modi and Merz arrived at the Riverfront, the sky filled with colour as more than 300 kitists from across India and 50 other countries sent their creations aloft.The display included kites depicting Lord Hanuman, the Indian national flag, and themes such as Operation Sindoor and Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family), alongside large-tailed kites carrying messages like ""#GUJARAT IKF2026"", ""Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi"", ""Atmanirbhar Bharat"" and ""I Love Modi"".The welcome was marked by a specially curated cultural programme, highlighted by an Indo-German musical symphony performed by 108 musicians. The ensemble greeted the German delegation with a traditional German tune rendered using classical Indian instruments, including the sitar, flute and tabla, blending musical traditions from both countries.Adding a strong local flavour to the event was a life-size replica of a pol, the traditional neighbourhood of Ahmedabad's Unesco World Heritage-listed Walled City. The installation recreated narrow lanes, ""otla"" (outdoor seating space) or extended verandas, and characteristic house facades, with a giant ""chabutaro"" (bird feeder) forming the centrepiece. Prime Minister Modi guided Chancellor Merz through the makeshift pol, showcasing the craft of kite-making and tracing the history of kite-flying in India through exhibits, dioramas and live demonstrations by artisans.From the Riverfront promenade, the leaders also took in views of the Sabarmati as fireworks and colourful smoke displays were set off on the opposite bank, adding to the festive atmosphere. The broader cultural showcase included music and performances that reflected India's regional diversity, reinforcing the festival's role as a meeting point of traditions.For participants, the event remains a unique platform. Kitist Paavan Solanki from Ahmedabad said the International Kite Festival had expanded steadily in both scale and reputation. ""The gathering allows kitists from different countries to interact and learn about new ideas and techniques from each other. Ahmedabad has emerged as a global destination for kite enthusiasts because of its enthusiastic crowd and deep-rooted kite culture,"" he said.Large numbers of citizens lined the Sabarmati Riverfront to witness the spectacle of kites filling the sky. The festival is open to the public on Jan 12 and Jan 13, with Jan 13 marking the first-ever celebration of night Uttarayan, adding a new dimension to one of Gujarat's most cherished festivals.","Indian prime minister narendra modi and german chancellor friedrich merz attended the international kite festival 2026.

"Real friends can disagree but still resolve differences, says US envoy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trade-deal-on-next-call-today-says-new-us-envoy-in-delhi/articleshow/126492239.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The US embassy belted out Hold On, I’m Coming, a 1960s classic President Donald Trump used in his election rallies, to welcome Ambassador Sergio Gor as he walked into his new office Monday, hitting all the right notes while declaring that his clear mission was to take the relationship to the next level.Gor backed the trade deal under discussion saying both sides are determined to achieve it, endorsed cooperation in counterterrorism, energy and technology, invited India to join the US-led Pax Silica initiative on supply chain security and asserted no partner is more essential than India.However, while he described Trump’s friendship with PM Narendra Modi as real, Gor said the president could visit India “hopefully in the next year or two”. The remark suggests that the already delayed Quad summit that India must host might have to wait longer.Gor addressed the embassy staff and media on his first day in office, even before officially presenting his credentials, indicating he won’t be dictated by conventions in performing his new role. The ambassador said that the US and India are bound not just by shared interests, but by a relationship anchored at the highest levels, and real friends can disagree but always resolve their differences in the end.“Last week, our great Secretary of State Marco Rubio powerfully stated that this year will be a year of reciprocity. We are raising the standard for diplomacy itself. That means fair trade, mutual respect, and shared security,” said Gor, adding both sides continue to actively engage for the trade and the next call on the issue would take place on Tuesday.""Remember, India is the world's largest nation, so it's not an easy task to get this across the finish line, but we are determined to get there. And while trade is very important for our relationship, we will continue to work closely together on other very important areas such as security, counterterrorism, energy, technology, education, and health,” he added while delivering his arrival speech. Despite the differences, both sides have been close to finalising the deal for a while now and India said last week it remained interested in a mutually beneficial trade deal between two complementary economies and looked forward to concluding it.On Pax Silica, a US flagship initiative on AI and reliable supply chain, Gor said that as the world adopts new technology, it is essential that India and the United States work together from the very start of this initiative. Only close US partners like the UK, Japan, South Korea and Israel were invited so far to join the effort that is meant to also challenge China’s dominance in high-end technology.Addressing the embassy staff, Gor said they had an opportunity to redefine diplomacy and accomplish what could be the most consequential global partnership of this century. “No partner is more essential than India. In the months and years ahead, it is my goal as ambassador to pursue a very ambitious agenda. We will do this as true strategic partners, each bringing strength, respect, and leadership to the table,” said Gor, who was welcomed with a musical extravaganza that played MAGA and Trump favourites like YMCA by Village People and November Rain by Guns N Roses. According to diplomatic sources, the playlist which also included songs like Ring of Fire by Johnny Cash and Hello by Lionel Richie was chosen by Gor himself.Gor was effusive in his praise of Modi, calling him an incredible and great PM. “I was with the President last week, and as we had dinner right after New Year's, he recounted his incredible experience visiting here and also his great friendship with the great Prime Minister of India, Prime Minister Modi,” said Gor, a close Trump aide in his previous role. “I've traveled all over the world with President Trump, and I can attest that his friendship with Prime Minister Modi is real,” said Gor, who is expected to present his credentials to President Droupadi Murmu this week.","Gor backed the trade deal under discussion saying both sides are determined to achieve it.

'Real Friends Can Disagree, But...': US Envoy Sergio Gor On India-US Ties, Comments On Trade Deal

NEW DELHI: US ambassador-designate to India Sergio Gor on Monday underlined the strength of ties between New Delhi and Washington, saying President Donald Trump shares a genuine personal relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and that the two countries remain firmly bound despite occasional disagreements.“I have travelled all over the world with President Trump, and I can attest that his friendship with Prime Minister Modi is real. The United States and India are bound, not just by shared interests but by a relationship anchored at the highest levels,"" Gor said.""Real friends can disagree but always resolve their differences in the end,” he added amid ongoing negotiations over tariffs and a proposed India-US trade deal.Recalling President Trump’s recent interactions with Prime Minister Modi, Gor said the US President often spoke of his visit to India and the personal rapport he shares with PM Modi.""During my last dinner with him, President Trump recounted his last visit to India and also his great friendship with the great Prime Minister of India. I hope the President will be visiting us soon, hopefully in the next year or two.

Gold and silver futures climbed to new all-time highs on Monday, as investors reacted to a mix of geopolitical flashpoints and growing concerns around the US Federal Reserve and its leadership.Safe-haven demand strengthened after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the Department of Justice had served subpoenas on the central bank and warned of a possible criminal indictment. The action relates to his June testimony on the Fed’s $2.5-billion renovation of two office buildings, a project that has been sharply criticised by President Donald Trump as excessive.In the domestic market, gold futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) for February delivery surged Rs 2,431, or 1.8%, to a record Rs 1,41,250 per 10 grams. The metal has added Rs 3,058 over the past week, reflecting a rise of 2.25%.Silver prices recorded an even stronger move. March futures jumped Rs 11,271, or 4.46%, to hit a lifetime high of Rs 2,63,996 per kilogram on the MCX. Over the last week, silver has gained Rs 16,409, translating into a 6.94% increase.International bullion markets mirrored the rally. On the Comex, gold futures for February delivery advanced $111.8, or 2.5%, to reach a fresh peak of $4,612.7 per ounce.Silver futures for March delivery rose $4.56, or 5.8%, touching a historic high of $83.90 per ounce.Market experts said the surge was driven by heightened unease over the Federal Reserve after US federal prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into Powell concerning the renovation of the Fed’s Washington headquarters.The development comes amid escalating tensions between the White House and the central bank, which Trump has repeatedly criticised for failing to cut interest rates as sharply as he prefers.Analysts said the probe has amplified fears about the Fed’s independence, raising doubts over the direction and stability of US monetary policy and prompting investors to move into safe-haven assets such as gold and silver.The rally was further supported by weakness in the US currency. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was trading lower at 99.03.Geopolitical risks also weighed on sentiment. Analysts pointed to comments that President Trump is considering military action against Iran following violent anti-government protests, saying Tehran had crossed a ""red line"".At the same time, the United Nations has called an emergency meeting after allegations that Russia deployed a new ballistic missile during a large-scale strike on Ukraine.Together, these factors have deepened uncertainty across global markets, pressured the dollar and reinforced investor demand for safe-haven assets.","Gold futures on the multi commodity exchange (mcx) for february delivery surged rs 2,431, or 1.8%, to a record rs 1,41,250 per 10 grams.

Canada updated its country-wise travel alert in the first week of January and advised Canadians to avoid traveling to a list of countries. This takes into account political tension, flight situations, internal protests etc.Canada advises its nationals to avoid all travel to Iran due to ongoing nationwide demonstrations, tensions in the region, the high risk of arbitrary detention and the unpredictable enforcement of local laws. ""The Iranian authorities have arrested and/or detained individuals, including foreign and dual nationals, to exert political or diplomatic influence on their governments. You should leave Iran if you can do so safely. Many airlines have suspended flights to and from Iran at this time, but there are overland crossing options.

'Ross is Christian, conservative,' says father

Is Ross' wife Filipina?





Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Nicole Good on a snowy street in south Minneapolis during a confrontation on Wednesday as she tried to drive away, as debate continued over whether his actions were justified.Trump administration figures, including President Donald Trump, defended Ross and claimed that Good was an agitator who attempted to run him over with her SUV. Witnesses told NBC News that it did not appear Ross was in the direct path of Good’s SUV as she tried to evade ICE officers.Ross served in the military and worked for the govt for years before the shooting. As a member of the Indiana National Guard, he was deployed to Iraq from November 2004 to November 2005, NBC news reported.Specialist Ross of the 138th Signal Battalion earned the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal, among others, according to the guard.Court documents showed that during his time in Iraq, Ross was a machine gunner on a combat logistical patrol team. After he returned home, Ross joined the US Border Patrol in 2007 in El Paso, Texas, and worked for the agency until 2015 as a field intelligence agent who gathered and analysed information on drug cartels and human traffickers.Ed Ross, 80, defended his son’s decision to shoot Good, in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail.""'She hit him,' said Ed Ross, 80. 'He also had an officer whose arm was in the car. He will not be charged with anything.'You would never find a nicer, kinder person,' the father added about his son. 'He's a committed, conservative Christian, a tremendous father, a tremendous husband. I couldn't be more proud of him.'""The father, from North Pekin, Illinois, said his son’s wife was a US citizen but declined to say how long she had been in the US. ""'I do not want to go any further than that,' he added.""Neighbors told the Daily Mail that Ross is a hardcore MAGA supporter.His 38-year-old wife, whose doctor parents lived in the Philippines, married him in August 2012, according to posts on her Instagram page. Her first picture with Ross on the social media account was posted two months earlier.In July 2013, when the couple lived around El Paso, Texas, Ross’s wife posted a picture posing next to a US Border Patrol helicopter. She also shared photos of baking recipes from a Spanish-language cookbook.One neighbour at Ross’s 10-house cul-de-sac told the Daily Mail that until recently Ross had been flying pro-Trump flags and a 'Don't Tread On Me' Gadsden Flag, an emblem of the Make America Great Again movement.","Minnesota ice killing: jonathan ross pulled the trigger on american; 'has history of violence...' transforms into 'ross is christian, conservative,' says father.

'Prepared For War': Iran's Araghchi Blasts Trump, Warns Of Military Consequences If Threats Continue

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran, stepping up pressure on Tehran over its violent crackdown on nationwide protests.Trump said the tariffs would take effect immediately.

Which US states are most likely to see the Nothern lights this week

Washington

Montana

North Dakota

South Dakota also falls well within the viewing zone for this event.

Can people farther south see anything at all

What is causing this aurora event

Clouds and city lights change the experience





Northern skies do not usually proclaim themselves. Most nights are calm, even when something faraway moves above the earth. This week is little different. A pulse of solar activity is travelling across Earth's magnetic field, and this change could be enough to bring the northern lights into view in portions of the United States. It is not guaranteed, and it will not appear the same everywhere. Some people may notice a gentle tint on the horizon, while others may see nothing. However, for a brief period in early January, the odds shift somewhat. Space weather forecasters and sky watchers are keeping a tight eye on the darkness, hoping it may reveal something unexpected rather than being empty for once during the harshest stretch of winter evenings.The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do. Alaska remains the most reliable place, almost separate from the rest of the map when it comes to aurora watching. Parts of:These areas lie closer to where Earth’s magnetic field funnels charged particles into the atmosphere. NOAA forecasts suggest activity could peak overnight between January 8 and January 9, though timing often slips by hours. In these states, the lights may form brighter arcs or slow-moving curtains rather than faint smudges.Even then, nothing is promised. Auroras are known for appearing briefly and fading without warning.States a little below the usual aurora belt are not entirely out of luck. Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine often sit on the edge during moderate geomagnetic storms, and this week could be another of those moments. The display in these places is usually subtle. Colour may appear washed out, sometimes closer to grey than green. It often stays low in the northern sky, easy to mistake for a cloud or distant glow. Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, and parts of New York fall into a similar category. For viewers there, seeing the aurora often depends on patience and expectations. Many who do catch it only realise later when photos reveal more than the eye noticed at the time.The trigger comes from the Sun, though not in a dramatic, cinematic way. A coronal mass ejection has sent a stream of charged particles outward, interacting with a co rotating interaction region already moving through space. Together, they disturb Earth’s magnetic field just enough to produce a G1-level geomagnetic storm. That rating is considered minor, but minor does not mean invisible. It simply means effects are more local and less intense. Space weather remains difficult to predict with precision. Solar wind speed, density, and direction can all shift suddenly. Forecasts improve as the storm arrives, but uncertainty never fully disappears.Even the strongest aurora means little under thick cloud. Cloud cover remains the biggest reason people miss these events, regardless of solar activity. Clear skies matter more than most other factors. Light pollution is the next obstacle. Urban lighting can wash out faint auroras entirely, especially in southern locations. Rural areas, coastal stretches, and dark sky parks offer better odds. Many experienced observers suggest letting your eyes adjust and avoiding phone screens for a while. Cameras often see more than humans do, especially in low light modes. Sometimes the night still looks empty. Sometimes it does not. That uncertainty is part of the pull.","A pulse of solar activity is travelling across earth's magnetic field.
