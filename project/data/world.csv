NEW DELHI: Former Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday rejected the Delhi exit poll results that projected big win for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and placed the ruling party at distant second.""Some agencies are showing that the party of abuse is winning more than 55 seats. In the last two hours, our 16 candidates have received calls saying, 'Leave AAP and join their party, we will make you a minister and give each of you 15 crores',"" Kejrwal said in a post on X after two more agencies projected clean sweep for BJP.""If their party is getting more than 55 seats, why do they need to call our candidates?""

NEW DELHI: Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh has been witnessing an ugly consequence of human-wildlife conflict, with wild a leopard loitering unrestrained in the city, which only last year dealt with the menace of wolves.Five people were injured in Bahraich's Bargadwa village on Thursday in recent incidents of leopard attacks, which have petrified the hamlet.""Leopard attacked five people... it stays in the village and daily takes away dogs as well as children...,"" recounted victim Shankardayal in a conversation with news agency ANI.Panic crept in Bargadwa Thursday morning after a leopard targeted five people, three of whom are being treated and two have been referred for further care.""A case will be filed by tonight and financial assistance will be provided to the injured,"" said Katarniaghat Bahraich DFO B Shivshankar.Regarding the human-wildlife conflict, the forest department advised people not to go alone into sugarcane fields or leave meat or livestock outside.""Leopards tend to avoid groups, so staying in pairs or groups can help prevent attacks,"" Shivshankar said.In 2024, October, villagers in panic-stricken Mahsi tehsil of Bahraich district killed a sixth wolf.According to forest officials, that was the last of the ""killer"" pack that terrorised over 55 villages in the region since March, claiming nine lives and injuring over 50 in a series of wolf attacks.Residents of Tamachpur village said that the wolf had tried to attack a child sleeping next to his mother in the courtyard of a house in the village, but on hearing the mother's screams, the wolf ran away and attacked a goat there.Later, the villagers surrounded the wolf and beat it to death, they said.Earlier on September 10, a fifth wolf was captured as part of the ""Operation Bhediya"" campaign that was ongoing in the region to catch the ""killer"" pack.","Five people were injured in bahraich's bargadwa village on thursday.

"No 'sheesh mahal, AAP-da' jibes in PM Modi's Rajya Sabha speech, focus back on Congress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-speech-aapda-sheesh-mahal-aap-congress-rahul-gandhi-arvind-kejriwal-delhi-assembly-elections-motion-of-thanks-on-presidents-address/articleshow/117988846.cms,"PM Modi in Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: Two speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Parliament in the space of three days ... first a day before the Delhi assembly elections and the second a day after voting in Delhi was over. What was the difference?Well, the second speech had no references to "" sheesh mahal "" and ""AAP-da"" unlike the first one in Lok Sabha during which these two terms were used quite a few times by the Prime Minister. The focus in Rajya Sabha was back on the Congress , and in full force, as it has been in the past in most of the Prime Minister's speeches.In his reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Prime Minister Modi had targeted both Congress, AAP and took digs at their leaders Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal over a range of issues without taking any names.The terms ""sheesh mahal and AAP-da"" - which were used extensively by the Prime Minister and other BJP leaders during campaigning for Delhi assembly elections - were used in the Lok Sabha speech quite a few times.""Sheesh mahal"" was a reference to BJP's charge of splurge of public money by Arvind Kejriwal in the renovation of his CM house. The BJP had released several videos showing Kejriwal's extravagance and opulence in CM house. On the other hand, the term ""AAP-da"" was used by PM Modi in his election rallies to suggest that the AAP government in Delhi was a disaster for its people.In his Lok Sabha speech, PM Modi said: ""Some leaders are focusing on jacuzzi and stylish showers in homes, but our focus is on providing water to every home. After 75 years of independence, 70-75% of the country's population, i.e. more than 16 crore households, did not have tap water connection. Our government has provided tap water to 12 crore families in 5 years and that work is progressing rapidly.""Referring to his government's resolve of helping the poor, PM Modi said ""Earlier, the headlines of the newspapers used to be related to scams and corruption. 10 years have passed and crores of rupees have been saved which has been used for the public. We have taken several steps which have saved a lot of money, but we have not used that money to build a 'sheesh mahal', instead we have used that money to build the nation.""Later, in his speech discussing the government's resolve to help the youth, PM Modi said: ""We have been working continuously by keeping the future of youth in mind. But there are a few parties that are deceiving the youth. They promise allowances at the time of elections but do not fulfill those promises. These parties are 'AAP-da' on the future of youth.""All these references in Prime Minister's Lok Sabha speech were oblique references to Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party which was in direct contest with the BJP in Delhi assembly elections. Delhi voted for a new assembly on February 5.PM Modi's second speech today, in Rajya Sabha, did not mention these terms even once. There was no reference to ""sheesh mahal"" or AAP-da in the entire speech. Prime Minister Modi was once again unsparing in his attacks on the Congress.The Prime Minister accused the Congress of adopting a policy of 'family first' and appeasement. He criticised the grand-old-party for having ""hatred and anger"" towards BR Ambedkar and said this was reflected in not giving due recognition like the 'Bharat Ratna' to the architect of India's Constitution.PM Modi also hit out at the economic policies of the Congress government and the 'licence quota raj' that gave rise to corruption and affected the country's economic progress and growth.He also said the entire Hindu community was blamed and its image tarnished across the world for the economic mismanagement and wrong policies of the Congress 'royal family' that led to slow growth, which was coined as the 'Hindu rate of growth'.The Prime Minister also targeted the Congress government for imposing Emergency in the country during which the entire opposition was put behind bars and hand-cuffed. He also cited several examples of film stars, singers and writers against whom action was taken for not lauding the Congress during that time.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders, he said those carrying copies of the Constitution have scant respect for it as he recalled how Nehru amended the Constitution during his first stop-gap government curtailing the freedom of speech and expression of common people and did not even wait for elections in doing so.","Two speeches of prime minister narendra modi in parliament in the space of three days.

He knows how to run the administration. He has got experience both as Prime Minister and chief minister. He is the only tallest leader in the country,” claimed the former PM.Nadda’s denial however sought to set the record straight; he lost no time in refuting the claim, saying that not only has the matter (NDA vice-chairmanship) never come up for discussion within the NDA but that all allies have resolved to stand firmly with the govt led by PM Modi.","Former prime minister h d deve gowda claims chandrababu naidu wanted to be vice-chairman of the ‘nda’ the claim, of course, was immediately denied by leader of the house in rajya sabha j p nadda.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117988913,imgsize-872354,width-400,resizemode-4/117988913.jpg"

'Indians insulted' - Opposition protests in Parliament

Also Read:

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday briefed Parliament on the recent deportation of 104 illegal Indian immigrants from the United States. Clarifying that the deportation process ""was not a new one"" and had been ongoing for several years, Jaishankar informed Rajya Sabha that a total of 15,668 illegal Indian immigrants have been deported to India from the US since 2009.A day earlier, a US military plane carrying 104 deported Indians landed in Amritsar. Rejecting all the opposition's charges, the minister also addressed the ""handcuff"" charges, Jaishankar said deportations by the US are organised and executed by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities and ""the standard operating procedure for deportations by aircraft used by ICE that is effective from 2012, provides for the use of restraints"".""However, we have been informed by ICE that women and children are not restrained. Further, the needs of deportees during transit related to food and other necessities, including possible medical emergencies are attended to,"" he said.During toilet breaks deportees are temporarily unrestrained if needed in that regard, the minister said, adding, ""this is applicable to chartered civilian aircraft as well as military aircraft"".""There has been no change from past procedures for the flight undertaken by the US on February 5, 2025,"" Jaishankar said.First, let's understand how the deportation process works in the US. According to NBC News, the process begins with an arrest.This could happen during a routine traffic stop, a workplace raid, or, in the case of individuals with criminal histories, a raid at the house.Following the arrest, immigrants are transferred to an ICE detention facility, which may be local or a few hours away. ICE currently operates over 100 facilities in the US with the capacity to hold up to 41,500 individuals.Immigrants who have arrived in the US within the past two years may face expedited removal, bypassing an immigration judge and being deported within weeks. Those who have been in the country longer could face years of legal proceedings before deportation for now.If a judge issues a “final order of removal,” the individual is typically flown to one of four staging locations along the southwest border—Mesa, Arizona; Alexandria, Louisiana; and San Antonio and Harlingen, Texas — either on a commercial airline or one of ICE’s 10 planes. At these staging facilities, detainees stay for a few days before being transported back to the airport for deportation.The Trump administration, however, has also started using military planes to deport immigrants. One such aircraft, the C-17 Globemaster, landed in Amritsar with 140 Indian deportees.Both the Houses, however, saw several disruptions by the opposition over the treatment of Indians sent back from the US.Earlier in the day, opposition leaders, including Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Akhilesh Yadav and those from the Left parties, protested by staging a demonstration in Parliament complex.Some of the opposition leaders protested while wearing handcuffs.Carrying placards that read ""Humans. Not prisoners"", the opposition leaders said they would not tolerate the insult to India and raised slogans such as ""Indians insulted. India won't stay silent"" against the government.""We, the INDIA parties, shall not tolerate the humiliation of Indian nationals,"" they said.","The external affairs minister s jaishankar briefed parliament on the recent deportation of 104 illegal indian immigrants from the united states.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/latest-income-tax-slabs-2025-26-how-much-tax-do-individuals-earning-slightly-above-rs-12-lakh-have-to-pay-marginal-relief-calculations-explained/articleshow/117911656.cms,"Budget 2025 income tax: The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs. 12,75,000/-.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 post Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ZERO or NIL tax liability for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in the Union Budget 2025 under the new income tax regime. For salaried individuals, including the standard deduction, this limit is Rs 12.75 lakh under the new regime.But what about individuals with taxable income slightly above Rs 12 lakh? Will they have to pay more income tax than their additional earnings above Rs 12 lakh? Will someone earning Rs 12,10,000 face a Rs 61,500 tax burden versus an individual earning Rs 10,000 less who will pay nothing?There's good news! Here's where the concept of marginal relief comes us. Individuals with income slightly above Rs 12 lakh, which is the nil tax threshold, will receive fair treatment through marginal tax relief.For example, for a person having income of Rs 12, 10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax works out to be Rs 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakh + 10% of 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10,000). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-)Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-Marginal relief examples:It's important to note that rebate is offered to individuals with taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new tax regime. This is different from marginal relief for taxpayers whose earnings slightly exceed Rs 12 lakh.
