What’s on PM Modi’s agenda



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Argentina on a two-day visit. He will hold talks with the top leadership of the country to review existing cooperation and explore ways to strengthen ties in important areas.PM Modi landed at the Ezeiza International Airport on Friday evening (local time), where he was given a ceremonial welcome.

Modi had earlier visited the country in 2018 to attend the G20 Summit.""Landed in Buenos Aires for a bilateral visit which will focus on augmenting relations with Argentina. I’m eager to be meeting President Javier Milei and holding detailed talks with him,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.This is the third stop in his ongoing five-nation tour. Before this, he was in Trinidad and Tobago.PM Modi’s visit to Argentina is the first Indian bilateral prime ministerial visit in over five decades. According to the ministry of external affairs, the visit is expected to deepen the strategic partnership between India and Argentina.In his departure statement, PM Modi said, ""Argentina is a key economic partner in Latin America and a close collaborator in the G20.""He also said he looked forward to discussions with President Javier Milei, whom he had met last year.Argentina holds the world’s second-largest shale gas reserves and the fourth-largest shale oil reserves. It also has significant conventional oil and gas deposits, positioning it as a potential long-term energy partner for India.The country is also rich in critical minerals such as lithium, copper, and rare earth elements. These are important for India’s plans for clean energy and industrial growth. Along with Bolivia and Chile, Argentina is part of the Lithium Triangle, a region that holds a large share of the world’s lithium reserves.Lithium plays a central role in rechargeable batteries, which are used in electric vehicles, mobile phones, laptops, and systems that store renewable energy.Modi will hold wide-ranging talks with Argentina's President Javier Milei to explore cooperation in areas like defence, agriculture, mining, oil and gas, renewable energy, trade and investment.""We will focus on advancing our mutually beneficial cooperation, including in the areas of agriculture, critical minerals, energy, trade, tourism, technology, and investment,"" Modi had said.PM Modi will also visit the famous Boca Juniors Stadium to have a look at Argentine football, news agency ANI reported.

During that visit, six agreements were signed to expand ties, and Modi was conferred with 'The Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago’, which is the country's highest civilian honour.

"All eyes on India as Brics takes up US tariffs, Israel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-eyes-on-india-as-brics-takes-up-us-tariffs-israel/articleshow/122272731.cms,"NEW DELHI: While the Brics Declaration that will follow the two-day summit beginning Sunday is expected to factor in India's concerns on terrorism, it may also call upon India to take a stronger position on issues like US President Donald Trump's unilateral tariffs and Israel's actions in Gaza.Brics countries were engaged in intense negotiations to finalise the declaration as PM Narendra Modi arrived in Rio for the summit on Sunday. A draft statement under discussion proposed condemnation of US tariffs and some of Israel's actions in Gaza, issues on which India has nuanced its position given its efforts to reach a trade deal with the US before Jan 9, Trump's deadline for suspension of tariffs, and its balancing act on relations with Israel and Palestine.Brics - which was expanded last year to include Egypt, Ethiopia, UAE, Indonesia, Iran and Saudi Arabia as full members - has been an important platform for India to focus on issues like multilateral reforms, counterterrorism, sustainable development goals and people-to-people exchanges. Modi is expected to strongly raise the issue of cross-border terrorism in his address to further sensitise the international community about the role of Pakistan in promoting terrorism, as evident from the recent Pahalgam attack.The Brics Declaration will be followed closely for what it has to say on tariffs and the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. According to a Bloomberg report from Rio, going by a draft statement under discussion, Brics heads of govt are likely to adopt a position at odds with the Trump administration on tariffs and aspects of the conflict in the Middle East. The statement, however, doesn't name the Trump administration or the US on the tariff issue as not all countries apparently were comfortable with it.There's also a proposal for the leaders to express serious concern about the situation in Palestinian territory, citing the resumption of Israeli attacks and the obstruction of the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The language, according to the report, includes a condemnation of the use of starvation as a method of warfare - a reference to charges levelled at Israel.While it's not clear how much of the draft statement will appear in the final text that will be adopted on July 7, a proposal for full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip is also being deliberated. This may be a little off-putting for India which abstained from a UNGA vote recently for immediate ceasefire in Gaza.However, while India recently backed out of a statement by the SCO condemning Israel's attacks on Iran, it has been more flexible with Brics.","Brics countries were engaged in intense negotiations to finalise the declaration.

It is also more equal than every G7 and G20 country, many of which are considered advanced economies,"" said a govt note citing data from the multilateral agency.It said that India falls into the ""moderately low"" inequality category, which includes Gini scores between 25 and 30, and is only a fraction away from joining the ""low inequality"" group, which includes countries like the Slovak Republic with a score of 24.1, Slovenia at 24.3, and Belarus at 24.4.""Apart from these three, India has a better score than all of the other 167 countries for which the World Bank has released data,"" said the note from the social welfare department.Globally, just 30 countries fall into the ""moderately low"" inequality category. including several European countries with strong welfare systems.

The share of people living on less than 2.15 US dollars a day, which was the global threshold for extreme poverty till June 2025, fell sharply from 16.2% in 2011-12 to just 2.3% in 2022-23. Under World Bank's revised extreme poverty threshold of $3.00 per day, the 2022-23 poverty rate would be adjusted to 5.3%.The Gini Index measures how equally income, wealth or consumption is distributed across households or individuals in a country. It ranges in value from 0 to 100. A score of 0 means perfect equality. A score of 100 means one person has all the income, wealth or consumption and others have none, hence absolute inequality.

The Department of Defence said the research project would explore the use of towed array target motion analysis technology to improve the reliability, efficiency and interoperability of current surveillance capabilities.DSTG senior researcher Sanjeev Arulampalam explained that a towed array consists of a long linear array of hydrophones, towed behind a submarine or surface ship on a flexible cable. “We need to harness the best minds in innovation, science and technology to build new capabilities, to innovate at greater pace, and to strengthen our strategic partnerships.The hydrophones work together to listen to the undersea environment from various directions,” the Department of Defence cited Dr Arulampalam as saying.The project is the latest milestone in increasing maritime domain awareness cooperation between Australia and India. It is significant within the Quad framework— consisting of India, Australia, US and Japan — which seeks to counter China's growing maritime belligerence in the Indo-Pacific.The combination of target motion analysis with the towed array system is intended to manage noise corruption and explore performance improvements. The project would see novel algorithms being put to test, using the strengths and shared knowledge of the two countries. “It will involve the sharing of ideas, investigation trials, algorithm demonstrations and performance analysis,” Arulampalam said.The Department of Defence announcement comes after external affairs minister S.

Arms dealer 'linked to Vadra' now a fugitive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arms-dealer-linked-to-vadra-now-a-fugitive/articleshow/122272714.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Saturday declared arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari a fugitive economic offender, observing that failed extradition attempts does not make him an ""angel or immune from the prosecution for the violation of Indian laws"". The order, which was reserved by the court of Special Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal on May 24, was pronounced on Saturday.""Extradition attempt may have failed, but it will not make accused angel or immune from the prosecution for the violation of Indian laws. FEO proceedings are another way of making one come back to India to face trial by coercing him to return by attachment, confiscation of properties of such fugitive economic offender and proceeds of crime, and by disentitling the such fugitive economic offender from putting forward or defending any civil claim,"" the judge said in his 100-page judgment.""...this court is satisfied that Sanjay Bhandari is a fugitive economic offender under section 12(1) of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018, and is declared as such under the above provision(s)"" of the Act, he said.ED and I-T department had in the extradition proceedings claimed that Bhandari had undisclosed foreign income worth Rs 655 crore on which he evaded tax worth Rs 196 crore.The middleman in defence deals, allegedly a key factor in deals like that of trainer aircraft Pilatus, deposited huge amounts of money in bank accounts of overseas shell companies and also invested in properties in the UAE and the UK between 2009 and 2016.The case against Bhandari has an important political dimension - his alleged links with Robert Vadra , spouse of Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Robert is also being probed for his links with Bhandari, who fled to London when multiple agencies started investigating him in 2016.The judgment came on the ED's application filed under the Act in 2019. The court said the ""fugitive"" tag is to an individual who has committed schedule offence or offences involving an amount of Rs 100 crore or more and who has absconded or refused to return to avoid criminal prosecution.This will allow ED to confiscate his properties anywhere in the world and bar Bhandari, who is wanted by Indian agencies in multiple cases, from filing or defending any civil proceedings in India.The judge dismissed Bhandari's counsel's argument that the UK high court's order disallowing ED's plea for his extradition makes him eligible to stay in London, and therefore, FEO won't apply to him. ""The said argument is without any substance as the extradition failure will not make any difference as the extradition of the accused was one of the means to bring the accused to India to face trial in the said offence under Section 51 of the Black Money Act,"" the judge said.The court stressed Bhandari wilfully refused to return to face criminal prosecution, and said, ""...this court is satisfied that the total value of the schedule offence is Rs 100 crore or more i.e. the schedule to the present FEO Act which is Section 51 of Black Money Act.""The court also rejected Bhandari's contention that declaring him a fugitive economic offender entails very serious consequences, effectively amounting to economic death penalty. ""Bhandari always has an option to return... when he chooses not to return to India, he cannot take the plea of avoiding all the legal consequences...

"Dalai Lama issue: India can’t be compliant to China or seen as insensitive to Tibetans, says Robert Barnett",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dalai-lama-issue-india-cant-be-compliant-to-china-or-seen-as-insensitive-to-tibetans-robert-barnett/articleshow/122270325.cms,".

As someone who has studied Tibet closely, were you surprised by the Dalai Lama’s recent announcement regarding his succession, especially given his earlier remarks suggesting he might be the last incumbent?

Tell us about the history of this contentious golden urn method of picking a successor.

How do you anticipate Beijing will respond to this announcement? If China proceeds to name its own successor, are we looking at the possibility of two Dalai Lamas?

The Dalai Lama has suggested that his reincarnation could be found outside China. If that successor emerges from the Tibetan diaspora in India, what kind of diplomatic and political challenges might this pose for New Delhi?

How do you interpret China’s recent efforts in Tibet — including large-scale infrastructure projects, population resettlements, and the campaign to re-educate Tibetan children?

STRAP: Just days before his 90th birthday on July 6, the Dalai Lama — the revered spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism — declared that he would have a successor. The announcement is more than a theological decision since China has long sought control over the succession process. Neelam Raaj spoke to Robert Barnett, a leading Tibet scholar at SOAS, London, for insights into this high-stakes contest between faith and power.For many years, the Dalai Lama has been reminding the public that he can choose from innumerable options and alternatives in terms of his succession. Sometimes he expressed this in a light-hearted way, such as saying he might come back as a butterfly, while at other times he referred to not returning at all, or he listed little-known theological alternatives, such as transmitting his consciousness to another adult through a process called “trulwa” or emanation. But all of these alternatives were reminders that in Tibetan Buddhism it is the individual lama, and the karma of that individual lama, which decides how or whether a lama returns. Of course, these have all been messages to China and its rulers that their claim to have the sole right to control reincarnations makes little sense in the religious context. The Dalai Lama had also always said that the decision about whether he returns would depend on the wishes of his followers, and his officials spent the last year or more getting written opinions from the wider Buddhist community about that request.This process was partly ceremonial – it reflects a very traditional understanding that a lama reincarnates only if his or her followers request for him or her to do so. So, no one doubted that the community would ask the Dalai Lama to return, and his decision to reincarnate is not a surprise. But here again the Dalai Lama seems to be sending a message to China, namely that, unlike Beijing, his decisions and his legitimacy are not based on the use of force or the resort to traditional authority, but on processes of consent and consultation.Contemporary Chinese officials say that in 1792-3 an order was given by the then emperor of China requiring Tibetans to use a golden vase or urn as the final stage in deciding between three children identified as candidate reincarnations of a high lama. After reciting appropriate prayers, the winning name would be drawn from the urn. This claim is correct, and , , the golden urn system was used scores of times in Tibet and Mongolia and other areas to select reincarnations up until the early 1900s. The current Chinese government claims that it is thus merely invoking a long-running legal precedent that requires Tibetans today to only use the same system and at the same time to recognise that only the Chinese government can authorize and select reincarnations. However, there are major weaknesses in this claim. Firstly, there had been scarcely any mention or use of the golden urn system for nearly 100 years before Beijing abruptly reintroduced it in 1995. Secondly, the emperors in the past who were involved with reincarnations and the golden urn were not Chinese and their governments were not Chinese – they were Manchus and were Buddhist believers, and were regarded by Tibetans at the time in many cases as emanations of the Buddha. Thirdly, it is not clear that use of the urn had meant in the past that the government in Beijing was seen by Tibetans as a sign of imperial sovereignty; according to the pioneering work of the historian Max Oidtmann, the process seems to have been more one of cooperation between Tibetans and the Manchus rather than one imposed on the former by the latter. And fourthly, the Manchu involvement in reincarnations seems to have been often understood by Tibetans as a kind of available option at times of dispute, rather than a law they were required to follow. And in general, religions and their believers tend to give priority to traditions and beliefs, rather than state laws. So, Beijing’s invocation of 18th-century Manchu-Tibetan religious relations as proof of Chinese sovereignty today describes a world that seems vastly different from the contemporary situation.It seems very likely, now that the Dalai Lama has announced that there will be a 15th Dalai Lama, that China will feel required to assert its sovereignty in these matters by naming its own Dalai Lama. So we are looking at a future, after the lifetime of the present Dalai Lama, where there will be two competing Dalai Lamas. But this will not be like a medieval competition between two rival popes, because only one of these Dalai Lamas will have been selected according to religious traditions and with the imprimatur of the previous Dalai Lama – the one who will be selected by the exiles. The Chinese candidate will have been selected by the Chinese state, whose rulers are by definition atheists if not, at times, outright enemies of religion. So, the Chinese candidate is at risk of having limited credibility among the Buddhist community and worldwide. Yet we might want to keep in mind that everything we are reading about is at some level a process of signalling to China. So the Dalai Lama’s announcement is also an indirect reminder that if China wished to, it could still offer him a settlement. That settlement is actually easy to imagine, in theory: the Chinese could simply return to the position they took on reincarnation in the 1980s and the early 1990s, when they claimed only the right to confirm the choices made by the relevant lamas and did not claim any role in the reincarnation process or selection itself. But few people currently expect today’s Chinese leaders to make concessions.The succession of the Dalai Lama has become a controversy because of Beijing’s claim in 1995 to have sole authority over that process. Why did it make that claim, which is clearly one that would lead to conflict and dispute? One theory is that Chinese foreign policy strategists see an advantage in using this issue to advance China’s aims abroad. According to this theory, the succession issue provides a new opportunity for China’s diplomats to seek compliance from other governments – it provides an entry-point for China to call on those governments to support its claims and to denounce any claims or actions by the Tibetan exiles. If so, it’s a clever move, because most governments have few exiles and few Buddhists in their population. Such governments might feel it less costly to comply with China’s request than to refuse on what for them will seem a minor or obscure issue. But this is not, of course, the case for India, for whom such a request would have major implications in terms of soft power, international diplomacy, religious respect and even border negotiations. Whatever happens, India will be the chief focus among all nations of China’s strategic interests in this matter, and will likely come under significant Chinese pressure. India’s policy makers and diplomats will certainly be deploying all their skills and resources in order to find a way to respond to those pressures without seeming compliant to China or insensitive to Tibetan or religious priorities.It used to be rather difficult for outside analysts to characterise Chinese policies in Tibet – they varied, being sometimes extremely harsh and in other ways and at certain times less so. But since 2014 a new policy has emerged under Xi Jinping which is clear: minorities, including the Tibetans and others, are to be gradually “integrated” (jiaorong in Chinese) into the larger Chinese “community” or nation (Zhonghua minzu). It has also become clear that Xi Jinping has ordered this process to begin from early childhood, because since 2021 his government has required all kindergartens – and kindergarten attendance is more or less compulsory these days for children aged 3-5 or so – to teach primarily or solely in the Chinese language. These schools and preschools increasingly teach children about Chinese or Communist history and values, rather than Tibetan ones. So there are serious concerns about the extent to which the next generation of Tibetans, Uyghur, Mongols and others within China will have substantive knowledge of their mother-tongue or their culture. At the same time, China has been moving many thousands of rural and nomadic Tibetans to settlements in or near towns, or to remote border regions, sometimes for very unclear reasons, and this too is likely to have a dramatic impact on cultural traditions and identity. There will be practical benefits for some of these relocated people, in terms of work, medical access and knowledge of Chinese, but there is much uncertainty about the overall effect of what is an ongoing process of massive social and cultural engineering.","Dalai lama has suggested that his reincarnation could be found outside china.

The Congerss leader's post on X

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would ""meekly bow"" to US President Donald Trump , as New Delhi weighs its interests amid ongoing trade talks with Washington.Gandhi's remark was a reaction to Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal 's statement, where he said: ""We are not working towards any specific deadlines, we are working towards national interest"". Trump has set July 9 as the deadline for trade agreements.""Piyush Goyal can beat his chest all he wants, mark my words, Modi will meekly bow to the Trump tariff deadline,"" Gandhi wrote on X.The minister hit back at the Congress leader, saying: ""This is not the India under UPA rule, which would beg for negotiations not under national interest... Nobody takes Rahul Gandhi seriously anymore because of the negativity he, his colleagues, and his party consistently spread.""""They have lost the confidence of the people of India, who have time and again rejected the Congress. Till today, they have not been able to come up with any positive agenda for the development of the nation,"" Goyal told the news agency ANI.He said India negotiates with a position of strength and we are ""self-confident and can compete with anyone in the world"".""India does not negotiate under deadlines, we negotiate keeping national interests in mind. National interest is paramount in all our work across the world... Today India negotiates with a position of strength, we are self-confident and can compete with anyone in the world,"" he said.India will enter into a trade agreement with the US only if its interests are protected and it is able to sustain a tariff advantage over its competitors, while prioritising the interests of farmers, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said Friday.Trump had imposed reciprocal tariffs on nearly 100 countries but agreed to a 90-day pause that is to end Tuesday. India was slapped with 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs.There is uncertainty over whether India and US can agree to an early tranche or a mini deal before that even as a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement is negotiated by Fall (Sept-Oct) after a meeting between Trump and PM Modi. For India, lowering tariffs on farm products, such as maize and soybean, as well as dairy products is a concern.While Goyal did not get into the specifics, he said India will not compromise the interests of farm and dairy sectors.""Farmers' interest is always paramount for Modi government. In any negotiation we have done, you have seen UK, Australia, Mauritius, EFTA and UAE agreements, India's farmers have been protected.""The government has refrained from offering concessions in major agricultural products, but for US, it is the main focus. While some government officials said US demands were not very clear, for India, Goyal said Indian expectations for duty concessions in labour-intensive sectors were the focus of the trade deal. India was hoping for duty concessions in leather, footwear, textiles and some auto parts in return for reducing levies on automobiles and American whiskey.","Congress leader rahul gandhi on saturday claimed that prime minister narendra modi would ""meekly bow"" to us president donald trump.

Pakistan was in the front. China was providing all possible support. 81% of the military hardware with Pakistan is Chinese... China is able to test its weapons against other weapons, so it's like a live lab available to them.Turkey also played an important role in providing the type of support it did; they gave Bayraktar.

""This time, our population centres were not quite addressed, but next time, we need to be prepared for that.""He also shared operational details and takeaways from the mission, underlining that military planning was based on both technology and intelligence inputs. ""There are a few lessons from Operation Sindoor. The strategic messaging by leadership was unambiguous... There is no scope of absorbing the pain the way we did a few years ago... The planning and selection of targets was based on a lot of data that was collected using technology and human intelligence. So a total of 21 targets were actually identified, out of which nine targets we thought would be prudent to engage... It was only the final day or the final hour that the decision was taken that these nine targets would be engaged.""He added, ""A considered decision was taken that it will be tri-services approach to send the right message that we indeed are an integrated force... An important consideration was that we should always be at the top of the escalation ladder. When we reach a military objective, we should try and put a stop to it... War is easy to initiate, but it's very difficult to control.

Keanu Evans, the man who was reportedly attacked by an Indian-origin man on a plane, leading to the latter's arrest, said the viral video of the incident only showed half of what happened. 21-year-old Ishaan Sharma has been charged with battery and is facing a $500 bond after attacking Keanu on a flight to Miami from Philadelphia. A report in WSVN.com said that Sharma allegedly started a fight with Keanu Evans during the flight. Evans said the fight started for no reason.The video of the fight also went viral on social media. Upon landing on Monday night, Miami-Dade Sheriff’s Office deputies immediately handcuffed Sharma and took him into custody. Officials said he had a cut on his face and needed stitches.The report added that cell phone footage showed Evans and Sharma in the middle of the fight as other passengers urged them to stop. “Let him go,” said an unidentified passenger. “Stop, let him go.”A flight attendant reportedly also tried to break up the fight, but was unsuccessful. ""Sir, you have to sit down,” a flight attendant, seen on video, told both of them.Evans told 7News that he was attacked while simply returning to his seat and he did nothing to provoke Sharma. “What I hate is that the video doesn’t capture what started the whole thing, you know?” said Evans. “It only captures me defending myself.”Evans said, “He was doing some, like, dark laugh like, ha ha ha ha ha. And he was saying things like, you, you puny mortal man, if you challenge me, it will result in your death.”Evans said he then went to use the restroom and told the flight attendants what was going on. The flight attendants told him to push the button for assistance if the argument continued. Evans said he pushed the button as Sharma kept threatening him with death.“That’s what made me get up and press the button above me and I just turned around and I looked at him and I responded to him. A lot was going on, and immediately he just got up and he put his forehead on my forehead like he was challenging me.”Evans said the situation quickly escalated and Sharma was “looking at me very angrily and we’re looking eye to eye, forehead to forehead, and then he just grabs me by the throat and just starts choking me. At that moment it was, you know, fight or flight responses kick in. I’m in a tight, confined space on an aircraft, and all I can do is just defend myself”.“If you see on my face, I’ve got some scratches from him,” Evans said.Ishaan Sharma's lawyer claimed that the incident began when he was meditating.
