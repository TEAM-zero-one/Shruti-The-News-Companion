"'Pakistan repeatedly attack us': Shashi Tharoor in Panama says 'India continues to bear pain, grief, wounds and losses'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-repeatedly-attack-us-shashi-tharoor-in-panama-says-india-continues-to-bear-pain-grief-wounds-and-losses/articleshow/121452390.cms,"Picture: X/Shashi Tharoor

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , leading an all-party parliamentary delegation to Panama, used a public address to the Indian community to strongly condemn Pakistan ’s continued support for terrorism targeting India.Speaking at the Sociedad Hindostana de Panama, Tharoor said that India’s peaceful intentions have not been respected by Pakistan. “Our desire to be left alone has not been reciprocated. They have attacked us repeatedly because they want territory that we control, and which is part of our sovereign borders,” he said.He reminded the audience that India has endured nearly four decades of terror attacks, beginning with the conflict in Kashmir in 1989.""We have suffered attack after attack for almost four decades now. Going back from the first attacks in Kashmir in 1989 onwards, we have seen repeated outrageous civilian victims,"" Tharoor said. ""It is just not acceptable for us to continue to bear the pain, the grief, the wounds, the losses, and then merely go and tell the international community, look what is happening to us. Please help us. Please put pressure on the perpetrators,"" he added.Tharoor highlighted India’s shift in its counter-terrorism approach, referring to the 2016 surgical strikes in Uri and the 2019 Balakot air strikes. “For the first time, we crossed the Line of Control, and later even the international border, striking terror bases deep in Pakistani territory,” he said. He stressed that India’s actions sent a clear message to those behind the attacks: there will be consequences.He also defended Operation Sindoor , launched after the Pahalgam terror attack , where 26 Indian women were widowed.""Some women cried out The terrorists killed me too, and they said, 'No, go back, tell what happened to you. We heard, we heard their cries and India decided that the colour of the Sindoor, the vermilion colour on the forehead of our women, will also match the colour of the blood of the killers, the perpetrators, the attackers...""Tharoor also met Panama’s national assembly president Dana Castaneda. After the meeting he said, “When we presented the president with a shawl from Kashmir, where the Pahalgam tragedy occurred, she gave us a symbol of Panama’s warriors in return. She said she hopes we will fight terrorism with that same strength, and I thought that was an excellent message to leave the national assembly with.”The delegation observed a moment of silence in memory of the Pahalgam victims. Alongside Tharoor were MPs including Tejasvi Surya, Milind Deora, and former US ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu.Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora warned Pakistan against provoking India. “We are here to give a message—whether it's Kashmir or Mumbai, if you attack us, we will respond,” Deora said.BJP MP Shashank Mani added that while India does not seek war, it will stay firm on its path to development and not be derailed by external threats. “We showed patience for years. But when it went too far, we showed strength. We don’t seek war, but we also won’t let anyone derail our path towards Viksit Bharat,” he said.",Congress mp shashi tharoor is leading an all-party parliamentary delegation to panama.

NEW DELHI: The Northeast is a geostrategic asset and not a liability, Union minister Jyotiraditya M Scindia said on Tuesday, highlighting that the region, which shares borders with five countries, is perfectly placed to serve as India's gateway to Southeast Asia and even Central Asia.Towards this, he said, Guwahati and Agartala are being developed as international aviation hubs as they are within 2-3 hours flying radius of major Southeast Asian capitals like Singapore and Bangkok, making them ideal transit points for trade and travel.""We're making significant progress on the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway, which is 70% complete, with around 200 km of work remaining on our end.

The PM's vision has led to over 800 ministerial visits and Rs 6.7 lakh crore in fiscal support. """"We've added 6,000 km highways and 1,900 km new railway lines.

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The central board of direct taxes (cbdt) has extended the deadline for filing income tax returns (itrs) for the assessment year 2025–26.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday green-lighted the 'Made in India' fighter jet programme to produce a fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).India has been working on the ambitious AMCA project to develop a medium-weight, deep-penetration fighter jet with advanced stealth capabilities to bolster its air power.The AMCA, along with the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), is expected to form the backbone of the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the coming decades.""In a significant push towards enhancing India's indigenous defence capabilities and fostering a robust domestic aerospace industrial ecosystem, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has approved the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) Programme Execution Model,"" the ministry of defence said.The ministry added that private sector companies are invited to participate in the project.""They can bid either independently or as a joint venture or as consortia. The entity/bidder should be an Indian company compliant with the laws and regulations of the country,"" the ministry said in a statement.The development also comes amid heightened tensions with Pakistan following Operation Sindoor which claimed over 100 terrorists.The government has focused on enhancing India’s air power, especially in light of China's rapid advancements in the domain.Meanwhile, China now accounts for over 80% of Pakistan's arms imports.A recent US intelligence report claimed that Pakistan is the ""primary recipient"" of China’s economic and military generosity and foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan's armed forces are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China.""Foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan’s WMD programs are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China, and sometimes are transshipped through Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. However, terrorist attacks targeting Chinese workers who support China Pakistan Economic Corridor projects has emerged as a point of friction between the countries; seven Chinese nationals were killed in Pakistan in 2024,"" it added.Also read: Why India is fighting a Pakistan armed by China ""Pakistan primarily is a recipient of China’s economic and military largesse, and Pakistani forces conduct multiple combined military exercises every year with China’s PLA, including a new air exercise completed in November 2024,"" the report said.Last year, the Cabinet Committee on Security, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, granted in-principle approval to the AMCA programme. The indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet project is expected to play a pivotal role in strengthening the IAF’s combat capabilities.The estimated development cost of the AMCA project stands at approximately Rs 15,000 crore.The IAF has long advocated for the AMCA programme, given its long-term strategic requirements and the absence of a fifth-generation fighter jet in its current fleet. In contrast, China has already inducted its Chengdu J-20 jets, which it claims to be fifth-generation air superiority fighters with precision strike capabilities.India’s confidence in the AMCA initiative received a major boost following the successful development of the LCA Tejas.Developed by state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the Tejas has proven to be a capable platform for air combat and offensive missions, with secondary roles in reconnaissance and anti-ship operations.Meanwhile, the IAF is also in the process of acquiring 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) to enhance its operational readiness. In April 2019, the IAF issued a Request for Information (RFI) for the procurement, estimated at around USD 18 billion. The MRFA deal is considered one of the largest military procurement programmes globally in recent years.","India has been working on the ambitious amca project to develop a medium-weight, deep-penetration fighter jet.

NEW DELHI: The Border Security Force (BSF) on Tuesday claimed to have received multiple inputs about terrorists returning to their launchpads and camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir following Operation Sindoor.In a press conference, BSF Inspector General Shashank Anand said that intelligence inputs suggest possible infiltration attempts from both the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border in Jammu and Kashmir, for which security agencies must remain vigilant.""The Line of Control in our Kashmir and Jammu regions, and the international border in the Jammu area, consistently provide us with various types of intelligence inputs, as we have observed recently,"" Anand said.""Currently, we have not received any specific input about when terrorists might attempt infiltration, but we are continuously receiving information that terrorist organisations are making efforts.

""""This is a land of the brave. Until now, what we used to call a proxy war, after the scenes witnessed post-May 6, we can no longer make the mistake of calling it a proxy war.

China To Attack Taiwan? 'Invasion Anytime' As U.S. Confirms HUGE Preps; Fighters, Warships Deployed

NEW DELHI: India has revived its long-pending case for the indigenous construction of 12 specialized warships to detect, track and destroy underwater mines laid by enemy forces to choke harbours and ports, disrupt shipping and maritime trade.Defence ministry sources say the procurement case for the 12 advanced minesweepers or mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for the Navy, at an estimated cost of around Rs 44,000 crore, will soon be placed before the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council for the grant of “acceptance of necessity (AoN)”.The “open tender” or RFP (request for proposal) will then be issued for Indian shipyards to submit their techno-commercial bids. “It will take at least 7-8 years, if not more, for the first MCMV to roll out after the contract is inked,” a source said.The MCMVs are crucial in the backdrop of Chinese nuclear and conventional submarines, which can quietly lay mines, regularly coming to the Indian Ocean Region. Pakistan, too, is rapidly adding to its underwater combat fleet, with eight new Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines to be delivered by China.The Indian Navy, alarmingly, does not have a single MCMV at present, with its earlier six Karwar-class and two Pondicherry class of minesweepers having progressively retired several years ago.The force is making do with “clip-on mine countermeasure suites” mounted on some ships to plug the critical capability gap when it needs 24 MCMVs to guard the country’s 7,516-km long coastline with 13 major ports and over 200 minor ones.Both state and non-state actors can choke harbours and ports by planting underwater mines, which are cheap and relatively easy to use, to blow up warships, merchant vessels and tankers.The acquisition case for 12 MCMVs had begun way back in July 2005, which eventually led to Goa Shipyard tying up with South Korea firm Kangnam to build the specialized vessels. The negotiations, however, remained deadlocked on the costs, technology transfer and build strategy. The Rs 32,000 crore project was finally scrapped by the MoD in 2017-2018.With a displacement of around 900-1,000 tonne, the MCMVs have non-magnetic hulls and high-definition sonars, acoustic and magnetic sweeps to detect marooned and drifting mines. The vessels then use remote-controlled systems like small underwater vehicles to detonate the mines at safe distances.The over 130-warship Navy, of course, played a silent but crucial role during Operation Sindoor earlier this month in dissuading Pakistan from escalating hostilities by forward deploying its aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, warships and submarines in the northern Arabian Sea.The force currently has 60 warships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards, while it will also commission its second 3,900-tonne multi-role frigate built in Russia as INS Tamal at Kaliningrad next month.It also has the initial approval or AoNs for another 31 warships, including seven new-generation frigates, eight corvettes and six stealth diesel-electric submarines. The MCMVs will add to the numbers.The Navy, however, will reach a force-level of just about 160 warships by 2030, given the slow pace of construction in Indian shipyards as well as the progressive decommissioning of older warships, as earlier reported by TOI.","The procurement case for the 12 advanced minesweepers or mine countermeasure vessels (mcmvs) for the navy, at an estimated cost of around rs 44,000 crore, will soon be placed before the rajnath singh-led defence acquisitions council. “it will take at least 7-8 years, if not more, for the first mcmv to roll out after the contract is inked,” a source said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121399201,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1096204,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The two sides are also continuing with their confidence building measures to progressively reduce the ""high alertness levels"" between the rival militaries to ensure that neither side ""fires or initiates any aggressive and inimical action"", as reported by TOI earlier.India has repeatedly stressed that the ongoing understanding, which came into effect at 5 pm on May 10 after India's deep precision strikes on nine Pakistani airbases as well as a few radar sites earlier that day, is conditional and depends on Islamabad's behaviour.""If Pakistan's behaviour improves, it is fine. But if there is any disturbance, harshest punishment will be given,"" defence minister Rajnath Singh had said.In the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack , Pakistan had moved several reserve army formations, tanks and Chinese-made SH-15 self-propelled 155mm howitzers closer to the Line of Control as well as the international border.India had further carried out some forward deployments, which included the multi-layered air defence network that eventually thwarted the waves of drones and some missiles unleashed by Pakistan against Indian civilian and military targets.","The two armies are discussing ""measures to ensure troop reduction from the borders and forward areas"" indian dgmo lt-general rajiv ghai and his pakistani counterpart major general kashif abdullah reached the understanding on may 10 to cease cross-border hostilities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121449430,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1066963,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Calling PM Narendra Modi a ""master distorian"", Congress on Tuesday said he is criticising Jawaharlal Nehru on his death anniversary and resorting to 'filmi' dialogues to divert attention from serious questions about the Pahalgam terror attack like failure to arrest the four perpetrators, silence on US President Donald Trump's repeated claims about ""ceasefire"" and the growing hyphenation between India and Pakistan.Congress said the opposition MPs, as part of a global outreach, are conveying the country's stand on terrorism much more effectively, while BJP members are ""spreading hate and division in line with Pakistan's wishes"".Claiming the Modi govt is ""run, inspired and operated by trolls"", party spokesperson Pawan Khera said the failure of foreign policy in rebuffing the ""hyphenation"" between India and Pakistan is evident in the way Kuwait and the UAE have removed visa restrictions on Pakistani citizens.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar has firmly rejected claims that the United States played a decisive role in brokering the recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan, asserting instead that it was India’s military response that forced Islamabad to halt hostilities. In an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jaishankar also raised concerns over Pakistan’s close defence ties with China, encouraging observers to ""draw your own conclusions.""“The cessation of firing was agreed between the military commanders of both sides through direct contact,” Jaishankar said. “The morning before, we effectively hit and incapacitated Pakistan's main airbases and air defence system. So who should I thank for the cessation of hostilities? I thank the Indian military because it was the Indian military action that made Pakistan say: We are ready to stop.”Pushing back against suggestions that the standoff during Operation Sindoor brought the nuclear-armed neighbours close to atomic conflict, Jaishankar called such claims baseless and alarmist.“Very, very far away. I’m frankly astonished by your question,” he said when asked how close the world was to nuclear war.“We had terrorist targets. Those were very measured, carefully considered and non-escalating steps. After that, the Pakistani military opened fire on us. We were able to show them that we could disable their air defence systems. Then the firing stopped at their request.”He criticised what he called the West’s persistent tendency to frame South Asian conflicts as potential nuclear flashpoints. “Anything that happens in South Asia is promptly linked to a nuclear crisis by the West,” he said, calling the narrative “disturbing” and warning that it inadvertently “encourages terrible activities like terrorism.”On Pakistan’s continued support for terrorism, Jaishankar said: “Anyone who is not blind can see that the terrorist organisations are openly operating from the cities and towns of Pakistan... In Pakistan, terrorism is a very open business. A business that is supported, financed, organised and used by the state. And by their military.”When asked about China's involvement in the India-Pakistan dynamic, Jaishankar pointed to Islamabad’s defence dependency on Beijing. “Many of the weapons systems that Pakistan has are of Chinese origin and the two countries are very close. You can draw your own conclusions from that,” he said.Jaishankar’s remarks were part of a wide-ranging conversation on India’s evolving foreign policy, its relationship with Germany and the European Union, and its longstanding strategic partnership with Russia. Defending New Delhi’s ties with Moscow, he criticised what he described as European double standards.“You sound as if you can do business with states that are different, but we cannot... My neighbour Pakistan has caused every conceivable problem under the sun... But doesn't Germany also do business with Pakistan?” he asked.On Europe’s changing approach to global affairs, Jaishankar said the continent was beginning to move away from the assumption that its concerns automatically translate into global priorities. “I see big changes in Europe and Europe’s thinking... that it feels it should be more independent and more resilient,” he said.He welcomed Germany’s increasing role in global security, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, and expressed hope for stronger India-Germany defence cooperation. However, he acknowledged that “the conditions are not yet perfect” and India continues to press for deeper technological collaboration.Regarding the long-pending India-EU Free Trade Agreement, Jaishankar struck an optimistic tone. “Prime Minister Modi and EU Commission President von der Leyen have made it clear that the project should be completed by the end of the year... The agreement has strategic importance.”He also expressed confidence in Germany’s growing engagement with the Indo-Pacific and its understanding of India’s concerns over China. “When I look at Germany ten years ago, I see an enormous evolution... I see much stronger prospects for our partnership,” he said.","External affairs minister jaishankar asserted that india's military actions, not us mediation, compelled pakistan to agree to a ceasefire.

Remittances tax: How Donald Trump's 'The One Big Beautiful Bill’ may turn out to be ugly for Indians in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-remittance-tax-explained-how-donald-trumps-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-may-turn-out-to-be-ugly-for-indians-in-america/articleshow/121444456.cms,"Indians sending money from the US back home may have to pay a 3.5% remittance tax.

India Gets Largest Chunk of Remittances From US

The US continues to be the largest source of global remittances. RBI's remittance survey released in March indicates that of the total $118.7 billion remittances in 2023-24, the United States contributed approximately $32 billion, which is approximately 28 per cent.

How Indians in US will be hit

Should this legislation take effect, and even if one were to maintain current remittance levels, the Indian community would face an additional tax burden of $1.12 billion!

This regulation is likely to affect individuals who transfer money on a regular basis.

US President Donald Trump’s ‘The One Big Beautiful Bill’ may actually turn out to be ugly for Indians living in the US. By 2026, Indians sending money from the US back home may have to pay a 3.5% remittance tax. ‘The One Big Beautiful Bill’ carries significant implications for many Indian residents in the United States, including H-1B visa holders and permanent residents.International money transfers from the United States to India might become more expensive by 2026 if President Donald Trump's proposed legislation receives approval. The extensive 1,116-page 'One Big Beautiful Bill', which includes tax modifications and expenditure reductions, has received House approval and awaits Senate consideration.The final vote is anticipated in late June or July, with implementation contingent upon passage. The House passed the bill on May 22, reducing the initially proposed remittance tax rate of 5%.The legislation stipulates that only non-US citizens, including permanent residents and employment visa holders, would be subject to this tax. US citizens who incur the 3.5% tax can claim a credit during their tax filing, provided they use verified remittance providers.For Indian nationals, this holds particular importance as they constitute one of the largest immigrant populations in the United States.According to the Migration Policy Institute Data, over 2.9 million Indian immigrants resided in the United States in 2023. The US is Indians' second most preferred global destination after the United Arab Emirates.Statistics also indicate that Indians represent the second-largest foreign-born population in the United States, following Mexicans, comprising 6% of the total 47.8 million foreign-born residents in 2023.Even students earning income through various work opportunities would need to pay the 3.5% tax if they wish to transfer their earnings to India upon completing their studies and returning.Also Read | Big export boom: India benefits from Donald Trump’s tariffs; Indian firms see competitive position in the US tariff scenario Since there is no minimum amount specified, the taxation applies to remittances of every value. The rule would impact all categories of Indians residing in the US, including those on H-1B visas, L-1 visas (for intra-company transfers), and permanent residents. Any money sent to relatives in India or invested in Indian assets, such as securities or real estate, would be subject to a 5 per cent deduction by the remittance service provider (like a US bank).Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner and Mobility Leader at EY India explains, “The excise tax levy on remittances by US citizens/nationals can either be prevented by remittances through a qualified remittance transfer provider which has entered into written agreement with US Treasury to verify the status of senders as US citizens/nationals or claimed as credit against their income tax liability subject to compliance of certain conditions. ”“The bill, which aims at curbing US dollar outflows, is currently under Senate review and if enacted, could affect many Indian professionals working in the US, particularly those on H-1B visas or Green Cards, making remittances to India. Indian diaspora in the US may need to wait and watch, and potentially re-evaluate their remittance patterns, including the amount and frequency of remittances from the US,” he told TOI.Also Read | ‘Will not discuss…’: US tells WTO that India has no basis to impose retaliatory duties on 29 American products Devesh Kapur, who teaches political science and specialises in diaspora studies at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, notes that Indian diaspora generally send about 20 per cent of their income back home, with the amount fluctuating according to their household needs.Sudarshan Motwani, who leads BookMyForex, indicates significant consequences for overseas workers. ""These people have gone there for better prospects so that they could support their families back home. They need to send money back home to India. Hence, they will all be subjected to the new 3.5% tax,"" Motwani told ET.According to Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors, this regulation could affect the inflow of funds into Non-Resident External (NRE) accounts and investments in India's premium real estate sector, which has seen increased capital from overseas Indians. Kumar notes that it could also affect corporate mobility programmes where staff are posted to the US and receive US-based compensation.""These employees may seek to negotiate the additional 3.5% cost as part of their relocation package or under tax equalisation arrangements, effectively increasing the salary costs for the companies. Since this levy is classified as an excise tax, it may not fall within the definition of 'income tax' as outlined in tax treaties, and therefore may not be eligible for a foreign tax credit,"" he told ET.Also Read | ‘Instead of discussing the matter...’: Row erupts over India’s mango exports rejection; authorities say US inspectors did not follow protocol","Us president donald trump’s ‘the one big beautiful bill’ may actually turn out to be ugly for indians living in the us.

US halts new student visa interviews amid plans for social media screening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-halts-new-student-visa-interviews-amid-plans-for-social-media-screening/articleshow/121445425.cms,"Trump administration orders pause on student visa interviews worldwide





The United States has temporarily stopped scheduling new student visa interviews at embassies across the globe.The Trump administration is getting ready to bring in stricter rules on checking social media accounts of foreign students, leaving many international applicants worried about their future in the US.The order was issued via a diplomatic cable sent on Tuesday by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor (F, M and J) visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued,” Rubio wrote. According to the cable, more detailed instructions are expected soon. Interviews already booked will continue as planned.This latest action adds to growing efforts by the administration to tighten entry rules for foreign students, citing threats to national security and concerns around campus unrest. The State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have not commented on the development yet.The sudden pause in visa processing follows previous signals from Rubio about a tougher approach.In March, he referred to students who he claimed were coming to the US not to study, but to engage in protests. Citing the case of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was arrested and later released on bail after writing an op-ed in support of Gazans, Rubio said: “If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell us that the reason you are coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus—we’re not going to give you a visa. ”The visa freeze also comes on the heels of another controversy involving Harvard University. Just days ago, the DHS attempted to stop the prestigious school from enrolling international students, although that move was blocked by a federal judge. The administration has also threatened to pull back all federal contracts with Harvard, worth nearly $100 million—and US President Trump has warned of redirecting billions in grant money away from the university.Despite the crackdown, some voices within the academic community are advocating for a more balanced approach. Speaking on Fox Business, Kevin O’Leary, a lecturer at Harvard Business School, said: “These students are extraordinary individuals and they don’t hate America. Why don’t we vet them first, check their backgrounds, clear them, and tell them, ‘You graduate Harvard, you’re an engineer or whatever, you stay here and you start a business here and you’ll get funded here and you’ll create jobs here because that’s why you came here in the first place. ’”","Trump administration orders pause on student visa interviews worldwide.

Tommy Robinson gets early release because of ‘change in attitude’

British far-right activist Tommy Robinson walked free on parole earlier today after a UK judge granted his early release from an 18-month sentence for contempt of court . Upon release, Robinson credited tech billionaire Elon Musk and the platform for enabling him to share his version of events. “I have to say a thank you to Elon Musk, because without X, if we didn't have X, everyone would just think I lied. No one would have got any other narrative,"" he said during a livestream to his followers. ""These attempts at censorship, to silence, to cancel people, it hasn't worked. You've attempted to lock up the truth. And that truth has been echoed around the entire globe,"" he added.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon was jailed for violating a court order prohibiting him from repeating libelous claims about a Syrian refugee, Jamal Hijazi . He was sent to jail in October 2024 for contempt of court after admitting that he broke a legal order. The 42-year-old had accused Hijazi of being a violent bully—allegations a court deemed false.He later featured the claims in a documentary titled Silenced, which he shared on X (formerly Twitter), owned by Elon Musk. Musk has previously expressed support for Robinson, saying he was jailed “for telling the truth” and calling for his release.Justice Jeremy Johnson granted Robinson’s early release, citing a “change in attitude” though with ""absence of contrition or remorse.""""He has given an assurance that he will comply with the injunction in the future, that he has no intention of breaching it again, and that he is aware of the consequences of what would happen if he breached the injunction again,"" the judge said.Robinson admitted in October to breaching the injunction by promoting the Silenced film and discussing the case in media interviews and public rallies. His previous videos about Hijazi reportedly led to widespread harassment of the boy, who dropped out of school and relocated with his family. A 2021 libel case awarded Hijazi £100,000 in damages.A repeat offender, Robinson has previously served time for assault, mortgage fraud, and contempt of court. He remains a polarizing figure in Britain’s far-right circles and retains a sizable following both in the UK and abroad.His legal team has assured that he would comply with the original court order moving forward.",British far-right activist tommy robinson walked free on parole earlier today after a uk judge granted his early release from an 18-month sentence for contempt of court.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N nvidia ceo jensen huang blasts biden-era ai chip export policy.

What happened at the Liverpool parade



How terrorism is legally defined in the UK

Public and political reaction





A celebration turned into a nightmare in Liverpool on Monday when a car crashed into a crowd during the Premier League victory parade, injuring at least 50 people, including four children. The incident occurred near the iconic Liver Building as hundreds of thousands of fans gathered to mark the city’s 20th top-flight football title. A 53-year-old British man from Liverpool has been arrested in connection with the crash. Police have confirmed that the incident is not being treated as terrorism, despite its shocking nature and the large number of casualties.Merseyside Police have clearly stated that the crash is not being treated as an act of terrorism. According to UK law, an incident can only be classified as terrorism if it is done with the intention of influencing the government or intimidating the public to advance a political, religious, racial, or ideological cause. At this stage, there is no evidence suggesting the suspect acted with such motives. Without a clear ideological or political link, authorities are pursuing other possible criminal charges.During the victory celebrations, a vehicle ploughed into fans gathered in Liverpool’s city centre.Witnesses reported hearing “bumps” as the car struck multiple people, causing widespread panic. Emergency services, including North West Ambulance Service, rushed to the scene, transporting 27 individuals to hospital and treating 20 others on-site. Two of those hospitalised, including a child, sustained serious injuries. The incident disrupted what had otherwise been a jubilant day for the football-loving city.In the UK, the definition of terrorism is specific and legally binding. An act is only deemed terrorism if it involves violence or threats intended to influence the government or intimidate the public, and is carried out for a political, religious, racial, or ideological reason. Simply causing harm or chaos — however grave — does not automatically qualify. In this case, unless police uncover evidence of the suspect acting with such motivations, they will be required to proceed with different charges, such as dangerous driving or attempted manslaughter.Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the incident, calling the scenes “appalling” and emphasising that such violence has no place at public celebrations. “Everyone, especially children, should be able to celebrate their heroes without this horror,” he said. The public has responded with concern and sympathy for the victims, particularly the families of injured children.As the investigation continues, police are working to establish a timeline of events, examine CCTV footage, and speak to witnesses. Updates on the suspect’s charges are expected soon. Meanwhile, Liverpool residents and football fans around the country are left reflecting on a day meant for celebration that turned unexpectedly tragic.","A 53-year-old british man from liverpool has been arrested in connection with the crash.
