PM Modi receives Namibia’s highest honour

NEW DELHI: India and Namibia discussed enhancing ties in defence, maritime security, digital technology and UPI, energy and critical minerals as PM Modi held a bilateral meeting with President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah in Windhoek during the final leg of his five-nation tour.Addressing Namibia's Parliament, PM Modi also laid out India's vision for Africa - freedom to future - and said India sought to cooperate, not compete, and not take but to build and grow together.""Let us create a future defined not by power, but by partnership, not by dominance, but by dialogue, not by exclusion, but by equity,"" he said.""We believe that Africa must not be just a source of raw materials. Africa must lead in value creation and sustainable growth. Let our children not only inherit the freedom we fought for, but the future we will build together,"" the PM said. Some of the remarks by Modi are seen as a subtle dig at China, which has a vast presence in the continent, at a time many African countries are looking to diversify their partnerships.According to an Indian statement, Modi thanked Namibia for its strong support and solidarity extended to the people of India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.They agreed to strengthen the global fight against terrorism.

NEW DELHI: India strongly demanded that the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) undertake a comprehensive investigation and global review of all maritime incidents involving foreign-flagged container vessels operating in Indian waters. It said these incidents, caused by undeclared hazardous cargoes, and structural and stability issues, have raised serious safety concerns.Participating in the 134th session of the Council of the IMO, port and shipping secretary T K Ramachandran underscored the need to reinforce international protocols related to packaging, declaration, stowage, and monitoring of lithium-ion batteries and International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDGs).In a statement, the port and shipping ministry said, ""India delivered a principled statement addressing recent maritime incidents involving foreign-flagged container vessels operating in Indian waters.""Citing the proactive role of Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard in ensuring the safety of life at sea, the statement said India called for urgent enhancements in the safety framework for container shipping. India also proposed the establishment of IMO-led investigations into such incidents to help build global best practices, improve standardisation, and strengthen operational norms that ensure the safety and security of container ship operations across the world.There have been serious maritime incidents along India's coastline that exposed vulnerabilities in the current emergency response framework. The sinking of the container ship MSC ELSA 3 in May 2025 and the major fire and explosion on the container ship WAN HAI 503 in June 2025, off the coast of Kerala, led to the loss of several containers in the waters and the release of hazardous cargo and significant environmental risk.","India strongly demanded that the international maritime organisation (imo) undertake a comprehensive investigation and global review of all maritime incidents involving foreign-flagged container vessels operating in indian waters.

Yes, I fully support it. No, I do not support it.

NEW DELHI: More than 25 crore workers across sectors including banking, insurance, postal services, coal mining, and construction are expected to join a nationwide general strike on Wednesday, potentially disrupting key services across India, according to a joint forum of central trade unions.The strike, described as a ‘ Bharat Bandh ’, has been called by a forum of 10 central trade unions and their associates to protest against what they term “anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the government”.“Preparations have been taken up in earnest by unions in all sectors of the formal and informal/unorganised economy” and urged supporters to make the strike a “grand success"", said the forum in a statement.“All India Trade Union Congress’s Amarjeet Kaur said, “More than 25 crore workers are expected to take part in the strike. Farmers and rural workers will also join the protest across the country.” Harbhajan Singh Sidhu of Hind Mazdoor Sabha added, “Banking, postal, coal mining, factories, state transport services will be affected due to the strike.”The forum said it had earlier submitted a 17-point charter of demands to Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya but received no concrete response.It also alleged that the government had not conducted the annual labour conference for the past decade and was instead pushing through four labour codes that would weaken collective bargaining, cripple union activity, and favour employers in the name of “ease of doing business”.It further claimed that economic policies were deepening unemployment, raising prices of essential commodities, suppressing wages, and reducing expenditure on education, health, and civic amenities, thereby widening inequality and burdening the poor, lower-income groups, and the middle class.The statement added, “The government has abandoned the welfare state status of the country and is working in the interest of foreign and Indian corporates, and it is so evident from its policies being pursued vigorously.”The unions are also protesting against the privatisation of public sector enterprises, outsourcing, contractual employment, and casualisation of the workforce. They claim that the four labour codes passed in Parliament were designed to “suppress and cripple the trade union movement, increase working hours, snatch workers’ right to collective bargaining, right to strike, and decriminalise violation of labour laws by employers. ”“We are demanding from the government to address unemployment, recruitments against sanctioned posts, creation of more jobs, increase in days and remuneration of MGNREGA workers and enactment of similar legislation for urban areas. But the government is busy imposing ELI (Employment Linked Incentive) scheme to incentivise employers instead,” the statement said.It also alleged that instead of hiring young professionals, government departments were increasingly recruiting retired personnel, as seen in Railways, NMDC Ltd, steel sector, and education services — a move the unions say is harmful to a country where 65 percent of the population is below the age of 35 and unemployment is highest among those aged 20 to 25.Unions from NMDC Ltd, non-coal minerals, steel, state government departments, and other public sector enterprises have also served notices for participation in the strike.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha and a joint front of agricultural workers’ unions have also extended support to the strike and announced large-scale mobilisation in rural areas.Similar nationwide strikes were observed by trade unions on November 26, 2020; March 28-29, 2022; and February 16, 2023.(With inputs from news agency PTI)","More than 25 crore workers across sectors including banking, insurance, postal services, coal mining, and construction are expected to join a nationwide general strike.

Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1,200km border with Tibet, not China, chief minister Pema Khandu declared Wednesday in a surgical swipe at Beijing for repeatedly laying claim to the northeastern state, and also creating what he called a ticking ""water bomb"" in the form of the world's largest dam project on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra in India) river.""Officially, yes, Tibet is under China now. That can't be ruled out... but originally we shared a border with Tibet,"" he told PTI in Delhi on his way back from the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday celebration in Dharamshala.""In Arunachal Pradesh, we share three international boundaries - with Bhutan approximately 150km, with Tibet... and on the eastern side, with Myanmar approximately 550km.""Khandu, in his third consecutive term as CM and credited with strengthening BJP's hold on the state, made the remarks while seeking to ""correct"" the interviewer the moment he referred to Arunachal Pradesh bordering China.Pointing to China's ""forcible"" occupation of Tibet in 1950, Khandu said that if one looked at India's map, ""none of the Indian states directly shares borders with China"".The CM's statement comes amid China's intensified bid to stamp its authority on the Dalai Lama's succession. Union minister and fellow Arunachal Pradesh native Kiren Rijiju, said recently that the decision on who should be the Dalai Lama's successor should be solely his and in accordance with established Tibetan Buddhist convention.No government, including China's communist regime, should have a say, he said.On the dam China is building on the Yarlung Tsangpo, the Tibetan name for the Brahmaputra, Khandu warned that the project poses an “existential threat” to Arunachal and its neighbouring northeastern states. He termed it “a bigger issue” than anything else other than the Chinese “military threat” hanging over the region.Khandu said Beijing not being a signatory to any international water treaty meant it “cannot be trusted”. “No one knows what they might do... Suppose the dam is built and they suddenly release water, our entire Siang belt would be destroyed. The Adi tribe and similar groups would suffer devastating effects,” he said. The CM said that after discussions with the Union government, Arunachal Pradesh conceived the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project as a bulwark against China's intentions. “Since we cannot make China see reason, it is better that we focus on our own defence mechanisms and preparations,” he told PTI.","Arunachal pradesh shares a 1,200km border with tibet, not china, says chief minister.

NEW DELHI: A Financial Action Task Force (FATF) report on a comprehensive update on terrorist financing risks, released this month, has for the first time mentioned the role of 'states' as terror sponsors, something India has been harping on while seeking to designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism.India had identified state sponsored terrorism from Pakistan as a source of terrorist financing risk in its money laundering/terror financing risk assessment in 2022. The findings of the FATF reinforces India's position as for the first time, it has introduced the concept of state sponsored terrorism in its report, a senior govt official said.""Political and economic realities within states play a significant role in the close cooperation between criminal elements and terrorist organisations' operations and settlements,"" the report said, adding that weak governance-related matters, systemic corruption and high criminal levels influence the nature of terror financing risks.It stressed on the fact that criminal and terrorist organisations thrived in states with ineffective legal and institutional frameworks, experiencing widespread and systemic corruption, particularly ones which offered lucrative criminal opportunities. The report also mentioned widespread use of banking channels by terrorist outfits in Pakistan.The Paris-based inter-governmental body said Pakistan-based terror outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) had used non-profit organisations (NPOs) and gaming platforms to raise terror financing.""Sham NPOs are established or registered knowingly for the purpose of terror financing and used to raise, store and move funds, commonly under false charitable pretexts,"" the FATF report said. The report raised concerns on increasing use of gaming websites by terror outfits.","A financial action task force (fatf) report on a comprehensive update on terrorist financing risks, released this month, has for the first time mentioned the role of'states' as terror sponsors.

NEW DELHI: A video from Wednesday's Bihar Bandh protest seemingly showed Congress leaders Kanhaiya Kumar and Pappu Yadav being stopped from boarding a protest vehicle carrying Rahul Gandhi , Tejashwi Yadav and other senior INDIA bloc leaders in Patna.The leaders were participating in the 'Bihar Bandh' rally, organised to oppose the Election Commission of India 's (ECI) decision to carry out a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls ahead of the state assembly elections.Visuals from the protest show Kumar and Yadav being stopped by security from joining the truck carrying Gandhi, Tejashwi and other top Mahagathbandhan leaders.Meanwhile, responding to the incident, Pappu Yadav said it was not an ""insult."" ""I fell and got hurt. One leader from each party was present there, but this is not an insult. Nothing is greater than the public; it is acceptable to be insulted for them, not just once but even a million times,"" the Purnia MP said while talking to news agency ANI.Earlier in the day, several opposition leaders gathered at the Sachiwalay Halt railway station, where Congress workers blocked railway tracks and shouted slogans such as “Chunav Aayog hosh mein aao” (Election Commission, come to your senses).Among the prominent faces at the protest were CPI general secretary D. Raja, CPI (ML) Liberation leader Dipankar Bhattacharya, Bihar Congress President Rajesh Ram, and Sanjay Yadav. Independent MP from Purnea, Pappu Yadav, also took part in the demonstration.At the centre of the protest is the ECI’s June 24 notification announcing the SIR of Bihar’s electoral rolls. The ECI maintains that the revision is in line with Article 326 of the Constitution and Section 16 of the Representation of People Act, 1950. These provisions define who is eligible to vote and the grounds for disqualification.However, critics, including Swaraj India member Yogendra Yadav and the Association for Democratic Reforms, argue that the move violates universal adult suffrage. They have filed a petition in the Supreme Court, which is set to hear the on Thursday.To counter rumours, the ECI issued a statement last, affirming that no changes have been made to the SIR process and dismissing claims of manipulation.The Election Commission also shared Article 326 on social media, highlighting that every Indian citizen aged 18 or above is entitled to vote unless legally disqualified.","Kanhaiya kumar and pappu yadav were stopped from boarding a protest vehicle in patna.

NEW DELHI: Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Tuesday submitted its preliminary report on the AI171 plane crash to the ministry of civil aviation. The report is based on the initial findings of the probe, reported news agency ANI citing top sources.Meanwhile, a crucial meeting of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is scheduled for today, with top officials from the civil aviation ministry, including the civil aviation secretary and the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), expected to appear.The recent Air India Flight AI-171 crash in Ahmedabad is also likely to come up during the meeting, along with broader concerns over aviation safety.Sources confirmed ANI that the civil aviation Secretary and representatives from the DGCA have been summoned.However, the meeting’s primary focus will be on how passenger fees, airline charges, and other tariffs are determined and regulated for public infrastructure and airport services, in addition to ongoing safety concerns in the aviation sector.On June 12, a London-bound Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.The aircraft collided with a hostel complex at BJ Medical College, killing 241 of the 242 people on board. Among the victims was former Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani.Since the crash, the ministry of civil aviation has been assisting the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which is conducting a full-scale investigation. The AAIB, operating from its lab in New Delhi and equipped with advanced technology, is leading the probe.According to the ministry, the Crash Protection Module from one of the plane’s black boxes was retrieved and accessed by June 25, and data from it has been successfully downloaded. A source told ANI, an identical black box, referred to as a ""golden chassis"", was used to confirm whether the data could be accurately retrieved from the original black boxes.The investigation team comprises experts from the Indian Air Force, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), and the U.S.-based National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

The rocket is designed to improve the Navy’s ability to counter undersea threats more effectively and from longer ranges.On Monday, Rajnath also spoke about the rising global interest in Indian defence equipment following the success of Operation Sindoor Addressing officials at the controllers’ conference organised by DRDO in New Delhi, he said, “The world is looking towards our Defence sector. The valour that our soldiers have shown during Operation Sindoor, as well as the way we showcased the capabilities of our domestic equipment, has led to an increase in demand for our indigenous defence products. World military expenditure has increased to over USD 2.7 trillion in 2024 - such a big market is awaiting us. ”He further highlighted the importance of utilising the defence budget wisely, noting that it is larger than the GDP of some countries.“...If you look at our Defence budget, it's bigger than the GDP of some countries in the world. When a significant portion of people's hard-earned income is allocated to the Defence Ministry, our responsibility increases exponentially – we need effective growth. Our Defence expenditure should be such that not only does the budget increase, but also we should utilise it in the right way - by proper deployment at the right time for the right objective,” he said.","The trials were carried out on tuesday from ins kavaratti.

Air India Plane Crash: What Led To Ahmedabad Crash? AAIB Submits Preliminary Report To Centre

MUMBAI: As the 30-day limit to submit the report of the preliminary investigation into the June 12 Air India accident in Ahmedabad to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) ends this week, there is anticipation India will release it to the public.The ICAO places no obligation on the investigating country to make the report public and India had not released the preliminary report of the last major accident at Calicut in 2020. But the AI 171 probe is being followed by the global airline industry with keen interest as it was the first major one involving a Boeing 787.""Apart from the roles and responsibilities of Air India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, and others, the investigation will crucially be a Boeing 787 systems-level case study. It's the first such global investigation of the 'more electric' B787 aircraft. The preliminary findings, if substantial and critical, could reshape B787 operations,"" said a senior commander, requesting anonymity. ""What we hear is that India will make the preliminary report public this time,"" he added.Prior to the June 12 accident, the last major fatal accident India investigated was the August 2020 Calicut Air India Express accident involving a Boeing 737 and 21 deaths.Back then, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) did not release its preliminary report to the public.Since an aircraft accident investigation is solely carried out to learn lessons and prevent a repeat — unlike a murder investigation, it does not apportion blame or trace culprits — most countries release their preliminary findings to the public.The last time the global aviation industry tracked an accident investigation closely was in 2018 after the Oct 29 Indonesian Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX crash. Keeping with the 30-day deadline, on Nov 28, Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee sent a preliminary report to ICAO and also publicly released it. In fact, it announced in advance that the preliminary report would be uploaded on its website at 10 am on November 28.“The preliminary investigation following Lion Air Flight 610 revealed that prior to the crash, a system called Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS engaged without the Lion Air pilots’ knowledge. Back then, Boeing hadn’t disclosed MCAS to any airlines or pilots. The MCAS lowers the nose automatically to prevent a stall, or the loss of lift, if it detects that the angle of the plane’s nose is too high relative to the ground. What we learnt from the preliminary report is that a malfunctioning sensor may have led the MCAS to engage repeatedly, countering the pilots’ manoeuvres,” said a B737 examiner. “When Ethiopian Airlines B737 MAX crashed five months later, it was the Lion Air preliminary report that came back into focus. The final report into the Lion Air crash came a year later; by then, the B737 MAX was already grounded globally,” he added.“If Air India accident preliminary report points to any possible warning or technical fault in the B787, you can imagine the impact it would have on Dreamliner operations globally,” the examiner said. Of all the accident investigations carried out by India in the past decades, this one is arguably the most followed investigation globally. The AAIB can submit the preliminary report to the ministry of civil aviation if it chooses. Under Annex 13 of ICAO, which lays down the guidelines for carrying out an accident investigation, the preliminary report has to be submitted by the state (India, in this case) to ICAO within 30 days of the occurrence.",The 30-day limit to submit the report of the preliminary investigation into the june 12 air india accident in ahmedabad ends this week. There is anticipation india will release it to the public.

Trevor Bauer’s life changed when he was accused of sexual assault but then he accused the woman of “fraud”



T revor Bauer, once considered to be one of the most talented and popular players in the league, had his whole life change in December 2022 when a woman accused him of sexual assault. While the MLB later reinstated him, the Los Angeles Dodgers fired him in January 2023 due to the allegations against him. But things changed in 2024, when Trevor Bauer accused the same woman, Darcy Adanna Esemonu, of “fraudulent schemes and artifices”.Back in 2022, Darcy Adanna Esemonu accused Trevor Bauer of sexually assaulting her in late 2020 which had then resulted in a pregnancy. This news had sparked uproar in the league and had sent shockwaves across his fans.The serious allegations led to Trevor Bauer being fired from his team in January 2023 but in 2024, the woman was charged by Trevor Bauer for getting undisclosed benefits “by means of fraudulent pretenses, representation, promises, or material omissions.”Apparently, as per CNN Sports, according to the police report, Darcy Adanna Esemonu had demanded a whopping $1.6 million from Trevor Bauer for an abortion. While Trevor Bauer did pay $10,000 for pregnancy needs, as per his lawyer, the woman was actually never pregnant when she demanded the amount from the MLB player.When Trevor Bauer was accused of sexually assaulting Darcy Adanna Esemonu, he strongly denied charges of getting intimate with her without her consent. The former Los Angeles Dodgers’ player even shot a video where he denied any charges related to sexual assault.In the YouTube video, Trevor Bauer had said, “If there comes a time in the future where I need to defend myself further, I will not hesitate to do so.”The former Los Angeles Dodgers’ player added, “For now, there is no reason to speak further on this topic, though, because outside of Adanna – who’s now been indicted with felony fraud – there are no claims against me, no ongoing investigations, and no outstanding lawsuits.”At this point in time, there are no further public updates about the case between Trevor Bauer and Darcy Adanna Esemonu.Also Read: What went wrong for free agent Julio Urías?

NHL Trade Rumor: Jordan Kyrou’s future in St. Louis uncertain amid Canadiens' growing interest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumor-jordan-kyrous-future-in-st-louis-uncertain-amid-canadiens-growing-interest/articleshow/122353752.cms,"Jordan Kyrou trade talks escalate (Imagn Images)

Jordan Kyrou Trade Rumors Heat Up: Blues May Be Ready to Move On From Their Star Winger



As the St. Louis Blues aim to reshape their roster following a playoff appearance, a familiar name continues to surface in trade talks—Jordan Kyrou. The dynamic winger, known for his speed and offensive output, is reportedly at the center of intense trade speculation as the Blues look for ways to upgrade their squad amid salary cap constraints.Despite delivering a respectable 36-goal, 34-assist season across all 82 games and adding three goals during the playoffs, Kyrou’s future in St. Louis is anything but secure. The chatter, once dismissed as typical offseason noise, has grown significantly louder. NHL insider Frank Seravalli recently revealed, “The Blues remain very motivated to move on from Kyrou.” That revelation has sent waves through the fanbase and around the league.One of the biggest reasons behind the Blues’ motivation appears to be financial. Kyrou is in the third year of his eight-year contract that carries a cap hit of $8.125 million annually. With six more seasons remaining, St. Louis may be rethinking the value he brings relative to his price tag. Whether it’s an attempt to reallocate cap space for a more balanced roster or to create room for a marquee acquisition, the writing is on the wall.Teams have reportedly been circling, with the Montreal Canadiens emerging as a serious suitor. TSN’s Pierre LeBrun reported that Montreal’s front office, even after landing defenseman Noah Dobson, was not finished making moves. “They were among several teams expressing an interest in Kyrou,” said LeBrun. While the Canadiens primarily need a second-line center, they remain open to adding a top-tier scoring winger—a role Kyrou could instantly fill.However, complications remain. Kyrou’s no-trade clause officially kicked in on July 1, giving him significant leverage in any potential deal. Jeremy Rutherford of The Athletic added that while the Canadiens were interested, “it would take multiple assets for the Habs to land him.” Compounding matters, Montreal may lack the specific center the Blues have been hunting—although St. Louis has since addressed that need by signing Pius Suter and Nick Bjugstad.Despite the murky path forward, Marco D’Amico of RG.Org reports that Montreal is still trying to bolster their top six and “still have the Blues winger among their targets.” Their recent trade history—with Logan Mailloux going to St. Louis in exchange for Zack Bolduc—suggests the communication lines are open.Yet, unless Kyrou waives his clause and the Canadiens are willing to meet what is expected to be a steep asking price, this potential blockbuster may never leave the ground. Still, as the offseason drama unfolds, one thing is clear: Jordan Kyrou’s future in St. Louis is far from guaranteed.Also Read: Connor McDavid's patience tested as Oilers trade key prospect amid rising 2025-26 expectations",Jordan kyrou is reportedly at the center of intense trade speculation.

Rishi Sunak: A journey from banker to Prime Minister to a job at Goldman Sachs — a return no one expected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunak-a-journey-from-banker-to-prime-minister-to-a-job-at-goldman-sachs-a-return-no-one-expected/articleshow/122344536.cms,"Image: Getty Images

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.W hen Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former uk prime minister rishi sunak is returning to goldman sachs as a senior adviser.
