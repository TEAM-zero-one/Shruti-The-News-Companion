NEW DELHI: Releasing a book on Operation Sindoor , Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday said the India-Pakistan conflict did not end with the May 10 ceasefire understanding but “continued for a long time.”The book, ""Operation Sindoor: The Untold Story of India’s Deep Strikes Inside Pakistan"", has been authored by former army officer KJS Dhillon, a veteran.“You may be thinking that on May 10, the war finished; no, because it continued for a long time, with many decisions still to be taken. Beyond that, of course, it will be difficult for me to share here,” General Dwivedi said at the launch event, according to PTI.""India announced its resolve with a new normal, with outstanding clarity in strategic guidance, with a whole-of-nation approach for execution,"" he asserted in his address.The army chief also noted how, throughout the conflict, the force ""moved something like a rhythmic wave.""""When I say rhythmic wave, in these 88 hours, it was not possible for you to come for the planning, pass the orders... so, everybody was synergised, and everybody knew his orders,"" he explained.Hours after the ceasefire took effect on May 10, Pakistan had sent drones into Indian border states — a move it repeated the next night.On his part, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly emphasised that Operation Sindoor has only been “paused.”It was launched on May 7 in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , in which Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 civilians. Under it, the Indian forces struck multiple terror infrastructures across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in what the government described as “focused, measured and non-escalatory” action.Pakistan retaliated with offensives, prompting Indian counter-strikes, and the conflict dragged on for nearly four days. On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations reached out to his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which India accepted.","Army chief general upendra dwivedi said the india-pakistan conflict did not end with the may 10 ceasefire understanding but “continued for a long time” the book, ""operation sindoor: the untold story of india’s deep strikes inside pakistan"", has been authored by former army officer kjs dhillon.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123728945,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-66522,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi's planned visit to India is likely to be delayed with UNSC yet to grant him the waiver he needs to travel to India. While Afghan media reported that the Security Council denied a waiver to Muttaqi, sources said dates for the visit have not been finalised. Because of UN travel ban imposed on the Taliban leader, India needs to get approval from the Council to facilitate his travel. TOI had reported on Aug 28 that Muttaqi was likely to visit India soon.Indian govt sources had then denied reports that India had sought a waiver, saying it will approach UNSC to lift the travel ban only after the dates for his visit are finalised. This would have been the first visit by a Taliban leader to India, as India's ties with the regime in Kabul improve on the back of considerable humanitarian aid that India is providing Kabul. A proposed visit by Muttaqi to Pakistan was earlier cancelled after the Council denied him waiver from travel ban.EAM S Jaishankar spoke to Muttaqi last week and condoled the loss of lives in the recent earthquake, while also announcing India's decision to send relief material. Looking to build upon improvement in the relationship, foreign secretary Vikram Misri had met Muttaqi in Dubai in Jan and conveyed India's readiness to respond to the urgent developmental needs of Afghan people.This was followed by the first political contact between the two sides as Jaishankar spoke to Muttaqi in May.

India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins”His remarks came in response to a Washington Post article that said Washington’s harsh language toward New Delhi was worsening ties.Navarro has repeatedly targeted India for its refusal to halt trade with Moscow, calling the conflict “Modi’s war,” branding the country “Kremlin’s laundromat,” and alleging it was profiting from the war.Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, he had claimed: “India is helping feed the Russian war machine. I mean Modi's war, because the road to peace runs, in part, through New Delhi.”The ministry of external affairs (MEA) rejected his comments.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

(May be updated)

With a single cryptic post, US President Donald Trump on Friday signaled a tectonic shift in global alignments, taking America deeper into an isolationist and antagonistic stance by clubbing India, Russia, and China together as allies. The post also appeared to publicly cede to China a leadership position adversarial to the US.""Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!"" Trump posted first thing on the morning on Friday, sending shock waves across the world, including in the US strategic community that did not anticipate such a stark and public indication of a geopolitical realigment.There was much for analysts to unpack in the 20-word post by America's mercurial President, who often takes to social media to troll and taunt adversaries and sometimes even allies.First, there was the sense of resignation and acknowledgement that he, with his MAGA vision for US, has lost India and Russia (mentioned in that order), countries he implicitly seemed to expect to be aligned with Washington. Then the negative characterisation of China as a ""deepest, darkest"" entity, which seemed to suggest that he now regarded it as a conspiratorial and primary adversary.Calling the US President's evolving stance arguably ""the greatest own goal in modern foreign policy,"" CNN commentator Fareed Zakaria said Trump's tariffs and rhetoric had caused many of the world’s pivotal states are to move away from the US toward China. The Trump post seemed to concede it was a self-goal.It is rare for Trump to admit any loss, in keeping with the core principles of his book Art of the Deal, which emphasizes never conceding defeat and claiming victory even in the face of setbacks. The sense of resignation, unless it is read as a negotiating tactic or sarcasm, was unreal and un-Trumplike.Indeed, the post surprised even Trump surrogates, who held their counsel for now as they tried to figure out the President's motive for such a cryptic but provocative post. Some of Trump's cabinet principals and the non-partisan bureaucracy have been quietly working to keep the India ties on an even keel, given the time and energy both sides have expended on the construct that it will be the most consequential and ""defining relationship of the 21st century. "" Even some MAGA megaphones read more sarcasm than any drastic realignment in the post. The NYPost read it as nothing more than a ""snarky takedown"" of Russia and India ""cozying"" up to China.Absent any immediate elaboration about the post from the administration, trolls and agent provocateurs on social media had a field day, from taunting the US President with his signature ""Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" to gibing if he had taken his morning medication.India partisans ridiculed him for his recent embrace of Pakistan, attributing it to his family's business interest in cryptocurrency that is reported to have netted $5 billion through a firm wooed by Islamabad. ""Actually you are left with Pakistan. Rest entire world has abandoned you already,"" gibed one post, while another wished Trump ""a happy future with jihadis"" for ""forgetting 9/11 and where Osama bin Laden was found. ""MAGA xenophobes too jumped into the fray, one of them suggesting ""it is time we put the Indian people in camps and mass deport them."" Trump's increasingly antagonistic stance towards India has unleashed a torrent of racial abuse and slurs on the far right.","Us president donald trump on friday signaled a tectonic shift in global alignments.

Infant mortality rate posts 1-pt decline

NEW DELHI: Highlighting that Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year and stays well below the replacement level fertility of 2.1 births per woman, the latest Sample Registration System (SRS) Statistical report 2023 shows TFR for rural India for the first time touched 2.1 - the replacement rate, where one generation replaces itself, leading to population stability.Rates above replacement rate 2.1 suggest population growth, and the rates below that level indicate a declining population and a potential ageing population. Nationally, India's TFR touched replacement level in 2019 and was at 2.0 since 2020. TFR represents the average number of children born to a woman during her reproductive years.As per SRS report, Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) for 2023 is estimated at 0.9, which means that on average, each woman in India is having one daughter who survives to reproductive age and has children of her own. Rural GRR (1.0) was slightly higher than urban GRR (0.7), which suggests that women in rural areas are having more daughters than women in urban areas.GRR is a refined measure of fertility that accounts for future mothers and measures the average number of female children a woman is expected to give birth during her entire reproductive span conforming to the age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) for a given year, if there is no mortality.GRR values for major states/UTs range from 0.6 in Delhi, Bengal and TN to 1.3 in Bihar.TFR for rural areas was 2.2 in 2022 and 1.6 for urban. Going by TFR for 2023, at present, a rural woman would have about one child more than an urban woman having a TFR of 1.5 on an average.As far as states go, Bihar had highest TFR among bigger states/UTs at 2.8, followed by UP (2.6), MP (2.4) and and Rajasthan (2.3). Delhi records the lowest TFR at 1.2, followed by TN and Bengal at 1.3 each.Maharashtra stands at 1.4, while Andhra, J&K, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, and Telangana each have a TFR of 1.5. TFR in urban areas was generally lower than in rural areas across all major states/UTs in India, except Kerala and TN.\The SRSReport 2023 shows that infant mortality rate (IMR) registered a one-point decline from 26 per 1,000 live births in 2022 at the national level. Among bigger states, maximum IMR was observed at 37 each in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, & minimum at five in Kerala and three in Manipur. However, the report noted that despite this decline, one in every 40 infants at the national level die within one year of life — one in every 36 infants in rural areas and one in every 56 infants in urban areas. The report highlighted that the decline in IMR from 32 in 2018 to 25 in 2023, marks a decline of seven points over past five years and an annual average decline of about 1.4 points. The corresponding decline in rural IMR has been eight points (36 in 2018 to 28 in 2023) against a decline of five points in urban IMR (23 in 2018 to 18 in 2023). IMR for both genders have shown a decline during 2018-23. With regard to Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR), in 2023, the country saw a decline of one point (29 in 2023 against 30 in 2022). There has been a decline of one point in female U5MR and no changes has been observed in male U5MR during the corresponding period.","Total fertility rate (tfr) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year.

Boundary Dispute With China Will Remain India’s Biggest Test: CDS Sounds Caution Amid Thaw in Ties

Poll Do you agree with India's decision to use air power against terrorist camps in Pakistan? Yes, it was necessary. No, other methods should have been used.

NEW DELHI: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Anil Chauhan explained why India chose to go beyond drones and loitering munitions during Operation Sindoor , saying lethal action against Pakistan-bred terrorists required air power.CDS Chauhan said precision strikes had been carried out against terrorists holed up in Pakistan even after the attacks in Uri and Pulwama, and therefore, India already had ""enhanced precision strike capabilities"".He said it was decided that destroying terrorist camps in Bahawalpur and Muridke required air power, as this would help achieve the political objective -- possibly a reference to reaffirming India’s stand of zero tolerance against terrorism.Speaking at an event in Gorakhpur, CDS Chauhan said: India and Pakistan learned different lessons after the Balakot operation. India focused on long-range precision strike weapons and post-strike damage assessment, and Pakistan might have focused on its air defence...During the surgical strikes after the 2016 Uri terror attack, the Indian Army entered Pakistan by land and destroyed the terrorist camps. We conducted airstrikes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region after Pulwama attack.""He further said: ""After the Pahalgam terror attack happened, we already had enhanced precision strike capabilities. When we discussed with the political leadership, it was decided that by only using drones and loitering munitions, we will not be able to achieve the political objectives. To destroy terrorist camps in Bahawalpur and Muridke , it was necessary to use air power"".CDS Chuahan said that political leadership ""gave a clear direction with a clear message to destroy the terrorist camps, and retaliate only if we are attacked"".""During Operation Sindoor, the political leadership provided a clear direction with a clear message to destroy the terrorist camps, and retaliate only if we are attacked. During Operation Sindoor, we were given full operational freedom, including planning and selection of targets,"" the CDS was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.On May 7, India retaliated for a Pakistan-backed terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir.Indian forces, acting against crossborder terrorism, destroyed multiple terror infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) and Pakistan, including the hotbeds like Bahalwalpur and Muridke.As the tension escalated, the Indian forces stepped up the retaliation -- bombing the Rahim Yar Khan Pakistani Air Force (PAF) base in Pakistan's southern Punjab region and Nur Khan air base in Rawalpindi.",Chief of defence staff (cds) anil chauhan explains why india chose to go beyond drones and loitering munitions during operation sindoor.

Maroof, born in Kannur's Kottayam-Malabar village, had moved to Pakistan in 1977 with his grandmother before working in UAE. His daughters were born in Pakistan and later shifted with the family to Thalassery.The sisters applied for Indian citizenship, producing an NoC from Pakistan high commission instead of a renunciation certificate. They said under Pakistan's citizenship law, renunciation papers can only be issued after turning 21, and by then they had already surrendered their Pakistani passports.The single bench accepted this plea.The division bench disagreed, ruling that both minors and adults must formally renounce foreign citizenship to qualify. ""Unless Pakistani citizenship is renounced under Section 14A of the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951, Indian citizenship cannot be claimed,"" the court said. The order leaves the petitioners legally Pakistani citizens in the eyes of both countries.",Kerala high court rules pakistan-born people seeking indian citizenship cannot bypass the mandatory requirement of renouncing their pakistani nationality.

The ministry of external affairs did not confirm who will lead the delegation.TOI had reported on July 24 that India had reserved a slot for the PM to address the UNGA on Sept 26. However, the provisional list of speakers is not always a reliable guide about who might deliver India's national statement. In the past too, the head of govt has been inscribed on the list of speakers only to later have the EAM fill in for the PM.According to sources, UNGA is not a part of PM's travel schedule for now, and things are likely to remain that way, barring a last-minute breakthrough in India's trade talks with the US leading to a proposal for a meeting with President Donald Trump . As things stand now, any such development seems unlikely.If he travels all the way to New York, the PM would ideally want to have a bilateral meeting with Trump. However, in the current circumstances, govt believes it's best to avoid a high-stakes meeting between the leaders. Jaishankar is certain to be there and will meet many of his counterparts on the margins, including Ukraine foreign minister Andrii Sybiha.Trump is also reportedly upset with Modi for not hopping over to Washington from Canada where the PM was attending the G7 summit.

Floods submerge 87 BSF border outposts; fencing damaged along 110 km stretch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/floods-submerge-87-bsf-border-outposts-fencing-damaged-along-110-km-stretch/articleshow/123723265.cms,"AP photo

NEW DELHI: Swollen rivers spanning both the Jammu and Punjab frontiers have submerged around 87 border outposts manned by BSF and damaged border fencing in stretches running a length of 110 km, sources told TOI on Wednesday.BSF officials, however, stressed that there is no letup in border vigil despite the floods, which have affected Pakistan’s border areas equally or more. The force personnel have in fact stepped up surveillance with drones and aids like searchlights and night vision devices to detect and bust any attempts at infiltration from across Pakistan. The BSF ‘seema praharis’ are now conducting regular riverine patrols on boats and have positioned themselves in the depth areas (some distance inside the international border) or on higher ground to detect and foil any attempts by Pakistani terrorists to sneak across the international border, taking advantage of the floods.Sources said BSF is already repairing the damaged forward defence posts or high-mound posts to ensure that its personnel are safe and can keep an eye on any illegal border crossings.An officer said the flood-affected areas along the international border/LoC in Jammu division include Samba, Jammu, Akhnoor and R S Pora; while the Punjab division covers Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Ferozepur, Fazilka and a few parts of other districts.The swollen rivers causing havoc in Jammu include Badi and Chhoti Tawi and Chenab. In Punjab, the Ravi and Sutlej rivers have inundated the BSF outposts as well as the fence.Sources told TOI that the fencing is currently under water in a 20 km IB stretch in Jammu frontier and a 67 km stretch in Punjab frontier. “The actual extent of damage to the fence will be known only after the water recedes. As per the current assessment, fencing is partially damaged in certain stretches and fully washed away in others,” an officer told TOI.The officer added: “Drones have been pressed to watch over infiltration attempts and foil them in real time. BSF personnel have stepped back a little to the depth areas in view of the floods. They are ensuring tight vigil and using force multipliers and technical surveillance and aids like searchlights and night vision devices to deny the terrorists the slightest chance of crossing over”.","Swollen rivers spanning both the jammu and punjab frontiers have submerged around 87 border outposts manned by bsf.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin has cautioned the United States against trying to strong-arm India and China with tariffs and sanctions, a development that comes close on the heels of his meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.“You cannot talk to India or China in that way,” Putting said, addressing the media after attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit and a military parade in Beijing. “The colonial era is now over. They have to realise they can’t use these terms in speaking with partners.”The Russian President accused the Trump administration of using economic pressure as a tool to undermine two of Asia’s biggest powers. He also mentioned that he debriefed Modi on the Alaska summit with Trump during his one-hour car drive with the Indian PM.Putin said the US tariff regime was an attempt to “weaken the leadership of these countries”.“You have countries like India with 1.5 billion people, China, powerful economies, but they also have their own domestic political mechanisms and laws,” he said. “When somebody tells you they are going to punish you, you have to think — how can the leadership of those big countries react?”Putin said that history weighs heavily on the political instincts of both nations.“They had difficult periods in their histories too, like colonialism, tax on their sovereignty during a prolonged period of time. If one of them shows weakness, his political career will be over. So that influences his behaviour.”Tensions will, however, eventually ease, according to the Russian President. “Ultimately, things will be sorted out, everything will take its place, and we will see normal political dialogue again,” he said.Meanwhile, Russia is stepping up fertiliser supplies to India this year and both sides will sign a pact for Arctic cooperation next year.",Vladimir putin has cautioned the united states against trying to strong-arm india and china with tariffs and sanctions.

NEW DELHI: Indian govt rejected US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro's recent remarks on India's ties with Russia, saying he had made inaccurate and misleading statements. Navarro has repeatedly attacked India in the past few weeks for ""profiteering"" from Russian crude by reselling its refined form in the international market. Accusing India of bankrolling Russia's war, Navarro even said India's acting as Kremlin's laundromat and what's going on in Ukraine is Modi's, and not Putin's, war.""We have seen some wrong and misleading comments or statements from Navarro. And, we would like to say that this is unacceptable for us and we reject it,"" said MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal.The official said India and the US share a comprehensive global strategic partnership and India would like to carry it forward, based on its substantive agenda. ""There should be mutual understanding between the two countries, with shared interests and mutual respect. This relationship between the US and India is very important for us. Both our countries share a comprehensive global strategic partnership, which is anchored in our shared interests, democratic values and robust people-to-people ties.This partnership has weathered several transitions and challenges,"" added the official.MEA did not respond to Trump's remark Friday that the US had lost Russia and India to ""deepest, darkest China"". Trump's remarks followed the SCO summit in Tianjin in which the three countries signalled solidarity against Western unilateralism.As it remains hopeful of hosting the Quad summit in Nov, despite continued display of hostility towards India, MEA also described as speculative reports that Trump won't travel to India for the summit. ""The Quad is a valuable forum for discussion on shared interests in a number of areas. The Leaders' Summit is scheduled through diplomatic consultations among the four partners,"" said the official.Both Japan and Australia have agreed to participate in the summit, but question marks remain about the US, as the rift over trade continues to deepen. Diplomatic sources say that for Quad to take place, it's essential for India and the US to settle their differences in the next few weeks.In his remarks, Navarro has also said the road to peace in the Ukraine conflict passes through New Delhi. However, without actively mediating in the conflict, India has continued to press upon both Russia and Ukraine to stop fighting and return to dialogue and diplomacy. ""As far as the conflict in Ukraine is concerned, we welcome all the recent efforts towards establishing peace in Ukraine. We hope all parties will proceed constructively. India supports an early end of the conflict and the establishment of an enduring peace,'' said Jaiswal, reiterating the message Modi conveyed to Putin when the two met in China last week.","Indian govt rejected us president donald trump's trade adviser peter navarro's recent remarks on india's ties with russia.

"PM to skip Brics meet on Trump tariffs, Brazil's Lula is hosting",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-to-skip-brics-meet-on-trump-tariffs-brazils-lula-is-hosting/articleshow/123726272.cms,"PM Modi is seen here with Lula in a photo from July 8 in Brasilia -AFP Photo

NEW DELHI: India will be represented in the Brics leaders' virtual summit that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will convene on Sept 8 by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, and not PM Narendra Modi. The leaders' meeting will discuss ways to deal with Trump's tariffs, along with efforts to boost multilateralism, and may be followed by a joint statement. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said Friday that Jaishankar will join the virtual summit.Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-US summit, but Modi's decision to skip the event, even as India prepares to assume the Brics presidency next year, suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the SCO summit that was seen as a reassertion of India's strategic autonomy in the middle of a trade crisis with Washington.Launching into another rant against India for its participation in Brics, US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick said Friday India should either support the dollar and the US, or be ready to pay a 50% tariff. Ironically, within Brics, India has always emphatically rejected the idea of de-dollarisation, maintaining it's not a part of its strategy.Modi's show of camaraderie with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the margins of SCO summit in Tianjin also vindicated the point many have made about Trump driving India into the arms of China with his trade policy.However, as MEA reiterated Friday, India sees its relationship with the US as important and will continue to pursue the substantive agenda that both countries have committed to, hoping that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests. India has stressed on the significance of mutual respect in the relationship, as senior Trump administration officials' launch frequently into anti-India tirades.While both Brazil and India have been slapped with 50% tariffs by the US president, in Brazil's case it's more about political vengeance than trade. Trump has targeted Brazil for the prosecution of his political ally, right-wing leader and former president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchase of Russian crude. Brazil has so far not announced the names of other leaders who will join the meeting.","Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-us summit, but modi's decision to skip the event suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the sco summit.

There has been no reduction in cargo handled by major ports in India so far,” he said, in response to a question. Minister said domestic consumption and India’s success in bilateral trade agreements with countries have opened new avenues for Indian products.Indian ports serve as the lifeline of the country’s international trade, handling nearly 85% of EXIM (Export-Import) cargo by volume and over 70% by value.Sonowal was interacting with reporters after inaugurating and laying foundation stone for multiple projects worth over Rs 350 crore at V O Chidambaranar Port, including the country's first port-based green hydrogen pilot project.
