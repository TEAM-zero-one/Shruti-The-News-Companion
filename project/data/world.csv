NEW DELHI: A Hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district on Thursday night following allegations of blasphemy, BBC Bangla reported, amid continuing unrest in the country and growing concerns over attacks on minorities and media institutions.The incident took place in the Dubalia Para area of Square Master Bari in Bhaluka upazila. Police identified the victim as Dipu Chandra Das, who worked at a local garment factory and lived in the area as a tenant.“A group of agitated people caught him and beat him up around 9 pm on Thursday for insulting the Prophet. Then they set his body on fire,” Ripon Mia, duty officer of Bhaluka police station, told BBC Bangla. He said the attackers tied the body to a tree before setting it ablaze.Police reached the spot after receiving information and brought the situation under control. The body was recovered and sent to the morgue of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital for autopsy. No case has been filed so far. “We are searching for his relatives. If they come and file a case, action will be taken according to the law,” Mia said.Also read - ‘Journalists were scared to death': Bangladesh newspaper Prothom Alo goes unpublished for first time in 27 years; editor recounts 'darkest night' of media attack The interim government condemned the incident in a statement on X, which is also the first response to the ongoing unrest in the country.""We wholeheartedly condemn lynching of a Hindu man in Mymensingh. There is no space for such violence in new Bangladesh. The perpetrators of this heinous crimine will not be spared,"" the statement read.The killing comes amid a broader wave of violence across Bangladesh following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a 32-year-old student leader and key figure in last year’s uprising. Hadi, who was shot by masked gunmen earlier this month, died in hospital on Thursday, triggering large-scale protests in Dhaka.Also read: Yunus govt reacts to lynching of Hindu man; urges for peace Several buildings in the capital, including those housing leading newspapers Prothom Alo and the Daily Star, were vandalised and set on fire. Journalists were trapped inside smoke-filled newsrooms as firefighters carried out rescue operations. “I can't breathe anymore. There's too much smoke. I am inside. You are killing me,” Daily Star reporter Zyma Islam wrote on Facebook.Firefighters brought the blaze at the Daily Star building under control around 1.40 am, rescuing 27 employees. “For the first time in the newspaper's history, the publication had to be halted,” consulting editor Kamal Ahmed told AFP. Prothom Alo executive editor Sajjad Sharif said the attack was “an attack on freedom of the press, expression, dissent and diversity of opinion”.The violence has drawn international concern. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed and urged Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety of journalists and hold those responsible accountable.In New Delhi, a parliamentary standing committee on external affairs said the situation in Bangladesh was “complex and evolving” and flagged continued attacks on minorities, media groups and intellectuals. “The political events of August 2024 have created significant instability and uncertainty with incidents of violence, attacks and intimidation of minorities, tribal communities, media groups, intellectuals, journalists, academicians, etc. , becoming the norm,” the panel said in a report presented in Parliament.The ministry of external affairs told the committee that India remains concerned about extremism and attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, even as it continues engagement with the interim government and seeks to insulate bilateral ties from recent political developments.Police in Bangladesh have launched a manhunt for Hadi’s attackers and announced a reward for information leading to their arrest, as authorities struggle to contain unrest that has raised fresh questions about law and order and minority safety in the country.","A hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in bangladesh’s mymensingh district.

"‘Global pecking order has changed’: Jaishankar jibes Western economic model, points to ‘political stagnation’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-pecking-order-has-changed-jaishankar-jibes-western-economic-model-points-to-political-stagnation/articleshow/126092032.cms,"'Global Order Has Changed Forever, No Single Nation Can Dominate All Issues': Says EAM Jaishankar

NEW DELHI: The external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a “very significant change,” suggesting that India has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.Addressing the convocation of an institute in Pune, Jaishankar said the cumulative impact of recent global developments has altered the international pecking order.“The cumulative result of all these happenings is that the global economic and, thereafter, political pecking order has actually undergone a very significant change,” he said, according to ANI.Pointing towards the shifts in the international labour market, the minister said India is increasingly becoming a driver of the global workforce.“We have started to surge in trained human resources at the very time when many developed nations are struggling to find them,” he said, adding, “Since demand and supply invariably develop their own equation, we have entered an era of mobility.”The minister also mentioned that this growing cross-border mobility now places new responsibilities on governments. “We need to ensure welfare, including in conflict situations, and the politics of this mobility needs to be managed,” he said, referring to India’s efforts to protect its citizens abroad.Reflecting on the post-colonial global order, Jaishankar said control over national destinies has shifted back to sovereign states, making policy choices a decisive factor. He noted that while China has “gained the most” since decolonisation, India has “done well, especially in the post-reform era,” and even more so over the past decade.In contrast, he criticised the Western economic model, linking current discontent to past decisions.“Western elites consciously chose to shift production to maximise profits. Their competitiveness has eroded over the years, accelerated by their lifestyle,” he said. “Much of the Western world now feels that they have stagnated, a sentiment that has increasingly come to acquire a political meaning.”Concluding his address, Jaishankar told students that national progress is shaped by leadership and governance. In India’s case, he said, “leadership and governance have led to ups and downs in various phases in our economic growth and in our social transformation,” urging them to see themselves as contributors to a “Viksit Bharat” that is increasingly shaping, not just participating in, the global order.",External affairs minister s jaishankar said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a “very significant change” he said india has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126092509,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-487596,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
After the last landing: Where do planes go to die?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-the-last-landing-where-do-planes-go-to-die/articleshow/126091800.cms,"When planes get stuck

The afterlife of wings

The second act



Civil jets and combat flyers



What is a plane worth?



Do you remember the first time you noticed an aircraft overhead? A metal giant cutting through the sky, growing smaller until it vanished from sight. For some, the feeling never quite leaves.But an aircraft’s story does not end at the horizon.Long after it disappears from view, the plane will fly hundreds, sometimes thousands, of times. And then will come a day when it will not take off in the sky again. The giant, after years of service, carrying people miles and possibilities to the sky, reaches the end of its life.But what happens then?Do planes have a grave, as we humans do? Is it dismantled piece by piece or kept in a museum like a relic from another era?In aviation, an aircraft's death has an official name - decommissioning.But does a plane stop flying, and how do we know it's the end?Aviation expert Harsh Vardhan explains that there are two factors that determine when a passenger aircraft is decommissioned.The first is economic. When the cost of maintenance overtakes the profit an aircraft can generate, it no longer makes financial sense to keep it flying. The second is regulatory. If an aircraft fails to meet mandatory safety standards, it cannot legally remain in service.Once either threshold is crossed, the aircraft’s flying days are over. What follows, however, can take many unexpected paths.In 2023, an unusual sight caught national attention when an aircraft being transported on the back of a truck got stuck under a bridge in Bihar's Motihari. The scrapped Air India aircraft was being moved from Assam to Mumbai. What followed was the crowds of people gathering to make videos, take selfies.This was not an isolated incident. In another case, an Air India plane got stuck under a foot overbridge near Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport in 2021, prompting widespread confusion over how a plane ended up on a city road. Air India later clarified that it was a sold-off decommissioned aircraft being carried away by its rightful owners.Sometimes, decommissioned planes don’t even leave the airport.In November, a forgotten aircraft at Kolkata airport finally met its end after lying abandoned for 13 years. Airport authorities flagged its presence to Air India, and in an internal post to employees, CEO Campbell Wilson revealed that the airline had been unaware of the aircraft’s existence.The plane was eventually moved to Bengaluru, where it will now be used to train maintenance engineers.Not all decommissioned aircraft are this fortunate.For most aircraft, decommissioning leads to dismantling.Expert Harsh Vardhan explains the process of salvaging usable components before the rest is scrapped.He says, ""The people who maintain inventory for old aircraft, they buy that scrap. They buy those components from the scrap aircraft. These are usually bought by specialised scrap dealers for the value of scrap because there are metals, valuable metals, and other parts. So, to the extent, the components that can still be reused later are taken out. They're taken out and bought by these logistics.""What remains is largely unusable.""The rest becomes the hull, which cannot be used in any form. So it is taken by the scrap dealers to scrap it. Since they have valuable metals, they'll be taken and used for different purposes,"" Vardhan adds.Yet, not every fuselage is destined to be melted down.Aircraft bodies often find a second life far removed from runways. Film sets, training facilities, museums, restaurants, and even children’s parks have all housed retired aircraft.Remember the music video of Shah Rukh Khan's 'Gerua' from Dilwale? Or countless Hollywood scenes featuring planes frozen in dramatic stillness? These are often retired airliners repurposed for storytelling.""Some shelves are used for innovative ideas, creating a restaurant or a children's park to display items,"" Vardhan says.Civil and military aircraft serve vastly different purposes in the sky, but their journey after decommissioning follows similar principles.Group Captain Kaushik Sinha explains that the fighter jets of Air Force are retired based on strict technical limits.""Decommissioning is of two types. One is when the engine life of the aircraft ends. Another is based on the airframe hours of the aircraft. Airframe means the body of the aircraft,"" he says.""They also have a certain age. Once they are mature, they can no longer fly. So they are decommissioned,” Group Captain Kaushik Sinha adds.What happens next is carefully regulated.""We have different policies. We send it to a museum where all the young generations can come and see it, so they get motivated for the future. Or if some government or the private sector wants to put it in their place for a display, we have policies in the MoD by which it is approved,"" he says.For decades, these silent machines have sparked ambition in countless young minds.""Some of these policies are for future generations, so that they should get motivated to join the armed forces, the Navy, Air Force, and Army,” the Group Captain adds.The emotional value of an aircraft is impossible to quantify. Its financial value, however, is carefully calculated.Group Captain Sinha explains the process for military aircraft.""Generally, air force aircraft are not sold. They are either donated to museums or a state government takes them to put them on display, at some important road crossing or civil airports, etc. On an occasion where some private entity wants it, then the aircraft fuselages are auctioned,” he says.He adds that India does not follow a uniform scrapping policy: ""In India, we don’t have any standard scrapping policy for aircraft. Since not many Jet aircraft are decommissioned in India, it is decided on a case-by-case basis.""Civil aviation follows a different route.""Most of them are done through the specialised auction agencies. There are international agencies that do this. But some airlines like Air India, etc, have their local departments that do the scrap selling,” aviation expert Harsh Vardhan says.The resale price of a civil aircraft can go up to about $100,000, or roughly Rs 91 lakh.The contrast with manufacturing costs is stark.""It varies,"" Vardhan says. ""For (Boeing) 737, 378, 100, Neo or Indigo, you are talking about $250mn (more than Rs 2,200 crore) list price today. And 787 could even be around $450mn (more than Rs 4,000 crore).""But do the planes have graveyards like us?Yes.In the United States, the Arizona desert serves as a final resting place for thousands of retired aircraft. The dry climate slows corrosion, allowing planes to remain intact until their fate is decided.""Generally, big nations have graveyards for decommissioned aircraft as they scrap many aircraft in a year. These are large tracts of land in a dry area, which prevents corrosion of the airframe of aircraft till the disposal is decided,"" Sinha explains.Harsh Vardhan adds, ""If you see the Arizona Desert, it is full of all the defence and retired aircraft, even civilian aircraft. So not all can be salvaged.""India’s reality is different.“But here, scrap aircraft are either sold by the operator. And many times, if it is just parked and the parking charges are not paid, then airport authorities auction them,” Vardhan says.Whether India needs a similar graveyard remains a debated topic. While Sinha views it as a tribute akin to war memorials, Vardhan believes current systems suffice, given land constraints.After the final landingWhen an aircraft stops flying, it does not simply vanish.It becomes metal, memory, training equipment, museum artefact, or scrap. It becomes a reflection of economics, policy, pride and time.Aircraft are built to conquer gravity, but even they cannot outrun age.Long after their engines fall silent, they continue to carry meaning. And even grounded wings, it turns out, leave trails behind.","Decommissioning is the end of an aircraft's flying days. The cost of maintenance overtakes the profit an aircraft can generate. If an aircraft fails to meet mandatory safety standards, it cannot legally remain in service. For most aircraft, decommissioning leads to dismantling. India does not follow a uniform scrapping policy for aircraft.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126092108,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1033799,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'Global Order Has Changed Forever, No Single Nation Can Dominate All Issues': Says EAM Jaishankar

'

India's talent

, skill has shaped our national brand': Jaishankar

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Saturday said he merely carries out the “vision” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , likening his role to that of Lord Hanuman carrying out Lord Ram’s mission.At an event in Maharashtra's Pune, Jaishankar, a former diplomat, was asked if only “one Jaishankar” is enough for India. He ""corrected"" the question, replying, 'You actually should have asked me 'there is one Modi.'”The EAM said, “That was the question you should have asked me because ultimately, the diplomats… after all, Shri Hanuman finally serves (Lord Ram). So bear it in mind.”Showering praise on PM Modi, Jaishankar added, “Countries are defined by leaders, countries are defined by vision. There are people who execute it. But ultimately today, it is that vision, the leadership, the confidence. That is what makes a difference.”Jaishankar, who served as India’s foreign secretary from January 2015 to 2018, has been the country’s external affairs minister since May 2019, following PM Modi’s second consecutive term win.The BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member was in Pune to attend the 22nd convocation of Symbiosis International (Deemed University).He told the graduating students, “The old stereotypes about India are steadily being put behind. But this evolution in our image is an undeniable reality. Hard figures vouch for this transformation. Among them, the growing number of global capability centres in India, the increasing demand for Indian talent and skills abroad, and the individual successes of people. And this extends equally to us as a collective. Perhaps more than others, India is today defined by its talent and by its skill. All that has helped to shape our national brand.”The minister also called for “doubling down” on the Make in India initiative so that Indian products can make a mark beyond the country’s shores.“Add to that design in India, research in India, innovate in India, or deliver from India, and the same holds true for services as well. We have to upgrade our infrastructure, develop our human resources, and adopt and pursue the right policies. But more importantly, it requires vision, it requires leadership, and it requires execution, all of which we fortunately have today,” he remarked.Students from over 40 countries graduated at the ceremony, and Jaishankar wished them success in their future endeavours.",External affairs minister subrahmanyam jaishankar likens his role to that of lord hanuman carrying out lord ram’s mission.

Rahul Gandhi Demands Unified National Response As Parliament Debates India’s Air Pollution Crisis

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday alleged that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had joined hands with “anti-India forces” during his visit to Germany.Party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia asserted that the Congress MP was part of a larger conspiracy against the country. The BJP also linked Gandhi to US billionaire investor George Soros, repeating earlier allegations of foreign influence.Addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters, Bhatia alleged that Gandhi met individuals hostile to India while abroad.“If anyone meets anti-India forces and insults Bharat from foreign soil, it’s none other than Rahul,” Bhatia charged. He added, “George Soros and Rahul Gandhi are two bodies but one soul.”The BJP spokesperson displayed a purported photograph of Gandhi with Cornelia Woll, president of the Berlin-based Hertie School, claiming it as evidence of his interaction with “anti-India forces in Germany”.Bhatia alleged that Woll is a trustee of the Central European University, which he said is funded by Soros’s Open Society Foundation.Questioning Gandhi’s foreign visits during parliamentary sessions, Bhatia asked, “What kind of anti-India agenda is it that the Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi is hatching a conspiracy against Bharat by joining hands with such anti-India forces?”He further claimed that Gandhi frequently travels abroad during or ahead of Parliament sessions and meets people who are “jealous of India and attack its integrity”.Bhatia also alleged that this was not the first such instance, accusing Gandhi of defaming India during previous foreign visits.“This is not the first time Rahul Gandhi is indulging in such anti-national activities,” he said. “Rahul Gandhi has become Mir Zafar,” the party spokesperson asserted.The BJP reiterated its claim that Soros makes “anti-India statements” and provides funds to create unrest in the country.“George Soros is not an Indian; he is a foreigner. But Rahul Gandhi has taken the oath of protecting the Constitution,” Bhatia said. He added, “These snakelets within India need to be treated. People of the country are demanding it.”The BJP’s remarks come amid Rahul Gandhi’s ongoing visit to Germany, where he toured BMW’s headquarters in Munich. During the visit, Gandhi criticised the Centre over manufacturing, saying India needs to “produce more” and that manufacturing in the country was “declining”.In a video shared by the Congress, Gandhi said India needs to focus more on production-led growth.“Manufacturing is the backbone of strong economies. Sadly, in India, manufacturing is declining. For us to accelerate growth, we need to produce more—build meaningful manufacturing ecosystems and create high-quality jobs at scale,” he said.In another video clip from the visit, Gandhi remarked, “India needs to start producing. Production is the key for the success of any country. And our manufacturing is declining which actually should be going up.”The BJP strongly objected to Gandhi’s remarks, accusing him of running down the country from foreign soil at a time when Parliament was in session.BJP MP and party spokesperson Sambit Patra said the Leader of Opposition carries a “huge responsibility” and must act with restraint while travelling abroad.“The LoP has a huge responsibility. The LoP has to behave in a really responsible manner, especially when the LoP is on foreign soil. Parliament is in session here, several Bills are being discussed in the House and Rahul Gandhi is in Germany to address the Indian diaspora,” Patra said.Referring to Gandhi’s visit to the BMW plant, Patra alleged that the Congress leader praised German manufacturing while portraying India negatively.“Today, we saw Rahul Gandhi visiting the BMW factory in Munich and there, he appreciated their manufacturing and said that he is sad that manufacturing is poor in India,” he said, rejecting Gandhi’s claim and citing official data to assert that India’s manufacturing sector was on a growth path.The BJP’s latest attack also revives allegations made earlier this year, when party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia accused the Congress and Rahul Gandhi of working with foreign forces to destabilise India.In February, Bhatia had claimed that organisations linked to George Soros were involved in “anti-India activities” and alleged that funding to certain NGOs during the Congress-led UPA government was significantly higher than under the current BJP government.At the time, Bhatia had accused Gandhi of collaborating with foreign forces to weaken India, citing alleged links to Soros-funded organisations.","The bharatiya janata party (bjp) on saturday alleged that congress leader rahul gandhi had joined hands with “anti-india forces” during his visit to germany.

123-year-old Curzon clock ticks again at Golden Temple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/123-yr-old-curzon-clock-ticks-again-at-golden-temple/articleshow/126097695.cms,"file photo

AMBALA: For decades, the clock was stuck at 10.08, a mute time-keeper for the lakhs who moved in and out of Sri Darbar Sahib in Amritsar. Dinged up, dented and faded, few ever looked up at it, and fewer still realised it was a keeper of history. Now, it ticks again. A two-year restoration in Birmingham - the same city where it was built it to order for Lord Curzon in 1920-22 - has brought the clock back to life.""It cost us around £80,000 (nearly Rs 96 lakh) to restore the clock and it's ready for installation at Sri Darbar Sahib in Jan,"" Inderjit Singh, representative of Birmingham-based Guru Nanak Nishkam Sewak Jatha (GNNSJ), told TOI.Lord Curzon, who was India's viceroy from 1899 to 1905, and his wife visited Golden Temple on April 9, 1900. Contemporary records note he and his wife were struck by the ""somewhat unworthy appearance"" of a common wallclock hanging inside Sri Darbar Sahib and Curzon expressed his desire to replace it with a more ""fitting timepiece, designed specifically to harmonise with the sanctity of the Sikh religious place"". It took over two years for Birmingham-based Elkington & Co Ltd to craft the specially commissioned clock and ship it to India.The gleaming brass timepiece was presented at Sri Darbar Sahib on Oct 31, 1902, on Diwali and Bandi Chhor Diwas, through the-then Lahore commissioner.It carried the inscription: ""This clock was presented to the Golden Temple at Amritsar by Lord Curzon, Viceroy & Governor General of India, on the occasion of his first official visit, April 1900."" This inscription later proved crucial in establishing the historical significance of the artefact because time rubbed its sheen so badly that it faded into the wallwork. Over time, the clock suffered extensive damage, likely due to a fall from height and subsequent repairs, said sources. Its 10kg brass housing bore dents, cracks, scratches and missing decorative elements. Its original mechanical movement, hands and dial had been replaced decades ago with a mass-produced quartz mechanism and dull aluminium dial.In 2023, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) handed the restoration and conservation of frescos, wall paintings and golden plates of the shrine to GNNSJ, led by Bhai Mohinder Singh. During the conservation work in late 2023, GNNSJ discovered the historic clock concealed under a modern clock on the northeast side entrance.With SGPC's approval, the clock was transported to the UK and Bhupinder Singh Minhas of Birmingham took on the task of getting it restored.""Bhai Mohinder Singh brought it back to India after restoration in Nov. It is fully functional now. We shall reinstall it at the same spot. The firm has supplied special brushes for its cleaning,"" said Inderjit Singh. The aluminium face with hand-painted Punjabi numerals has been replaced with brass face and roman numerals, just the way it was when Lord Curzon handed it over.","The clock was commissioned by lord curzon for his first official visit to sri darbar sahib in 1900.

‘It is really painful’: Justin Herbert’s beau Madison Beer gets blunt about mental health and bullying,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/it-is-really-painful-justin-herberts-beau-madison-beer-gets-blunt-about-mental-health-and-bullying/articleshow/126078576.cms,"Madison Beer mental health becomes the focus after Justin Herbert’s girlfriend speaks out on online hate and why it still hurts.

Madison Beer explains why online hate hits harder on bad mental health days

Madison Beer balances vulnerability, new music, and public life with Justin Herbert

Madison Beer is not sugarcoating it anymore. Justin Herbert’s girlfriend used an Instagram Q&A this week to speak plainly about how online hate affects her mental health, and her words landed hard with fans who are used to seeing polished photos instead of personal fallout.The singer did not frame it as a one-off bad day or a celebrity complaint. She described a recurring struggle, one that changes depending on her emotional state and one that still cuts deep, even after years in the public eye.Beer addressed the topic after a follower asked how she deals with bullying online. She said her response depends on how grounded she feels that day and whether life outside social media feels stable.“If I'm feeling good in my personal life, having a good day etc, it's much easier for me to brush it off and focus on what's really in front of me these days, which is growth I'm really proud of,” Beer wrote. “But we all know the truth is most days aren't perfect like that. I struggle with my mental health a lot, so it is really painful to go online and read so much negativity about yourself, for anyone. But especially when you are already struggling.She also pushed back on the idea that public figures should simply accept cruelty as part of the job. Beer asked people to think about the weight of what they post and reminded followers that everyone is dealing with something unseen.“It shouldn't matter if someone is struggling or not / wish people were kinder. It's so easy to think but just do really wish people would take the weight of their words, that we've all just human beings living life for the first time and not every opinion u have needs to be shared. Everyone is dealing with something and I don't personally wanna take part in just attacking or ripping others apart just because I could.”Beer added that grounding herself in her own identity and leaning on people who know her personally helps, even though the judgment never fully disappears.The Q&A came just one day after Beer posted photos teasing her upcoming album, Locket, which is set to release on Jan. 16. She captioned the post, “My album comes out in one month,” signaling a major professional moment running parallel to a very personal admission.Beer has previously spoken about feeling supported in her relationship with Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert. On the “Call Her Daddy podcast” on Dec. 10, she described the stability she feels behind the scenes.“I feel like taken care of in a way that I can break down and like I have someone to lean on,” Beer said. “And I think that’s important.”The couple publicly confirmed their relationship on Oct. 5 with a sideline kiss during the Chargers’ game against the Washington Commanders. Since then, Beer has appeared at games and shared glimpses into Herbert’s life away from football, including a recent visit to his family’s animal farm in Oregon.The timing matters. Beer is preparing to release deeply personal music while also navigating the scrutiny that comes with dating a franchise quarterback. Her comments suggest that public visibility does not dull the impact of online cruelty. If anything, it amplifies it.For fans who consume celebrity lives in clips and captions, Beer’s message cuts through that distance. The hate does not stay on the screen. It follows people offline.","Justin herbert’s girlfriend used an instagram q&a this week to speak plainly about how online hate affects her mental health.

Newly released documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein have put a spotlight on previously unseen photos of the late convicted sex offender with a host of high-profile figures, including legendary popstar Michael Jackson , musician Mick Jagger , and former US President Bill Clinton.The images were made public by the US Justice Department on Friday as part of a long-awaited government disclosure.The US Department of Justice published thousands of heavily redacted pages under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump in November.Jeffrey Epstein’s released files and contact lists include the name of Michael Jackson, and court documents show the pop star was at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion at least once, according to a deposition. There is no evidence that Jackson was involved in Epstein’s crimes, and inclusion in the records reflects social overlap, not guilt.The Epstein files include Mick Jagger’s name in contact lists and social records tied to Epstein’s network, placing the Rolling Stones frontman among many celebrities whose details appeared in the documents. There is no public evidence linking Jagger to criminal activity or involvement in Epstein’s offences.Newly released Epstein documents contain photos and records showing former President Bill Clinton in social settings with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, including images of Clinton in a pool and at events with others. Clinton has denied knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, and no charges have been brought against him.The earlier releases also contained photographs of several prominent public figures, including billionaire Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen, philosopher Noam Chomsky, Google co-founder Sergey Brin and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon.

Nicole Lunders and Greg Biffle’s relationship, divorce, and life as Emma Elizabeth’s mother

Nicole Lunders is known as the ex-wife of NASCAR driver Gregory Jack Biffle and the mother of their daughter, Emma Elizabeth Biffle. In recent days, Nicole has been in the public eye again after reports confirmed that Emma Elizabeth died in a tragic plane crash in North Carolina. Officials are still investigating what caused the crash, and many questions remain unanswered.The plane went down near Statesville Regional Airport in December 2025. Local authorities confirmed that everyone on board died after the aircraft caught fire while attempting to land. The names of the victims were not released right away. Later, family friends told Associated Press and ABC News that Emma Elizabeth was among those killed. Reports also said the flight was connected to Greg Biffle’s family. As the investigation continues, attention has turned to Nicole Lunders, not for her past marriage, but because she has lost her only child in a sudden and heartbreaking way.Nicole Lunders and Gregory Jack Biffle were together for many years before getting married in 2007. During Greg’s rise in NASCAR, Nicole stayed mostly out of the spotlight. She was often seen supporting him at races but kept her personal life private.The couple welcomed Emma Elizabeth during their marriage. Even after Nicole Lunders and Greg Biffle separated in 2015 and finalized their divorce in 2016, both remained closely involved in raising their daughter. Friends have often said Emma was the center of both parents’ lives.After the divorce, Nicole focused on being a full-time mother. She avoided public attention and did not stay active on social media. Emma, however, was sometimes seen with her father at racing events and special ceremonies. In September 2025, Emma attended an event where Greg Biffle was honored at the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame, showing they shared a strong bond.That is why the plane crash has shocked so many people. Authorities, including the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, are still working to find out what went wrong. Officials have asked the public for patience as the investigation moves forward.For Nicole Lunders, the focus now is not public attention, but grief. She is being remembered as a devoted mother facing an unimaginable loss, as the racing world and fans continue to mourn young Emma Elizabeth.Also Read: Greg Biffle Net Worth In 2025: NASCAR Star, Career, Family, Income And Death In Plane Crash","Nicole lunders is the ex-wife of nascar driver gregory jack biffle.

The US Justice Department has begun releasing a large batch of previously unseen files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following lengthy efforts to make government records about the case public.The release comes under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump in November. It required unclassified documents in the department’s possession to be made public by December 19, 2025.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News on Friday that the Justice Department would publish “several hundred thousand” pages of documents on the deadline, but he said that the full set will not be released at once and additional batches are expected over the coming weeks.Blanche said the department needed extra time to protect victim identities and ensure that names and identifying details are appropriately redacted.The newly released documents include a wide range of investigative material generated over nearly two decades of federal scrutiny into Epstein’s conduct and network. These materials may comprise photographs, internal law enforcement communications, evidence inventories, and other records related to multiple aspects of the Epstein investigation, according to CBS news.In addition to Friday's Justice Department release, lawmakers and committees have previously made thousands of pages of materials public through subpoenas and voluntary disclosures. In September, the House Oversight Committee released tens of thousands of pages of files ranging from court records and flight logs to videos of Epstein’s jail cell before his death. The earlier revelations included previously available material as well as a new context for Epstein’s relationships with powerful figures. No formal accusations have been made against political leaders whose names appear in the records.The Epstein Files Transparency Act also requires the government to publish a list of all politically exposed persons and government officials named in the records, along with explanations for any redactions and withheld portions, within 15 days of the documents’ release.Despite the milestone release, the Justice Department is facing criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who say the department is violating the law by not releasing all of the files by the legal deadline, which was 30 days fromt he president's signing.","The us justice department has begun releasing a large batch of previously unseen files related to convicted sex offender jeffrey epstein.

Brandon Lowe headline piece in Rays, Astros, and Pirates trade talks

“If completed, outfielder Jacob Melton and right-hander Anderson Brito would head to the Rays.”

Brandon Lowe could be on the move soon. The Tampa Bay Rays are in active talks on a possible three-team trade with the Houston Astros and the Pittsburgh Pirates, according to reports on Wednesday from The Athletic. The deal is still being discussed, but it could change all three rosters before the MLB offseason moves forward.The talks involve power, pitching, and young talent. If completed, the trade would send Brandon Lowe out of Tampa Bay after several strong seasons. It would also give Houston pitching help and allow Pittsburgh to add a much-needed bat to its lineup.According to The Athletic reporters Chandler Rome and Ken Rosenthal, the current framework sends Brandon Lowe from the Tampa Bay Rays to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Lowe is 31 years old and has been one of Tampa Bay’s top hitters when healthy.In the 2025 season, Brandon Lowe hit .256 with 31 home runs and 83 RBIs. He remained one of the best power-hitting second basemen in baseball.Since 2019, only Marcus Semien and Jose Altuve have more home runs at the position. The Pirates are looking for offense after struggling to score runs last season.Brandon Lowe would give them power in the middle of the order right away.Pittsburgh would also receive Rays outfielder Jake Mangum and left-handed pitcher Mason Montgomery if the deal goes through.Lowe’s contract runs through the 2026 season, which makes this a key decision point for Tampa Bay as it looks to balance payroll and long-term planning.In the same deal, the Pittsburgh Pirates would send right-handed pitcher Mike Burrows to the Houston Astros.Mike Burrows is 26 years old and posted a 3.94 ERA during the 2025 season. Houston is looking to add pitching depth after dealing with injuries and workload issues.Tampa Bay would receive Astros outfield prospect Jacob Melton and right-handed pitcher Anderson Brito. Ken Rosenthal reported,Jacob Melton is viewed as a strong young outfield prospect with upside. Anderson Brito gives Tampa Bay another arm to develop. The Rays are known for building depth through trades like this.There is still work to be done. Talks are ongoing, and nothing is final yet. Tampa Bay has also been linked to Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte, which suggests backup plans are in place if this deal falls apart.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: White Sox Eye Power Upgrade In Munetaka Murakami As Experts Predict Bo Bichette 2B Transition","Tampa bay rays eye major three-team trade with astros and pirates featuring brandon lowe: report.

Meditation works as systematic mental training that strengthens the brain’s regulatory systems, improving attention, emotional stability, and stress resilience through neuroplastic change.Both Indian frameworks such as Satvavajaya Chikitsā and Upanishadic dhyāna and modern research confirms these effects biologically, showing altered brain networks, calmer stress physiology, and markers of improved brain–body resilience.This World Meditation Day 2025, let us dive into special meditation curated based on next 12 months planetary transits. One can do these meditations for 11 mins a day or 24 mins a day depending upon time availability.Aries needs to learn how to control their impulses and strengthen their willpower in the coming year. Meditation should focus on counting breaths with short pauses to help the nervous system slow down before acting. This teaches self-control without stopping drive. A low-mid frequency of about 528 Hz can help calm down emotional reactions and reset how the body reacts to stress. Deep red with hints of earthy brown is the most supportive color because it grounds fire energy without putting it out.Taurus's long-term relationship with Uranus causes internal instability, so it's important to be aware of your body. A body-scan meditation that slowly moves your attention from your feet to your head can help you feel safe in your body and trust your nervous system again. 432 Hz is perfect for Taurus because it syncs up the body's rhythms and makes them calm and stable. Soft green or muted teal is a color that helps with healing, calming the mind, and relaxing the body.When Jupiter moves through Gemini, it can make your mind work too hard. Gemini people can use single-point mantra meditation, which starts out loud and then gets quieter, to focus their attention. 741 Hz helps clear your mind and get rid of too many thought loops. The light yellow color with white accents makes things clearer without being too bright.When Jupiter activates memory and emotional intelligence, Cancer goes through a lot of deep emotional work. Meditation should include breathing that focuses on the heart and gently labeling emotions so that they can be recognized without being too much. 639 Hz, which is linked to emotional harmony and relational balance, is especially helpful. Silver or pearl white is the most balancing color because it calms the lunar nervous system.Ketu's effect on Leo breaks down old ego structures, so this year is more about finding your own authority than getting approval from others. Witness-consciousness meditation, in which thoughts are observed without correction, assists Leo in alleviating identity pressure. 963 Hz helps you become more aware and less egotistical. The best color is gold with beige, which keeps things dignified while making them less stiff.Virgo's analytical mind can get tired when transits are mostly Pisces. A structured mindfulness practice, with a set time and method, keeps you from drifting and calms your mind when you think too much. 417 Hz helps reset emotions and make changes that are necessary. The color earthy olive or muted green brings back balance between the mind and the heart.Libra has to learn karmic lessons about relationships and setting limits. Meditation on loving-kindness (Metta) that starts with looking inside and then goes outside helps keep balance without losing yourself. 639 Hz is useful again here because it helps keep emotional balance. Soft pink or pastel blue colors promote harmony without making you dependent.Scorpio's subconscious is coming to the surface more strongly this year. Trataka meditation, which involves softly staring at a candle or a fixed point, helps turn emotional turmoil into focus. 396 Hz helps get rid of fear and deep emotional baggage. Deep maroon or dark indigo is the most stabilizing color because it gives depth without making you feel bad.As Jupiter moves through the signs, Sagittarius's beliefs change. Contemplative inquiry meditation, which focuses on one question per session, fits with the sign's philosophical nature and keeps the mind from going too far. 852 Hz helps with insight and following your gut. The color deep saffron or muted orange keeps wisdom from being preachy.Pluto is still changing things over time, so Capricorn needs to become stronger on the inside. Slow-breathing meditation with awareness of the spine helps you regain your power from the inside out instead of from outside sources. 528 Hz helps the nervous system heal and keeps your emotions stable. Charcoal grey or dark brown strengthens your inner strength and stability.Rahu in Aquarius can make your mind too busy, make you tired of technology, and make your intuition less clear.
