NEW DELHI: Ahead of Rahul Gandhi 's Amethi visit on Wednesday, posters were put up in the Congress MP's former Lok Sabha constituency targeting him and leaders of the party-led INDIA bloc for taking a ""pro-Pakistan"" stand amid escalating tensions with the neighbouring country over last week's terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam.Gandhi is on a two-day visit to Rae Bareli, which he currently represents in the Lok Sabha, and Amethi. He visited Rae Bareli on Tuesday.""INDI's hand is with Pakistan,"" one of the posters read. Hand is the Congress' symbol.The poster had comments from National Conference supremo Farooq Abdullah and Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar. It called Gandhi a ""sympathiser"" of terrorism (""Aatank ka saathi"").Similar banners were put up across the Uttar Pradesh town targeting the opposition INDIA group leaders for making statements ""favouring"" Pakistan.The Congress and other opposition parties have declared their complete support to the government as it plans India's response for the Pahalgam attack, carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists. However, stray remarks from its leaders forced the grand old party to distance itself from their comments.""Some Congress leaders have been speaking to the media. They speak for themselves and do not reflect the Congress' views. There should be absolutely no doubt whatsoever at this most sensitive of times that the CWC resolution, the views expressed by (Congress president) Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi and the views of authorised AICC office-bearers ALONE represent the position of the Congress (sic),"" Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.Last night, after much outrage, the party deleted a social media post in which it accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of going ""missing"" during the crisis. The image, which showed a headless PM, was captioned ""Gayab"" (missing).","Posters were put up in the congress mp's former lok sabha constituency targeting him and leaders of the party-led india bloc.

In the wake of Pahalgam terror attack , Indian students at the Harvard Kennedy School protested the upcoming visit of Pakistani delegates to the campus. In a letter to US secretary of state Marco Rubio , the students requested him to revoke the visas of Pakistani officials who will attend the Pakistan Conference 2025 at Harvard University.""We are students at Harvard Kennedy School, deeply disturbed by the recent targeted terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India, on April 22, 2025. Survivors confirm that attackers demanded religious identification and recitation of Islamic prayers--those who failed or identified as Hindu were killed. This was not an indiscriminate act of violence--it was a faith-based massacre,"" Indian students Surabhi Tomar and Abhishek Chaudhari wrote in the letter.The students condemned Pakistan's response to the attack, as many leaders issued threats towards India.""Even more troubling is the response from Pakistani state officials. While the Pakistani Foreign Ministry issued perfunctory condolences, other leaders have simultaneously issued veiled threats toward India and reaffirmed their support for Kashmiri insurgents, the ideological and logistical base for LeT,"" the letter added.The students noted that ""despite this, senior Pakistani government figures, some directly tied to these statements, are scheduled to attend the Pakistan Conference 2025 at Harvard University. These include Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and others representing institutions complicit in ideologically or materially enabling religiously motivated terrorism.""""Senator Rubio, we respectfully urge you to recommend that the US State Department revoke the visas of all Pakistani officials travelling to the United States for this conference,"" the letter added.In another letter to the leaders of Harvard, the students said that ""Harvard has always stood for equity, global justice, and human dignity. In recent years, the university has taken meaningful stances in support of communities affected by racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hatred.""""We now ask for the same clarity, courage, and compassion for Hindu and Indian students grieving the targeted killing of members of their faith.

Window opens for a reset with Canada as new Liberal govt takes over; PM Modi seeks to unlock opportunities with Carney,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/window-opens-for-a-reset-with-canada-as-new-liberal-govt-takes-over-pm-modi-seeks-to-unlock-opportunities-with-carney/articleshow/120742734.cms,"Canada’s Liberal Party headed by PM Mark Carney returned to power Tuesday riding a wave of strong anti-Donald Trump sentiment. PM Narendra Modi was among the first to congratulate Carney and express willingness to unlock greater opportunities in ties, while underlining that India and Canada are bound by shared democratic values, a steadfast commitment to the rule of law, and vibrant people-to-people ties.For India and Canada, there’s an opportunity now to wipe the slate clean after 20 months of bitterness in ties as Carney talks of rebuilding what he sees as “incredibly important” ties with India. Aware of the dramatic turnaround in Liberal fortunes because of Trump’s policies, and given it held Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau alone accountable for destroying the relationship, India had already been looking to rest ties with Canada under the Canadian PM since he assumed office in March but based on “mutual respect and sensitivity”.However, unchecked activities of Khalistan separatists will continue to act as a redline in the relationship for India. Of immediate interest will also be whether Canada invites Modi for the G7 summit it will host in June. Canada has so far not announced the name of any guest country for the event.“I look forward to working with you (Carney) to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people,’’ said Modi in a post on X. Modi’s message followed Carney’s declaration of victory even though he failed to get a majority that he had said would allow him to deal with Trump, who has unleashed a trade war on Canada and apparently even sought to annex the US’ northern neighbour, from a position of strength. A record 22 Punjabis were elected to the House of Commons but, importantly for India, pro-Khalistan leader Jagmeet Singh, a thorn in India’s side for years, lost from his own constituency and resigned from his position as the leader of the New Democratic Party.India’s ties with Canada took a body blow last year in October when the 2 countries expelled each other’s high commissioner, following the diplomatic row over the killing of Khalistan leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in 2023. Even before that, with Canada accusing the Indian government of having masterminded the murder without apparently backing up the claim with evidence, India had expelled dozens of Canadian diplomats to ensure parity in diplomatic presence.As things look up, both sides are expected to negotiate the return of diplomats, particularly the high commissioners. Both sides have already identified senior diplomats for the top job, but India would want to make sure that the redlines it has drawn are adhered to by Carney’s government. These include a mature and responsible handling of the Nijjar issue as the case goes to trial - avoiding Trudeau’s sensationalism - foolproof security for Indian diplomats and a crackdown on extremists and secessionists indulging in anti-India activities. India continues to hold Trudeau and his indulgence towards Khalistan extremists responsible for the downturn in ties with a country where over 4 lakh Indian students are studying, and which is home to one of the largest Indian diasporas abroad - 1.8 million Indo-Canadians and another 1 million non-resident Indians. However, while India blames Trudeau, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which has investigated the Nijjar case, maintains he only acted based on the information provided by the agency. If India and Canada indeed take steps to normalise the relationship, they will have to see that the process is ring-fenced from the fallout of any damning revelations made during the trial.Carney, who has visited BAPS temple and Gurudwara as PM, has so far not explicitly spoken on the Khalistan or Nijjar issue but he was quoted as saying ahead of the elections there are strains on the relationship that “we didn’t cause to be clear, but there is a path forward to address those with mutual respect and to build out.” An economist by profession, he has identified trade as one of the areas the 2 sides can work on to rebuild the relationship. It is important for Canada to diversify its trade partnerships with other partners in the face of the Trump offensive and Carney, soon after his victory, said Canada stands ready to build a coalition of like-minded countries who share common values.",Canada’s liberal party headed by pm mark carney returned to power tuesday riding a wave of strong anti-donald trump sentiment.

NEW DELHI: Congress' pictorial post on social media, seemingly portraying PM Modi without his head, caused a furore in BJP. The governing party said the image echoed the Islamist "" sar tan se juda "" call recently made by a Pakistan diplomat in London, who had mocked Indian diaspora with a throat-slitting gesture.Congress posted the image with ""gayab jimmedari ke samay (missing instead of taking responsibility)"" as the caption on its X handle by cropping Modi's head out of what appeared to be an old picture of the PM, with his trademark clothes forming the outline. It did not mention the PM's name.Congress defended the post through the day, arguing that it did not show anyone's name or face. However, with the image going viral on social media, the party deleted it in the evening.Significantly, it was only on Monday that the party, alarmed at its netas making controversial remarks like the one debunking the account of kin of Pahalgam victims that terrorists had marked out non-Muslims before killing them, had said only party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and LoP in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi represented the party's stand.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said the post once again exposed sincerity of Kharge's and Rahul's claim of supporting govt in responding to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. ""This is not an innocent post by Congress. It is a sinister design to weaken the integrity of Bharat,"" he told at a presser.""On one hand, PM Modi and Army have taken a vow to destroy the power which has looked at India with an evil eye, while on the other, its the evil of terror demonic power... Pakistan's thinking and Congress's thinking,"" Bhatia alleged, mocking Congress as ""Lashkar-e-Pakistan Congress"".BJP IT dept head Amit Malviya said on X, ""Congress leaves little doubt with its use of 'sar tan se juda' imagery. This is not a political statement; it is a dog whistle aimed at its Muslim vote-bank and a veiled incitement against the PM.""Following the controversy over the 'Gayab' post, Congress on Tuesday instructed all party netas and workers to stick to the CWC resolution on the Pahalgam attack and said any deviation would be seen as a serious breach of discipline. It is learnt that AICC general secretary KC Venugopal has written to all state units and party functionaries in this regard.Congress also took down the 'Gayab' post amid a feeling within the party that BJP's campaign alleging ""sar tan se juda"" had undercut the mileage the party had sought to generate through letters to the PM seeking a special session of Parliament on the terror hit.The party was also disappointed that the post, with allegations of being ""distasteful"", dented the positive feedback about the party's stand extending support to the govt over the terror attack.The delayed response in taking down the post was said to be due to the leadership's late focus on the issue. Earlier, AICC social media chairperson Supriya Shrinate defended the post, with a detailed video of how Modi has been ""missing"" since the attack.","Congress' pictorial post on social media, seemingly portraying pm modi without his head, caused a furore in bjp.

We are Muslims, even if the storm comes, we say 'Allahu Akbar',"" he told news agency PTI, responding to allegations that his son may have had prior knowledge of the attack.Muzammil, who was operating the zipline at Baisaran meadow when terrorists opened fire on tourists, has since been detained and questioned by the NIA and Jammu & Kashmir Police.The remarks came after a tourist from Gujarat, Rishi Bhatt, alleged that Muzammil shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" thrice just before the firing began. “Nine people ziplined before me, but the operator did not utter a word. When I was sliding, he spoke, and then the firing started... He said 'Allahu Akbar' thrice and then the firing started,” Bhatt told ANI.Meanwhile, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti defended the Allahu Akbar remark by the zipliner and echoed similar remarks saying, ""There are some people on social media who are very communal...Like we say, ""Jai Shree Ram"", Muslims say ""Allahu Akbar"" and when we are in any difficulty, we say ""Allahu Akbar""...The government of India must take strict action against those who are spewing venom on social media...""The video, filmed by Bhatt during his zipline ride, captured the chaos as gunshots rang out in the background. It has since gone viral on social media and added a controversial layer to the ongoing investigation into the terror attack that killed 26 tourists, including one Nepalese citizen.Meanwhile, authorities have summoned all witnesses present at the site and are continuing to probe whether there was any local facilitation of the attack.The Central government has vowed to punish the perpetrators and their collaborators. In the wake of the incident, it suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, revoked visas for Pakistani citizens (barring diplomatic categories), and closed the Attari border checkpoint.This has been the deadliest attack on civilians in Jammu and Kashmir since the 2019 Pulwama bombing and has sent shockwaves through the tourism sector and local communities in the Valley.","Zipline operator muzammil was heard shouting ""allahu akbar"" moments before the april 22 pahalgam terror attack began.

'What's wrong in use of spyware to track terrorists?' asks SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-wrong-in-use-of-spyware-to-track-terrorists-asks-sc/articleshow/120742802.cms,"NEW DELHI: ""What is wrong in govt having spyware to track terrorists and enemies of the country?"" Supreme Court on Tuesday put this question to petitioners clamouring for making public the court-appointed committee's report on Pegasus spyware and alleging that it was used to ""snoop on citizens"".""The kind of situation we are facing now, wemust be very careful. We cannot compromise on security and safety of country,"" a bench of justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said in what appeared to be a reference to the Pahalgam atrocity.Senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan and Dinesh Dwivedi flagged a US district court order to claim that WhatsApp had admitted about its system being hacked by Pegasus in India and other countries and repeatedly requested the bench to make public the Justice R V Raveendran committee report and seek Centre's response on whether it had bought the military-grade Israeli spyware.When the Pegasus controversy broke out in 2021, SC had set up a committee under Justice Raveendran to examine the allegation of use of the spyware to surveil on politicians, including a couple from the ruling party, journalists and others.The committee, which was appointed on Oct 27, 2021, had informed the court that only a few people who had claimed that their phones were hacked using Pegasus had submitted their mobile phones for verification by the committee. It found no conclusive evidence of the misuse of Pegasus, though it found signs of suspected interception of conversations and messages in a few cases.For petitioners, who included N Ram, John Brittas and Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, the advocates said the Centre had not denied using the spyware.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, stuck to the Centre's consistent stand and said, ""Government of India does not answer questions concerning sovereignty and security of the country in motivated petitions.""The bench said the US district court order was of little use as SC had passed a detailed judgment and a report had been submitted by the high-powered committee. ""You tell us the name of the petitioner who suspects his phone was hacked. We will check in the report and then tell you whether the apprehension is true. But we cannot make the report public as we do not want it to be a document for discussion on the street,"" it said.When Divan said the spyware was used by the govt to ""snoop on its citizens"", Mehta reiterated that sovereignty and security of the country could not be the subject of debate in the court and alleged that the petitioners were using the forum for some purpose other than the cause they had publicly espoused. ""Terrorists and those who want to cause disturbance in the country cannot claim the right to privacy,"" the SG said. The petitioners said the court could redact sensitive information from the report and then give it to them to understand the process of scientific examination and the findings.","""we cannot compromise on security and safety of country,"" a bench of justices surya kant and n kotiswar singh said.

: The UK govt has said “India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack)” and that it is “seeking to play its full diplomatic role to help manage heightened tensions between India and Pakistan” as the tensions spill over onto the streets of Britain.But, foreign office minister Hamish Falconer said in the House of Commons on Tuesday, “It is important there is a proper law-enforcement-led response based on a focus of the actual perpetrators.”Britain said it was “vital that here in the UK all of us in positions of influence at a community level do what we can to ensure those tensions do not play out on British streets. A terrible terrorist attack has been perpetrated … We encourage Pakistanis to cooperate fully with the Indian govt in their efforts to investigate,” Falconer said. He was speaking during a debate on the Pahalgam attack, which left 26 people dead, following an urgent question by Labour MP Gurinder Singh Josan.“The two states are talking to each other, which is welcome. It is understandable the concerns India has for its security in light of such a horrific incident and it is clearly taking steps to try to establish the facts of the incident as best it can and will have British support to do so,” Falconer said.Falconer refrained from commenting on what UK security agencies know as to who is behind the attacks. He said both the Pakistan and India high commissions “will receive all support from the UK state to ensure they remain safe.”A J&K-born man, Ankit Love (41), was charged with criminal damage after allegedly smashing windows at the Pakistan high commission on Sunday. He appeared in court on Monday. He was blacklisted by the Indian govt after being charged with criminal damage for throwing eggs and stones at the India high commission in Feb 2022.Falconer toldMPs he was aware of the throat-slitting gesture video of a Pakistan diplomat. “The Metropolitan police are investigating, so I will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident, but it is obviously concerning,” Falconer said.Several MPs expressed their horror at how Hindus and Christians were targeted in the attack. Others criticised India for suspending the Indus water treaty or making “unfounded claims” against Pakistan or resorting to ""bulldozer tactics"".Labour MP Barry Gardiner asked: “Is it not time to make the support we give to Pakistan conditional on them finally closing down the terrorist training camps that they harbour?”“Until the investigation is concluded, we should not speculate on the nature of the attack. As we understand it, international agreements have been put in abeyance, rather than being rescinded,” Falconer said.","India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (pahalgam terror attack), uk govt says.

(Pic credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: It may not be immediately possible for India to stop the flow of river water to Pakistan due to infrastructural constraints on the ground, but the neighbouring country will feel the pinch during winter when it would be possible for New Delhi to regulate water flow of the western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - through its existing upstream infrastructure.Observers say that the current phase (April-September) is a period of 'high flow' due to the melting snow in the Himalayas and it, in fact, makes it a necessity for India to let water flow to Pakistan as it does not have adequate storage capacity.“India doesn't have the infrastructure to divert the water from the western rivers because it was not allowed under the Indus Water Treaty (IWT),” Anjal Prakash, expert on Hindu Kush-Himalayas water system and research director of the Hyderabad-based Indian School of Business (ISB), told TOI.During the 'low flow' season of winter, New Delhi may somehow regulate the river water flow and its timing using infrastructure of Baglihar and Kishanganga dam . Though these dams are not designed to hold back water, the flow timing can be regulated, impacting Pakistan’s winter crop sowing cycle, mainly wheat, somewhat and that too during the Oct-March period.In order to punish Pakistan more effectively, India will have to increase its water storage capacity and speed up works on under construction hydropower projects. But it will take time to have such infrastructure on the ground.“To utilise the water, India must fast-track hydroelectric and irrigation projects on the western rivers, while enhancing storage and diversion infrastructure on the eastern rivers. Projects like Shahpur Kandi, Ujh, and Ratle can be prioritised. Rapid construction, political will, and inter-agency coordination are crucial,” said Prakash.Noting that India’s decision to keep the Treaty in abeyance opens the door for strategic control over its river resources, he said, “Within two years, with streamlined approvals and emergency execution powers, India can significantly reduce water flow to Pakistan and redirect it to its own states, bolstering water security and asserting its strategic and hydrological sovereignty.”Earlier as a goodwill gesture, India used to communicate flood data of monsoon period to Pakistan from 1st July to 10th Octoberevery year, to enable the neighbouring country to undertake advance flood relief measures. “India will now not share such data with Pakistan,"" said an official.","India suspends the indus waters treaty with pakistan in the wake of the pahalgam terrorist attack.

Muzamil's father, however, defended him, telling reporters Tuesday that his son was just terrified and had no ill intentions. ""Even if a storm comes, we say Allahu Akbar. What is our fault here?

However, the action risks further inflaming tensions sparked by the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians. India has indirectly implicated Pakistan, pointing to The Resistance Front, a Lashkar-e-Taiba offshoot, though Islamabad denies involvement.Since the attack both nations have escalated retaliatory measures. India suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), sealed the Wagah-Attari border, and revoked visas for Pakistani citizens. Pakistan countered by closing its airspace to Indian flights, halting trade, and expelling Indian defence advisers. On the LoC, Indian and Pakistani troops have exchanged relentless small arms fire in Poonch and Kupwara, with no reported casualties Tuesday.“India’s unprovoked aggression will face resolute force,” Pakistan’s foreign office declared, while an Indian Army spokesperson accused Pakistan of “ceasefire violations to escalate tensions”.A larger military buildup is indicated by Pakistan’s upgrading of its airports at key places, such as Skardu in Gilgit-Baltistan, which now serve as airbases hosting JF-17 fighter jets equipped with China’s PL-15 missiles. The Indian Navy tested anti-ship missiles and declared it was prepared for “precision strikes”, while the Pakistan Air Force boasted of “enhanced airpower projection”. Such posturing, coupled with warmongering rhetoric, has pushed the region to a dangerous precipice.Mainstream and social media in both countries have fanned the flames. Pakistani outlets trend #IndianFalseFlagExposedAgain, while Indian platforms demand retribution for Pahalgam. Defence minister Khawaja Asif warned, “India’s jingoism will be met with a crushing response. Our nuclear arsenal is primed.” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to “pursue terrorists to their last hideout”, amplifying domestic calls for action.Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar labeled India’s actions “reckless”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while expressing a “commitment to peace”, cautioned, “Any threat to our sovereignty will be decisively countered.” India’s moves, including threats to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, risk dismantling decades of fragile bilateral frameworks. “Abandoning Simla would collapse all diplomatic guardrails,” a former Pakistani diplomat warned.As Pakistan bolsters its airbases and India hunts for suspects linked to Pahalgam, the LoC remains a volatile flashpoint, with both sides bracing for potential conflict.","Pakistani army claims it shot down an indian quadcopter along the line of control (loc) the action risks further inflaming tensions sparked by the april 22 attack in pahalgam.

The sharp exchange of allegations has deepened the India-Pakistan rift, raising concerns about a broader confrontation.Chaudhry revealed the arrest of Abdul Majeed near Jhelum on April 25, alleging he was trained in India to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan. Authorities recovered a drone, an IED, and Rs 25,000 (approximately $90) in cash from Majeed, which Chaudhry claimed was proof of India’s covert operations. “India is actively supporting terrorist networks on Pakistani soil,” he alleged, challenging New Delhi to substantiate its claims about Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack. “Seven days have passed, and India has failed to provide a single shred of evidence,” he added.However, Pakistan’s evidence lacks detailed substantiation, raising questions about its weight.India, too, has accused Pakistan of orchestrating the Pahalgam attack without publicly disclosing evidence. In response, India announced the suspension of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, closed the Attari and Wagah borders, and recalled its defence attachés from Islamabad. Pakistan rejected India’s treaty suspension, closed its airspace to Indian flights, and warned that disrupting its water rights would be an “act of war”.Analysts warn that the current standoff risks spiralinginto a broader conflict. The Indus Waters Treaty, a rare success in India-Pakistan diplomacy, has survived previous tensions, and its suspension could have catastrophic consequences for Pakistan, a lower riparian state dependent on the Indus river system.Pakistan’s allegations of Indian-sponsored terrorism, while serious, also demand scrutiny. The evidence presented – centered on Majeed’s arrest – lacks granular detail, and Islamabad’s narrative risks being dismissed as tit-for-tat rhetoric.

NEW DELHI: As it looks to mobilise international opinion against Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism, the government also briefed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan about the common neighbour’s links with the April 22 Pahalgam attack . According to sources, Taliban’s acting foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi strongly condemned the terrorist attack in a meeting with an Indian delegation headed by MEA joint secretary Anand Prakash, who handles Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, underscoring the need to punish the perpetrators.The visit by Prakash came in the middle of soaring India-Pakistan tensions over the attack. India’s ties with the Taliban dispensation in Kabul have improved dramatically in the recent past, contrary to the fear in August 2021 - after the Taliban took over Kabul – that the armed militia would act as a proxy government run by the ISI. All this while, Pakistan’s own ties with the Taliban have seen a stead deterioration, mainly because of the activities of Pakistan Taliban (TTP).The Taliban, in fact, had categorically condemned the Pahalgam attack last week too, saying such incidents undermine efforts to ensure regional security and stability. Given the current circumstances, Afghanistan is unlikely to allow Pakistan any “strategic depth” that it has always sought in the country in the event of a military conflict with India.Prakash was in Kabul on Sunday to review progress in bilateral ties and was reported to have conveyed to Muttaqi that India is ready to restart work on its projects in the country and also invest in other infrastructure projects. The Taliban have on several occasions in the past few years assured Indian officials of enough security to allow them to work fearlessly in the country.According to Kabul, the 2 sides discussed bilateral political relations, trade, transit, and recent regional political developments and Muttaqi again underlined the need for normal issuance of Indian visas to Afghan businessmen, patients and students.Muttaqi emphasized the expansion of diplomatic and economic relations between Afghanistan and India and stated that there are currently good opportunities for investment in Afghanistan. He encouraged Indian investors to take advantage of these opportunities and invest in Afghanistan, according to an Afghan readout, while seeking facilitation of movement of people between Afghanistan and India.Prakash, according to Afghanistan, said that India values its relations with Afghanistan and hopes to further expand ties in various areas.“He mentioned that India will continue its cooperation with Afghanistan and wishes to invest in some infrastructure projects, as well as resume work on some projects that have been stalled for some time,” said the readout.“In conclusion, both sides emphasized expanding relations, facilitating the exchange of delegation, easing visa issuance, and strengthening bilateral cooperation,” it added.",Taliban’s acting foreign minister mawlawi amir khan muttaqi strongly condemned the terrorist attack in a meeting with an indian delegation.
