How India’s airlines turn delays into before-time arrival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-indias-airlines-turn-delays-into-before-time-arrival/articleshow/124081226.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

Choked airports, weather events, maintenance and staff woes, there’s much that can hold up flight operations. But carriers have a simple strategy to stay on top of flight schedules: inflating the duration of the journey

Wide margins

Bragging rights

Blame game

Depending on which airline you choose to fly, the travel time mentioned in the ticket for a Delhi-Mumbai flight can be less than two hours or stretch to almost three. How’s that possible? Most airlines fly either Boeing or Airbus planes, so they fly at roughly the same speed, more or less at the same altitude, and follow similar routes. So, how do you account for the extra one hour of flying time? That’s where OTP comes in. No, not the one-time password you are so familiar with, but On-Time Performance. Airlines, which, understandably, make a virtue out of punctuality, have long since realised that the safest way to ensure an on-time (or even before-time) performance is by inflating the journey time. That makes late arrival rather difficult.Basically, airlines do a careful calculation of all factors at play from before a plane takes off till it lands. To be fair, there are many factors an airline doesn’t control. Like bad weather or congestion on the ground and in air before landing in some choked airport like Delhi or Mumbai. Some, though, are very much the responsibility of airlines, like ensuring there are no snags and taking care of other logistical issues like making sure crew are present.Technically, a flight needs to be pushed back from the boarding gate within 15 minutes of its scheduled departure time to be counted as an on-time departure for the purpose of flight statistics, which are maintained by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The scheduled departure and arrival time of a flight is calculated keeping the historical and seasonal flying time (from getting airborne to touchdown) between the origin and destination city pairs and the taxi time at either airport. This is known as the “chocks off” to “chocks on” time, referring to the wedges placed in front and behind aircraft wheels before it is pushed back and after it lands to prevent accidental rolling when parked.“The usual Delhi-Mumbai flying time is one hour and 40 minutes. Add to that 10 minutes of taxi each at IGIA (Delhi) and CSMIA (Mumbai), giving a total time of two hours. Then, to factor in airport congestion and hovering at destination, the taxi time was increased to, from 20 to, say, 27 minutes. Some airlines added further buffer to their block time — the time an aircraft can start taxiing to the time it comes to a halt at its destination — to ensure they can announce an on-time arrival,” said one pilot. If these inflated flying times are about airlines being smart, it is also a practice that has been driven by growing competition and hectic schedules.Therefore, unless you are flying on a particularly bad weather day, or a particularly unreliable airline with poor aircraft maintenance/unpaid employees/jet fuel suppliers, or to and from particularly choked airport/s, you are unlikely to miss the boast of “another on-time arrival” on touchdown at the destination by the crew. Queries to big and upcoming airlines — Air India, IndiGo and Akasa — on this issue went unanswered.It was in 2003 that Indian skies started getting low-cost carriers (LCCs) that democratised air travel. And, with that, air traffic, terminal and runway congestion, too, became a fact of life.“About two decades back, the total travel time from Delhi to Mumbai was given as 1 hour and 55 minutes. Then, congestion checked in and planes would routinely get delayed on ground and in air. Some smart private airlines started adding a buffer to the journey time to report on-time arrivals. Soon, almost everyone started to do the same, at least on city pairs with choked airports,” said a pilot with over four decades of flying experience. Which brings us to today, when the exact same aircraft type often has different travel times on the same sector. But there’s more here than would appear obvious.Arriving ahead of or on schedule triggers a virtuous cascading effect for the airline: the plane can then operate its next flight on time as well with the same buffer for the flight after and so on. That is unless it’s caught in a big weather event like heavy rain or fog or develops a snag en-route or on landing and has to be grounded for checks and maintenance. But there are other reasons why there can be no fixed or standard travel time between two destinations common to all airlines.How long it takes to fly between any two destinations depends on a number of things, like the routings given (direct or not), weather, wind flow and airport congestion. “If an aircraft gets tailwinds, it will reach its destination faster while headwinds will slow it down. Winters see strong west-to-east jetstreams, which means an Ahmedabad-Kolkata flight could take 10-15 minutes less than the Kolkata-Ahmedabad journey and a LondonDelhi nonstop can take up to two hours less than the Delhi-London,” said a senior commander.DGCA issues monthly reports for domestic air travel that include, among other data points, OTP data of scheduled domestic airlines based on inputs from six metro airports — Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Kolkata. This “data” is crucial for airlines to project themselves as punctual in the eyes of the domestic traveller.But tinkering with travel times is not done just for reasons of OTP. Sometimes, Indian carriers that operate long hauls, say between Delhi and London, report an under 10-hour flying time to ensure they can make do with two pilots. Reporting journey time of over 10 hours means they will have to fly with three pilots, which adds to their cost and also requires them to inform DGCA. The regulator routinely flags this issue with Indian carriers whenever it detects anomalies over under-reporting of travel time with a view to carrying fewer than required pilots.When it comes to reporting inflated travel times on domestic routes, it may suit the airline well, though it also creates several problems on ground.Airlines and operators of busy airports blame each other for air traffic congestion, which is among the potential delays factored in while inflating journey times. While airlines say delays in getting clearance for take-off from or landing at choked hubs is beyond their control, airport operators say that flights failing to operate on time upsets their slot allocation and accentuates OTP issues.“Airport slots are given per schedules filed by airlines. If airlines don’t adhere to that and planes come ahead of, or after, the time they were supposed to land, then it overlaps with the slot given to some other airline. While some mismatch is understandable depending on weather conditions and routings on a given day, what we see is significant distortion in schedules,” said a senior official at one of India’s busiest airports.But going ahead, things could improve as India is now seeing a boom in airport infra with Delhi-NCR and Mumbai MMR going to get their secondary airports and Hyderabad and Bengaluru adding to their facilities. Many constrained places like Patna and Chennai, too, will get second airports.On the airline front, India is now seeing well-funded players like IndiGo and Tata’s Air India Group along with emerging players like Akasa, Star Air and others. These airlines focus on maintaining their young fleets, which, along with added airport infra, should cut down delays to an extent that airlines don’t need to inflate travel times in a desperate bid to win brownie points with flyers.",Airlines inflate the duration of the journey to ensure an on-time performance.

Right now, there are countries in Europe that are still buying massive amounts of oil and natural gas from Russia, which is absurd. They’re asking for the US to impose more sanctions, but there are countries in Europe that are not doing enough,” he said.Rubio added that while the US had taken measures against India, “that’s something we hope we can fix.” He further noted that President Trump retains the option of introducing more sanctions on Russia. “At some point, he may have to decide to impose new sanctions. The President has the ability to do more, and he’s considering doing more because of the direction this has taken,” he said.The Trump administration has levied an additional 25 per cent tariff on India, taking total duties on Delhi’s trade to 50 per cent, among the highest globally.Rubio said Trump remained “deeply disappointed” with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s course of action in Ukraine despite their Alaska summit in August. “But let’s remember, he didn’t start this war. He inherited it, and all he’s wanted to do is end it,” Rubio said.His remarks followed a meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “Our conversation covered a range of bilateral and international issues of current concern.

In a sweeping immigration update, the United Arab Emirates has reportedly halted the issuance of tourist and work visas temporarily for citizens of nine countries spanning Africa and Asia. Though no official confirmation has been publicly released, an internal immigration circular signals a significant policy shift — one with far-reaching economic, diplomatic, and humanitarian consequences. The 2026 UAE visa ban reflects evolving concerns over security, health, and migration governance.According to a confidential immigration circular accessed by multiple outlets, the UAE has imposed a temporary suspension on new visa applications from the following countries:Citizens of these nine nations are barred from applying for both tourist visas and work permits in the UAE as of 2026. The policy remains in effect until further notice, with no announced timeline for reassessment or reversal.It's important to emphasize that this is a visa ban, not a comprehensive travel ban. Nationals of the listed countries who already hold valid UAE visas are not affected and can continue residing or working without issue in the UAE legally.While the UAE government has not released an official explanation, sources and analysts have pointed to several contributing factors behind this decision:The most cited rationale in unofficial reports is national security. The UAE has previously enacted similar measures in response to concerns about:The suspension is described by insiders as a preventive measure to shield the country from potential risks associated with fraudulent or unverified entries.Tense or complex bilateral relations between the UAE and some of the affected nations may also be influencing the visa policy. Past instances suggest that immigration policies are sometimes used to manage or reflect broader diplomatic positions.Residual COVID-19 protocols appear to remain part of the UAE’s visa review process. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in cross-border health management. Analysts point to concerns over:These health considerations may continue to shape immigration policy well into the post-pandemic era.The visa freeze also aligns with efforts to streamline documentation, improve identity verification, and digitize the visa process. The UAE is reportedly working to overhaul its immigration systems to reduce paperwork inconsistencies and identity fraud.The UAE’s visa ban has triggered a chain reaction across multiple sectors:Though indefinite, the UAE visa ban is not permanent. Once lifted, nationals from the listed countries will regain access to the UAE visa application process via:The standard visa requirements will then apply, including:Authorities and businesses across affected countries are awaiting further clarification from the UAE.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday highlighted the lack of engagement from the Indian-American community on issues affecting India, such as H-1B visa restrictions and trade tariffs, as he welcomed a visiting US Congressional delegation in New Delhi.Tharoor said the five-member delegation, all Democrats with four of them from California expressed “tremendous interest in India” and reiterated that the US Congress continues to value and support the India–US strategic partnership. Some members of the delegation were headed by Ami Bera, who is of Indian origin, and they shared similar views.“We had a very good visit from a US Congressional delegation which consisted of five members of the US House of Congress. They spoke very warmly and positively of the relationship, and the most important message that came out was that a lot of American opinion, including in Congress, is strongly committed to the Indian relationship despite recent setbacks like the H1-B visa issue, the 50% tariff setback and the sanctions on Chabahar Port ,” Tharoor said.However, the Congress leader also questioned why the Indian-American diaspora had not been vocal on these matters. He pointed out that one of the visiting congresswomen said she had not received a single phone call from any Indian-American voter urging her to support a change of policy.“This is something that is surprising,” Tharoor remarked, adding that the diaspora must speak up if they truly care about India. “If you care about the relationship with your motherland, then you also have to fight for it, speak for it and press your political representatives to stand up for India.”Tharoor noted that the delegation members were already “friends of India” and “well disposed” towards the country. He said the US lawmakers also praised the strength and resilience of the Indian economy and highlighted the contributions of the Indian diaspora, even as concerns were raised over the Trump administration’s steep hike of the H-1B visa fee to USD 100,000.Other issues raised in the meeting included the US sanctions waiver for Iran’s Chabahar Port, which is being developed by India and the 50% tariff on Indian goods. Some US lawmakers criticised the Trump administration for these decisions.“India is valued, and they remain determined to strengthen the relationship despite the recent setbacks we are familiar with,” Tharoor said.The new US policy on H-1B visas has introduced a one-time fee of USD 100,000 for new applicants, which does not apply to existing holders or renewals and is not an annual recurring charge.US President Donald Trump had also imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, doubling duties on key exports such as garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, furniture and chemicals. The move was seen as a major setback for Indian exporters and trade ties.A parliamentary panel on Tuesday raised concerns over recent US decisions affecting India during an interaction with a visiting delegation of US Congresspersons.

Yes, more measures required No, current measures are adequate

Here are ten things to know about the incident:

A 32-year-old man from Telangana’s Mahabubnagar district, Mohammad Nizamuddin, who had moved to the United States in 2016 to pursue higher education, was allegedly shot dead by police in Santa Clara, California on September 3. Nizamuddin had first studied at Florida College before joining a private company, where his performance earned him a promotion that eventually took him to California, according to his family’s account. His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, a retired teacher, expressed shock and grief, saying he was informed only recently about his son’s killing, which reportedly occurred weeks earlier in the United States. The family claimed they were left in the dark for nearly two weeks, learning about Nizamuddin’s death only on September 18, when a friend from Raichur, Karnataka, informed them of the tragic news. According to reports, the incident began with a quarrel among roommates over an air-conditioning issue, which escalated into a violent scuffle involving knives before neighbors called police for help. The Santa Clara Police department said its officers responded to a 911 call reporting a stabbing, encountered Nizamuddin holding a knife, and opened fire, which led to him being shot. Police chief Cory Morgan defended the officer’s actions, saying that the shooting likely prevented further harm and may have saved the life of another roommate who had already been stabbed. Nizamuddin’s relatives, however, have raised questions about the speed of the police response, alleging that no proper inquiry was conducted before shots were fired, leaving the family with unanswered concerns. His body remains in a hospital in California awaiting formalities, while his grieving family in Mahabubnagar has appealed to both the Indian government and the Telangana state government to repatriate his remains. Nizamuddin’s father and community representatives, including Majlis Bachao Tehreek leader Amjed Ullah Khan, have urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene urgently and help bring his body back to India so the family can perform last rites in their hometown.

NEW DELHI: The death of Indian techie Mohammed Nizamuddin in Santa Clara, California, has drawn strong reactions, with police describing him as an armed aggressor, his family alleging a hasty and excessive response, neighbours recalling a domestic quarrel that turned deadly, and him alleging workplace racial harassment, including ""wage-fraud, wrongful termination and obstruction of justice.Santa Clara police said they were called to a residence on September 3 after reports of a stabbing, where they found Nizamuddin allegedly armed with a knife after attacking his roommate. Officers claimed he ignored commands and appeared poised to strike again, prompting them to open fire, fatally wounding him, while his injured roommate was hospitalized and two knives were recovered from the scene.The family of Nizamuddin alleged that the shooting ""happened so quickly.""

Poll Should the government take stronger measures to protect citizens abroad from forced recruitment? Yes, more proactive action is needed No, current measures are enough

RUDRAPUR: A man from Udham Singh Nagar who had recently travelled to Russia for higher studies was allegedly coerced into joining the Russian army and sent to the war front in Ukraine, his family said, adding they have had no contact with him since early Sept and are now desperate for help. The family of Rakesh Kumar, 30, has written to the ministry of external affairs (MEA), sought support from the Indian embassy in Moscow, and approached local officials in a bid to bring him back home.Rakesh, a resident of Kushmoth village in Shaktifarm under Sitarganj tehsil, had left for Russia on Aug 7 after securing admission to St Petersburg University on a study visa. However, within a few days, he began hinting at being in a troubling situation, suggesting things were not going as planned.His elder brother, Deepu Maurya, said the last time they had a direct conversation was on Aug 30, when Rakesh informed them that he had been forcibly drafted into the Russian army and would soon be deployed to the war zone in Ukraine. After that call, his phone went unreachable. The family later received a photo of Rakesh in a Russian military uniform, which only heightened their fears and confirmed their worst suspicions.A few days later, Rakesh called again, this time from an unfamiliar Russian number. In a short and distressed conversation, he told them that his passport and personal documents had been seized, his official emails had been deleted, and that he had undergone military training in the Donbas region before being sent to the battlefield. That was the last they heard from him.""We do not even know if he is alive. We just want the govt to bring him back home safely,"" said Deepu. The family wrote to MEA on Sept 5 and has also reached out to elected representatives and the local administration.This is not the first such case to surface in recent months.

Gosal allegedly planned violence at Indian consulates in Canada

Poll Do you think recent actions in Canada will help curb pro-Khalistan activities? Yes, it will make a difference No, more needs to be done

Inderjit Singh Gosal, who took over Canada's Khalistan referendum campaign after Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing, is learned to have been arrested by Canadian police. Gosal is also the Canada coordinator for terror group Sikhs for Justice and has links with Babbar Khalsa International, also a designated terror outfit.The action comes shortly after India's national security adviser Ajit Doval and his Canadian counterpart, Nathalie Drouin, held talks in Delhi last week.The arrest - made on multiple firearms charges - signals a shift from Canada's previous approach.Gosal was also an accused in the case of violence at the temple in the Greater Toronto Area last year but was let off after a brief detention. Ties nosedived after the killing of Nijjar, a wanted terrorist, as former Canadian PM Justin Trudeau accused Indian agencies of masterminding it. In Oct last year, India said it was pulling out its high commissioner and five other diplomats due to Ottawa's attempt to link them to the Nijjar case. It also expelled many Canadian diplomats.Gosal came to the forefront of anti-India activities in Canada and campaigned aggressively for Khalistan referendum. Multiple instances of confrontations were reported as pro-Khalistan activists sought to get other Sikhs to sign off on their secessionist agenda.Gosal even acted as one of the personal security officers to SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannu during his visits to Canada. He was also allegedly involved in the planning of the violence at Indian consulate establishments in Canada.A few months ago, he had revealed that Canadian police had asked him to be ""careful"" against a possible hit. Canadian police had also subsequently claimed that Gosal was among the 13 citizens of the country who were targets of criminal violence aimed at pro-Khalistan elements. ""As a result of being the organiser of Khalistan referendum, I am facing an imminent threat to my life from the agents and proxies of the govt of India but I have to continue. .."" he told a Canadian new website.","Inderjit singh gosal took over canada's khalistan referendum campaign after hardeep singh nijjar's killing.

Yes No

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday referred to India several times in his United Nations General Assembly speech, repeating several allegations and charges.In his first speech since his return to the Oval Office, Trump claimed he had ended seven wars in seven months, including conflict between Indian and Pakistan.In another bid to position himself for a Nobel Peace Prize , he also accused India and China of sponsoring Russia amid its ongoing war with Ukraine.""I ended seven wars... No president or prime minister, and for that matter, no other country has ever done anything close to that. I did it in just seven months. It's never happened before. I'm very honoured to have done it. It's too bad that I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them,"" the US President said.""In a period of just seven months, I have ended seven unendable wars.

But inexcusably, even NATO countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products, which, as you know, I found out about two weeks ago, and I wasn't happy.

Poll Do you agree with Manish Tewari's call for greater maturity in political discourse? Yes, it's time for serious discussions. No, politics should remain competitive.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manish Tewari on Tuesday told the BJP to “grow up” after the ruling party, seizing on his social media post, claimed it was aimed at Rahul Gandhi.“Gosh I just wish that some people would grow up in life. Everything does not have to be dumbed down to a Cong–BJP he-said-she-said or targeting X or Y. What is happening in South Asia and East Asia has serious national security implications, and why it is happening needs to be understood in the correct perspective,” Tewari posted on X, responding to BJP's Amit Malviya.In his original post, Tewari had cited recent youth-led protests across South Asia to argue that today’s generation will no longer accept entitlement. Malviya, in return, said the Congress veteran was taking veiled swipe at Gandhi — the “ultimate nepo kid” — and described his comment as a “revolt from within” the party.“The toppling of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in Sri Lanka in July 2023, Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh in July 2024, KP Sharma Oli in Nepal in September 2025, and now the protests against Ferdinand Marcos Jr in the Philippines have one word written over them: ENTITLEMENT IS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE TO Gen X, Y, Z,” Tewari wrote, while promoting his upcoming piece titled ‘The Social Media Trends that toppled or are challenging Dynasts.Latching onto his remarks, Malviya said it was not just Gen Z but also senior Congress leaders who were weary of Gandhi’s “regressive politics.” He pointed out that Tewari is part of the group of 23 Congress veterans who had earlier demanded internal reforms in the party, widely known as the ""G23.""Last week, Gandhi had appealed to “Gen Z” in a social media post, urging them to ""stand up"" for India’s Constitution. His remarks followed a press conference — his second — alleging “vote chori” (vote theft) by the Election Commission.In Nepal, meanwhile, the recent demonstrations were widely branded as “Gen Z protests” since these were spearheaded by school and college students opposing a now-revoked social media ban. The agitation soon broadened into a wider movement against corruption, unemployment, and the “Nepo kids” — foreign-based children of Nepali politicians.In Bangladesh, too, protests that began over a government job quota quickly turned anti-establishment after a harsh crackdown. Both Bangladesh and Nepal are currently under caretaker administrations.","Congress mp manish tewari on tuesday told the bjp to “grow up” after the ruling party, seizing on his social media post, claimed it was aimed at rahul gandhi.

India's only active volcano located on the uninhabited Barren Island in Andaman Sea erupted on Sept 20, presenting a visual extravaganza rare for south Asia. The episode was in fact the result of an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 that hit the region two days before the event.Though the eruption was minor with no immediate risk to human settlements in Indonesian archipelago, the episode - fourth since 1991 - can't be overlooked as the island lies over a fault that moved, causing the Dec 2004 tsunami.The fault's coordinates fall on the same latitude as the Barren Island volcano and in the vicinity of the longitude of the quake that made the magma chamber apt for ""pre-mature magmatic eruption"", said O P Mishra, director, National Centre for Seismology.O P Mishra said it was ""earthquake shaking intensity"" in magma chamber of Barren volcano that erupted this month. Barren Island is roughly circular with a diameter of approximately 3.2km where the volcano rises nearly 2km above the sea floor. Its average height is 300m above mean sea level.""Andaman-Nicobar Island is located in the subduction complex consisting of the down going Indian plate intruding to the mantle of the overriding Sunda Plate where continuous earthquakes of moderate to strong strengths used to occur besides the micro seismicity in the area,"" said Mishra.There are two magma related lava volcanoes located along active West Andaman Fault. Though Barren Volcano has been active for years, the eruption is intermittent and sporadic as and when magma chamber at the depths of 18-20km are activated. Lava and magmatic eruptions occur from time to time due to disturbance of the magma chamber by seismic energy generated from strong to moderate earthquakes that upwelled lavas to the surface through volcanic vents. ""This type of episodic volcanic eruption was witnessed in 1991, 2004, 2005, and now in 2025,"" said Mishra.He said the lava and magma persists and remains in the moving state and is pushed upward once the 'earthquake shaking' tries to bring the hot materials to the surface through cracks and fractures widened by the continuous seismically active cycle.

Opposition Slams PM Modi for Skipping H-1B, Foreign Policy in ‘Old’ GST Speech

Poll Do you think PM Modi adjusted his address timing to accommodate the cricket match? Yes, it makes sense. No, it's just a coincidence.

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut on Monday expressed surprise over Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s decision to advance his usual national address from 8 pm to 5 pm on Sunday.Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Raut suggested that the timing adjustment may have been intended to allow BJP workers to watch the India vs Pakistan cricket match without disruption. He also called the prime minister’s usual 8 pm address a “standard time to mislead people.”Raut said, “The Prime Minister addressed the nation at 5 pm, which surprised everyone. His usual time is 8 pm — that’s the standard time to mislead people.”He added that the timing change appeared to be due to the India-Pakistan cricket match, as BJP workers reportedly wanted to watch it without any interruption from the Prime Minister’s address.According to Raut, the party allegedly informed the prime minister to schedule the address for 5 pm, allowing workers to follow the match — what he described as “a display of patriotism.”""BJP workers wanted to watch the India-Pakistan match, so the time was changed-- what a display of patriotism!,"" he said.During his address, PM Modi urged citizens to adopt Swadeshi practices and prioritize Made in India products, coinciding with the rollout of the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms from September 22, the first day of Shardiya Navaratri.He said, “We need to make every home a symbol of Swadeshi... every shop should be adorned with Swadeshi products.” PM Modi called the GST reforms a “Bachat Utsav” and appealed to people to purchase products made in India, highlighting the hard work of the country’s youth.The prime minister emphasised that the reforms reflect the Union Government’s “Nagrik Devo Bhava” principle and will result in substantial savings for the public.Emphasising self-reliance as the path to a developed India, PM Modi noted that the GST rate reduction would directly benefit small businesses and MSMEs.The timing of Prime Minister Modi’s address coincided with the India vs Pakistan Super Four match in the 2025 Asia Cup.
