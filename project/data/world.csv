Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi living in Belgium: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fugitive-businessman-mehul-choksi-living-in-belgium-report/articleshow/119362229.cms,"<p>Mehul Choksi<br></p>

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi is reportedly living in Belgium's Antwerp with his wife, Preeti Choksi, after securing an ‘F Residency Card’ in the country, according to a media report.Indian authorities have reportedly urged Belgium to initiate his extradition to India after knowing his whereabouts, the Associated Times reported.Choksi, accused of defrauding Punjab National Bank of over Rs 13,000 crore, obtained residency in Belgium and secured an 'F Residency Card' on November 15, 2023, reportedly facilitated by his wife, a citizen of Belgium. According to the Carribean-focused media outlet, Choksi had fabricated his documents to Belgian authorities and misrepresented his nationality in his application process, failing to disclose the details of his existing citizenship.It is believed that Choksi was believed to be living in Antigua and Barbuda before travelling to Belgium and is planning to move to Switzerland.The matter came days after Antigua and Barbuda’s Foreign Minister EP Chet Greene said that Choksi is no longer on the island.Greene, who was invited to participate in the Raisina Dialogue, did not reveal where Choksi had gone and noted, “Mehul Choksi is not on the island. I am told he left Antigua for medical attention abroad (but) he remains a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda. The governments, yours (India) and mine, are working together on this matter.”Choksi departed from India in January 2018 after being implicated in the PNB case. His nephew, Nirav Modi, was also implicated and currently awaits extradition proceedings in London.In May 2023, Choksi informed a Mumbai special court that circumstances beyond his control prevented his return to India, contesting the label of 'fugitive economic offender'. He claims he did not leave to avoid prosecution and is not refusing to return, adding that Indian authorities suspended his passport.The ED approached the special court seeking to designate him as a 'fugitive economic offender' for avoiding their summons and to enable confiscation of his assets under applicable legislation.In May 2021, his disappearance from Antigua led to speculation about abduction by Indian authorities - claims disproven when he was located in Dominica. Some suggested he attempted to avoid potential extradition.Dominican authorities arrested him for unlawful entry, but he returned to Antigua on medical grounds with interim bail. The proceedings were halted in May 2022.Choksi disputed the illegal entry allegations, stating that individuals posing as police officers took him from his restaurant, Jolly Roger in Antigua, to Dominica by boat.In December 2023, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed Parliament that assets valued at Rs 22,280 crore had been recovered or liquidated to settle debts of wanted persons including Choksi.","Indian authorities have reportedly urged belgium to initiate his extradition to india.

Where Indian airports stand

Pressure to make green break

How to avoid hiccups

The power outage that crippled London-Heathrow on Friday was not an isolated incident for the global airline industry, except for the scale of flight disruptions, which was unprecedented. Ask aviation experts and they’ll tell you that it’s more than just an operational mishap but a warning for the entire airline industry.International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh voiced the questions now on everyone’s mind. “First, how is it that critical infrastructure, of national and global importance, is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case, as it seems, then it is a clear planning failure by the airport.”Heathrow is the UK’s largest hub, handling over 1,300 flights a day. For comparison, Mumbai airport handles about 950 flights a day. Heathrow had to shut down after a fire at the North Hyde substation, located about 1.5 miles north of the airport, caused a “significant power outage”. A Heathrow spokesperson said “backup systems have been working as they should but they are not sized to run the entire airport”.Can such an incident occur at any airport in the world or was it merely a result of Heathrow’s legacy infrastructure? Experts said a substation fire may not be a risk unique to Heathrow, but it exposes the pitfalls of relying on a single external power source without sufficient backup systems or onsite supply in the form of solar, wind, or diesel generators, etc. Aviation norms ensure critical units like air traffic control towers, runway lighting, etc, are typically fed by uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The problem is with nonessential operations, the kind that involves operations at passenger terminals.Mumbai airport, India’s second largest airport with its two passenger terminals and one cargo terminal, consumes 26.9 MW power a day. “We receive power through two independent, redundant (back up) sources. In the event of a failure at one source, the other can seamlessly take over 100% of the power load to ensure operational continuity. Each terminal gets electricity from more than one power station,” said a Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson.There are multiple pathways to deliver power to each terminal. “The system is designed to handle not just one failure, but two back-to-back failures without stopping operations. Both the terminals and the airfield have their own diesel generators, with a total capacity of 30 MW. These get activated in the case of a rare, major failure,” the official said. Mumbai airport runs on 100% renewable energy, 5% comes from on-site solar generation and 95% from hydro and wind energy. Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL) said it uses a highly resilient and redundant power infrastructure for uninterrupted operations. “BLR airport receives power from Begur substation, which gets power through four independent supply lines from different substations,” said Hari Marar , MD and CEO, BIAL. “BIAL has also installed a separate transformer at the Begur substation dedicated for airport operations, minimising the risk of disruptions and also integrated on-site solar power generation and gone for tieups with off-site external renewable energy suppliers, ensuring a steady supply of green power,” he added.Unlike the 16-year old Bengaluru airport, many major airports rely on infrastructure designed long before modern digital systems and sustainability requirements became key concerns. While airports have kept upgrading facilities, many remain dependent on outdated power grids, centralised energy supply, and legacy IT systems that can be difficult to overhaul. Heathrow, for instance, opened in 1946 and expanded incrementally. Its electrical systems reflect a patchwork of upgrades rather than a fully modernised design, said an aviation expert.Most major hubs and airports of the world have started moving towards 2050 net-zero carbon emission goals (India’s net-zero target is set for 2070). In the coming decades, the demand for electricity at airports will see a steep rise as it powers everything from vehicles to aircraft. The move towards sustainable energy will happen even as terminal buildings and runways handle ever-increasing volumes of passengers and flights. Airports have begun preparing for this and “electrical resilience” has become a critical aspect of operations in recent years.All the 40 airports surveyed in a US study were found to be planning for or completing electrical infrastructure projects aimed at increasing their power resilience. These include removing overhead routes for an airport’s main feeder lines and taking those underground, and upgrading infrastructure to eliminate single points of failure. The latter is exactly the kind of upgrade that would prevent a Heathrow-like crisis.One of the most promising solutions — which began to find takers starting in the early 2000s — is the adoption of microgrids. These are localised grids that can operate independently or in tandem with the main grid, offering a self-sustained power supply. Microgrids can integrate renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Through these, and along with battery storage and backup generators, airports can reduce their reliance on external power sources. As airports move towards an increasingly electrified future, ensuring power reliability is no longer optional. Heathrow’s disruption should not just be another unfortunate event in aviation history — it should be a turning point.","London-heathrow's power outage was not an isolated incident for the global airline industry.

NEW DELHI: As ties remain frosty, there was no representation from the Indian side at the Pakistan National Day celebrations Thursday for the second year in succession. Addressing the event, Pakistan charge d’affaires Saad Ahmad Warraich said Pakistan desires peaceful ties with India and a new dawn can emerge in the relationship by enhancing mutual understanding , addressing mutual concerns and resolving longstanding issues, including J&K.MEA did not confirm if India had been invited for the event but said invitations or their acceptance dependon the nature of the relationship, while also hitting out at Pakistan for hosting Indian fugitive Zakir Naik . Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal went on to recall India’s statement earlier this week in which it had said the main roadblock to peace is Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism . “This is not the first time that he (Naik) has been treated in Pakistan. And obviously, it shows, you know, the kind of approach his hosts have and what it means for us, and what it means in terms of giving so much of support to a person who is wanted here,” said Jaiswal.Warraich stressed in his address that Pakistan consistently sought friendly relations with other states based on principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect and peaceful coexistence. This edifying approach, he stated, had also guided Pakistan’s quest to seek peaceful relations with India, he noted. “South Asia, our shared home, should march forward with stable peace, equal security and shared prosperity.”",No indian representation at pakistan national day celebrations for second year in succession.

Modi’s presence at G7 uncertain as Canada says no decision on summit invitations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-presence-at-g7-uncertain-as-canada-is-yet-to-finalise-invites/articleshow/119356690.cms,"NEW DELHI: With barely 3 months to go for the G7 summit in Canada, suspense looms over PM Narendra Modi's participation in the event. Modi has been a regular at G7 since 2019 but, asked about whether India will be invited for this year's summit, host Canada told TOI no decision has been taken yet about participation of guest countries.Canada’s ongoing G7 presidency will see it hosting the summit on June 15-17 in Kananaskis, Alberta, at a time its bilateral ties with India remain frosty and in the middle of an unprecedented crisis with the US provoked by a nasty tariff war. The foreign ministers of the group of economically most advanced nations put up a show of unity in Charlevoix earlier this month reaffirming their “unwavering” support for Ukraine but the G7 has been riddled with concerns about Trump’s treatment of allies and his reluctance to call out Russia for its aggression.“No decisions on summit invitations have been taken at this time. More information will be made available in due time,’’ said a Canadian official with the G7 media relations team. Both Modi and his predecessor Manmohan Singh have in the past been invited for G7 summits. Modi, in fact, has been a regular since 2019, when French President Emmanuel Macron invited him for the meeting in Biarritz. Then the Trump administration too had invited him for the Camp David summit in 2020, although it was called off later because of Covid-19.It's learnt that former PM Justin Trudeau, widely blamed for wrecking ties with India with his slapdash approach to the Khalistan murder plot, may have left the choice of guests to his successor. The new PM, Mark Carney, has said he wants to rebuild ties with India but is currently saddled with the unenviable task of dealing with Trump’s adventurism. Carney has also said he wants to create trading relationships with new partners, and to build the strongest economy in the G7. Apparently, limited space at the summit venue might also be a factor in having very few, or even no, guest leaders.Carney has so far been silent on Khalistan supporter Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s killing that caused a dramatic downturn in ties, including a downgrading of the diplomatic relationship. India has said it hopes to rebuild ties based on mutual trust and sensitivity but will probably wait to see the outcome of the next elections that Carney is likely to call soon and will be held, according to reports from Canada, on April 28. While it’s fashionable here to blame Trudeau for the current status of ties, the RCMP, which has investigated the case, maintains that Trudeau’s position was informed by information provided by the agency.","Modi has been a regular at g7 since 2019, when french president emmanuel macron invited him for the meeting in biarritz.

The Myth of Sisyphus

I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. Albert Camus

So maybe Pakistan is happier.

Not because it is richer, freer, safer, or better—

But because, like Sisyphus, it has made peace with the mountain.

And it no longer asks why.

Long before he became a meme for slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars for a joke that seemed like a punchline for Big Pharma to sell some follicular solutions, Will Smith acted in some remarkable movies. One of the most moving was, a fine film on paternal-filial relationships. In a rather dark moment, he wonders if Thomas Jefferson gaslit America by stating in the Declaration of Independence that every American would be endowed with certain rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He says in the movie: “And I remember thinking: how did he know to put the pursuit part in there? That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. No matter what.”It’s a sentiment that theappears to agree with—at least for Indians , who have been rankeddespite the fact that it’s a rising global power—one of the few, to borrow a line from the proverbial egg-faced Shashi Tharoor , whose leader can hug both the premiers of Ukraine and Russia.But that’s hardly surprising, because it completely fits into the WENA (Western Europe and Northern American) idea of India. If one were to learn about India solely from Anglosphere coverage, one would assume that India was a genocidal hellhole where the living conditions were worse than sub-Saharan Africa.The fact is that if irony could be measured, the World Happiness Report 2025 would be a more shoddily written Don Quixote. India is ranked 118th—below Saudi Arabia (32), Libya (79), Venezuela (82), Uzbekistan (53), Rwanda (116), China (68), Iran (99), Lebanon (104), Palestine (108), Pakistan (109), Ukraine (111), Iraq (101), Cameroon (104), a list that includes war zones, authoritarian regimes, debt-ridden states, and nations facing civil unrest. Even if one were to accept that there are enough citizens of the world who prefer being a fed sparrow to a hungry songbird, even Pakistanis would be shocked to learn that they are ranked above India and would wonder if the only person surveyed for this poll was Osama Bin Laden So, before we get into the problem with the methodology, let’s do a simple headcount between India and Pakistan. Currently, India’s GDP is $3.7 trillion—the fifth largest in the world and the only one after the US to outstrip its former colonial rulers. Pakistan, meanwhile, is a $375 billion economy—not even 10% of India’s size. India’s digital economy is booming, startups are thriving, and infrastructure is expanding at a record pace. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s economy is lurching from one IMF bailout to another like a tippler looking for his next drink.Pakistan is essentially running on loans. The country has over $125 billion in external debt, with crippling inflation and foreign reserves barely enough to cover a few weeks of imports. It defaulted on several payments before being saved by yet another IMF bailout. India, by contrast, is not only managing its debt prudently but has become a net lender to the IMF.As for the contrasting militaries, there’s a delightful anecdote from 1957 recalled by Anvar Alikhan in apiece titled, where he draws parallels between the militaries of the two countries.He writes: “A true story: In 1957, the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , visiting the office of General Thimayya, the Chief of the Army Staff, saw a steel cabinet behind his desk and asked the general what it contained. The general replied that the top drawer contained the nation’s defence plans. And the second drawer contained the confidential files of the nation’s top generals. And what about the third drawer, enquired Nehru. Ah, said the general with a straight face, the third drawer contains my secret plans for a military coup against you. Nehru laughed, but there was apparently a tinge of nervousness to his laughter.”While the idea of a military coup in India remained a joke locked in a cabinet, in Pakistan, the military was so good at dealing with law and order and other issues that whenever martial law was declared, people would rejoice: “” playing on the termWhile India became a nuclear-armed democracy—warts and all—Pakistan devolved into a de facto military state whose generals always had more power than elected officials. Coups happened with the alacrity of Friday prayers. In fact, Imran Khan was propped up by the military to counter mainstream politicians, but the former World Cup winner soon became more powerful than his puppeteers intended. Yet, a country where the army decides your prime minister, your policies, and sometimes even your breakfast menu is apparently living its best life.Yes, India’s secularism is under scrutiny and faces legitimate criticism. But it still remains a constitutionally enshrined, functioning democracy with an independent judiciary, regular elections, and a diverse press. Pakistan, in contrast, is a state founded on religious identity and has institutionalised discrimination against minorities. Ahmadiyyas can’t even call themselves Muslim, and Hindus are regularly persecuted. Minorities live under a blasphemy law that’s been used more as a weapon than a shield.So, how exactly does a theocracy with enforced religious conformity and institutional bigotry outscore a pluralist democracy—even if imperfect?India is seen as a rising power on the global stage. It’s hosting G20 summits, mediating in global conflicts, and pushing for a multipolar world. Pakistan, meanwhile, is often the subject of IMF reports, FATF warnings, and UN human rights resolutions. India’s passport opens doors; Pakistan’s passport raises eyebrows.In fact, the contrast between India and Pakistan can even be seen in both nations’ favourite pastimes: cricket. In recent years, much to the chagrin of English and Australian columnists, India has become the de facto Trump of world cricket —big enough to call the shots—so much so that when Pakistan finally got the chance to host a Champions Trophy, India refused to set foot. While the Pakistani team went out dismally in the group stage, India romped home to pick up the trophy without as much as breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury, India’s dominance meant that Pakistan (the hosts) had to travel to Dubai to play its match, and India reaching the final robbed Pakistan of the spectacle.India’s changed standing on the global stage can be summarised by the contrasting online reaction to a tweet from an American commentator with a Ukraine flag (a marker of online inanity), which wondered why there was no outrage when Prime Minister Modi (like Zelenskyy) wasn’t dressed in a suit. Most commentators pointed out that Modi was dressed in traditional garb (a kurta pyjama and a jacket) as opposed to Zelenskyy’s cosplay sweatshirt and khakis. However, the real kicker was even white Americans—who often spend time mocking JD Vance’s wife —defended the Indian Prime Minister because he wasn’t in America asking for more funds and weapons.The implication that India—a growing economy, a space-faring democracy, and a hub of innovation—is less “happy” than war-torn or economically collapsed nations raises serious questions about the methodology behind these rankings. The report relied heavily on subjective self-assessments, primarily via Gallup’s “Cantril Ladder,” where respondents rated their lives on a scale from 0 to 10. These were then modelled against six variables: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. However, many of these variables were based more on perceptions than hard data. In societies where expectations are low, or media is tightly controlled, people often report higher satisfaction. In contrast, in dynamic democracies like India, rising aspirations, political noise, and media scrutiny tend to yield harsher self-assessments—even in the midst of tangible progress.All of this brought renewed attention to the flaws of international perception-based indices—something Sanjeev Sanyal and Aakanksha Arora had flagged in a 2022 working paper . They had offered a pointed critique of three influential global indices: Freedom in the World (by Freedom House), Democracy Index (by the Economist Intelligence Unit), and the V-Dem Indices (by the University of Gothenburg)—all of which had routinely rated India poorly.Sanyal-Arora had argued that these indices were largely opinion-driven, relying on small, opaque pools of anonymous “experts” whose identities, qualifications, and nationalities were often undisclosed. Freedom House, for instance, used 25 subjective questions assessed by internal analysts and external advisers, but published no transparency on scoring mechanisms. The EIU claimed to use public opinion, yet India’s last World Values Survey input dated back to 2012—meaning more recent assessments were based almost entirely on expert opinion. V-Dem, meanwhile, used 473 variables, many of them highly subjective, including notions like “self-censorship” or “deliberative quality of governance.”They also noted that many of the questions used were ill-suited for cross-country comparisons, such as “how pervasive is corruption?” or “to what extent is direct popular vote utilised?”—metrics that penalised democracies like India and the US for not holding national referendums, while awarding higher scores to one-party states like Cuba.India and Pakistan are on two different trajectories, and even the honest Pakistani knows that. If Albert Camus was right, then perhaps the secret to happiness lies not in prosperity, democracy, or purpose—but in the acceptance of futility, the repetition of struggle, and the knowledge that there is no divine reward at the summit.In, Camus describes a man condemned to eternally roll a boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down each time. It is an absurd fate, but in contemplating it—knowing it is his, accepting it as unchangeable—Sisyphus becomes, paradoxically, free. Camus writes: “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”Perhaps this, then, explains Pakistan’s higher ranking in the World Happiness Report 2025. Perhaps Pakistan is the Sisyphus of South Asia. A nation locked in a cycle of economic collapse, military coups, IMF bailouts, energy shortages, and cricketing heartbreak, and yet—it smiles on the way back down the hill.Where India fights, debates, builds, reforms, and aspires—Pakistan accepts. It no longer expects the summit. Its happiness is not driven by achievement but by survival, not by growth but by repetition. Where India agonises over its democracy, Pakistan no longer pretends to have one. Where India chases global leadership, Pakistan is content negotiating its next loan. There is peace in low expectations, freedom in detachment. If happiness is the absence of disillusionment, then what better strategy than to stop being illusioned in the first place?And so, while Indians grumble through traffic jams in growing cities, rage against corruption, or demand better governance, Pakistanis return to their rock each morning, lift it with muscle memory, and smile—because nothing else was promised. As Camus wrote: “Each atom of that stone... forms a world.”Every bailout is a new beginning. Every coup, a cosmic reset. Every World Cup loss, a philosophical cleansing. They roll the rock. It rolls back. The absurd cycle is complete. Meanwhile, India is caught in its own existential spiral—still believing happiness is to be earned, still chasing Jefferson’s promise of “the pursuit”, still demanding meaning from its journey. But as Camus warns, meaning is a human construct. The world owes us none.","World happiness report 2025 ranks india 118th among 147 countries. India is ranked below saudi arabia (32), libya (79), venezuela (82), uzbekistan (53), rwanda (116), china (68), iran (99), lebanon (104), palestine (108), pakistan (109) pakistan is essentially running on loans, with crippling inflation and foreign reserves barely enough to cover a few weeks of imports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119308142,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1418551,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Terry Bradshaw’s political shift: Why the NFL legend chose to stay neutral



Terry Bradshaw , the legendary NFL quarterback turned television personality, has taken a rare path in the often politically charged landscape of professional sports. While numerous celebrities and sports figures have openly voiced their political opinions, especially since Donald Trump ’s initial presidential campaign a decade ago, Bradshaw has opted for a more reserved approach. Unlike several high-profile NFL names who have publicly backed Trump, Bradshaw has consciously chosen to remain politically neutral—a stance that reflects both his evolving political beliefs and his desire to avoid alienating fans.Donald Trump has received notable endorsements from influential NFL figures, including Hall of Fame quarterbacks Brett Favre, John Elway, and Fran Tarkenton. Current NFL stars like Nick Bosa, Gardner Minshew II, and Harrison Butker have also shown public support for the former president. However, at 76, Terry Bradshaw has stood apart by choosing not to align himself with any political party.In a 2020 interview with Business Jet Traveler, Bradshaw opened up about his political shift. After being a longtime Republican, Bradshaw made the decision to switch political parties and register as an Independent. His reasoning was straightforward and pragmatic: ""I've been a Republican, but now I'm a registered independent. I don't want to alienate anyone, and the minute you say, 'I'm a Democrat' or 'I'm Republican,' you're kicking off the other side. I want the best person [in the White House], and I'll pick the one who's most like the way I feel.""Bradshaw’s move reflects his desire to remain open-minded and focused on leadership qualities rather than party loyalty. His switch mirrors a growing sentiment among public figures who feel constrained by rigid political affiliations. Notably, other athletes like Danica Patrick and Charles Barkley have also made similar moves in recent years.While Bradshaw has generally avoided taking sides, he has not shied away from criticizing political decisions when he feels compelled to speak out. One of the most notable instances came during Donald Trump's presidency when the former president condemned NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem as a form of protest. Bradshaw was vocal in defending the players' right to protest, emphasizing the core values of American freedom.""This is America. If our country stands for anything, folks, it's freedom. People died for that freedom. I'm not sure if our President understands those rights—that every American has the right to speak out and to protest. Believe me, these athletes do love this great country of ours,"" Bradshaw stated. He further added, ""Personally, I think our President should concentrate on North Korea and healthcare rather than ripping into athletes and the NFL.""Bradshaw’s remarks underscored his belief in free expression and the importance of focusing on larger national issues rather than politicizing sports. His balanced approach allows him to maintain credibility and connection with a broad audience, avoiding the divisiveness that often comes with strong political statements.Despite his political shift, Bradshaw remains a prominent figure in the NFL world. As a key part of FOX’s broadcasting team, he continues to be a familiar face to football fans every week. While his longtime colleague Jimmy Johnson has decided to retire, Bradshaw intends to stay on air at least until FOX’s next Super Bowl broadcast.Also Read: ""Please be true"": Excited Joe Burrow fuels buzz over Bengals’ possible 2025 international appearance Bradshaw’s decision to remain politically independent reflects a thoughtful, measured stance in a time when public figures face increasing pressure to declare their allegiances. By prioritizing leadership over party loyalty, Bradshaw has set an example of focusing on unity rather than division—a stance that resonates with both sports fans and beyond.","Terry bradshaw, the legendary nfl quarterback turned television personality, has taken a rare path in the often politically charged landscape of professional sports.

Elon Musk reveals why he uses Ketamine—and why investors should approve

Musk on late-night posts: ‘Almost always sober, but questions remain'

X’s advertising business and content moderation policies

Elon Musk cancels Don Lemon’s X deal after tense interview

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk recently addressed his use of the medication ketamine, his late-night social media activity, and the challenges facing X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. In a wide-ranging interview with journalist Don Lemon, Musk explained his reasons for using ketamine, emphasizing its effectiveness in managing what he described as a “negative chemical state” in his brain. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO also defended his work ethic, stating that excessive use of ketamine would interfere with his ability to manage his companies. The conversation further touched on X’s advertising struggles, Musk’s stance on content moderation, and the controversial termination of Lemon’s deal with the platform.During the interview, Musk disclosed that he has a prescription for ketamine from a licensed medical professional. He explained that he takes a small dose of the drug once every other week to alleviate symptoms of depression. Musk described his condition as possibly genetic and not necessarily linked to external negative events.Ketamine, originally developed as an anesthetic, has gained attention in recent years as a potential treatment for depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. Some clinical studies have suggested that low doses of ketamine can have rapid antidepressant effects, though concerns remain about its long-term safety and potential for misuse.Musk firmly denied any overuse of the drug, emphasizing that maintaining mental sharpness is crucial given his demanding work schedule, which often involves 16-hour workdays. He argued that excessive ketamine consumption would hinder his ability to run his companies effectively.Musk also addressed concerns about his frequent late-night posts on X. When asked whether he is under the influence while posting, he responded that he is “almost always” sober during these sessions. However, he did not clarify whether he was referring specifically to ketamine or other substances.The billionaire’s social media activity has often attracted controversy, as his posts have led to significant market fluctuations, legal disputes, and public scrutiny. Despite this, Musk continues to use the platform actively, frequently sharing updates, opinions, and memes.The conversation also covered X’s advertising business, which has faced challenges since Musk acquired the company. Many advertisers distanced themselves from the platform due to concerns about the rise in controversial and hateful content under Musk’s leadership.In a previous public statement, Musk harshly criticized advertisers who left X over concerns about antisemitic content, telling them they could “go f**k yourself.” However, in the interview with Lemon, he claimed that almost all major advertisers have returned to the platform and that both advertising and subscription revenue are growing rapidly.Musk reiterated his position on content moderation, stating that advertisers are free to choose where their ads appear but should not dictate censorship policies for the entire platform. He maintained that X would not accommodate demands for broad censorship beyond ad placement preferences.The interview also led to a falling-out between Musk and Don Lemon. Originally, Lemon had entered into a deal with X to host his new streaming show on the platform. However, following the interview, Musk canceled the agreement, claiming that Lemon had approached the conversation with a bias akin to mainstream media.The dispute between Musk and Lemon further highlights the ongoing tensions between X and traditional media organizations. Since taking over the platform, Musk has positioned X as a space for “free speech,” often clashing with journalists and critics who argue that the platform has become more hostile to certain viewpoints.","Elon musk defends ketamine use under doctor's prescription for his mental health.

Tourist reactions

Canadian visitors to decline

Recent policy decisions by US President Donald Trump are raising concerns about the future of American tourism, with fears that price increases and a stronger dollar could deter foreign visitors.A report by Tourism Economics, a division of Oxford Economics, estimates that the US tourism sector could lose approximately $64 billion in 2025 due to reduced international and domestic travel.The report forecasts a 5.1 per cent drop in foreign arrivals to the United States in 2025 compared to the previous year, a sharp reversal from earlier projections of an 8.8 per cent increase, according to the report published late late month. Visitor expenditure is also expected to decline by 10.9 per cent ""which totals to an estimated $18B loss in 2025 alone,"" according to the report.Since the report was published ""The situation has deteriorated further"", said Tourism Economics president Adam Sacks, citing growing negative sentiment toward the US He attributed this to the Trump administration's recent actions, including tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China, and potential measures against the European Union, as well as stricter immigration policies.Other significant policy changes include cuts to the US Agency for International Development, civil service redundancies, and controversial strategies regarding the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts. These moves, combined with polarizing rhetoric, are expected to discourage international travel and deter organizations from hosting events in the US, according to Tthe ourism Economics.The World Tourism Forum Institute also warned that strict immigration rules, a strong dollar, and rising global tensions could have long-term impacts on US tourism patterns.A December YouGov survey of 16 European and Asian nations found that 35 percent of respondents were less inclined to visit the United States under Trump's leadership, while 22 percent expressed increased interest.Despite the projected decline, some tourists remain undeterred. In Times Square, AFP interviewed visitors from France, Uzbekistan, and Argentina, who said Trump's policies had not changed their travel plans.Marianela Lopez and Ailen Hadjikovakis, both 33 and from Argentina, chose to enter the U.S. using their European passports. ""We were a bit scared about the situation, but we didn't change our plans,"" Lopez said.The Lagardere family from France also maintained their original travel plans. Laurent Lagardere, 54, remarked, ""The Americans elected this president. It's democracy. If they're not happy, they'll change it in four years.""The National Travel and Tourism Office projected 77.7 million foreign visitors in 2024, reflecting a 17 percent annual increase. However, some key markets are already showing signs of decline.Western European visitors, who accounted for 37 per cent of 2024 arrivals, along with Canadians and Mexicans, are reportedly the most likely to seek alternative destinations, as reported by AFP.Statistics Canada reported a 23 per cent year-on-year decrease in US-returning Canadian travelers in February, marking two consecutive months of decline. NYC Tourism president Julie Coker noted that New York City, which welcomed 12.9 million international visitors in 2024, is experiencing increased Canadian cancellations and reduced online searches.Meanwhile, British and German authorities have issued heightened travel document warnings due to the risk of arrest when visiting the US.The impact is also being felt by airlines. United Airlines and its competitors report a notable reduction in both Canadian-US travel and domestic demand.Industry professionals worry these trends could affect major upcoming sporting events, including the 2025 Ryder Cup, the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and the 2026 Los Angeles Olympics.",A report by tourism economics estimates that the us tourism sector could lose approximately $64 billion in 2025.

'They did bad things': Donald Trump orders crackdown on law firms who challenged him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-did-bad-things-donald-trump-orders-crackdown-on-law-firms-who-challenged-him/articleshow/119361813.cms,".





Trump Responds To Claims That His Actions Towards Law Firms Are ‘Coercion’: They ‘Did Bad Things’

US president Donald Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the actions of lawyers and law firms that his administration believes filed frivolous lawsuits or attempted to block immigration policies.In the Friday-night memo first reported by CNN, Trump accused some legal professionals of engaging in ""frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation"" against the government. The directive asks Bondi to review lawsuits filed in the past eight years and recommend possible actions against attorneys found to have acted improperly. This could include revoking security clearances, cancelling federal contracts, or other penalties.The memo's vague language leaves it unclear what specific actions would warrant punishment. However, it explicitly calls for misconduct complaints against lawyers working on immigration-related cases.Trump has long expressed frustration with legal opposition to his policies, particularly regarding immigration. His administration has faced numerous legal challenges over travel bans, asylum restrictions, and border enforcement measures. This latest move is seen as an attempt to deter further lawsuits.“Far too many attorneys and law firms have long ignored these requirements when litigating against the Federal Government or in pursuing baseless partisan attacks,” Trump said in the presidential memorandum released by the White House on Saturday.During Friday's Oval Office meeting, president Trump responded to questions about his actions towards law firms. ""They went after me for years ruthlessly, violently, illegally. They are not babies. They are very sophisticated people. They did bad things. They went after me for years.""The White House defended the decision in a post on X, saying, ""In everything we do, we're restoring law, restoring order, and restoring public safety in America... and bringing honour, integrity, and accountability back to the highest levels of government.""Trump’s actions against the legal community seem to have led at least one major law firm to make concessions this week. According to New York Post, Paul Weiss, a prominent law firm known for working with Democratic clients, agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services to the Trump administration. This decision was made to bypass an executive order that would have restricted the firm from representing clients before the federal government.","Donald trump has ordered attorney general pam bondi to review the actions of lawyers and law firms that his administration believes filed frivolous lawsuits or attempted to block immigration policies.

The circumstances surrounding her death remain under investigation, and the official cause will be determined by the Virginia medical examiner’s office, as per the New York Post.Aber, a Biden appointee , resigned from her position in January following the transition of power to President Donald Trump.

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez to tie knot in a summer wedding in Venice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jeff-bezos-and-lauren-sanchez-to-tie-knot-in-a-summer-wedding-in-venice/articleshow/119362386.cms,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, have officially sent out their wedding invitations, nearly two years after getting engaged. The couple will tie the knot in Venice, Italy, this summer, according to Page Six.The ceremony is set to take place aboard Bezos’ $500 million superyacht, Koru, off the coast of Italy in June.Bezos, 61, and Sanchez, 55, got engaged in May 2023, four years after the billionaire’s divorce from MacKenzie Scott and the same year when Sanchez ended her marriage to Hollywood agent Patrick Whitesell.Following their engagement, the couple celebrated in Positano, Italy, with high-profile guests, including Bill Gates, Ari Emanuel, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, Queen Rania of Jordan, and Kris Jenner. Sanchez was also spotted earlier this month at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party, wearing a white strapless mermaid gown by Oscar de la Renta—sparking wedding speculation.While there were earlier rumours that the wedding would take place in Colorado last December, Bezos dismissed the claims. Sanchez previously shared with Vogue that she was so overwhelmed when Bezos proposed with a 20-carat, $2.5 million diamond ring that she “blacked out a bit.”Beyond wedding plans, Sanchez is preparing for a space trip with an all-female crew aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket this spring. She will be joined by Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry, and Gayle King for the historic mission, the 11th human flight by Bezos’ space company.Bezos and Sanchez, who began dating in 2019, initially kept their relationship low-key until finalising their respective divorces. Bezos and his ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, share four children, while Sanchez has three children, two with Whitesell and one with former NFL player Tony Gonzalez.","Jeff bezos and lauren sanchez have sent out their wedding invitations.

New Canadian Prime Minister Carney will run in Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/new-canadian-prime-minister-carney-will-run-in-ottawa-area-district-as-he-seeks-to-join-parliament/articleshow/119362140.cms,"(AP photo)

TORONTO: New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will run in an Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament for the first time, two officials familiar with the matter said Saturday, a day before Carney triggers an early general election before a vote on April 28.The election will take place against the backdrop of a trade war and sovereignty threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Carney will run to represent the suburban Ottawa area of Nepean.The election campaign for 343 seats or districts in the House of Commons will last 37 days.The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister.Carney replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January, but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader on March 9 following a leadership race by the governing party.Carney, sworn in as Canada's 24th prime minister on March 14, has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate.The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war. Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state and he acknowledged Friday that he has upended Canadian politics.What Trump hasn't said is that the almost daily attacks on Canada's sovereignty have infuriated Canadians. That has led to a surge in Canadian nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers.The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products - as well as all of America's trading partners - on April 2.Carney still hasn't had a phone call with Trump and that might not happen now until after the election. Trump mocked Trudeau by calling him governor, but he has not yet mentioned Carney's name.Carney, 60, was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013, he became the first noncitizen of the United Kingdom to run the Bank of England - helping to manage the impact of Brexit.Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney's main challenger. The party and Poilievre were heading for a huge victory in Canada's federal election this year until Trump's near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them.Poilievre, 45, for years the party's go-to attack dog, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put ""Canada first."" He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada's public broadcaster. His party announced that it won't allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes.","New canadian prime minister mark carney will run in an ottawa area district as he seeks to join parliament for the first time.
