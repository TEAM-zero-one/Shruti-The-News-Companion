Nikhil Gupta trial

NEW DELHI: Indian national Nikhil Gupta, indicted by US authorities for plotting to kill Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , will go on trial on Nov 3 and not in June or July as was earlier proposed.A US district judge of the southern district of New York finalised the date for the trial, which will last only for a week, after both prosecution and defence sought postponement to allow them to file pretrial motions to resolve legal issues that may have a bearing on the trial.In a Feb 28 order, the court had asked both parties to suggest a trial date in June or July. While the parties also said in their latest submission that they anticipated the trial to last for approximately two weeks, the court allowed only a week to wrap up. Nikhil Gupta, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, has been held in a detention centre since Czech Republic, where he was first detained, extradited him to the US on June 14 last year.Gupta stands accused of hiring a hitman for $100,000 to eliminate Pannun, a US-Canadian national, at the behest of an Indian govt official identified as Vikash Yadav. The murder plot unravelled as the hitman turned out to be a federal undercover agent. Yadav allegedly hired Gupta in May 2023 to orchestrate Pannun's assassination.The Indian govt formed a high-level committee in Nov 2023 to probe US findings. In Jan, days before Donald Trump assumed office, the committee submitted a report recommending legal action against Yadav (without naming him) saying his ""earlier criminal links and antecedents also came to notice during the enquiry"".","Indian national nikhil gupta, indicted by us authorities for plotting to kill sikh separatist gurpatwant singh pannun, will go on trial on nov 3.

Stock market crash today: It’s bloodbath on Monday! BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, crashed in trade on Monday. Both stock market indices plunged 5% intraday before recovering partially. BSE Sensex ended the day at 73,137.90, down 2,227 points or 2.95%. Nifty50 ended at 22,161.60, down 743 points or 3.24%.This is the largest single-day decline in 10 months. The sharp decline followed global market turmoil triggered by US President Donald Trump's tariff increases and China's retaliatory measures, sparking concerns about economic slowdown. Investors on Dalal Street experienced significant losses on Monday, with their wealth diminishing by Rs 14 lakh crore due to a substantial drop in benchmark indices.The market value of companies listed on the BSE saw a considerable reduction of Rs 14,09,225.71 crore, settling at Rs 3,89,25,660.75 crore (USD 4.54 trillion) within a single trading session.Amongst Sensex constituents, only Hindustan Unilever avoided losses. Tata Steel registered the steepest decline of 7.33 per cent, whilst Larsen & Toubro decreased by 5.78 per cent.Significant losses were also recorded by Tata Motors, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, Infosys, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HCL Technologies and HDFC Bank. Hindustan Unilever showed a slight increase.Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited said, “The market tumbled as the carnage over high US tariffs and the retaliation by other countries may kickstart a trade war. Sectors like IT and metals have underperformed relative to the broader market due to the risk of high inflation with slower growth that may result in a potential recession in the US. Though the overall impact on India may be limited when compared with other countries, investors are advised to play cautiously during this fray. Focus will be on pure-play domestic themes, where the rebound is likely to be fair when the dust settles.""On Monday, small-cap indices declined 4.13 per cent, whilst mid-cap indices decreased 3.46 per cent.BSE sectoral indices showed substantial losses: Metal (6.22 per cent), realty (5.69 per cent), commodities (4.68 per cent), industrials (4.57 per cent), consumer discretionary (3.79 per cent), auto (3.77 per cent), bankex (3.37 per cent), IT (2.92 per cent), tech (2.85 per cent) and BSE Focused IT (2.63 per cent).The week ahead has crucial domestic and global events, with international investors monitoring trade-related developments closely. On the domestic front, the MPC meeting conclusion on April 9 will be pivotal, followed by important economic indicators—IIP and CPI data—scheduled for April 11. The quarterly earnings season commences with TCS presenting its results on April 10.The Nasdaq index moved into bear market territory on Friday, declining over 20% from its latest high point. This followed the extensive tariff announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump, raising concerns about worldwide economic deceleration. The comprehensive nature of these tariffs caught market participants off guard, leading to substantial declines across international financial markets.The Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell noted that the tariffs exceeded anticipated levels and cautioned about their potential effects on inflation and economic expansion, contributing to the unclear prospects for the U.S. economy.The Indian stock markets reflected the broader international decline, with significant drops across Asian exchanges. Asian markets experienced substantial declines, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropping over 13 per cent, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 declining nearly 8 per cent, Shanghai SSE Composite index falling over 7 per cent, and South Korea's Kospi decreasing more than 5 per cent.European markets experienced significant selling pressure, declining by up to 6 per cent.Concurrently, American futures showed continued weakness, with Nasdaq futures declining 4% and S&P 500 futures showing a 3.1% reduction. The European futures markets also displayed significant negative movement.Investors are increasingly worried about an economic downturn rather than immediate inflation challenges. The upcoming U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report is projected to show a 0.3% rise for March. However, experts anticipate that impending tariffs will lead to substantial cost increases across various industries, affecting everything from food items to vehicles.As the earnings season commences, businesses are likely to face pressure on their profit margins due to higher operational expenses. Approximately 87% of U.S. firms will disclose their financial results between April 11 and May 9, with financial institutions leading the announcements.The worldwide commodities market experienced substantial losses due to concerns about reduced demand and potential economic contraction.The price of Brent crude decreased by 6.5%, while WTI saw a 7.4% reduction. Precious metals weren't spared, with gold declining 2.4% and silver dropping 7.3%. Industrial metals also experienced significant reductions, as copper fell 6.5%, zinc decreased 2%, and aluminium declined 3.2%, reflecting investors' unease about trade disputes and recession possibilities.Market participants shifted towards secure investments as concerns about a worldwide economic downturn intensified, creating additional pressure on stock markets. Strong demand for government securities pushed the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield down by 8 basis points to 3.916%. Trading in Fed funds futures increased, indicating expectations of an additional 25-basis-point reduction in rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve within the year.The widespread move towards secure assets resulted in extensive selling across equity markets, as cautious sentiment spread throughout global trading venues. Although Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated on Friday that the central bank remains patient regarding policy changes, market projections now suggest a 56% likelihood of a rate reduction by May.The global trade dispute intensified as China implemented retaliatory tariffs on various U.S. products, responding to comprehensive U.S. tariff increases earlier in the week. This ongoing exchange of trade restrictions has generated significant concerns regarding international trade and economic development.Market analysts have expressed apprehension that sustained trade disagreements between the United States and China could affect manufacturing processes, reduce company profits, and further impact global demand, leading to substantial declines in worldwide equity markets.","Bse sensex ended the day at 73,137.90, down 2,227 points or 2.95%.

Second extension for China's TikTok app

Trump Tariffs hurt TikTok deal . The US President Donald Trump just admitted the same. According to a report in Bloomberg, The US President made the admission to reporters on Air Force One as he returned to Washington after a weekend of golf in Florida. China’s objections to new US tariffs stalled a deal to sell off TikTok and keep it operating in the US, President Donald Trump said, as per the report. Trump told reporters, “We had a deal pretty much for TikTok — not a deal but pretty close — and then China changed the deal because of tariffs.”He added, “If I gave a little cut in tariffs they would have approved that deal in 15 minutes, which shows the power of tariffs.” Reports claim that before Trump announced widespread tariffs that went live on April 5, a deal was said to be close, advanced by a consortium of US investors including Oracle Corp, Blackstone Inc and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.Incidentally, Trump had earlier said that he is willing to cut a deal with China to lower tariffs if the country agreed to a TikTok sale .On Friday, April 4, the US President extended the deadline for the TikTok deal by another 75 days. This is the second extension for the Chinese social media app, after Donald Trump earlier gave a 75-day extension on the day of his inauguration as the US President. Media reports suggest that the Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, have been working on an agreement to find TikTok an American buyer, as required by a bipartisan law enacted in 2024. However, any deal that allows TikTok to be sold to an American company requires China's approval. Under the 2024 law, ByteDance was required to divest TikTok’s US unit by January 19, which has been valued from $20 billion to as high as $150 billion.Trump previously extended the divest-or-ban requirement, and on Friday signed another 75-day extension.","Second extension for china's tiktok app. Us president donald trump just admitted the same.

Poll Do you think green card holders should reconsider traveling abroad in light of recent immigration policies? No, I believe it's safe. Yes, it's too risky.

Having correct documents is most important

Green card holders and visa holders in the country need to think twice before traveling outside the country, lawyers warn amid the massive crackdown on international students and migrants. ""Anyone who isn't a U.S. citizen should think hard about the need to leave the United States, especially if they have made statements on social media that are critical of political positions that the Trump administration supports or have had even minimal contact with police,"" César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, the Gregory Williams Chair in civil rights & civil liberties at Ohio State University College of Law, told Newsweek.""The Trump administration has given permanent residents and visa holders plenty of reason to worry about running into problems trying to get back into the United States from a trip abroad,"" the immigration law expert said, though the administration asserted that those who have not broken any laws have nothing to fear about anything.Shannon Shepherd, chair of the media committee for the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) told Newsweek that overall there's no guarantee that a person coming back to the US will be granted entry and that's been the case always. ""But what we're seeing lately is more negative exercise of discretion, I guess is the way to put it, where people are being denied entry that we wouldn't necessarily have been denied before or people being detained instead of just allowed to withdraw their request for entry.""According to these experts, having the correct documentation is of utmost importance. For green card holders, the documents are a valid passport and the green card. If the green card is up for renewal, then one must vatty the receipt from the US Citizenship and Immigration Service.Past criminal convictions, even minor infractions, could now be taken into account at the discretion of CBP officers at the border, along with social media comments or text messages, in order to deny entry even if the traveler has all the correct paperwork, Shepherd said.If an individual is in the process of applying for a green card, known as Adjustment of Status (AoS), then they generally can't leave the country without Advance Parole. This is a travel document that has to be granted by USCIS before travel. CBP website mentions that those with valid H-1B or L-1 visas going through AoS are allowed to travel without Advance Parole, as are V- and K-3/4 nonimmigrant visa holders.","Experts feel green card holders should think twice now before traveling outside the us if they have criticized trump on social media.past criminal convictions, even minor infractions, could now be taken into account at the discretion of cbp officers at the border, along with social media comments or text messages.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120023862,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-935229,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

President Trump defends tariffs, calling it 'economic revolution'

United States President Donald Trump doubled down on his tariff move, calling the retaliatory duties a ""beautiful thing"" that the Americans would ""realise someday"".Trump’s remarks followed a steep downturn in global financial markets, which seemed poised to extend their losses when trading reopened on Monday. His aides, meanwhile, attempted to calm investor fears, noting that over 50 countries had expressed interest in opening talks to remove the tariffs.Trump said the US has a ""massive financial deficit with China, the European Union and many others"", accusing predecessor Biden of growing surplus.""We have massive Financial Deficits with China, the European Union, and many others. The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing Tens of Billions of Dollars into the U.S.A. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold,"" he said on his social media platform TruthSocial.He further said: ""The Surplus with these Countries has grown during “Presidency” of Sleepy Joe Biden. We are going to reverse it, and reverse it QUICKLY. Some day people will realize that Tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!""On April 02, Trump implemented a series of extensive tariffs aimed at restructuring US trade relationships and bolstering domestic industries. On April 2, dubbed ""Liberation Day,"" a universal 10% import duty was imposed on all goods entering the United States, with higher rates for 57 specific trading partners, including China, Canada, and Mexico. These increased tariffs were calculated based on existing trade deficits with each country, with the administration aiming to reduce these deficits to zero.Specifically, tariffs on Chinese imports were raised to an effective rate of 54% after April 9, intensifying the ongoing trade tensions between the two nations. Additionally, a 25% tariff on imported automobiles was enacted on April 3, affecting major auto-exporting countries.The administration justified these measures by citing the need to address trade imbalances, protect national security, and curb issues such as contraband drug trafficking. However, these actions have led to significant economic debates.Critics argue that the tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices , potential job losses in industries reliant on imports, and strained relationships with key trading partners. Some economists warn of the risk of a recession due to reduced consumer confidence and increased production costs.In response, countries like Canada, China, and the European Union have announced counter-tariffs , further escalating global trade tensions. Legal challenges are also emerging, questioning the extent of executive power in imposing such tariffs and their alignment with international trade laws .As these policies unfold, their long-term impact on the US economy and global trade dynamics remains a subject of close observation and analysis.","Us president donald trump doubled down on his tariff move, calling the retaliatory duties a ""beautiful thing"" that the americans would ""realise someday"" his remarks followed a steep downturn in global financial markets, which seemed poised to extend their losses when trading reopened on monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120051339,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1098856,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Market commentator and CNBC host Jim Cramer-- who warned that a potential market crash could be the worst one-day decline since 1987's "" Black Monday ,""-- urged long-term investors to stay the course amid the market turmoil caused by President Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariff announcement.Speaking on Squawk on the Street Thursday, Cramer advised investors to maintain their positions, emphasizing that, like during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the market would eventually recover.In 1987, US stock market plunged over 22% in a single day.“If you were OK in 2007 and 2008, it came back,” Cramer said, referencing the market’s recovery after the financial crisis, as per CNBC report.He acknowledged that it took until 2013 for investors to recoup their losses but insisted that those with a long-term outlook shouldn’t panic. “If you need your money now, such as retirees or those nearing retirement, you’re in limbo,” Cramer added, but emphasized, “Don’t sell, just hold.”Reflecting on the current market drop, Cramer described it as a ""price-to-earnings ratio lowering event,"" suggesting that the decline is offering buying opportunities for savvy investors. He said, “Once that happens, then I think you really have to start thinking, ‘That’s interesting.’ It will get there.” Cramer noted that the S&P 500’s forward P/E ratio is just above 20, down from a trailing P/E ratio closer to 25.Cramer also shared a personal anecdote, recalling the advice he gave during the financial crisis. “In 2007, I went on the ‘Today’ show and said, ‘If you need any money in the next five years, you should sell.’ That was a great call,” he said.But Cramer also reflected on his later advice during the market’s recovery, when he famously bought at the “Haines bottom,” a moment credited to late CNBC anchor Mark Haines, who called the market bottom on March 10, 2009.While Cramer emphasized the difficulty of timing the market, he highlighted the danger of remembering only the sell call from such moments, not the buy call when the market was poised to rebound. ""You have to be right twice: first on the sale, and second when you repurchase at the bottom,"" Cramer cautioned.His advice remained clear: Investors should not panic, but instead, view the market’s current volatility as a potential buying opportunity in the long run.","Cnbc host jim cramer warned that a potential market crash could be the worst one-day decline since 1987's "" black monday,""-- urged long-term investors to stay the course amid the market turmoil caused by president donald trump’s sweeping tariff announcement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120069098,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1054310,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Global markets hit hard

US stock markets joined the global market selloff on Monday, with S&P 500 plunging 4%. S&P 500 saw its poorest performance since the COVID-induced economic crisis in March 2020. Markets are experiencing dramatic fluctuations as investors evaluate the implications of President Donald Trump 's international trade policies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average demonstrated extreme volatility, initially plummeting 1,700 points before surging 800 points higher, and subsequently declining 414 points. As of 1:33 pm, GMT-4, Dow Jones was trading at 332 point below the previous closure.The S&P 500 displayed similar erratic behaviour and fell 1.3% during the first trading hour, whilst the Nasdaq composite decreased by 0.8%. These movements mirror worldwide market declines as concerns intensify regarding the impact of Trump's trade policies on global economic stability. As of 1:38 PM GMT-4 on April 7, the Nasdaq Composite is trading at 15,634.50, up 46.71 points (0.30%) from the previous close of 15,587.79. Also, the S&P 500 is at 5,072.75, down by 1.33 points (0.026%) from the previous close of 5,074.08 at 1:40 PM.The S&P 500, a crucial component of numerous investors' 401(k) retirement portfolios, has declined by over 20% from its peak established less than two months ago. Should the S&P 500 close below this threshold, the decline would qualify as what financial experts term a ""bear market"".This classification indicates a more severe downturn than the typical 10% correction that occurs annually, representing a more significant economic concern.Stock markets around the world are bleeding due to US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement, which has stoked fears of a global recession, including in the US. The downward trend drove Nasdaq into bear market territory during the previous week, with S&P 500 and Dow Jones approaching similar levels. A bear market occurs when values decrease by 20 percent from their recent highest point.Ahead of the US stock market opening, Trump asked people not to be weak. ""The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done decades ago. Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a Panican (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!"" he said on social media.European and Asian markets experienced sharp declines, whilst S&P 500 index futures declined 2.7% during premarket trading. The index had fallen 17.4% from its February peak by the close of the previous week. Market analysts typically classify a decline of 20% or more from a recent peak as a bear market, according to an AP report.Crude oil prices continued their downward trend, momentarily falling under $60 per barrel, reaching levels not seen since 2021. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures decreased by 2.4%, whilst Nasdaq futures registered a 3% decline.Trump reaffirmed his stance on reciprocal tariffs on Sunday regarding trade deficit reduction with partner nations, indicating he would not negotiate unless this issue was addressed.""Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump stated, whilst his administration remained unfazed by market volatility.Whilst aboard Air Force One, he informed journalists that international leaders were ""dying to make a deal.""Also Read | Stock market crash today: It's a bloodbath!
