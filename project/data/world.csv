'Really horrible war': Trump tells Russia to 'get deal where people stop getting killed'; again takes credit for India-Pakistan ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/really-horrible-war-trump-tells-russia-to-get-deal-where-people-stop-getting-killed-again-takes-credit-for-india-pakistan-ceasefire/articleshow/123085094.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and US counterpart Donald Trump (File Image)





US President Donald Trump on Sunday suggested a new way for Russia to avoid the sanctions, and that is to get a deal ""where people stop getting killed.""Trump on Friday warned Russia with new sanctions over the Ukraine war. He said, ""Russia -- I think it's disgusting what they're doing. I think it's disgusting,"" AFP quoted Trump saying. ""We're going to put sanctions. I don't know that sanctions bother him,"" he added.While talking with reporters, Trump said that in both the countries Russia and Ukraine a lot of people are being killed. He claimed that in Ukraine the number of deaths are lower than Russia.""Yeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed. They had a number that just came out that a tremendous number of Russian soldiers are being killed. And likewise Ukraine, a lower number, but still thousands and thousands of people. And now we're adding towns where they're being hit by missiles. So it's a lot of people being killed in that ridiculous war,"" Trump said.Trump again took the credit for stopping the war between India and Pakistan which Indian officials have already denied in all the public platforms.However, Trump seems to stick to his claims. He not only took the credit for India-Pakistan war, but also said that he stopped Cambodia Thailand, and Congo-Rwanada.""And, you know, we stopped. We stopped a lot of countries from war. India and Pakistan, we stopped a lot of countries. And we're going to get that one stopped, too, somehow. We're going to get that one stop. That's a really horrible war. You heard about Cambodia and Thailand. We got that one done. We got the Congo, which was going on for 31 years. Rwanda, that one's done. We stopped a lot of wars,"" Trump said.""This is the one we seem to be mission be the easiest to stop. And it's not. I mean, Rwanda and Congo were going on 31 years, and I got it stopped. Eight million people dead. At least that's what they have. But I think the number is much higher. And the leaders of each country, Rwanda and the Congo, they were great. They were great and they wanted it stopped. 31 years it went on. We stopped a lot of wars. Serbia, Kosovo was going to be happening, and I don't believe it will now. So we stopped. That would do,"" he added.Since May 10, Trump has claimed multiple times that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire after US-mediated talks. However, officials have firmly denied any US involvement in the recent ceasefire.Even in the Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar refuted Trump's claims and said that there was no foreign mediation.","Us president donald trump on sunday suggested a new way for russia to avoid the sanctions, and that is to get a deal ""where people stop getting killed"" trump again took the credit for stopping the war between india and pakistan which indian officials have already denied in all the public platforms.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123085075,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35076,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Trump's tariff move



A senior Trump administration official criticised India on Sunday for buying Russian oil, accusing it of fueling the Russia-Ukraine war, following increased pressure from the US President on New Delhi.""What he (Trump) said very clearly is that it is not acceptable for India to continue financing this war by purchasing the oil from Russia,"" remarked Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and key Trump advisor, Reuters reported.This stern rebuke from Miller represents the Trump administration's most forceful criticism to date regarding one of America's primary Indo-Pacific allies.""People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil. That's an astonishing fact,"" Miller stated during his appearance on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures.""Despite US tariff slap and the penalty threat, India seems to be unworried about anything as it continued to maintain their Russian oil purchases.On Friday, a 25% duty was imposed on Indian goods following the country's acquisition of Russian military equipment and energy resources. Trump has additionally warned of possible 100% tariffs on US imports from nations buying Russian oil, unless Moscow negotiates a significant peace agreement with Ukraine.Miller balanced his criticism by acknowledging Trump's ""tremendous"" relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.On July 30, US President Donald Trump imposed a 25 per cent tariff on Indian products whilst issuing warnings about possible sanctions regarding India's acquisition of Russian weaponry and petroleum.Following the tariff declaration, Trump severely criticised New Delhi's relationship with Moscow, describing both nations as ""dead economies"" and explicitly stating his indifference towards Indo-Russian relations.Trump indicated his willingness to enforce substantial tariffs -- potentially up to 100% -- on imports from nations that maintain their oil purchases from Russia, unless Russia negotiates a peace agreement with Ukraine.","Stephen miller, white house deputy chief of staff and key trump advisor, criticised india for buying russian oil.

Philippines eyes buying more defence equipment from India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/philippines-eyes-buying-more-defence-equipment-from-india/articleshow/123082592.cms,".

NEW DELHI: As the Indian govt prepares to host Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, Manila has expressed interest in purchasing more defence equipment from India.Defence, security and maritime cooperation are among the key pillars of the relationship and will top the agenda of Marcos' bilateral engagement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, along with trade ties.Ahead of the president's visit, the chief of Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Romeo Brawner, said the Philippines is looking to purchase more weapon systems from India, citing the quality and affordability of Indian defence equipment.Talking about the ongoing delivery of BrahMos cruise missiles to Manila, Brawner also said two sets of the India-Russia jointly developed missile systems will arrive in the Philippines in the next few years. The Philippines' maritime dispute in the South China Sea (SCS), or what Manila calls the West Philippine Sea, has seen it scaling up defence cooperation with countries like India and Japan to blunt Chinese aggression and ensure peace and stability in the contested waters.India will also join the Philippines this week for a joint patrol in the South China Sea. In the middle of its own border tensions with China, India in 2023 joined Manila in explicitly asking China to abide by a 2016 arbitral tribunal award that refuted Beijing's expansive claims over SCS waters.Modi and Marcos are also expected to discuss India's offer for concessional Line of Credit to meet Philippines' defence requirements, acquisition of naval assets, and expansion of training and joint exercises on maritime security.According to Manila, six agreements in a range of areas like science and technology, law and culture are expected to be signed.The Modi-Marcos meeting, however, takes place in the middle of efforts by both India and China to rebuild their relationship and it will be interesting to see how much play the South China Sea issue can get in the meeting. During Marcos' recent visit to the US, President Donald Trump reportedly told him he wouldn't mind if Manila got along with China.The two countries will also discuss efforts to enhance trade ties, as they both look to conclude a bilateral trade deal with the US to avoid getting caught in the cross hairs of Trump's trade war.While the US president has announced 25% tariffs on imports from India, he has slapped Manila with a 19% levy.Bilateral trade crossed $3 billion for the first time in 2022-2023 and the two sides have agreed to commence negotiations for a bilateral Preferential Trade Agreement.According to the ministry of external affairs (MEA), development cooperation is another crucial aspect of bilateral relationship.""India is implementing six Quick Impact Projects (QIPs) in the areas of agriculture, disaster risk reduction & management, health-care and livelihood support, in the Philippines, under an MoU on Indian Grant Assistance for the implementation of QIPs, signed on Feb 7, 2023,"" said an official.","Defence, security and maritime cooperation are among the key pillars of the relationship.

Operation Akhal: Indian Forces Gun Down Terrorist In Kulgam Amid Rising Infiltration Attempts

NEW DELHI: The 'Janaza-Ghaib (funeral in absentia)' of Tahir Habib, one of the Pahalgam terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev in J&K, has been performed in his village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir - a second confirmation that Pakistan was involved in the April 22 incident in which 26 civilians were killed.Videos and pictures posted on Telegram channels show the elderly of Khai Gala in Rawalkote gathering for the final prayers for the former Pakistan Army soldier and Lashkar-e-Taiba operative. But the funeral took an unexpected turn when local LeT commander Rizwan Hanif tried to be part of it. Tahir's family explicitly barred LeT members from attending the funeral but Hanif insisted, leading to a confrontation.Tahir's association with LeT and his role in the Pahalgam attack had made him a wanted category 'A' terrorist. His killing during Operation Mahadev in Srinagar last week along with two others was a major breakthrough for Indian security forces.During the funeral, a source said, ""Lashkar operatives threatened mourners with a gun, sparking outrage among villagers. The residents of Khai Gala, who have long been wary of radicalisation, are now planning a public boycott to oppose terror recruitment.""This development is significant as it not only highlights the growing resistance among POK residents against Pakistan's state-sponsored terror machine but also confirms that the impact of Operation Sindoor - conducted as a response to the Pahalgam attack - is being felt across the border.""A Lashkar commander facing public backlash and being forced to flee is a testament to the changing dynamics in the region,"" the source added.Tahir's past includes his association with the Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT) and the Student Liberation Front (SLF) before joining the Pakistan army. The Sadozai Pathan community, to which Tahir belonged, has a rich history of resistance, having migrated from Afghanistan in the 18th century and playing a key role in the Poonch Rebellion. This also led to Tahir getting the alias of 'Afghani' with which he was known in intelligence records.","Tahir habib, one of the pahalgam terrorists killed in operation mahadev in j&k, has been performed in his village in pakistan-occupied kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday refused to comment on Rahul Gandhi ’s endorsement of US President Donald Trump ’s remark calling the Indian economy ""dead."" Tharoor said the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha may have had his ""own reasons"" for saying so, but stressed that maintaining economic ties with the US is vital for India.When asked about Rahul Gandhi's statement, Tharoor said, ""I don't want to comment on what my party leader has said. He has his reasons for saying so. My concern is that our relationship with the US, as a strategic partnership and economic relationship, is important for us. We are exporting around 90 billion worth of goods to America. We can't be in a position to lose that or have it diminish significantly.""He added, ""We must wish our negotiators strength to get a fair deal for India. We should also be talking to other regions for exporting our goods. Then we could make up for some of what we might lose in the US. We have to support our negotiators.""Tharoor’s response came after Rahul Gandhi, on Thursday, agreed with Trump’s description of the Indian economy. Gandhi had said, ""Yes, he is right. Everybody knows this except the prime minister and the finance minister. Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact. The entire world knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. BJP has finished the economy to help Adani.

"Delay hits Scorpene retrofit to boost stealth, endurance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delay-hits-scorpene-retrofit-to-boost-stealth-endurance/articleshow/123082184.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has once again missed the boat to enhance the underwater operational endurance and stealth of its latest Scorpene or Kalvari-class conventional submarines, with the already delayed air independent propulsion (AIP) system developed by DRDO still not ready for integration with the vessels.The first Scorpene submarine to be built at the Mazagon Docks (MDL) with French collaboration, INS Kalvari, which was commissioned in Dec 2017, will now complete her ongoing maintenance refit at the Mumbai naval dockyard without being retrofitted with the AIP plug as was originally planned, defence ministry sources told TOI.""The fuel cell-based AIP system developed by DRDO's Naval Materials Research Lab, which has L&T as the prime industry partner, is still not yet operationally available. Hopefully, it should be ready by the time the second Scorpene (INS Khanderi) comes for her scheduled normal maintenance refit in mid-2026,"" a source said.The Navy after a long delay has inducted six diesel-electric Scorpene submarines, constructed by MDL in collaboration with the French Naval Group under Project-75 for over Rs 23,000 crore, with the sixth INS Vagsheer being commissioned in Jan this year.There is major concern about the continuing delay in the indigenous AIP project, which was originally slated for completion by June 2017 after being sanctioned in 2014 at an initial cost of Rs 270 crore.Amid the delay, MDL and Naval Group signed an agreement for the integration of the indigenous AIP energy system plugs on the Scorpenes only on July 23. Under it, each submarine will undergo a complex project called ""jumboisation"", involving precision cutting of the hull, safe insertion of the AIP plug and then rejoining the structure to ensure the vessel is fully operational again.Unlike nuclear-powered submarines, which have unlimited underwater endurance, diesel-electric boats must surface or snorkel every couple of days to get oxygen to recharge their batteries. Those fitted with AIP, however, can stay submerged for around two weeks to significantly boost their stealth and combat capabilities.With Pakistan on course to induct eight Yuan or Hangor-class conventional submarines with AIP from China in a major capability jump, India's depleting conventional underwater combat arm has become a major worry. China, of course, now has the world's largest navy, which includes over 50 diesel-electric and 10 nuclear submarines.Apart from the six French-origin Scorpenes, India has seven very old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW diesel-electric submarines at present. It also has two operational SSBNs (nuclear-powered submarines armed with nuclear ballistic missiles) in INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, with the third to be commissioned as INS Aridhaman this year, as reported by TOI earlier.The long-pending projects to build three additional Scorpenes for Rs 38,000 crore and six new-generation diesel-electric submarines, with both AIP and land-attack cruise missiles, for Rs 70,000 crore under Project-75-India at MDL, are also yet to be finalised and inked.","India has inducted six diesel-electric scorpene submarines, constructed by mdl in collaboration with the french naval group under project-75 for over rs 23,000 crore.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump once again on Sunday repeated his claims of brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, along with ending several other global conflicts.In post on Truth Social, Trump responded to radio host and author Charlamagne Tha God saying the host knew “nothing” about his achievements, including “just ending 5 Wars, including a 31 year bloodbath between Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, where Seven Million people have died, and there was no end in sight.”Trump added, “He didn’t know that, or India and Pakistan or, wiping out Iran’s nuclear capabilities, or closing the horrendous open Border, or creating the greatest economy.”Speaking to Newsmax a day earlier, Trump claimed to have “settled a lot of wars,” including India and Pakistan.“One of the wars—India, Pakistan, nuclear,” he said. He also cited conflicts in Thailand and Cambodia, and Congo and Rwanda, saying many were resolved through trade pressure, reported PTI.“I said ‘listen, you guys are going to fight. You can fight all you want. I mean, just fight your hearts out. But we’re not doing a trade deal’.All of a sudden they end up not doing a war.”Trump added, “I settled a lot of wars. I think I settled averaging about a war a month. But, you know, we’re saving millions of lives.”Last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt supported Trump’s claim, saying he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. “Trump has now ended conflicts between Thailand and Cambodia, Israel and Iran, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia,” she said at a briefing.She claimed Trump has “brokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month” in his six months in office.Since May 10, Trump has claimed multiple times that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire after US-mediated talks.However, officials have firmly denied any US involvement in the recent ceasefire. Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Parliament that no foreign leader urged India to stop Operation Sindoor, launched in response to the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said there was “no third-party intervention” and dismissed any link between the ceasefire and trade.“Prime Minister Modi and Trump did not have any phone calls between April 22, when the Pahalgam terror attack took place, and June 16,” Jaishankar said in the Rajya Sabha as quoted by PTI.","Us president donald trump claims to have'settled a lot of wars', including india and pakistan.

What I didn't know, though, was that I had this autoimmune issue that greatly impacted everything.”Gabrielle Union added, “When we talk about that edge to your voice—that I wanted to eliminate by having more patience and more wisdom…menopause kind of just says, “Ha!” And my patience can shrink on a dime. And it makes it hard.”The popular actress continued, “I just didn't want to be the person anyone avoided.”When Gabrielle Union embraced motherhood in her life, she was already in her mid 40s.At that time, Gabrielle Union went through a few miscarriages that had already made her pretty sensitive and uncomfortable with the whole experience.Gabrielle Union has also opened up about how unfortunately she had to go through a miscarriage while she was filming for her hit TV series, Being Mary Jane.Fortunately, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union ended up opting for surrogacy and were successful in welcoming their daughter, Kaavia Wade, into their lives in 2018.Since then, the couple have left no stone unturned to show how deeply they love and adore their young one and are very public about it on their social media.Gabrielle Union has also been very welcoming to Dwyane Wade's other children that he had with his ex wife and a former friend.

From viral sideline sweetheart to polarizing figure on Bears turf

Fan resentment grows as feud with Riley Gaines resurfaces

From America's sweetheart to NFL target

Once celebrated as the NFL ’s “it couple,” Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens are now facing unexpected backlash. From viral sideline moments to social media criticism, fans have turned on Biles amid controversy. Her public feud with Riley Gaines may be fueling the fallout as her NFL support takes a surprising hit.Not long ago, Simone Biles was hailed as the gold standard of NFL WAGs (wives and girlfriends), captivating fans with her heartfelt sideline moments alongside husband Jonathan Owens, now a Chicago Bears safety. In December 2024, she was praised for her warm embrace and playful handshake with Owens before a Bears game, a viral moment that had fans dubbing them the “real MVP couple,” even above the media-favorite Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.But fast forward to the Bears' Family Fest on August 3, 2025, and the narrative around Biles has taken a sharp turn. Although the couple shared another affectionate pregame interaction, the public reaction was jarringly different. Fans who once celebrated Biles turned hostile, criticizing everything from her fashion choices to her very presence. One commenter asked, “She hasn’t been fully canceled yet?” while another bluntly called her “overrated as a human being.The sudden shift in public sentiment may trace back to Biles’ public clash with Riley Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer and outspoken conservative voice on women's sports. The feud, which played out on social media and cable networks, polarized audiences and cast Biles in a political spotlight she hadn’t occupied before. Now, some NFL fans appear to be taking sides—against her.While there’s no concrete evidence that her dispute with Gaines triggered the backlash at Family Fest, it seems to have intensified the public’s scrutiny. Critics even mocked her for not wearing Bears gear, suggesting she was stealing the spotlight. “She’s not even a real fan,” one user joked, pointing out her neutral outfit.Simone Biles may be used to pressure from years of elite competition, but this type of fan revolt marks new territory. The internet has turned on the Olympic icon with alarming speed—transforming her from NFL darling to divisive figure. As one social media user harshly put it, “She used to represent strength. Now she just wants attention.”Also Read: “Ivanka is prettier than Gisele”: Donald Trump mocked Tom Brady and made eyebrow-raising comments about Gisele Bündchen For Biles, the next few months could be a defining chapter—not in gymnastics, but in navigating a more unforgiving side of NFL fandom.","Simone biles, once adored as an nfl sweetheart, now faces unexpected fan backlash.
