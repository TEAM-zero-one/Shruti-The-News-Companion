'Eliminating all retaliatory tariffs on US goods': Canada's big announcement; move comes day after Carney-Trump talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eliminating-all-retaliatory-tariffs-on-us-goods-canadas-big-announcement-move-comes-day-after-carney-trump-talks/articleshow/123458530.cms,"Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday announced that Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs on US goods, aligning with Washington's recent decision to exempt products covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).Speaking a day after a call with US President Donald Trump , PM Carney told reporters that starting September 1, Canada would be ""eliminating all Canadian tariffs on American goods"" covered under the pact.He added this move comes as both countries ""intensify"" discussions on a broader trade deal.""Canada currently has the best trade deal with the United States. And while it’s different from what we had before, it's still better than that of any other country,"" Carney said.""Canada and the United States have reestablished free trade for the vast majority of our goods. Canada will retain our tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos as we work intensively to resolve the issues there,"" he added.With the USMCA scheduled for review in 2026, Carney described the pact as a ""unique advantage"" for Canada, noting that the US is increasingly charging other countries for market access.The Canadian PM noted that America's commitment to the agreement ensures Canadian exporters still benefit from one of the lowest average US tariff rates, with more than 85% of bilateral trade remaining tariff-free.Canadian and Mexican firms also continue to receive preferential access under the USMCA, AP reported.The retaliatory tariffs were introduced under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after Washington imposed duties on Canadian goods. However, the Trump administration later exempted USMCA-covered products, prompting Ottawa’s latest move.While most Canadian and Mexican imports remain protected by the trade pact, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has signaled fresh uncertainty, saying, ""I think the president is absolutely going to renegotiate the USMCA.""Earlier, Trump also signed an executive order raising tariffs on Canadian imports to the United States from 25% to 35%.The tariff applies to all items not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. A 40% transshipment levy would apply to goods rerouted through another country to avoid these tariffs.At the same time, Canada still faces sector-specific US levies outside the deal that continue to weigh on the industry.Since March, Trump implemented various Canadian tariffs: 25% on all goods excluding potash and energy products, 10% on energy resources including potash, 50% on steel and aluminium imports, and 25% on automotive products.Trade experts note that preserving the free trade pact will be crucial for both Canada and Mexico, with more than 75% of Canadian exports and 80% of Mexican exports heading to the US.","Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs on us goods, aligning with washington's recent decision to exempt products covered under the usmca.

Not every family milestone plays out on social media: privacy and new priorities

What this says about blended families, step-parent roles and growing up in the spotlight

Tom Brady’s recent tribute to his eldest son, Jack, drew warm reactions online — and also shone a light on the different ways blended families handle big moments. Brady filled his feed with praise and photos as Jack turned 18, writing that his heart was ""overflowing with happiness and pride. "" But Gisele Bündchen, Brady’s ex-wife and a longtime stepmother figure, didn’t post a public birthday message, instead sharing family shots focused on her younger children and new partner. That contrast set off chatter — and it’s worth unpacking beyond the headline.Public figures often navigate competing pressures: celebrate openly to fans or protect private family life. Gisele’s choice to highlight her younger children and recent personal moments suggests a conscious boundary.She posted photos of Benny and Vivi and moments with Joaquim Valente, which coincided with Jack’s birthday timeline. For many parents — celebrities included — shifting priorities after a divorce can mean reframing whose milestones are celebrated publicly.Jack, born in 2007, has grown up partly in public and partly out of it. Brady’s visible celebration underscores his role as an involved father; Bündchen’s quieter presence may reflect respect for Jack’s independence as he becomes an adult, or simply her focus on her immediate household.Either way, the episode highlights a broader point: social media silence isn’t always a slight — sometimes it’s a deliberate choice to protect relationships and boundaries. Fans and commentators should be cautious before reading too much into a single Instagram gap.Also Read: “Give up my dream because…”: Gisele Bündchen slams the media and reveals the truth behind split with Tom Brady At the end of the day, Jack’s 18th birthday is a personal milestone.

Harjinder Singh's accident, major visa fallout







A signature-collection petition in support of Harjinder Singh , the truck driver who killed three people in a crash in Florida, is at the center of a fresh row as social media users ask how they were allowed to start a petition in support of the Indian-origin man who was residing in the US illegally.The petition was started by Manisha Kaushal under the name of 'Collective Punjabi youth' which argued that Harjinder Singh did not have any criminal intent or history. The incident in which three people died because Singh took a wrong U-turn was a catastrophe and not a criminal act, the petition said.""The driver has no prior record and fully cooperated with authorities...The imposed 45-year sentence is excessively severe given the nature of the accident,"" the petition said.The petition urged for reduction the current sentence, grant parole eligibility after Harjinder serves a reduced term, and considering alternative sentencing options.The Florida accident had a major repercussion as the State Department paused issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers. ""The increasing number of foreign drivers operating large tractor-trailer trucks on US roads is endangering American lives and undercutting the livelihoods of American truckers,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.After the road crash, it was found out that Singh entered US illegally and got his driver's license in Democrat-controlled California. Donald Trump administration blamed the California government for issuing license to illegal aliens while California Governor Gavin Newsom's office claimed Singh entered the country illegally in 2018 during the Trump administration. The to-and-fro continued as the Trump administration said his work permit was granted by the Biden administration, even after it was canceled by the Trump administration.Singh fled to California after the incident. He was brought back to Florida, where he now faces charges and then deportation.","A petition has been started to reduce truck driver harjinder singh's sentencing.

Actress Gabrielle Union , wife of NBA legend Dwyane Wade, has shared something special for her fans. On Saturday, August 24, she took to Instagram with a heartfelt video. The clip carried memories from her hit 2000 film Bring It On. Union did not just post old moments, she also shared powerful words about how the film changed her life.Gabrielle Union, who played Isis, the cheerleader leading the East Compton Clovers, looked back at the movie that first made her famous. She shared a short video filled with fan edits and iconic cheerleading moments. In her caption, Union wrote,“25 years later and the spirit lives on! Back then, I never imagined the blessings that came with stepping into that Clover uniform. It truly is the gift that keeps giving.”Union also spoke in the video, saying, “I cannot believe… 25 years. That's a quarter of a century since Bring It On came out,"" she said, remembering shooting in San Diego in 1999. The cast believed they were simply producing a lighthearted film about cheerleaders. Rather, the movie grew to be a teenage classic that also brought up issues of race, animosity, and identity.She added, “Fans have shown up since day one and continue to inspire new generations of Bring It On-ers. All the Clovers and the Toros, you have been bringing it with your spirit fingers!”Union also honored her late co-star Natina Reed, who played Jenelope, saying, “Much love always, and to our forever Clover, Natina Reed.”The 25th anniversary brought reflection too. Union admitted that when she first played Isis, she held back her anger on screen. “I muzzled her,” she confessed. “I made her appropriate when I should have allowed her to be angry. That was my failure.”Her honesty struck fans, showing that even with a beloved role, she still questions her choices years later.What makes this anniversary sweeter is how Bring It On quietly tied into Gabrielle Union’s personal life. During an old episode of TODAY with Jenna & Friends, Union and Dwyane Wade revealed how they first met. It was at the NBA All-Star Weekend in 2002. Union thought Wade was one of her friends and gave him a big hug from behind. But it turned out to be the rookie guard from the Miami Heat. Wade later laughed, saying he immediately recognized her as “Gabrielle Union from Bring It On. ”The pair met again years later at a Super Bowl party they co-hosted. That second meeting sparked the romance that eventually turned into marriage in 2014.Even today, Bring It On is part of their marriage jokes. Back in 2020, NBA star Rex Chapman posted a clip of Union as Isis leading her squad. Wade jumped into the comments, teasing, “That’s her ‘I mean business’ walk… every time I leave the toothpaste cap off.” Union replied with laughter, keeping their inside joke alive.Over the years, Wade has often poked fun at Union’s fierce on-screen walk, while she uses it to playfully remind him of little habits at home.For Union, the film still holds deep meaning. In a past interview with Vogue, she said, “I didn’t want the Clovers to be saved by anyone else. That’s me in real life, and that’s me in Bring It On.”","Gabrielle union, who played isis, the cheerleader leading the east compton clovers, shared a short video filled with fan edits and iconic cheerleading moments.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline

US president Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariff hikes on imports could shrink the US deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, the Congressional budget office (CBO) said on Friday.According to CBO, Congress’ nonpartisan analyst, higher tariff revenue would reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion and trim federal interest payments by $0.7 trillion. The new estimate marks a sharp increase from June, when CBO forecast a $2.5 trillion reduction in primary deficits and a $500 billion drop in interest costs.The revenue boost could help offset the effects of the Republicans’ tax-cut and spending package passed earlier this year, which CBO said will widen the deficit by $3.4 trillion over 10 years.The US federal debt stands at $37.18 trillion, treasury department data shows, and continues to climb under both Republican and Democratic administrations as spending outpaces revenue. Lawmakers must pass new spending bills by the end of September to avoid a government shutdown according to Reuters.CBO cautioned that the current top tariff rates may not last, with trade negotiations and international legal challenges still in play.Tariffs across countries and products averaged 16.7% in August, up from 15.1% in June, according to Oxford Economics. US customs and border protection has already assessed more than $26 billion in duties this fiscal year, far above the hundreds of millions collected in the previous year, the analysis found.","Us president donald trump ’s sweeping tariff hikes on imports could shrink the us deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, the congressional budget office (cbo) said on friday.

Poll What should be the priority for international agencies in combating terror financing? Stricter monitoring of fund flows Stronger global cooperation

NEW DELHI: After suffering severe setbacks during Operation Sindoor , Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror outfit has launched a massive fundraising drive in that country under the garb of building over 300 mosques to replicate Lashkar-e-Taiba’s decentralization policy, security officials said.The JeM has come out with a new mechanism with the support of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to collect funds.It is using digital wallets like ‘EasyPaisa’ and ‘Sadapay’ controlled by its founder and most wanted terrorist Masood Azhar ’s family members to bypass scrutiny by global agencies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the officials said citing inputs from across the border.The Rs 3.91 billion fundraising drive would secure JeM’s operational and weapons financing for at least a decade, they said.Indian armed forces carried out missile strikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in the early hours of May 7 in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack Pakistan retaliated and the intense border skirmishes continued till May 10 before the two countries reached an understanding to end the hostilities.The officials said the JeM’s headquarters ‘Markaz Subhanallah’, along with four other training camps -- Markaz Bilal, Markaz Abbas, Mahmona Joya, and the Sargal training camp – were destroyed during the Operation Sindoor.While Pakistan’s government has announced funding to rebuild these destroyed facilities, the JeM has launched an online fundraising campaign through digital wallets to collect Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new markaz buildings under the garb of constructing mosques across Pakistan, the officials said.On social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, JeM-linked proxy accounts and those used by JeM commanders have posted posters, videos, and a letter from Masood Azhar, urging supporters to donate wholeheartedly as each mosque requires Rs 12.5 million (Rs 1.25 crore) for construction and smooth running, they said.According to the officials, several of the digital wallet accounts were found linked to the mobile number of Azhar’s brother Talha Al Saif (Talha Gulzar) and JeM Haripur district commander Aftab Ahmad based in Khala Batt Township.They said another fundraising channel was linked to a mobile number run by Azhar’s son Abdullah Azhar (Abdullah Khan) while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, JeM commander Syed Safdar Shah is collecting donations for the organization’s markaz via a number registered near Melwarah post office, Oghi, Mansehra district. In addition to these three accounts, over 250 EasyPaisa wallets are reportedly being used to raise funds for the JeM’s fundraising campaign.Alongside social media appeals, the terror outfit circulated an audio recording of Azhar’s brother, Al Saif, via its official propaganda channel, MSTD Official, urging supporters to contribute Rs 21,000 per person, the officials said. The speech was delivered at a gathering at Markaz Usman-o-Ali during a Friday congregation on August 15.In the audio clip, Al Saif also instructed the establishment of 20 new markaz this year, as part of JeM’s overall target of 313 centres, the officials said citing JeM’s organizational posters and videos. To build these mosques, the officials said the JeM may have two key motives -- first, to replicate LeT’s vast markaz network, decentralising its training camps so that future Indian strikes would have minimal impact on its terror infrastructure in Pakistan.Second, to establish secure, lavish safe houses for Azhar and his family to allow Pakistan to maintain plausible deniability about their whereabouts, the officials said. Under this plan, three-four large markaz centres would function as safe houses, medium-sized facilities would serve as training camps, and the remainder would handle logistics, allowing JeM to operate nationwide while Pakistan’s government continues to deny Azhar’s presence, they said.While JeM claims each markaz will cost Rs 12.5 million, estimates suggest a Markaz Bilal-sized facility costs only Rs 4-5 million.Larger markaz like Subhanallah or Usman-o-Ali may cost around Rs 100 million, but it is unlikely all 313 will be this large. If built, with three large markaz and 310 smaller ones, the total construction cost would be about Rs 1.23 billion (Rs 123 crore) leaving a large surplus for weapons purchases, the officials said.Given JeM-Hamas-TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban) connections and leadership meetings, the officials said the surplus could be used to acquire advanced weaponry and maybe attack drones or quadcopters used by TTP.It is widely known that Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI helps JeM procure arms cheaply from the black market, the officials said. “Today, JeM’s arsenal already includes machine guns, rocket launchers, and mortars.Thus this Rs 3.91 billion campaign could heavily bolster its arms stockpile,” an official said. In 2019, Pakistan was placed in grey list by the international watchdog working on blocking terror financing and accordingly, the Pakistani Government implemented the National Action Plan and presented to FATF that it had curbed JeM by taking its markaz under government control and placing JeM chief and his brother’s bank accounts under official watch, the officials said.It also banned cash transactions, animal hide donations, and other forms of fundraising which resulted in Pakistan getting formally removed from FATF’s grey list in 2022. Now, instead of donations going into bank accounts, the money is being transferred to the digital wallets used by Azhar’s family members and this way, Pakistan could falsely claim to FATF by showing only bank account details that JeM’s funding had been cut off, the officials said.",The jem has come out with a new mechanism with the support of pakistan's inter-services intelligence (isi) to collect funds. It is using digital wallets like ‘easypaisa’ and ‘sadapay’ controlled by its founder and most wanted terrorist masood azhar ’s family members.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123444403,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1736748,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
