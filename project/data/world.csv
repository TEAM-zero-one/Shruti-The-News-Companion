Shaksgam Valley Row Deepens As China Rejects India’s Claim And Defends CPEC Infra Project With Pak

NEW DELHI: BJP has raised several sticking points - ranging from border tensions to trade issues - in India-China ties in its interaction with a visiting Communist Party of China (CPC) delegation, emphasising that these were not helpful to their relations, as the two parties touched base after a gap of over six years amid signs of a possible thaw in the bilateral equation.The meeting on Monday with the Chinese delegation led by Sun Haiyan, vice minister of CPC's international liaison department, a senior rank in Beijing's foreign ministry hierarchy, was sought by the Chinese embassy here, and it sparked a war of words between BJP and Congress.Congress accused the governing BJP of ""hypocrisy, pretence and deceit"" as it recalled the relentless attack it has faced for allegedly signing an MoU with China's governing party. It demanded to know details of the meetings.BJP described the interaction as a ""formal meeting"" following ""improved"" relations between the two countries and hit back at Congress, saying it had nothing to hide as it was not entering into any secretive MoU with CPC. It also pointed to the meeting that leader of opposition - then Congress president - Rahul Gandhi had with the then Chinese ambassador during a tense standoff at Doklam in 2017.BJP sources said party's representatives - general secretary Arun Singh and foreign department head Vijay Chauthaiwale - brought up the border issues, export curbs like on tunnel boring machines as well as rare and critical minerals. These are not helpful for the professed desire to improve ties.CPC was keen on resumption of party-to-party ties with BJP, which had stalled since Singh led a party delegation to China in 2019, sources said, emphasising that the meetings, including with RSS on Tuesday, were requested by the visitors.On X, Chauthaiwale said they discussed at length ""the means to advance inter party communications"" between BJP and CPC. Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong also joined the delegation.RSS sources have said it was a courtesy meeting at the request of the visitors and was done with ministry of external affair's approval.Slamming BJP, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said people had a right to know what transpired in its closed-door meeting with the CPC delegation, alleging govt had pursued a policy of meek surrender in handling China.There was no problem in a political party engaging in dialogue with a party of another country, he said, accusing BJP of double standards. The CPC delegation also met Congress's foreign department head Salman Khurshid. Khera said govt had approved the meeting.BJP spokesperson Tuhin Sinha retorted that his party had nothing to hide. Congress was unable to explain its MoU so many years after it was signed, he said.The meeting, initiated at the request of CPC, has followed a thaw in the ties between two countries, with resumption of flights and ongoing efforts to boost trade, he noted. India-China relations had improved compared to a year ago, he said.",Bjp raised several sticking points - ranging from border tensions to trade issues - in india-china ties in its interaction with a visiting communist party of china delegation.

Donald Trump’s Iran Trade Tariff Warning Puts India In A Bind Over Exports, Chabahar And US Ties

How Will 25% Additional Tariffs Impact India?



India-Iran Trade Overview

In a fresh round of global tariffs, US President Donald Trump has announced that countries doing trade with Iran will attract a 25% tariff from the world’s largest economy. The move is seen as a pressure tactic on Iran over its response to nationwide protests that have reportedly claimed nearly 600 lives.Trump has repeatedly warned that his administration could consider military action if it determines that the Iranian government is using lethal force against demonstrators. Trump described this as a threshold Iran is ‘beginning to cross,’ prompting discussions within his national security team on what he called ‘very strong options’.The tariff decision was announced by Trump in a social media post on Monday, where he said that measures would take effect immediately. Several major economies, including China, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, and India maintain trade ties with Iran.“Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America. This Order is final and conclusive. Thank you for your attention to this matter!,” Trump posted on Truth Social.India already faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the US. While 25% of this figure are ‘reciprocal’ tariffs’, the remaining 25% are a penal duty for India’s crude oil imports from Russia.India and Iran share an important trading relationship, with India consistently ranking among Iran’s top five trading partners in recent years, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.India’s key exports to Iran span a range of products, including rice (especially basmati), tea, sugar, pharmaceutical goods, man-made staple fibres, electrical equipment, and imitation jewellery. In return, India mainly imports items such as dry fruits, inorganic and organic chemicals, and glassware from Iran.In 2023, rice was India’s largest export item to Iran at $734 million, followed by soybean meal valued at $96.8 million and bananas worth $52 million. On the import side, India’s purchases from Iran were dominated by acyclic alcohol derivatives that are halogenated, sulphonated or nitrated, amounting to $309 million.Also read: 'Seize and hold the cities'; 5 takeaways from Reza Pahlavi's declaration amid Iran protests

Iran is a crucial market for Indian basmati rice, typically purchasing more than one million tonnes each year, according to reports. Iran has traditionally been among the biggest overseas markets for Indian basmati rice. Reports suggest that Iran purchases close to 12 lakh tonnes each year, with the trade estimated at around Rs 12,000 crore.However, Iran is not among its top 5 trading partners in terms of both imports and exports. India’s top exporting destinations are currently the United States of America, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, China, United Kingdom - accounting for 41% of India’s exports according to the Ministry of Commerce dashboard.Beyond merchandise trade, the development of the Chabahar port remains a cornerstone of India-Iran economic cooperation. Situated in Iran’s Sistan-Balochistan province along the country’s resource-rich southern coastline, the port is being jointly developed to strengthen regional connectivity and expand trade links.From a trade and strategy perspective, India also has a major stake in Iran’s Chabahar port. Last year, the US extended its sanctions waiver for Iran’s Chabahar port by an additional six months to April this year. The waiver had earlier been withdrawn in September 2025 when the US State Department cancelled the exemption first issued in 2018, which had allowed India to develop the port as a gateway to Afghanistan and Central Asia while avoiding routes through Pakistan, as part of efforts to increase pressure on Tehran.If the exemption were to lapse, entities involved in operating the port or engaging in related activities could be exposed to US penalties under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act.Chabahar has gained strategic relevance for India’s outreach to Afghanistan, especially as engagement with the Taliban administration in Kabul has been gradually improving.","India already faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the us.

"Project-75I: How India’s $8 billion submarine upgrade reshapes the Pakistan, China equation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/project-75i-how-indias-8-billion-submarine-upgrade-reshapes-the-pakistan-china-equation/articleshow/126480351.cms,"What is Project-75I and why it matters



Why the German Type-214NG was selected



Make in India at the core



Pakistan, Karachi and the logic of sea denial



China’s expanding undersea footprint



Strategic timing of Merz’s visit



French-origin Scorpene follow-on plan put on hold as Project-75I gained priority



Long-term impact on India’s naval posture



NEW DELHI: More than five decades after Indian naval strikes crippled Karachi during the 1971 war, undersea power is once again at the heart of New Delhi’s strategic thinking. As German Chancellor Friedrich Merz began his visit to India on Monday amid a more volatile regional and global security environment, discussions around Project-75I have acquired fresh urgency.The Indian Navy’s plan to induct six next-generation conventional submarines equipped with air-independent propulsion reflects a convergence of hard lessons from history, renewed friction with Pakistan following recent crises, and China’s expanding undersea presence in the Indian Ocean. Together, these factors are pushing India towards one of its most consequential naval procurement decisions in years, one that blends deterrence, indigenisation and long-term strategic signalling.Project-75I is the Indian Navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel-electric submarines equipped with fuel-cell-based air-independent propulsion, advanced sensors, torpedoes and missile systems. The Ministry of Defence issued the Request for Proposal for the project in July 2021 under the Strategic Partnership Model, describing it as a key pillar of the government’s Make in India push, according to a PIB statement.The project envisages indigenous construction, long-term technology transfer and the creation of a domestic submarine-building ecosystem. The estimated cost was over Rs 40,000 crore at the RFP stage, with current assessments placing the final contract value closer to $8 billion, or about Rs 72,000 crore, based on configuration and lifecycle support.For the Indian Navy, the programme addresses a critical gap. Its conventional submarine fleet is ageing even as undersea activity by China and Pakistan increases in the Indian Ocean and along India’s maritime approaches.The Indian Navy has selected the German Type-214 Next Generation submarine, edging out Spain’s S-80 Plus offered by Navantia, defence sources said. The decision was driven primarily by the maturity of the German fuel-cell-based AIP system, acoustic stealth and lower lifecycle risk.AIP allows submarines to remain submerged for weeks without surfacing or snorkeling, reducing detection risk. In contested waters, endurance and silence are decisive. The Type-214’s AIP technology is widely regarded as operationally proven, while competing systems are still undergoing validation.In undersea warfare, reliability and survivability often outweigh novelty. That calculus appears to have guided the Navy’s choice.Under the proposed framework, all six submarines will be built in India at MDL, with TKMS providing design authority, engineering expertise and technical consultancy. Indigenous content is expected to start at around 45 percent and rise to nearly 60 percent by the final boat, aligning with Atmanirbhar Bharat goals.TKMS and MDL signed a memorandum of understanding in June last year to jointly pursue the project, laying the groundwork for the partnership. MDL’s prior experience building Scorpène-class submarines under the earlier Project-75 strengthened its case as the Indian strategic partner.The ministry of defence has repeatedly stressed that Project-75I is not only about acquiring platforms but about absorbing complex submarine design and construction technologies, as outlined in the 2021 PIB release.India’s emphasis on undersea capability is rooted in history. During the 1971 war, the Indian Navy’s attacks on Karachi port crippled Pakistan’s maritime logistics and fuel supply, accelerating Islamabad’s defeat. That episode stressed how control of the seas can shape outcomes on land.The relevance of that lesson resurfaced during Operation Sindoor in May 2025, when tensions with Pakistan escalated following a major terror provocation. Between May 8 and May 11, India placed its naval forces on heightened readiness, with Karachi again emerging as Pakistan’s most critical vulnerability.Karachi handles the bulk of Pakistan’s maritime trade and energy imports. India’s ability to credibly threaten that hub, even without firing a shot, highlighted the deterrent value of naval and undersea power. New submarines with extended underwater endurance would sharpen that leverage.Beyond Pakistan, China looms large in India’s maritime threat assessment. The People’s Liberation Army Navy operates a rapidly expanding submarine fleet, including nuclear-powered platforms that have increasingly deployed into the Indian Ocean.Chinese submarines have docked at regional ports and conducted patrols close to Indian waters, while Pakistan, with Chinese assistance, is also upgrading its submarine arm. For Indian planners, this twin challenge has made restoring conventional submarine strength an urgent priority.Project-75I is designed to plug that gap by giving India a survivable, persistent undersea capability suited to monitoring choke points, tracking adversary submarines and conducting sea-denial operations.Chancellor Merz’s visit from January 12–13 comes amid a broader effort by Germany to expand its strategic footprint in the Indo-Pacific. Berlin and New Delhi are also working toward an EU-India free trade agreement, as noted by AFP.For India, the potential submarine deal fits into a wider diversification of defence partnerships beyond legacy suppliers such as Russia. For Germany, it represents an opportunity to anchor a long-term industrial and security relationship with the world’s largest democracy.According to informed defence sources cited by idrw.org, the final contract is not expected to be signed during Merz’s visit but could be concluded within the next three months, with the high-level engagement expected to provide political momentum.In October 2025, India put on hold plans to build three additional French-origin Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, even as it moved decisively to push ahead with Project-75I, which envisages the construction of six new-generation German-origin diesel-electric submarines at the same shipyard, The Times of India reported.Top government sources told TOI that the proposal for the three additional Scorpenes, estimated to cost around Rs 36,000 crore, “was not being pursued” at the time, although a formal decision to scrap it had not been recorded. While cost negotiations for the Scorpene follow-on order had concluded in the previous fiscal, final clearance from the Prime Minister-led Cabinet Committee on Security remained on hold.Officials told TOI that the German submarines under Project-75I were considered “a generation ahead” in terms of technology and capability. Concerns also existed about MDL’s ability to simultaneously execute two complex submarine construction programmes. The six original Kalvari-class submarines had already been built at MDL under the earlier Project-75 contract signed in October 2005, with the first boat INS Kalvari commissioned in December 2017 and the sixth, INS Vagsheer, inducted in January 2025.All six Kalvari-class submarines were slated to be retrofitted with the DRDO-developed air-independent propulsion system to improve underwater endurance. AIP allows a diesel-electric submarine to remain submerged for nearly two weeks, compared to boats without the system that must surface or snorkel every few days to recharge batteries.In contrast, the submarines planned under Project-75I, to be built in partnership with Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, were designed to incorporate AIP from the outset, along with land-attack cruise missiles and other next-generation technologies, TOI reported.Sources told TOI that the decision to proceed with final techno-commercial negotiations for the six German submarines, with an option for three more at a later stage, followed extensive deliberations involving the defence ministry, the Navy and the National Security Council Secretariat. Formal contract negotiations began in September 2025.“These new-generation boats under P-75I will come with design ToT (transfer of technology) and a greater indigenisation level of around 60%. The project will serve as a bridge to the future P-76, under which conventional submarines will be constructed based on totally indigenous design,” a source told TOI.Despite the pause on the Scorpene extension, officials indicated that France’s broader strategic partnership with India remained strong. Negotiations progressed on additional Rafale fighters for the Indian Air Force’s proposed 114 multi-role fighter aircraft programme, as well as a collaboration to co-develop a powerful jet engine with French major Safran for India’s fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft was nearly finalised.At the time, the Navy’s conventional submarine strength stood at six Scorpenes, six ageing Russian Kilo-class boats and four German HDW submarines, alongside two nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. China, by comparison, operated more than 50 diesel-electric and around 10 nuclear submarines and was in the process of supplying eight Yuan-class AIP-equipped submarines to Pakistan, a development seen as a major capability boost for Islamabad, TOI reported.Once inducted, the six Type-214NG submarines will significantly enhance the Indian Navy’s capacity for covert surveillance, sea denial and precision strike missions. Their sensors, weapons and endurance will form a key layer of India’s maritime deterrence architecture.Equally important is the industrial legacy. By absorbing advanced submarine technologies, India positions itself for future indigenous designs and follow-on projects. MDL’s role would be strengthened, and a specialised domestic supply chain would be deepened.Project-75I marks one of the most consequential naval procurement decisions India has taken in years. It addresses hard lessons from 1971, recent operational realities with Pakistan, and the growing challenge posed by China’s undersea expansion.As Germany’s chancellor arrives in India, the submarine negotiations underscore how defence industrial cooperation has become central to New Delhi’s foreign policy. From Karachi’s burning docks in 1971 to the silent depths of the Indian Ocean today, India’s maritime strategy is being reshaped through capability, indigenisation and strategic foresight.","Project-75i is the indian navy’s flagship programme to build six modern diesel-electric submarines equipped with fuel-cell-based air-independent propulsion, advanced sensors, torpedoes and missile systems.

Congress questions BJP’s China dealings

BJP hits back, cites ‘improved’ ties

TMC alleges ‘double standards’

NEW DELHI: A visit by a delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to New Delhi has triggered a sharp political row with the Congress and the BJP trading accusations over transparency and India’s China policy.The row began after a CPC delegation led by its international department’s vice minister Sun Haiyan visited the BJP headquarters on Monday. Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong was also part of the delegation.A BJP team headed by party general secretary Arun Singh discussed “the means to advance inter-party communications between the BJP and the Communist Party of China”, BJP's foreign affairs department in-charge Vijay Chauthaiwale wrote on X.The delegation also called on RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Tuesday in what PTI sources described as a courtesy visit requested by the Chinese side.The CPC delegation also met Congress leader and former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid. The Congress said the meeting took place at the delegation’s request and with the approval of the government of India.Latching on the visit, the Congress mounted an attack on the BJP accusing it of double standards and demanding full disclosure of its engagements with the CPC.He questioned whether the BJP or the RSS raised issues such as border transgressions, trade imbalance, rare earth supplies and Chinese support to Pakistan. “We have no problems that you meet… The issue is that do you raise critical questions when you meet behind closed doors?” Khera asked.""The BJP has taught even a chameleon how to change its colours. Those who were supposed to show 'red eyes' to China have instead rolled out a 'red carpet' for it. The BJP has held meetings with China's party, the CPC. Even when they were not in power, they used to visit China and hold meetings; RSS members even went there for training,"" he added.Demanding transparency, he said, “This must include public disclosure of the agenda, outcomes and minutes of all closed-door meetings held between representatives of the CPC and BJP/RSS functionaries.”The BJP rejected Congress’s allegations saying its meeting with the CPC was formal and open. BJP spokesperson Tuhin Sinha said, “It was a process of a formal meeting. A formal meeting takes place when a situation improves. We do it very openly.”“We do not secretly sign any such MoU which we can not explain for years,” he added.Sinha said the meeting took place because “things have improved”, pointing to the resumption of flights and ongoing trade talks. He also attacked Rahul Gandhi, saying he had lost the right to question the government’s foreign policy.BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said the Congress had “no locus” to raise border issues, claiming the roots of the China problem lay in the Nehru era. “Nevertheless, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government has been working to resolve it. And that effort is continuing unabated,” he said.The Trinamool Congress also criticised the BJP over the CPC visit. TMC Rajya Sabha deputy leader Sagarika Ghose accused the ruling party of hypocrisy, saying China had lent “open military support” to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor and had reiterated its claim over the Shaksgam Valley.“Just imagine if an opposition leader or party had done this.

JAMMU: Gunshots rang out in the air Tuesday after security forces launched a joint search operation in Najote, a remote village in J&K’s Kathua district, based on information about the presence of terrorists there. The area lies near Kamadh Nallah in Kahog forest belt, where an encounter had erupted on Jan 7. The same evening, officials said two “drone-like objects” were spotted hovering over a village in Rajouri district.“Intermittent firing was reported from Najote forest area in Billawar, about 10km from Kamadh Nallah,” an official said, adding that suspected terrorists fired a few rounds upon spotting the search party, attracting retaliatory fire. The cordon was subsequently fortified while troops continued hunting the ultras.“DIG (Jammu-Samba-Kathua Range) Shiv Kumar Sharma and Kathua SSP Mohita Sharma were present at the spot and monitored the ongoing operation till late Tuesday. However, no further contact was established,” an official said.Meanwhile, officials said at least two suspected drones were spotted near the LoC in Rajouri district in the evening.“Around 7.35pm, the objects were seen hovering over Dheri Dhara village under Manjakote PS in Rajouri district, before moving towards Kalali village,” said an official.In another such sighting, Army personnel manning Dungagala infiltration gap under Chingus police post in Rajouri spotted more drones — believed to be from Pakistan — around 7pm, and opened fire at the flying objects, following which they disappeared.","Security forces launched a joint search operation in najote, a remote village in j&k’s kathua district.

NEW DELHI: Another drones were sighted along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir , prompting the Indian Army to activate counter-Unmanned Aircraft System measures, ANI sources said on Tuesday.The drones were sighted second time in last 48 hours alonf the international border and LoC.The development comes amid a sharp warning from Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi to Pakistan over active terror camps across the border.ANI sources said the drones were detected in forward areas and were engaged using counter-UAS protocols to prevent any potential threat. Further details are awaited.The sightings come a day after security forces detected suspected Pakistan-origin drones along both the International Border and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir’s Samba, Rajouri and Poonch districts. Officials said the flying objects were seen entering from the Pakistan side, hovering briefly over Indian territory and then returning.Following the sightings, ground search operations were launched across the affected areas. In the Nowshera sector of Rajouri district, Army troops opened fire with medium and light machine guns after observing drone movement over Gania-Kalsian village around 6.35 pm, officials said.Another drone was spotted over Khabbar village in the Teryath area of Rajouri district around the same time. In Samba district, a drone-like object with a blinking light was seen hovering for several minutes over Chak Babral village in the Ramgarh sector around 7.15 pm. A similar object was also noticed moving from the direction of Tain towards Topa in the Mankote sector along the LoC in Poonch district.The heightened alert along the border comes as Army chief General Dwivedi said that Operation Sindoor , launched in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack, remains ongoing and warned Islamabad against any future misadventure.“At least 6 terror camps still active across the LoC & 2 across the International Border after Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. Will act, if any (nefarious) attempts are carried out,” the Army chief said while addressing the annual Army Day press conference.Reflecting on the operation, he said, “Operation Sindoor was conceptualised and executed with precision. Through 22 minutes of initiation on 7th May and an orchestration that lasted 88 hours up to 10th May, the operation reset strategic assumptions by striking deep, dismantling terror infrastructure, and puncturing the longstanding nuclear rhetoric.”General Dwivedi said Indian forces destroyed seven of the nine identified targets and later played a key role in ensuring a calibrated response to Pakistani actions. He also said about 100 Pakistan Army personnel were killed in firing along the LoC and International Border during the period of heightened tensions.“The entire country stands with the Army,” he said, adding that any future response would be resolute and coordinated across services.Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes under Operation Sindoor on the intervening nights of May 6 and May 7, destroying terror hideouts in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and mainland Pakistan, including facilities linked to Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke. India has said the strikes were aimed solely at terror infrastructure, while subsequent Pakistani missile and drone attempts were intercepted by Indian air defence systems.","Suspected pakistani drones spotted along loc, ib near samba, rajouri & poonch districts in j&k.

Army modernising force for future warfare: General

NEW DELHI: General Upendra Dwivedi said on Tuesday the Army is ready to induct women in the infantry but that is contingent on societal acceptance.Stressing that women should not be seen as a “vulnerable commodity”, the General, during a media briefing, said the Army's focus is on “gender neutrality”. “If standards are same, if capabilities are same, and in India as a nation, society is ready to accept it, it (combat role) can be done tomorrow,” he said.He said uniform standards are essential, but achieving them remains a challenge due to medical and operational constraints. Gen Dwivedi said performance data of women officers will determine the opening of more roles, starting with supporting arms, followed by combat arms and eventually special forces, calling it a “sequential and welcome social change.”Giving an estimate of the number of women in the Army currently, the Army chief had last year said, “In the NDA as of today, we have 60 women Army cadets and every year, we are looking at (inducting) 20 cadets. Also, in the Officers’ Training Academy (OTA)—Chennai and Gaya—we are looking at 120 per year.” When it comes to inducting women in the other ranks (ORs), it involves a change in Section 12 of the Army Act, he had said.The Army was looking at a 12 times increase in women’s induction in ORs by 2032. “Currently, the total number of women officers is 8,000,” he had said. The Territorial Army opened up for women and 110 vacancies will come up for women, he had added.Taking lessons from conflicts going on around the world, General Upendra Dwivedi said on Tuesday modernisation remains the urgent focus of the Indian Army. Dedicated regiments of drones with enhanced capabilities, rocket cum missile force, loitering munitions, new battalions like Bhairon equipped with modern technologies and advanced weapons and anti-missile defence radar and systems are on the cards.He said over 90% ammunition is now indigenised, underscoring the push towards self-reliance. “After Operation Sindoor , drones got a new thrust,” he said, adding that new drone formations have been raised and each command now has the capability to manufacture up to 5,000 drones depending on operational requirements. This capability can be enhanced to 20,000 or even one lakh drones depending upon the threat perception or conflict, he said.“As of today, we have raised 13 Bhairav battalions, which are meant to bridge the gap between lethal platoons and special forces within infantry battalions,” the Gen said.“Moving on to artillery, we have created a Divyastra battery.

Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

NEW DELHI: When its third phase failed on Monday, Isro’s PSLV-C62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and Indian companies, including the primary payload. However, a football-sized Spanish satellite called KID (Kestrel Initial Demonstrator), survived, though it transmitted “critical data” back to Earth for only about 3 minutes.The 25-kg satellite separated “against all odds” from PSLV's fourth stage despite the third-stage anomaly that caused the mission to fail. The satellite’s developer, Orbital Paradigm, said on X, “Our KID capsule... separated from PSLV C62, switched on, and transmitted data…”KID, designed for re-entry testing towards a splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean, endured peak deceleration forces and thermal stresses that would pulverise most experimental hardware. “We’re reconstructing trajectory. We survived peak heat and peak g-load (~28g recorded). We have internal temps. Full report will come,” the company said.Developed with French partner RIDE, KID validates Orbital Paradigm’s reusable re-entry technology, crucial for future satellite servicing and de-orbiting.The startup plans a detailed report soon and is likely to accelerate Kestrel’s full-scale development programme.Tragedy struck PSLV when an “anomaly” in the third stage diverted the rocket from its flight path, preventing sun-synchronous orbit insertion of its payload.Isro chairman V Narayanan said on Monday, “Near the end of the third stage, we observed some disturbance in the vehicle, and there was a deviation in its flight path. As a result, the mission could not proceed as expected.” After his statement, it was assumed that all the 16 satellites, including primary payload EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a hyperspectral earth imaging satellite developed by DRDO for national security and surveillance, were lost.KID turned out to be the only to survive long enough to transmit signals. Orbital Paradigm is yet to confirm if the capsule later burned out or splashed down on Earth.","Isro’s pslv-c62 launch vehicle lost 15 satellites from several countries and indian companies.

Pakistan sent Sindoor SOS after seeing Indian forces’ movement; 8 terror camps still active along Pakistan-side of border: Army chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-sent-sindoor-sos-after-seeing-indian-forces-movement-8-terror-camps-still-active-along-pakistan-side-of-border-army-chief/articleshow/126513131.cms,"Operation Sindoor Turning Points Revealed: Army Chief Tells What Forced Pakistan To Seek Ceasefire

NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Tuesday said the moves made by Army, Air Force and Navy on the morning of May 10 following the govt’s directive to prepare for a possible escalation of Operation Sindoor , acted as the decisive signal for Pakistan to seek suspension of the conflict. He also said that eight terrorist camps are currently active along the Pakistani side of the LoC and international border.The three-day conflict was triggered after India on May 7 last year targeted terror camps deep inside Pakistan and POK in retaliation against the jihadi terror attack at J&K’s Pahalgam in April. “The first (turning point) was the 22-minute strike on terrorist targets,” he said. The strike on terrorist targets “derailed the opposite side’s decision-making, and they took time to take that all in,” Gen Dwivedi said. “Due to this, there was confusion among them, and that led to mismanaged responses, which were met with our calibrated response,” he said.“The second turning point was that on the morning of May 10, the tri-forces of India were given certain directions about what to do if this war had escalated. They (Pakistan) had understood it, and hence, they called our DGMO,” General Dwivedi said in what marked the first formal confirmation of the govt’s decision to prepare for a full-scale conflict.“They (Pakistan) had complete information about which (Indian) ship, which strike or pivot, which core unit, or which aircraft was moving where, all from satellites. When they connected these dots, they said that the time has come to stop this war,” Dwivedi said. The General’s observations also marked yet another repudiation of US President Donald Trump’s incessant claims about having brokered the pause in the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.He also spoke about the nuclear sabre-rattling by Pakistani politicians during the eventful four days (May 7-May 10). “As far as nuclear rhetoric is concerned, I would like to clarify that there was no discussion on the nuclear issue in the (India-Pakistan) DGMO talks. Whatever nuclear rhetoric was given by politicians or the public in Pakistan. I have no indication that anything of that sort came from the military,” he said.Emphasising that Operation Sindoor was “the best example of the tri-services’s synergy under clear-cut political directive and full freedom to act or respond”, Gen Dwivedi said, “The Army successfully destroyed seven out of the nine targets, and thereafter, played a pivotal role in ensuring a calibrated response to Pakistan’s actions.” He further said 100 “people associated with Pakistan” were killed in the firing along the Line of Control (LoC) or International Border (IB) during Operation Sindoor.On the current situation of terror hubs, the Army chief said, “There are six terror camps along the LoC and two along the IB. As per our knowledge, there is a presence of 100-150 terrorists there. If we spot any (mischievous) activities, we will definitely deal with it.”On sightings of multiple suspected Pakistani drones along the LoC and IB on Jan 10 and 11, the General said that India has conveyed a clear warning to Pakistan, saying New Delhi has told Islamabad that such activity is “not acceptable”.About violence in J&K, Dwivedi said 65% of the total terrorists eliminated in the UT last year were Pakistanis. He said 31 terrorists in total were eliminated by the armed forces in 2025 under Operation Mahadev, of whom three were the perpetrators of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack . “Active local terrorists are now in single digits. Terrorist recruitment is almost non-existent, with only two in 2025,” he said. Mentioning “clear indicators of positive change in J&K”, the Army chief cited examples of robust development activity, the revival of tourism and the peaceful Amarnath Yatra, which saw over 4 lakh pilgrims, exceeding the five-year average.","Army chief general upendra dwivedi on tuesday said the moves made by army, air force and navy on the morning of may 10 acted as the decisive signal for pakistan to seek suspension of the conflict.

'Real Friends Can Disagree, But...': US Envoy Sergio Gor On India-US Ties, Comments On Trade Deal

India-US trade deal: The new US Ambassador to India, Sergio Gor on Monday shared an important update on the India-US trade deal progress, saying that the two sides will hold a fresh round of talks tomorrow. ""Many of you have asked me for an update on the ongoing trade deal negotiations. Both sides continue to actively engage. In fact, the next call on trade will occur tomorrow,” he said after assuming charge.“India is the world's largest nation. So it's not an easy task to get this across the finish line, but we are determined to get there and while trade is very important for our relationship, we will continue to work closely together on other very important areas such as security, counter-terrorism, energy, technology, education, and health,” he added.“No partner is more essential than India. In the months and years ahead, it is my goal as ambassador to pursue a very ambitious agenda. We will do this as true strategic partners, each bringing strength, respect, and leadership to the table,” he said.India currently faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the US, 25% of which are penal tariffs for its crude oil imports from Russia. Both sides have been engaged in discussions for the first tranche of the trade deal to be finalised but a breakthrough is still elusive.In the meantime, US President Donald Trump has threatened higher tariffs on India if it doesn’t stop buying Russian crude and a new bill that proposes 500% tariffs on countries buying Russian oil has received his nod and will be up for vote in the Senate soon.Talking about the bond between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gor said, “.I've travelled all over the world with President Trump, and I can attest that his friendship with Prime Minister Modi is real. The United States and India are bound not just by shared interest, but by a relationship anchored at the highest levels.

Shaksgam Valley Row Deepens As China Rejects India’s Claim And Defends CPEC Infra Project With Pak





China on Monday reaffirmed its territorial claims over Jammu and Kashmir Shaksgam Valley and defended its infrastructure projects in the region, rejecting India’s objections and insisting the construction is “beyond reproach”.Responding to India’s objections last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the area belongs to China and that Beijing is well within its rights to carry out development activities there.“The territory you mentioned belongs to China,” Mao told reporters. “It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory. China and Pakistan in the 1960s signed a boundary agreement and delimited the boundary between the two countries, which is the right of China and Pakistan as sovereign countries,” she said.India, however, has firmly rejected China’s claims and the legality of the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement under which Pakistan ceded around 5,180 sq km of territory in the Shaksgam Valley to China from areas under its illegal occupation. New Delhi maintains that the region is part of Indian territory.“Shaksgam Valley is Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan ‘boundary agreement’ signed in 1963.We have consistently maintained that the agreement is illegal and invalid,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said on Friday.He further said the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are “an integral and inalienable part of India”, adding that this stance has been “clearly conveyed to Pakistani and Chinese authorities several times”.China, however, rejected India’s objections to CPEC as well, reiterating its long-held position that the project is an economic cooperation initiative. Mao said the corridor is aimed at promoting local socio-economic development and improving people’s livelihoods.“The China-Pakistan boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue and the position remains unchanged,” she said, adding that Beijing believes the “Jammu and Kashmir dispute is left over from history, and should be properly and peacefully resolved in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements”.The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a multi-billion-dollar network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port. India opposes it because key segments pass through Indian territory.","China on monday reaffirmed its territorial claims over jammu and kashmir shaksgam valley.

Gold price prediction today: What is the gold & silver price outlook in the near-term?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-january-13-2026-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-silver-prices/articleshow/126496127.cms,"While gold may rise further to $4706/$4803, we note that the Fed's concerns may dissipate to some extent. (AI image)

Gold price prediction

today:

Gold prices may trend upwards, but instead of chasing the rally, investors should look to buy on dips, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Performance:

Spot gold, following its monstrous rally of 4.61% to $4510 in the week ending January 9, advanced further to a fresh record high of $4630 on Monday due to escalating geopolitical risks and growing threats to the Fed's independence.

The yellow metal at the time of writing this article was trading at $4622, up 2.48% for the day. The MCX February gold contract at Rs 142,306 was up 2.51%.

Geopolitics watch:

The US President Trump, viewing Greenland of immense strategic security significance for the US, is not ruling out use of force to bring the Island into the folds of the US. His stance has rattled the European nations; thus, creating friction in the US-led NATO alliance that has been in place since the second World War.

Germany and the UK, to restrain the US manoeuvres over Greenland, are discussing plans for a military presence in Greenland. Germany will propose setting up a joint NATO mission to protect the Arctic region as the UK urges allies to beef up their security presence in the High North.

It is to be noted that the majority of Greenlanders support independence from Denmark and strongly oppose US control.

The US President Trump said Sunday that although his administration was in talks with Tehran to set up a meeting, he may act before then due to mounting death tolls and the Iranian government arresting protestors. As per the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency, at least 572 people, including 69 members of security forces, have been killed in the ongoing protests.

Threat to the Fed's independence:

On January 9, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) launched a grand jury investigation threatening a criminal indictment as the DoJ served the central Bank with subpoenas over the Fed Chair Powell's testimony about the Fed's building renovations that incurred around $2.50 billion expenses. The subpoenas are related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025.

Pushing back against the US Administration’s action to indict the Fed, Powell in a video statement released Sunday, called the threat of criminal indictment as pretexts to undermine the Fed's independence in setting monetary policy.

The fresh episode of Trump escalating battle with the Fed is yet another attack on the Central Bank’s independence for not kowtowing to the Administration to cut rates swiftly.

However, the Trump Administration's latest attempt to corner the Fed is facing bipartisan pushback as Senator Tillis, a key Republican on the Banking Committee, blasting the justice probe, vowed to oppose any Trump nominees to the Fed until the matter is resolved.

Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer condemned the probe saying Trump is abusing law to control the central Bank.

Data roundup:

US nonfarm payrolls data released Friday showed a stabilizing but a weak US job market as nonfarm payrolls rose 50K in January Vs the forecast of 70K. Although the unemployment rate unexpectedly edged lower to 4.4% from 4.5% in November Vs the estimate of 4.5%, it could be because of shrinking job pool as fewer people looked for jobs. Two-month payroll net revision stood at -76K jobs. Nonfarm payrolls 3-month average was noted to be -22K.

US Dollar Index and yields:

On Monday, the US Dollar Index fell 0.4% to 98.76 on mounting risks to the Fed's independence.

Two-year US yields rose by around 1 bps to 3.54%, while ten-year yields at 4.18% were up 1.50 bps.

US equities recovered most of the intra-day losses and were only slightly lower.

ETF holdings:

Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 98.95 MOz as of January 9, 0.003 MOz lower YTD.

Upcoming data:

Focus will be on the US CPI data to be released on January 13. University of Michigan Sentiment and inflation expectations (January 9), PPI (January 14) and retail sales (January 14) will also be in focus.

Gold Price Outlook:

While gold may rise further to $4706/$4803, we note that the Fed's concerns may dissipate to some extent on bipartisan opposition to the Trump Administration’s stance. Geopolitical risks may provide more sustainable support to the metal, though.

Buying the dips is preferred over chasing the rallies. Immediate resistance is at $4655, while support kicks in at $4550/$4500/$4400.

It is worth noting that despite elevated geopolitical risks to the Fed’s authority, risk appetite remains healthy. Sharp rallies in metals have become highly correlated with the risk assets though with a relatively higher beta. Moves in yields have been muted despite risk to the Fed.

Silver: Up over 5%

Spot silver prices caught strong bids right from the overnight COMEX session opening and the metal remained buoyant throughout the day. It rose to a fresh record high of $86.21.

At the time of writing, spot silver was changing hands at $85.28, up 7.57% for the day. The MCX March silver contract at Rs 270,423 was up 7% for the day.

Earlier, the grey metal surged 9.67% to $79.85 in the week ending January 9.

ETF:

Total known global ETF silver ETF holdings stood at 853.04 MOz as of January 9, down by around 10.50 MOz YTD.

Lease rates:

One-month LBMA lease rate stood at 3.36%, elevated on a historical basis, but down from 7%+ rates seen a few days ago.

Silver Price Outlook:

Silver is expected to maintain its positive momentum but is quite extended at the current level.

Moves in precious metals are in tandem with moves in risk assets and industrial metal copper, therefore, momentum buying is also visible in these parabolic moves.

Lease rates and ETF inflows have eased, which is not so supportive for the metal.

Nonetheless, spot silver can extend its rally to $87.30/$89.33 unless derailed by much hotter than expected US CPI data. Support is at $83.75/$80.

Buying the dips with a suitable stoploss is preferable over rally chasing trading.

Overall, we maintain a constructive outlook on the metal, though sharp intermittent corrections are likely to punctuate the rallies, which would be deemed as healthy corrections.

Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

Things started going wrong 8 min after launch, says Isro chairman

SRIHARIKOTA/BENGALURU: India's first space mission of 2026 failed on Monday after Isro's workhorse PSLV suffered a glitch in its solid-propellant third stage (PS3), costing 16 satellites and an ambitious project of strategic, diplomatic and commercial importance.The PSLV-C62 failure comes nine months after a glitch in the same third stage of PSLV-C61 prevented EOS-09, another strategic satellite, from reaching orbit on May 18, 2025. This is also the first time PSLV has failed consecutively. The main satellite was EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a DRDO satellite designed to give India's military sharper eyes in space through a hyperspectral imaging payload.Towards the end of the third stage we saw a little more disturbance in the vehicle roll rates and subsequently there was a deviation in the flight path. We are analysing the data,” Isro chairman V Narayanan said. Isro is yet to make public the failure analysis report of the PSLV-C61 mission. All appeared good on Monday when the 44.4-m PSLV, flying its fifth mission in dual strapon configuration, lifted off from SDSC’s first launch pad at 10.18 am, about 1.30 minutes after the scheduled time.About 8 minutes and 40 seconds later, between the thirdstage shut-off and fourthstage (PS4) ignition, something went wrong.Soon, Narayanan announced the mission had failed. It also carried a satellite (Munal) for Nepal and a technology demonstrator (AyulSat) from start-up OrbitAID aimed at cracking on-orbit refuelling, along with 13 other payloads.Also read: Isro sees warning in two consecutive PSLV failures AyulSAT, which was to demonstrate fuel transfer internally and later act as a target satellite for OrbitAID’s chaser satellite planned about six months later, would have put India a step closer to testing on-orbit refuelling. China is the only country which now has on-orbit refuelling technology. OrbitAID founder and CEO Sakthikumar R told TOI on Monday: “We are now forced to launch both the target and chaser satellites together. We hope to do that later this year.”The rocket also carried satellites from the UK, Brazil, Thailand and Spain, apart from payloads developed by Indian startups demonstrating several technologies, including AI processing in orbit, store-andforward communication systems, IoT services, radiation measurement, agricultural data collection, and a re-entry capsule to be deployed after re-start and deorbit of the PS4 stage. This failure is the third launch setback for Isro since Jan 2025 — GSLV-F15, which carried the NVS-02 navigation satellite, failed to place the satellite in geostationary orbit due to a propulsion system malfunction.","Isro's workhorse pslv suffered a glitch in its solid-propellant third stage (ps3) the main satellite was eos-n1 (anvesha), a drdo satellite designed to give india's military sharper eyes in space through a hyperspectral imaging payload.

He wanted to break some off-ice records. And he did so by 2016, as he had a net worth of $200 million. But even that pales in comparison to his net worth a decade later in 2026.2016 was a special year for Gretzky, as it was 10 years ago that he was appointed the vice-chairman and partner of the Oilers Entertainment Group. The owners of the very same franchise for whom he won four Stanley Cups.But it was his wealth that really proved that while Gretzky’s hockey IQ might be unparalleled, he was also one of the league’s savviest businessmen. Now, a decade later, it feels as if 2026 is the new 2016. And his net worth is proof of that.As per Celebrity Net Worth, Gretzky currently stands with a net worth of $250 million, a $50 million increase from a decade ago.This 25% growth proves his continued brand power.This amount also dwarfs his career earnings by a good $4 million. This again proves just how good the Great One has been with his financial decisions to nearly quadruple his career earnings over the 26 years since his retirement.During his NHL career from 1979 to 1999, Gretzky earned approximately $46 million in salary. While that's a substantial figure, it represents only a fraction of his total wealth. His peak earning years came with the New York Rangers, where he commanded $6.5 million annually.This wasn't unjust, as in his career Gretzky did some things that modern hockey fans just can't understand. This included four seasons with 200+ points. Something that only he had done and even the legendary Mario Lemieux couldn't repeat. Not to mention, the Great One also had the record for 894 career goals and still holds the all-time record for most points at 2857 points.But compared to these numbers, his earnings seem modest compared to today's mega-contracts, but Gretzky played in an era before the salary explosion that would follow. What set him apart wasn't just what he earned on the ice, but his understanding that his playing days would finance much larger opportunities.Those career earnings became the foundation upon which he built an empire worth more than five times his hockey salary alone. Soon, endorsements came for the “Great One.”Gretzky understood early that his brand could transcend hockey. During and after his playing career, he earned an estimated $50 million from endorsements, appearances, and licensing deals with powerhouse brands including Nike, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Upper Deck.His association with these companies wasn't just lucrative but also strategic. His decision to join the trading card giants meant that his name remains in printed media and collectibles for a long time. So while the younger generation might not remember his on-ice miracles, they will remember him in another way.But while some legends wane after retirement, Gretzky continued to be the center of brand deals, and his partnership with betting giants BetMGM once again showed his understanding of the market in this age of sports betting.Gretzky's post-retirement investment portfolio showcases remarkable diversity and timing. His real estate deals alone have been particularly profitable—he sold his family's Los Angeles estate to MLB star Lenny Dykstra for $18.5 million and later flipped a California mansion purchased for $13.5 million for $22.9 million.The journey from $200 million in 2016 to $250 million in 2026 tells a story of sustained excellence in a second career. It’s proof that the same vision and work ethic that produced 2,857 career points can build generational wealth.Wayne Gretzky didn't just change how hockey is played; he changed how hockey players think about life after the game, setting a standard for athlete entrepreneurship that endures today.","Wayne gretzky's net worth is $250 million, a $50 million increase from a decade ago.

Candace Owens recounts vivid dreams that point to betrayal around Charlie Kirk





Candace Owens publicly described a series of vivid dreams involving Charlie Kirk . The story, which was posted on fresh doubts about old partnerships and domestic divisions, created a heated debate within the political and social media sphere. What is most exceptional about it is not the statement alone, but the emotional clarity of the way Owens describes the experience.Owens did not make it symbolic or metaphorical but portrayed the dreams as recurring, particular, and disturbing. They, according to her, had a message, which she could not hear at first. The narrative grew in public attention following the revelation pointed out by commentator Keith Woods, and the story rekindled discussion on the concept of trust, loyalty and silence on the influential political networks.Candace Owens explained that in the dream, Kirk appeared urgent and distressed. She recalled him saying, ""Charlie said to me, I don't have much time."" He then insisted she needed to understand what had happened, adding that ""they betrayed me multiple people.""Each time she tried to ask who was responsible, the moment slipped away, her voice failing as if she were waking mid sentence. She described his words sounding distant, almost muffled, leaving her frustrated and shaken.Weeks later, the dream returned with startling clarity. Owens said one face finally came through clearly. “It wasn't until the third week after his death that finally one face came through this dream. It came through as clear as day around the corner of the restaurant and it was Andrew Colbett,” she said.Owens shared the exact message she sent Colbett afterward, explaining the weight she felt compelled to act on. ""I rarely have vivid dreams, but I had one clear as day this weekend. Charlie came to me and he sat down and he told me that he did not have much time that I needed to know that he was in fact betrayed and that they are hiding what happened to my left. I believe his soul is in purgatory and I believe that you know much more than you've said publicly or privately. ""Owens said Colbett never responded. The silence, she implied, only deepened the unease surrounding an already haunting experience.Also Read: Candace Owens opens up about personal struggle after podcast intro plan hits licensing wall","Candace owens shared a disturbing account of recurring dreams in which charlie kirk appeared urgently, claiming he had been betrayed.

Who is Sam Beal and why his disappearance is drawing attention now

Sam Beal’s NFL career and life after football

Former New York Giants defensive back Sam Beal has been missing for nearly seven months, according to his sister, who has now publicly asked for help in locating him. The case is now gaining attention after family members shared details of his disappearance and urged anyone with information to contact authorities. While officials continue to investigate, much about Beal’s whereabouts remains unknown and no official updates have been provided by law enforcement beyond confirming that he is now listed as a missing person.Sam Beal, 29, is a former NFL cornerback who was once part of the New York Giants organization. His disappearance has gained public attention largely because of his past as a professional football player and because his sister has recently spoken out about how long he has been missing.According to his family, it has been approximately seven months since they last heard from him. The public appeal marks the first time many outside his immediate circle have learned about the situation.According to Beal’s sister, Sam was last seen in July 2025. She has said that he dropped off his girlfriend and borrowed her car, telling her he was heading toward Virginia Beach, Virginia. He never returned and contact with him stopped shortly afterward.The vehicle was later found in Virginia Beach reportedly containing his shoes and socks, but Beal himself was not located. His sister has described the lack of information since then as devastating for the family saying they have had no communication from him for months.All known details about his last movements come from family statements and publicly reported information.Beal played college football at Western Michigan before entering the NFL. He was selected by the New York Giants in the 2018 supplemental draft and spent time with the team over the following seasons.His professional football career was relatively brief and he largely stayed out of the public spotlight after stepping away from the NFL. Since leaving football, Beal did not maintain a high-profile presence which has contributed to the limited public information available about his life in recent years.Law enforcement agencies are aware of Beal’s disappearance and his case is listed in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. Authorities have not publicly shared many details about the investigation, nor have they indicated whether foul play is suspected.There has been no official update on leads or developments and police have not released a timeline beyond confirming when Beal was last reported missing. As of now, the case remains open.Also read - Cardi B responds to Offset blackmail involving Stefon Diggs, released by Celina Powell","Former new york giants defensive back sam beal has been missing for nearly seven months, according to his sister.

Northern lights may drift across US skies this week: Know where to spot them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/northern-lights-may-drift-across-us-skies-this-week-know-where-to-spot-them/articleshow/126418902.cms,"Northern lights may drift across US skies this week: Know where to spot them

What is causing this aurora event

Clouds and city lights change the experience





Northern skies do not usually proclaim themselves. Most nights are calm, even when something faraway moves above the earth. This week is little different. A pulse of solar activity is travelling across Earth's magnetic field, and this change could be enough to bring the northern lights into view in portions of the United States. It is not guaranteed, and it will not appear the same everywhere. Some people may notice a gentle tint on the horizon, while others may see nothing. However, for a brief period in early January, the odds shift somewhat. Space weather forecasters and sky watchers are keeping a tight eye on the darkness, hoping it may reveal something unexpected rather than being empty for once during the harshest stretch of winter evenings.The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do. Alaska remains the most reliable place, almost separate from the rest of the map when it comes to aurora watching. Parts of:These areas lie closer to where Earth’s magnetic field funnels charged particles into the atmosphere. NOAA forecasts suggest activity could peak overnight between January 8 and January 9, though timing often slips by hours. In these states, the lights may form brighter arcs or slow-moving curtains rather than faint smudges.Even then, nothing is promised. Auroras are known for appearing briefly and fading without warning.States just below the typical aurora belt are not completely out of luck. Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine frequently find themselves on the verge of a moderate geomagnetic storm, and this week may be no exception. The exhibit in these sites is typically understated. Colours may appear washed out, closer to grey than green. It frequently remains low in the northern sky, easily mistaken for a cloud or distant glow. Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, and sections of New York fall under the same category. Seeing the aurora typically requires patience and expectations on the part of viewers. Many who do notice it do so only later, when images reveal more than the naked eye could see at the time.The trigger comes from the Sun, though not in a dramatic, cinematic way. A coronal mass ejection has sent a stream of charged particles outward, interacting with a co rotating interaction region already moving through space. Together, they disturb Earth’s magnetic field just enough to produce a G1-level geomagnetic storm. That rating is considered minor, but minor does not mean invisible. It simply means effects are more local and less intense. Space weather remains difficult to predict with precision. Solar wind speed, density, and direction can all shift suddenly. Forecasts improve as the storm arrives, but uncertainty never fully disappears.Even the strongest aurora means little under thick cloud. Cloud cover remains the biggest reason people miss these events, regardless of solar activity. Clear skies matter more than most other factors. Light pollution is the next obstacle. Urban lighting can wash out faint auroras entirely, especially in southern locations. Rural areas, coastal stretches, and dark sky parks offer better odds. Many experienced observers suggest letting your eyes adjust and avoiding phone screens for a while. Cameras often see more than humans do, especially in low light modes. Sometimes the night still looks empty. Sometimes it does not. That uncertainty is part of the pull.","A pulse of solar activity is travelling across earth's magnetic field.

Why India is on the list of 'high degree of caution'





Canada updated its country-wise travel alert in the first week of January and advised Canadians to avoid traveling to a list of countries. This takes into account political tension, flight situations, internal protests etc.Canada advises its nationals to avoid all travel to Iran due to ongoing nationwide demonstrations, tensions in the region, the high risk of arbitrary detention and the unpredictable enforcement of local laws. ""The Iranian authorities have arrested and/or detained individuals, including foreign and dual nationals, to exert political or diplomatic influence on their governments. You should leave Iran if you can do so safely. Many airlines have suspended flights to and from Iran at this time, but there are overland crossing options. Our ability to provide consular services in Iran is extremely limited,"" it said.""Avoid all travel to Venezuela due to the heightened security situation, unstable political and economic situations, significant level of violent crime, the risk of arbitrary detention, and the decline in basic living conditions, including shortages of medication, gasoline and water,"" the advisory said.""The political and security situation remains unstable in the Central African Republic. Military operations are regularly taking place throughout the country and armed criminal groups are committing acts of violence in several regions. The security situation is more stable in Bangui but could deteriorate rapidly,"" the alert said.Avoid all travel to South Sudan, due to the ongoing volatile security situation, armed conflicts, inter-ethnic violence and high levels of violent crime, the advisory said on South Sudan.
