Musk vs Trump: Did Vivek Ramaswamy 'Doge' a bullet by getting out in time?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-vs-trump-did-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-a-bullet-by-getting-out-in-time/articleshow/121664165.cms,"Trump WIPES OUT Elon Musk's $15 BILLION In Just 6 Minutes; Tesla Shares Tank, MAYHEM At Wall Street

Elon Musk EXPOSES Donald Trump-Epstein Link From 1992 Video: Mar-a-Lago Tapes Go Viral





In Washington’s latest episode of Tech Titans vs MAGA Caesar, D onald Trump has turned on Elon Musk —his former bromantic partner-in-disruption, SpaceX messiah, and self-appointed guardian of Western civilisation. The trigger? Musk labelled Trump’s much-hyped One Big Beautiful Bill “a disgusting abomination” and warned that America was hurtling toward “debt slavery. ”Trump, never one to take offence lightly—or privately—responded with a MAGA-flavoured blitzkrieg. Contracts for Musk’s companies? At risk. His reputation in conservative circles? Torched. “Just another whiny billionaire,” Trump sneered, “who forgot who made him matter.”As the Trump-Musk bromance dissolves faster than a Tesla on Autopilot in Washington traffic, one man watches the fireworks from a safe, well-lit distance—sipping Perrier, adjusting his campaign blazer, and thanking his stars he got out early, having clearly absorbed Sun Tzu’s timeless wisdom: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”—Vivek Ramaswamy.Also read: 'Disgusting abomination' to 'bombshell': Trump & Musk feud spirals; timeline of the public meltdown Once the philosophical darling of the new right, Ramaswamy was handed a shiny new toy in Trump’s second term—DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.A meme-ified federal Frankenstein, DOGE was Trump’s idea of bureaucratic reform through Silicon Valley swagger. Musk was the co-head. Vivek was the “sane one.” Together, they were meant to revolutionise Washington. Or at least yell at it until it agreed to be disrupted.But like any startup built on vibes and vague mission statements, DOGE began to implode before it launched. Musk wanted to fire half of Washington via app. Trump wanted press conferences with golden eagles and fog machines. And Vivek? Vivek quietly disappeared.Officially, he left to run for Ohio governor. Unofficially, insiders suggest he saw the writing on the Twitter wall —that DOGE was less a reform movement and more a digital kamikaze mission, powered by ego, caffeine, and libertarian hallucinations.And now, in hindsight, his exit looks less like a career pivot and more like a Sun Tzu manoeuvre. Because while Musk is now battling Trump, Congress, and his own booster-fuelled paranoia, Ramaswamy is free to reinvent himself as a centrist tech-whisperer in the Rust Belt. MAGA enough to get the base. Moderate enough to avoid the madness.Except MAGA, like any self-devouring revolution, doesn’t forget. Or forgive.Since stepping away from DOGE and softening his Trumpian rhetoric, Ramaswamy has found himself in the crosshairs of the same base that once anointed him their biotech Brahmin. Hardcore influencers have branded him a traitor. Conservative meme accounts now photoshop him next to Liz Cheney. And in the subterranean rage economy of right-wing internet culture, he's been rebranded from “America First entrepreneur” to “globalist plant with a Harvard tongue. ”Also read: Feud intensifies: Musk shares 1992 video; Trump seen with Jeffrey Epstein in clip The irony? The same mob now grilling Ramaswamy for “disloyalty” is turning on Musk for “disrespect.” In MAGAland, loyalty is a zero-sum blood sport, and the only acceptable exit is the one through public execution.DOGE, predictably, has become a political punchline. It was doomed from conception—run like a Reddit thread, branded like a crypto coin, and staffed by men who confuse spreadsheets with scripture. The only surprising thing is how quickly it crashed. Musk thought he could out-Trump Trump. But in MAGA-land, there can only be one sun god—and he’s orange, not emerald-mined.Ramaswamy, to his credit, didn’t wait around to become collateral damage. He understood what Musk didn’t: that proximity to Trump is radioactive. Stay too long and you mutate. Get out early and you might just survive.The result? Musk is in political freefall. Trump is in attack mode. And Ramaswamy? He’s in Ohio, sipping Perrier and talking about “innovation in public policy”—while ducking MAGA Twitter grenades and hoping they forget he ever existed.Call it foresight. Call it cowardice. Or just call it good political hygiene.Because as Sun Tzu said—he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.And in the dystopian sitcom that is American politics, that makes Vivek Ramaswamy the guy who ghosted the group chat before the firestorm—and lived to run another episode.","Vivek ramaswamy was the co-head of doge, the department of government efficiency.

Pakistan's propaganda with civilian casualty claims

NEW DELHI: The extent of Pakistan’s losses is becoming increasingly clear as more details emerge from the recent cross-border military conflict dubbed Operation Sindoor Indian Air Force (IAF) retaliatory strikes in response to the Pahalgam terror attack , which killed 26 civilians, led to the decimation of significant Pakistani military assets, including fighter jets, surveillance aircraft, drones, and missile systems, forcing Islamabad to seek a ceasefire within four days.According to ANI report on the basis of defence sources involved in the operation, the IAF destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, and one C-130 military transport aircraft. More than ten armed drones (UCAVs), several cruise missiles, and radar sites were also taken out during India's calibrated air campaign, which began late on May 6 and concluded by May 10.The strikes, which included hits on key Pakistani airbases such as Bholari, were executed exclusively using air-launched cruise missiles, avoiding surface-to-surface weapons like the BrahMos. The strikes were carried out by a mix of Rafale and Su-30 MKI fighters, with support from electronic warfare and surveillance assets.One of the most significant hits came in the form of a long-range Sudarshan missile strike, which neutralised a high-value aerial platform, possibly an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEWC) aircraft or an electronic warfare jet, at a range of nearly 300 km.Another AEWC aircraft of Swedish origin, believed to be stationed at the Bholari airbase, was also reportedly destroyed.Although there is suspicion that additional fighter aircraft may have been inside the damaged hangars, officials are not including those in confirmed kill counts due to Pakistan's refusal to clear debris from the site.Meanwhile, Indian air defences effectively intercepted multiple Pakistani air and ground-launched cruise and ballistic missiles. The IAF also scored multiple kills on Pakistani drones, including Chinese-made Wing Loong variants, during strikes and airspace incursions.A dossier showed Pakistan accusing India of targeting seven locations beyond the Indian military's officially disclosed targets, including Attock, Bahawalnagar, Gujrat, Jhang, Peshawar, Chhor, and Hyderabad, alleging civilian casualties. Indian officials, however, dismissed the claims as “propaganda”, asserting that all Indian strikes were limited to terror infrastructure, not civilian or military Pakistani centres.“We disclosed our targets transparently. This Pakistani document seems like an attempt to falsely portray Indian actions as indiscriminate,” said an Indian defence official.Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed civilians in Jammu & Kashmir. On May 7, India struck four terror hubs in Pakistan and five in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, including high-profile targets like the Sawai Nala camp in Muzaffarabad, Markaz Taiba in Muridke (Lashkar-e-Taiba HQ), and Markaz Subhan in Bahawalpur (Jaish-e-Mohammed HQ).After Pakistan escalated with missile and drone attacks on Indian military and civilian centres, India responded with force, targeting nine Pakistani airbases and multiple radar sites. The intense four-day conflict ended when Pakistan sought a ceasefire on May 10, reeling under mounting losses.","Operation sindoor was launched in retaliation to the pahalgam terror attack that killed civilians in jammu & kashmir.

Other G7 members keen on seeing Modi's participation, hints Carney

NEW DELHI: Canadian PM Mark Carney defended the last-minute invitation to his counterpart Narendra Modi for the G7 summit , saying it made sense for Canada and other members to invite the ""5th largest economy"" and the most populous country in the world that's central to a number of supply chains.While Modi's travel programme is not finalised yet, he's expected to reach Alberta in time for the G7 outreach session on June 17.The G7 summit begins on June 15. Asked repeatedly about why Canada would have Modi over when the probe into the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar is still on, Canadian PM Mark Carney said there had been progress on law enforcement dialogue which ""recognises issues of accountability"".Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau had wrecked the India-Canada relationship by alleging the Indian govt's role in the murder without, as India continues to maintain, sharing any evidence. ""Bilaterally, we have now agreed-importantly-to continued law enforcement dialogue. So, there's been some progress on that, which recognises issues of accountability. I extended the invitation to Prime Minister Modi in that context, and he has accepted,'' said Carney, responding to questions from the media about the issue and the invitation to Modi.""We are a country of the rule of law. The rule of law is proceeding as it should in Canada, and I am not going to disrupt that process,'' he added.Carney hinted that other G7 members were keen on seeing participation by the Indian leader. ""First, we are in the role - Canada is in the role - of the G7 chair, and in those discussions, as agreed with our G7 colleagues, we're addressing important issues like energy security, the digital future, and critical minerals, among others. Partnerships in building infrastructure in the emerging and developing world are also part of the agenda,'' he said.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , leading an all-party parliamentary delegation to the United States, briefed key American officials on the escalating threat of cross-border terrorism faced by India and the country’s strong counter-response through Operation Sindoor According to an official statement issued by the Embassy of India in the US, the delegation met deputy secretary of state Christopher Landau and held a wide-ranging conversation on regional security and India-US bilateral cooperation.The delegation informed the US official about the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, in which 26 people were killed and several injured, and outlined India’s subsequent military operation launched on May 7. ""The delegation briefed him on the heinous terrorist attack in Pahalgam, discussed India's subsequent Operation Sindoor, and put forth India's firm resolve to counter cross-border terrorism in all its forms,"" the Embassy said in a statement.The deputy secretary of state reaffirmed the United States’ “strong support” to India in its fight against terrorism, the statement added. The discussions also included avenues to deepen cooperation between the two countries in areas of shared interest.Tharoor also engaged with members of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In separate meetings with Senator Chris Van Hollen and a phone call with Senator Cory Booker, the delegation shared insights on India's security challenges and military actions. “Senator Van Hollen expressed deep sympathy for India and reaffirmed that the US stands firmly with India in the fight against terrorism,” BJP MP Tejasvi Surya posted on X following the meeting.Congress MP Tharoor also said on X that he had a ""warm & productive"" conversation with Senator Cory Booker. “Outlined the repeated provocations of terrorism emanating from across the border, laid out the details of Operation Sindoor, and emphasized India's firm resolve in countering any future acts of terrorism,” Tharoor wrote.The delegation participated in a special dinner hosted by the Indian Ambassador, where former envoy Taranjit Singh Sandhu said on X, “Delighted to meet so many old friends and supporters of India-US partnership at Ambassador’s dinner.”Tharoor also addressed the US media at the National Press Club in Washington in a session moderated by Indian-American journalist Poonam Sharma. “A lively session... spanned a wide range of issues related to Operation Sindoor and India's actions against terrorism,” he wrote.The all-party delegation includes MPs from various political parties: Shambhavi Chaudhary (Lok Janshakti Party), Sarfaraz Ahmed (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), G M Harish Balayogi (TDP), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejasvi Surya, and Bhubaneswar Kalita (BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), and Milind Deora (Shiv Sena), along with former Indian Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu.India launched Operation Sindoor as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: On his return to India after being a part of a global delegation that visited several countries, veteran Congress functionary Salman Khurshid said though he had been asked by his party to be a part of Centre's global outreach against terrorism, he was left wondering ""why people were making speculations and what they were looking for"". He was explaining his biting remarks that were apparently directed at Congress officebearers who ran down the govt campaign.Khurshid termed the trip as successful after his delegation met with external affairs minister S Jaishankar for a briefing. Congress MP Manish Tewari too praised his delegation's efforts in Gulf and African countries, where it effectively ""busted false equivalence"" Pakistan has drawn between Palestine and Kashmir, and sensitised the hosts about Pakistan's terror agenda against India.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is leading a delegation that is in the US at present, said, ""I think anybody who thinks that working in national interest is some sort of anti-party activity really needs to question themselves rather than us.""However, unfazed by the criticism of these party members, Congress continued its offensive against the programme, saying the foreign visits achieved little with the delegations failing to meet big leaders in host countries.When asked about Khurshid's praise of the outreach, All India Congress Committee spokesman Ajoy Kumar said the issue was not about any party or individual because it is govt that decides the script for any such delegation. ""And the problem is that govt did not give the script,"" he felt.Kumar added that the delegations did not even name China as the force behind Pakistan's devious agenda or call out US president Donald Trump for his claim that he was behind Indo-Pak ceasefire. ""The media was busy pitting Congress against Congress by talking about Tharoor, etc, but this was Modi's surrender,"" he claimed.Nevertheless, Khurshid stuck to his guns and said he had been in touch with the party high command throughout the tour.Citing an example of what the trip had achieved, he said Pakistan had to issue a ""frustrated press release"" after his delegation's three-day visit to Malaysia.""While some questions were raised by Malaysia, given its strong membership of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, we received a firm letter of support from the prime minister of Malaysia. We saw no indication of any hesitation in backing India,"" Khurshid pointed out.",Congress mp manish tewari too praised his delegation's efforts in gulf and african countries.

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic turn of events, Canadian PM Mark Carney called PM Modi and invited him for the G7 summit that begins eight days from now at Kananaskis in Alberta. Modi accepted the invitation and said he was looking forward to meeting him at the summit.The announcement by Modi on X followed almost a week of suspense over his participation because of a lack of invitation, drawing barbs from the opposition about his possible exclusion from the summit. India is not a member of G7 but Modi has been invited for all summits since 2019. Modi congratulated Carney on his poll win and thanked him for the invitation.As vibrant democracies bound by deep people-to-people ties, India and Canada will work together with renewed vigour, guided by mutual respect and shared interests,"" Modi posted on X.Without elaborating, a Canadian readout said that ""importantly, there was agreement to continued law enforcement dialogue and discussions addressing security concerns"".Modi and Carney, who was sworn in as PM in March and won federal elections the next month to cement his position, have pledged to rebuild the relationship that was left tottering by former PM Justin Trudeau's allegation of India's complicity in the murder of pro-Khalistan separatist and Canadian national Hardeep Singh Nijjar.New Delhi has rejected the allegation saying Ottawa hasn't provided any evidence to back its claim.The Indian govt will hope that Canada will ensure enough security to not allow Sikh separatist groups, who had been applying pressure on Carney to not invite Modi, to disrupt the visit. India's official position remains that the main issue with Canada is the leeway provided to Khalistan backers to carry out anti-India activities. For India to engage in any serious effort to rebuild the relationship, foolproof security for the country's diplomats, along with a crackdown on extremists and secessionists who seek to hurt Indian interests, is of paramount importance.Modi had last visited Canada in 2015. While the two countries are also said to be considering reappointing high commissioners, both Canadian and Indian authorities maintain they are looking at repairing ties one step at a time. Asked about the Nijjar investigations, Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand said last week that while the rule of law will never be compromised, Canada is looking forward to continuing to build this partnership.""The two leaders discussed the longstanding relationship between Canada and India, including deep people-to-people ties and significant commercial links,'' said the Canadian readout. The summit will also see Modi coming face to face with US President Donald Trump for the first time since their bilateral meeting in Washington in February this year.This will be Modi's first visit abroad since the military conflict with Pakistan and the PM is likely to use the opportunity to highlight India's concerns about Pakistan's continued support to cross-border terrorism and India's use of force to prevent terrorist attacks.",Canadian pm mark carney called pm modi and invited him for the g7 summit.

'Defiant' NATO Nation Leader Boldly Speaks Russian In Parliament; 'Nobody Can Stop Us...' | Viral





FBI Director Kash Patel has claimed that the United States is working closely with Indian law enforcement agencies to dismantle what he describes as a China-backed global fentanyl trafficking network. Speaking on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Patel alleged that while India is not a consumer of fentanyl, it has become an increasingly critical transit point for chemical precursors manufactured in China and passed on to Mexican drug cartels.“They’re going to places like India, and I’m also doing operations in India,” Patel said. “They’re having the Mexican cartels now make this fentanyl down in Mexico still.”Patel claimed that Chinese companies were “getting cute” by routing fentanyl precursors through third countries, including India, to evade direct enforcement and scrutiny.According to Patel, one of the clearest signs of a targeted campaign lies in where fentanyl deaths are and aren’t occurring. He said the drug is devastating the United States but has not created comparable crises in countries like India, Australia, or Canada.“You don’t hear fentanyl deaths in India. You don’t really hear fentanyl deaths in England, Australia, New Zealand, or Five Eyes partners in Canada,” he said.Patel suggested that the absence of deaths in those regions indicated that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was selectively deploying the fentanyl supply chain toward the United States for strategic purposes.“The CCP have used it as a directed approach because we are their adversary,” Patel claimed. “Why don’t we go and take out generations of young men and women who might grow up to serve in the United States military, or become a cop, or become a teacher?”Read: How Kash Patel broke every Indian-American stereotype Patel said that he had personally reached out to Indian officials and that joint operations between the FBI and Indian law enforcement were now underway. “I literally just got off the phone with the Indian government,” he said. “I said, I need your help. This stuff’s coming into your country and then they’re moving it from your country because India is not consuming fentanyl.”He stated that the FBI is working on the ground in India with “the heads of their government law enforcement authorities” to identify and shut down Indian companies involved in importing or redistributing Chinese fentanyl precursors.“We’re going to find these companies that buy it and we’re going to shut them down,” Patel said.Patel also laid out a strategy that includes international legal action. “We’re going to sanction them. We’re going to arrest them where we can. We’re going to indict them in America if we can. We’re going to indict them in India if we can.”Patel’s interest in Indian cooperation is not merely geopolitical — it’s personal. Born to Gujarati immigrant parents who fled East Africa, Patel grew up in a working-class immigrant household and has frequently spoken about the influence of his heritage on his national security outlook. His rise from federal public defender to Trump-era White House official and now FBI Director has often been cast by conservative media as a story of Indian-American exceptionalism — one that defies traditional liberal narratives of the diaspora. His critics, however, argue that he has used his identity to shield controversial moves inside the intelligence establishment.Patel said that the fentanyl trafficking network has adapted in response to stricter enforcement at the US-Mexico border. According to him, cartels are now using Canada as a northern entry point for distribution.“They’re flying it into Vancouver,” Patel said. “They’re taking the precursors up to Canada, manufacturing it up there, and doing their global distribution routes from up there because we were being so effective down south.”He further alleged that China’s economic interest in the trade is minimal and that the real motive is geopolitical sabotage.“They’re not making a ton of money off it,” Patel said. “So it’s really just for that purpose.”Patel stated that fentanyl precursors have been detected in Five Eyes countries — the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand — even though the drug itself has not yet been widely deployed in those regions.“The fentanyl itself isn’t being deployed into your country, but it’s there being manufactured,” he said. “The CCP just hasn’t directed it at you yet, and they know that.”He said he has asked allied governments to help dismantle those production networks before they become operational threats.According to Patel, over 74,000 Americans died of synthetic opioid overdoses in 2023 alone, and the fentanyl epidemic should be viewed not only as a public health emergency but as a “tier one national security threat.”Patel argued that India’s cooperation is critical in confronting what he repeatedly characterised as a CCP-directed campaign to destabilise American society.“India is not the problem,” he said. “But if we don’t get ahead of it, it could become one.”While none of Patel’s claims have yet been independently confirmed by Indian or Chinese officials, his remarks suggest a new phase of international cooperation on drug enforcement — one that places India at the centre of a growing geopolitical storm.Note: Kash Patel's statements about India","Fbi director kash patel has claimed that the u.s. is working closely with indian law enforcement agencies to dismantle what he describes as a china-backed global fentanyl trafficking network.

Musk deleted posts

Musk deleted post about Epstein files





Is Elon Musk taking a step closer to ending his feud with Donald Trump ? The Tesla CEO's latest move certainly seems to hint in that direction.James Fishback, principal architect of the ""DOGE Checks"" initiative, who had previously criticized Musk for his tweets targeting Trump, praised the SpaceX boss after he deleted all posts directed at the US president.Fishback highlighted Musk’s deleted tweets and urged him to take the next step by offering an apology to Trump.""Elon has deleted his slanderous tweets about the President of the United States. Good first step. Next up: full-throated apology to Trump and his family,"" he said.The dispute began when Fishback responded to Musk’s post about potentially forming a new political party, dubbed the ""American Party.""""Elon, Keep tweeting about your 'new political party' and Japanese fertility rates all you want. You owe President Trump a full-throated apology, and every hour you delay, it’ll make an eventual apology less sincere. You can substantively disagree with the President on policy, but you should not have baselessly and personally attacked him,"" Fishback said.In response, the recently-departed DOGE head posted a series of tweets, but shortly after, many of them were deleted. Some replies to those tweets are still visible, but the original posts have been removed.Notably, all of Musk's earlier tweets criticizing Trump, including those referencing the Epstein files, have also been deleted. This suggests that he may be exploring ways to mend their fractured relationship.One of the deleted tweets read: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT! Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.”The political rift between the two became public earlier this week when Musk lashed out at one of Trump’s signature legislative efforts — which the Republican leader often referred to as his “big, beautiful bill” — calling it a “disgusting abomination.”The criticism reportedly stunned Republicans and prompted a rare serious response from Trump. “Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” he said from the Oval Office.Trump didn’t stop there. Taking direct aim at Musk’s companies, the US president added: “The easiest way to save money in our budget — billions and billions of dollars — is to terminate Elon’s governmental subsidies and contracts.”Musk, in turn, accused Trump of ""ingratitude"" and escalated the standoff by reposting unverified claims suggesting the latter's name appeared in government documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein.Also read: 'It could have gone nuclear': Donald Trump again claims he 'stopped India-Pakistan war'; doubles down on trade angle","Elon musk has deleted all posts directed at us president donald trump.

NEW DELHI: US Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday made a pointed advise to a Pakistani delegation, led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, that the country should ""do all it can"" to eliminate terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad from the region and ensure protection of religious minorities in the country.In a social media post on X, Sherman said that he emphasised to the Pakistani delegation the importance of combatting terrorism and, in particular, the group Jaish-e-Mohammed, who murdered Daniel Pearl in 2002.""I emphasized to the Pakistani delegation the importance of combatting terrorism, and in particular, the group Jaish-e-Mohammed, who murdered my constituent Daniel Pearl in 2002,"" the Congressman said.""Pearl’s family continues to live in my district, and Pakistan should do all it can to eliminate this vile group and combat terrorism in the region,"" he added.Daniel was kidnapped by jihadi terrorists in January 2002 while he was on his way to what he had expected would be an interview with Pakistani religious cleric Mubarak Ali Gilani in Karachi.The US lawmaker also told the Pakistani delegation that the protection of religious minorities in Pakistan remains an important issue.""Christians, Hindus and Ahmadiyya Muslims living in Pakistan must be allowed to practice their faith and participate in the democratic system without fear of violence, persecution, discrimination, or an unequal justice system.”Sherman further urged the Pakistani delegation to relay to their government the need to free Dr Shakil Afridi, who continues to languish in prison for helping the United States kill Osama bin Laden.“Freeing Dr Afridi represents an important step in bringing closure for victims of 9/11,” he said.Afridi is a Pakistani physician who helped the CIA run a polio vaccination programme in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to collect DNA samples of bin Laden’s family.Afridi was arrested by Pakistani authorities shortly after the American raid on bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad in May 2011. In 2012, a Pakistani court sentenced Afridi to 33 years in prison.The Pakistani delegation timed its visit to the US capital around the same time as a multi-party delegation of Indian parliamentarians led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is in Washington DC.The all-party delegation is briefing key interlocutors about Operation Sindoor in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack and India’s strong resolve to fight terrorism emanating from Pakistan.Bhutto also landed in the US at the same time as the Tharoor-led delegation.Bhutto met UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres with his delegation as well as Security Council Ambassadors in New York and later travelled to Washington in Pakistan’s bid to internationalise the conflict with India as well as the Kashmir issue, but instead got instructed to deal with terrorism emanating from its soil.","Us congressman brad sherman on thursday made a pointed advise to a pakistani delegation, led by bilawal bhutto zardari.

49-year-old Bhushan Athale, an Indian-origin man in Texas, was sentenced to 26 months in prison for making violent threats against Sikh employees of a nonprofit organization in New Jersey. Athale called the main number of the Sikh nonprofit organization and left numerous messages threatening to injure or kill these individuals, cut their hair with a razor etc.The first calls were made in 2022 and in January this year he pleaded guilty to ""interfering with federally protected activities” by threatening to use a dangerous weapon and making an interstate threat to injure another person.He threatened to shave off her and other Sikhs’ “top and bottom” hair with a razor and called members of the religious group by profane names and other insults, according to the criminal complaint authorities wrote when the charges were filed.In 2023, he again called the same Sikh organization and left two more voicemail using violent, sexual imagery against Sikhs and Muslims.He had also sent “hate-fuelled” emails and messages to a Muslim colleague in November 2021, a separate complaint against him said.
