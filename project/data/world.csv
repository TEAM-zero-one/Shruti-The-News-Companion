NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , one of the leaders of seven all-party delegations, on Thursday (local time) expressed disappointment over Colombia's condolences for the people who lost their lives in Pakistan when India launched a counterstrike on May 7, and said that there can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend. He added that India was only exercising its right of self-defence.Tharoor, who is in Columbia as part of the Centre's move, has also shown the picture of Pakistani Army officials attending the funerals of terrorists after India's strike on their terror bases and said that if there is any misunderstanding the delegation is here to clear that.""We were a little disappointed in the reaction of the Colombian government, which apparently expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of lives in Pakistan after the Indian strikes, rather than sympathising with the victims of terrorism. We will say to our friends in Columbia there can be no equivalence between those who dispatch terrorists and those who resist them. There can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend,"" Tharoor said while addressing media in Bagota.""We are only exercising our right of self-defence, and if there is any misunderstanding here on this core, we are here to dispel any such misunderstanding. We're very happy to talk to Colombia about the circumstances in detail.We have, as I said, very concrete proof. In fact, when this terrorist attack occurred, it was immediately claimed by an organisation called The Resistance Front, which is a unit of the Lashkar-e-Taiba base in Muridke, Pakistan,"" he added.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and PoK, after the Pahalgam attack which claimed the lives of 26 people.The Indian Air Force also destroyed 11 Pakistani airbases in response to Pakistan's failed attempts to strike Indian military positions on May 8, 9, and 10.Tharoor emphasised India's resolute position against terrorism, explaining how the nation responded to the Pahalgam terror attack with Operation Sindoor strikes against terrorist infrastructure.""India suffered a grievous terrorist attack on the 22nd of April... When this happened, of course, the world rose up to condemn the terrorist attack, but that was as far as it went. There was no action taken, not even by the country where these people had emerged from, Pakistan. Nobody was arrested, and there was no attempt at any prosecution. India decided that this kind of outrage could not go unpunished. On May 7, India chose to strike against known terror bases and launch pads. ""He highlighted Pakistan's role in providing terrorists with sanctuary and support.""There (in Pakistan) was a well-publicised funeral of one of the terrorists on the sanctions list. That funeral was attended by uniformed senior military and police personnel from Pakistan. That is the extent of complicity that we are seeing between the terrorists who perpetrate crimes of this nature and those who finance, guide, train, arm, and equip them and do provide them safe haven to continue their training and their other awful deeds,"" he stated.",Congress mp shashi tharoor expressed disappointment over colombia's condolences for the people who lost their lives in pakistan when india launched a counterstrike.

PANAJI: At 5.22pm Thursday, as Lt Cdrs Dilna K and Roopa Alagirisamy stepped on Indian soil after a 239-day historic voyage, they became the first Indian duo to sail across the planet.""Yes. We made it."" These four words from Dilna summed up the poignant and emotional 25,400-nautical-mile journey that began Oct 2 from the banks of the Mandovi.""We saw the ocean and waves rising in anger some days. The waves were as high as 20 feet tall, looking like a wall. But we also had days when the sea was as calm as a mirror, and it felt heavenly, and time felt meaningless,"" said Roopa, narrating their audacious endeavour to fly the Tricolour and naval ensign ""in every sea and land across the world"".The circumnavigation took them through four oceans, crossing the equator twice and rounding the three great capes - a route acknowledged as the gold standard in ocean sailing. The mission was part of the Navy's broader initiative to showcase women's role in maritime operations. It also aimed to inspire a new generation of women to embrace adventure and take to the seas - a domain long dominated by men.""I feel I lived all my seven lives in these eight months.This is not going to be my last journey, I am sorry,"" said Roopa with a laugh, as she addressed her family.The voyage tested not just mental endurance but seamanship too. The naval officers navigated some of the world's most treacherous waters, including the South Pacific and the Southern Ocean. They battled towering waves, gale-force winds and long spells of isolation with only each other for company and their 56-foot yacht as their shelter.During the circumnavigation, the duo suffered a complete navigation blackout in the middle of the night in the Pacific Ocean. ""We lost GPS, boat heading, wind instrument, auto-pilot... everything. It took us three hours, but it felt like an eternity to get back the systems. This actually gave us a false sense of security in modern equipment,"" Roopa said.The duo covered 25,400 nautical miles over a period of eight months with port calls at Fremantle (Australia), Lyttleton (New Zealand), Port Stanley (Falkland Islands) and Cape Town (South Africa).Commander Abhilash Tomy (retd), the first Indian to sail around the Earth non-stop, provided mentorship to the duo. His survival and maintenance experience helped the duo master the critical skill of dual-handed sailing. Captain Vipul Mehershi, Captain Atul Sinha, and Commander Nikhil Hegde also played a key role in preparing the officers and the vessel for the expedition.The two naval officers' triumphant return at Mormugao Port was witnessed by defence minister Rajnath Singh and chief of naval staff Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi.","Lt cdrs dilna k and roopa alagirisamy became the first indian duo to sail across the planet.

Pak To Get 'Chinese Version' Of U.S. THAAD Air Defence System? HQ-19 Shield Explained

NEW DELHI: Under Operation Sindoor , India did not just win a military conflict with Pakistan but also scored a victory over China in the technological domain as Pakistan essentially fought as a Chinese proxy by relying heavily on Chinese platforms, according to military expert John Spencer.“Operation Sindoor pitted India’s indigenously developed weapons systems against Chinese-supplied platforms fielded by Pakistan. What unfolded was not just retaliation but the strategic debut of a sovereign arsenal built under the twin doctrines of Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat (the two key programmes of the Modi govt that lay emphasis on self-reliance in the defence sector),” Spencer, a retired US army officer who is currently the chair of urban warfare studies at the Modern War Institute, wrote on X.“India fought as a sovereign power—wielding precision tools it designed, built and deployed with unmatched battlefield control. Pakistan fought as a proxy force, dependent on Chinese hardware that was built for export, not for excellence. When challenged, these systems failed — exposing the strategic hollowness behind Islamabad’s defence posture,” he said.The ‘Made-in-India’ BrahMos supersonic cruise missile with Russian collaboration, totally indigenous Akash surface to air missile and Akashteer missile defence system, Rudram anti-radiation missile, Netra airborne early warning and control (AEW&C), loitering munitions (SkyStriker, Harop) and D4S counter-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, an indigenous multi-layer drone defence system integrating radar, radio frequency jammers, sensors and kinetic kill options had an upper hand over several Pakistan-owned but Chinese-built HQ-9/ HQ-16 SAM Systems, LY-80 & FM-90 air defence systems and CH-4 drones (China), Spencer elaborated.India’s thrust for self-reliance in defence weaponry began as part of PM Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, he said.“The goal was clear: reduce dependence on foreign arms imports and build a world-class domestic defence industry. The policy incentivised joint ventures, opened defence to foreign direct investment up to 74%, and encouraged both public and private sector manufacturers to build sophisticated military hardware at home. Within a few years, systems like the BrahMos missile , K9 Vajra howitzer, and AK-203 rifle were being produced inside India—many with technology partnerships but increasing domestic control,” Spencer said.However, in 2020, the combined shock of the Covid-19 pandemic and Galwan Valley clash with China exposed the fragility of foreign supply chains and the urgency of operational self-reliance, he said. “India imposed phased bans on key defence imports, gave the armed forces emergency procurement powers, and poured investment into indigenous research, design and production. By 2025, India had increased domestic content in defence procurement from 30% to 65%, with a goal of 90% by the decade’s end,” the military expert said in his post.India’s T-72 main battle tanks and advanced fighter jets Russian-origin Su-30MKIs and French-built Rafales provided firepower and flexibility, launching multiple strike packages on Pakistan and ensuring airspace control.“India fought as a sovereign power—wielding precision tools it designed, built, and deployed with unmatched battlefield control. Pakistan fought as a proxy force, dependent on Chinese hardware that was built for export, not for excellence. When challenged, these systems failed—exposing the strategic hollowness behind Islamabad’s defence posture,” Spencer added.","India won tech war, pak lost as china's proxy, says us military expert john spencer. ‘made-in-india’ brahmos supersonic cruise missile with russian collaboration, totally indigenous akash surface to air missile and akashteer missile defence system.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121501559,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1389197,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

We hope both sides remain calm and restrained and avoid actions that could escalate tensions,"" Zhang said during the ministry's monthly press briefing. He reiterated China’s position of promoting regional peace and expressed readiness to play a “constructive role” in achieving a lasting ceasefire.The comments come in the wake of India's retaliatory strikes under ""Operation Sindoor"" conducted from May 7 to 10, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The strikes followed the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that left 26 civilians, mostly tourists dead.During Pakistan’s attempted counterattacks on May 8, 9, and 10, remnants of Chinese-made weapon systems were recovered, raising questions over their effectiveness.While the Chinese government has avoided directly addressing these reports, state-run media have shown heightened interest in the India-Pakistan clash, reflecting the depth of military ties between Beijing and Islamabad.According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China supplied 81 per cent of Pakistan’s total arms imports between 2020 and 2024. These included advanced fighter jets, naval vessels, submarines, and missile systems. China and Pakistan also co-produce the JF-17 fighter jet, the backbone of the Pakistan air force.","The chinese military declined to comment on the effectiveness of chinese-made weapons used by pakistan during its recent military confrontation with india.

'Not A Single Project Completed On Time': Air Chief's Angry Outburst Over Defence Deals | Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday once again reiterated that dialogue with Pakistan will not resume until Islamabad takes concrete and effective action against terrorism. Regarding the Indus Waters Treaty , which was suspended following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, India said that the treaty will remain on hold until Pakistan ""irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.""""As far as our engagement with Pakistan is concerned, our stand has been clear. Any engagement has to be bilateral. We would like to reiterate that terrorism and talks cannot go together. They need to hand over to India, noted terrorists, whose records and list we submitted to them some years ago. Talks on J&K will be held only on the vacating of PoK and when Pakistan hands over the territory to us,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said at his weekly press briefing.""As far as the Indus Water Treaty is concerned, it will remain in abeyance till the time Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support to cross-border terrorism. Just like PM Narendra Modi says, terror and talks cannot go together, terror and trade cannot go together, and water and blood cannot flow together,"" Jaiswal added.The MEA's strong rebuke came a day after Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed Islamabad's readiness to engage in talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism.“There cannot be a bigger commitment and intention to beat this menace (terrorism) for all times to come, and in that, if India wants in all sincerity honest cooperation, Pakistan would be willing, along with the promotion of trade with India. All these issues need to be discussed on the table,” he said.“I think this is most unfortunate that India tried to threaten to stop our flow of water to Pakistan. This is not possible, was never possible, and will not be possible, God-willing. We are making proper arrangements to ensure that India never ever does it,” the Pakistani PM said.In the early hours of May 7, India had launched precision strikes on terrorist infrastructure in response to the Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists. The government had vowed harsh retribution, and over 100 terrorists were eliminated in 'Operation Sindoor'.Following the strikes, the Indian Armed Forces successfully repelled Pakistan’s retaliatory military aggression, targeting several of its airbases. Subsequently, both nations agreed to cease military actions and firing after the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) of Pakistan reached out to his Indian counterpart.In the immediate aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 until Pakistan verifiably renounces its support for cross-border terrorism.The Treaty had allocated the waters of the Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas rivers—around 33 million acre feet (MAF)—to India for exclusive use. Pakistan received the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab, averaging 135 MAF, except for certain limited uses allowed for India.India has also developed hydroelectric projects on Western rivers, within treaty limits. Major dams like Bhakra, Pong, Pandoh, and Thein, along with infrastructure such as the Beas-Sutlej and Madhopur-Beas links, enable full utilisation of Eastern river waters.","India reiterates that dialogue with pakistan will not resume until islamabad takes concrete and effective action against terrorism.

Ek baar jo humne commit kiya hain, fir mein apne aap ki bhi nahi sunta

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh on Thursday issued a strong call for accountability and urgency within India’s defence procurement and manufacturing ecosystem, citing constant delays in project timelines.Speaking at an event in Delhi, Air Chief expressed deep concern over the consistent failure of defence projects to meet delivery deadlines. ""Many times, we know while signing contracts that those systems will never come. Not a single project that I can think of has been completed on time,"" he said, questioning why unrealistic timelines are promised at the time of contract signing. ""Why should we promise something which cannot be achieved?"" he said.He highlighted the detrimental effects such practices have on capacity-building and the broader strategic posture of the armed forces. ""The process gets vitiated,” Singh noted, urging all stakeholders to reflect seriously on the credibility of their commitments.Air Chief called for a stronger partnership between the armed forces and Indian industry, stressing the need to move beyond manufacturing and focus on indigenous design and development in defence.“We must begin designing and developing defence systems in India, not just producing them,” he said. “Once we reach the stage of mass production, capacity naturally follows. But the foundation must be trust, between the forces and industry, to make this possible.”Quoting famous Salman Khan dialogue to underline the seriousness of commitment, he added: “.” (Once we’ve made a commitment, we don’t even listen to ourselves.)Singh also emphasised the enduring centrality of air power in military operations. “Whether it’s land or naval warfare, air power remains indispensable. Any kind of operation, as demonstrated in Operation Sindoor, is incomplete without it,” he said.In a rare moment of candour, the Air Chief also touched upon the culture of restraint within the defence forces, saying the services have often refrained from calling out underperformance explicitly. “Even defence forces have been keeping this restraint of not calling, you know, a black sheep, a black sheep,” he said, warning that such restraint cannot continue indefinitely.The Chief’s remarks come as India increasingly looks to the private sector to shoulder a greater role in defence production under the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative. Quoting Winston Churchill, Singh urged the private sector to seize this pivotal moment.“Each day comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered a chance to do something special,” he said. “What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared for that which could have been their finest hour.”In a passionate appeal, he challenged Indian industry leaders to rise above short-term profits and contribute meaningfully to the country’s defence preparedness. “If today somebody is manufacturing world-class cars, world-class electronics, world-class equipment in the civil domain, why can't that industry or some of the industry join together and say we will make world-class military equipment?” he said.“This is your tap on the shoulder. Please rise to the occasion,” he said.Earlier, the Air Chief had said his confidence in defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) continues to erode over its failure to fix delays in delivery and upgrades to the light combat aircraft Tejas. ""You have to alleviate (our) worries and make us more confident. At the moment, I am just not confident of HAL, which is a very wrong thing to happen,"" Singh had said in February.""I can tell you (HAL) what our requirements and worries are,"" he was heard saying in a video, purportedly referring to the PSU.",Air chief calls for a stronger partnership between the armed forces and indian industry.

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Thursday claimed that the 1988 nuclear agreement between India and Pakistan was signed under pressure from the United States, during the tenure of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.Sharing what he described as a declassified letter on X, Dubey alleged that then US President Ronald Reagan had dictated the agenda of talks between New Delhi and Islamabad.“Under American pressure, we spoke to Pakistani President General Zia. The agenda for the talks was set by the US President,” Dubey posted on X.“What we understood after this letter was that Pakistan and we did the nuclear deal in 1988 under American pressure.”“Why is Congress angry? When I saw this paper, I felt ashamed,” he added, attaching a copy of the letter that he said was addressed by Reagan to Rajiv Gandhi.Dubey also accused the Congress-led government of aligning with US interests in its foreign policy decisions.“Whatever we talked to our friend Soviet Russia about on the Afghanistan problem was an American agenda. Is this the Shimla Agreement? Is the Iron Lady the mentality of slavery? Were we a sovereign nation at that time? Is Congress abusing Modi Ji to make India stronger?” he wrote.The 1988 agreement between India and Pakistan, officially known as the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, was signed on 31 December 1988 and came into force on 27 January 1991. It obligates both nations to annually share lists of nuclear facilities and refrain from attacking each other’s nuclear infrastructure.Dubey’s remarks come amid renewed domestic debate over foreign involvement in India-Pakistan diplomacy, particularly following the Pahalgam terror attack and India’s subsequent Operation Sindoor . He also referred to a letter reportedly written by Rajiv Gandhi to Reagan seeking mediation with Pakistan, a move he said violated the 1972 Shimla Agreement which barred third-party mediation.“It is not easy to be Gandhi,” Dubey said, asserting that Rajiv Gandhi’s request for American intervention was contrary to India’s stated diplomatic policy.Earlier, the BJP MP had posted a declassified 1971 US intelligence cable suggesting that Indira Gandhi had agreed to a UN ceasefire during the Bangladesh Liberation War due to international pressure. The post was aimed at countering opposition criticism of the government’s current diplomatic approach.Meanwhile, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh criticised external affairs minister S. Jaishankar for remaining silent on US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s alleged remarks about possible American mediation in India-Pakistan talks.

Such statements do not solve the problem; they seem like an attempt to avoid accountability,"" he added.This comes days after Yunus hinted that India may be behind efforts to “destabilise” Bangladesh.His press secretary quoted him as saying that there were “relentless efforts to destabilise Bangladesh,”both “internally and externally,” thereby leading to a “war-like situation.”Yunus reportedly told Mahmudur Rahman Manna leader of the Bangladeshi political party Nagorik Oikya, that Bangladesh was now in a major crisis due to Indian hegemony.“The Chief Adviser stated that the country is in a major crisis due to Indian hegemony… He started the discussion by saying that we are in a deep crisis. By crisis, he meant a conspiracy by India. He said India does not want to accept this change in our country at all. If they could, they would destroy us in a single day, and they are doing everything necessary to that end. That’s what he said… He believes the entire nation needs to remain united in response,”Manna said.Meanwhile, Jaiswal also said, ""Bangladesh needs to ascertain the will and mandate of the people by holding an inclusive, free, and fair election at an early date.""Earlier, Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam, quoted Yunus saying, ""With the banning of the Awami League, a new war-like situation has emerged — both inside and outside the country. The goal is to prevent our progress, to push the nation toward total collapse, and to drag us back into subjugation. Since the Awami League’s activities were banned, there have been relentless efforts to destabilise the situation. We must protect ourselves from this.”Yunus has claimed he plans to hold the elections between December 2025 and June 30, 2026.“Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus will not stay in power even a day after 30 June 2026,” said Mr Shafiqul Alam.He said Yunus urged everyone at the meeting to be confident that he would not do anything that would put the country in danger.“I felt confident as we all sat together. If I fail to hold a fair election, I will feel guilty,” Yunus was quoted as saying.Alam claimed that various party leaders heard Mr Yunus and reaffirmed their support for the interim government. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), currently the most powerful traditional political force in the country, however, wants the polls to be held by December this year and is uneasy over the continuation of the interim government, which has so far shown no urgency to conduct elections.","Mea spokesperson randhir jaiswal said that bangladesh's accusations were an attempt to deflect attention from real issues.

However, what he said about the surgical strike was factually incorrect,"" Surjewala told reporters.""The Congress party only corrected the record by pointing out that the surgical strike on Pakistan and also at other places on the den of terrorists were regularly executed during Congress-led UPA government to give a befitting reply to terrorists by our armed forces and the then Congress Government,"" he added when questioned on the war of words between some Congress leaders and Tharoor.Surjewala's statement comes as Tharoor faces criticism from party colleagues over his recent remarks on surgical strikes.Tharoor, currently leading a multi-party delegation to countries including Panama and the US, had said that India conducted its first cross-border surgical strike in 2016, a claim seen by many in the party as undermining similar operations during the UPA era.Facing flak from Congress leaders such as Pawan Khera and Udit Raj, Tharoor defended himself in a strongly worded post on X from Panama City, clarifying that his remarks specifically referred to responses to terrorist attacks—not to prior wars or conflicts.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.The controversy erupted after Tharoor reportedly stated in Panama that India breached the LoC ""for the first time"" during the 2016 surgical strike. This prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of denigrating Congress's legacy. ""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed LoC and International border?"" Raj questioned.He went so far as to suggest Tharoor be made a ""super spokesperson of the BJP.""Pawan Khera also weighed in, posting a screenshot from Tharoor’s book, where the MP had previously criticised the Modi government for politicizing the 2016 strikes while acknowledging that the Congress had authorised several such operations in the past without publicising them.“The shameless exploitation of the 2016 'surgical strikes'... as a party election tool—something the Congress had never done—marked a particularly disgraceful dilution of the principle that national security issues require discretion and non-partisanship,” Tharoor wrote at the time.Despite the public discord, the Congress leadership has now sought to downplay the fallout.

They also demean diplomatic strikes by referring to them as tours or travels. The way they have spoken about MPs like Kanimozhi, Supriya Sule, and Rajeev Rai is shameful.

BJP rallies around Tharoor as Congress targets him



Shashi Tharoor is facing internal heat within the Congress party, as his recent comments that India crossed the Line of Control (LoC) for the first time during the 2016 surgical strike on a terror base drew sharp reactions from his party colleagues.Tharoor, who is leading one of the 7 all-party delegations for global outreach of Operation Sindoor and to expose Pakistan post Pahalgam terror attack, stated that India crossed the LoC ""for the first time"" during the 2016 surgical strike.Tharoor said: ""When, for the first time, India breached the Line of Control between India and Pakistan to conduct a surgical strike on a terror base... that was already something we had not done before.""Now, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera has challenged these assertions by citing Tharoor's own 2018 book --'The Paradoxical Prime Minister'. In the book, Tharoor had criticised the BJP's ""shameless exploitation"" of the 2016 surgical strikes for electoral gains, explicitly mentioning that Congress had authorised several such operations during its tenure without politicising them.The excerpt from the book reads: ""The shameless exploitation of the 2016 'surgical strikes' along the Line of Control with Pakistan...as a party election tool – something the Congress had never had done despite having authorised several such strikes earlier.""""I agree with that Dr @ShashiTharoor who wrote about surgical strikes in his book in 2018 - ‘The Paradoxical Prime Minister'"" Khera said in a post on X.Facing backlash from party colleagues, Tharoor, earlier today, clarified his position, explaining that his comments specifically addressed retaliatory actions following terrorist attacks, not previous wars or military operations.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.His remarks on surgical strikes also prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of ""denigrating"" Congress's legacy.""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed LoC and International border?"" Raj questioned.""In 1965 Indian Army entered Pakistan at multiple points... In 1971, India tore Pakistan in two pieces, and during UPA government several surgical strikes were unleashed but drum beating was not done to encash (it) politically,"" he added.Tharoor's recent statements on India-Pakistan relations have notably diverged from the Congress party's official position, particularly regarding the government's handling of US President Trump's claims about mediating a ceasefire between the two nations.The BJP has rallied around opposition MP Shashi Tharoor as Congress continues its attack on former diplomat and Thiruvananthapuram MP.Union minister Kiren Rijiju took to X to condemn the grand old party, responding to Udit Raj’s criticism of Tharoor. Sharing a video, Rijiju questioned the party's priorities: “Congress ka haath kiske sath? Kya Congress party mein desh ke liye bolna mana hai?” he posted in Hindi.“We Indians must speak in one voice in crucial time at least,” he added.In another post, Rijiju intensified his criticism, “What does the Congress party want & how much they really care for the country? Should the Indian MPs go to foreign nation and speak against India and its Prime Minister? There’s limit to political desperation!”BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said, ""Shashi Tharoor is being attacked at the behest of Rahul Gandhi because Shashi Tharoor kept India first not (Gandhi) family. He talked about national interest, not his party’s interest.

NEW DELHI: Spiritual leader Jagadguru Rambhadracharya on Thursday revealed that he bestowed the Ram Mantra Diksha upon Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi, invoking the blessing once given to Lord Hanuman by Maa Sita before his conquest of Lanka. The Guru said he asked for a unique dakshina in return: “I want PoK back.”General Dwivedi visited the revered seer at his Chitrakoot Ashram on Wednesday during a tour that also included the inauguration of a state-of-the-art simulator machine at Sadguru Netra Chikitsalaya, a pioneering step in medical training for eye surgeries.“This machine allows doctors to practice surgical procedures virtually before operating on real patients. There are only 4–5 such machines in India, and this is the first one in Madhya Pradesh,” said a member of the Sadguru Sewa Centre, adding that the Army Chief also observed the functioning of the facility’s operation theatres.With 140 vision centres and an equal number of surgeons operating across the network, the centre also explored possibilities of collaboration with the armed forces to extend eye care services to personnel and veterans.The Army Chief’s visit comes days after his critical leadership role in Operation Sindoor , India’s retaliatory mission against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22.General Dwivedi, alongside Navy Chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi and Air Force Chief Marshal AP Singh, oversaw operations from the military command centre, featured in a booklet recently circulated among Indian Army personnel.India has since launched diplomatic efforts, sending multi-party MP-led delegations to key countries to underscore its zero-tolerance stance on terrorism and expose Pakistan’s role in cross-border attacks.",Spiritual leader jagadguru rambhadracharya bestowed the ram mantra diksha upon chief of army staff general upendra dwivedi.

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday once again rejected the Trump administration’s claim that US President Donald Trump brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan by offering trade incentives.Speaking in response to a recent filing by the Trump administration in a US court, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Regarding the court filing in the United States, I hope you have seen the court order as well. Our position on this particular issue that you mentioned has been well articulated. I would refer you to our position that was made clear on 13th of May.”He clarified that the military situation was discussed between Indian and US leaders from the launch of Operation Sindoor on May 7 until the ceasefire on May 10, but “the issue of trade or tariff did not come up in any of those discussions.”Jaiswal added, “External affairs minister (S Jaishankar) has also made clear that the secession of firing was decided upon through direct contacts between the DGMOs of India and Pakistan.”This follows a submission by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to the US Court of International Trade, in which he claimed, “India and Pakistan - two nuclear powers engaged in combat operations just 13 days ago - reached a tenuous ceasefire on May 10, 2025.This ceasefire was only achieved after President Trump interceded and offered both nations trading access with the United States to avert a full-scale war.”Lutnick argued that invalidating Trump’s use of emergency economic powers would undermine diplomacy, saying, “An adverse ruling that constrains presidential power in this case could lead India and Pakistan to question the validity of President Trump's offer, threatening the security of an entire region, and the lives of millions.”India has consistently maintained that no third-party involvement was part of the ceasefire decision. External affairs minister S Jaishankar had earlier dismissed the notion of US mediation.In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jaishankar said, “The cessation of firing was agreed between the military commanders of both sides through direct contact.” He added, “The morning before, we effectively hit and incapacitated Pakistan's main airbases and air defence system. So who should I thank for the cessation of hostilities? I thank the Indian military because it was the Indian military action that made Pakistan say: We are ready to stop. ”Also read: Jaishankar denies US role in ceasefire with Pakistan, says 'draw your conclusions' on China link Pushing back against claims that the situation risked nuclear escalation, Jaishankar said, “Very, very far away. I’m frankly astonished by your question.” He explained that India’s response targeted terrorist infrastructure with “measured, carefully considered and non-escalating steps,” and that firing only stopped “at their request.”Trump has repeatedly asserted that he helped resolve the conflict and said America offered to do “a lot of trade” with both nations to end the hostilities.
