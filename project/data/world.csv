NEW DELHI: India on Thursday strongly criticised Pakistan at the 58th Session of the UN human rights council, calling it a ""failed state that thrives on instability and survives on international handouts.""Indian diplomat Kshitij Tyagi delivered a scathing response, accusing Pakistan of spreading falsehoods and using the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) as a ""mouthpiece"" to push its agenda against India.""It is regrettable to see Pakistan's leaders and delegates continuing to spread falsehoods handed down by its military-terrorist complex. Pakistan is making a mockery of the OIC by abusing it as its mouthpiece. It is unfortunate that this Council's time continues to be wasted by a failed state which thrives on instability and survives on international handouts. Its rhetoric reeks of hypocrisy, its actions of inhumanity, and its governance of incompetence. India remains focused on democracy, progress, and ensuring dignity for its people. Values that Pakistan would do well to learn from,"" Tyagi said.Also read: 'Committed firmly to shield human rights,' EAM S Jaishankar tells UN Tyagi further lambasted Pakistan for its continued focus on Kashmir, saying that the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh would always remain an integral part of India. He pointed to the region's significant political, social, and economic progress in recent years, contrasting it with Pakistan’s internal turmoil.""The Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India. The unprecedented political, social, and economic progress in J&K in the past few years speaks for itself. These successes are a testament to the people's trust in the government's commitment to bring normalcy to a region scarred by decades of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism,"" he said.Highlighting Pakistan’s alleged human rights abuses and its harbouring of UN-sanctioned terrorists, Tyagi said, ""As a country where human rights abuses, persecution of minorities, and systematic erosion of democratic values constitute state policies, and which brazenly harbours UN-sanctioned terrorists, Pakistan is in no position to lecture anyone.""Tyagi's remarks were made in response to Pakistan's ""baseless and malicious references"" regarding Kashmir. He urged Islamabad to focus on addressing its internal governance failures rather than fixating on India.""Instead of its unhealthy obsession with India, Pakistan should focus on providing actual governance and justice to its own people,"" he said.His remarks echo India's consistent stance on the Kashmir issue .

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has laid down guidelines for constitutional courts to scrutinise the proportionality of punishment awarded to an errant member by a legislature, thus permitting judicial scrutiny of the penalty, breaking through a self-imposed restraint to extend its jurisdiction to a matter that has traditionally been considered the domain of legislatures.This verdict by Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh, delivered Tuesday, builds upon the apex court's ruling in Raja Ram Pal case (cash for query) in which a five-judge bench led by CJI Y K Sabharwal had analysed the powers, privileges and immunities of members and said that Parliament and assemblies had the power to expel its members for reasons in addition to the grounds laid down in the Constitution for their disqualification.Also read: 'Imposing life ban on convicted lawmakers solely in Parliament's domain,' Centre tells Supreme Court Upholding Parliament's decision to expel the MPs found guilty, the five-judge bench had said, ""The power of expulsion is not contrary to a democratic process.

If standards for judicial review of such matters as at hand are not yet determined, it is time to do so now.""Also read: SC quashes RJD MLC Sunil Kumar Singh’s expulsion for comments on Nitish Kumar The Justice Kant-led bench laid down guidelines for constitutional courts to apply the proportionality test in scrutinising the punishment awarded to a member by the legislature, thus formalising the contours of judicial scrutiny of the punishment and to determine whether it was excessive or disproportionate to his/her proven misconduct.Recognising the complexity of circumstances and situations inside the House leading to varied behaviour of ruling and opposition members, Justice Kant said, ""Determination of what constitutes a disproportionate measure is inherently complex and context-dependent.""""Such assessment requires a nuanced scrutiny of the specific circumstances surrounding each case.

"In Supreme Court, government opposes life ban on convicted netas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-supreme-court-government-opposes-life-ban-on-convicted-netas/articleshow/118587195.cms,"'Only Parl can decide if lifetime ban would be appropriate or not'

NEW DELHI: Opposing the plea that the six-year disqualification for convicted persons from contesting polls be turned into a lifelong ban, Centre has told Supreme Court that the present law was constitutionally sound and it should be left to Parliament to decide on amending the law and the judiciary should refrain from passing direction.In an affidavit filed in SC, the Centre argued that there was nothing wrong in imposing time-bound penalty as other grounds of disqualification - such as holding an office of profit, unsoundness of mind, insolvency and not being a citizen of India - were not permanent but time-bound and disqualification was tied to the existence of a supervening circumstance.According to Section 8 of Representation of the People Act, the period of disqualification kicks in six years from the date of conviction or in case of imprisonment, six years from the date of release.Challenging the provision, advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, now with BJP, filed a petition seeking SC's direction to do away with time-bound penalty and bar a convicted person for life from contesting MP/MLA election, forming political party or becoming office-bearer of a political party.Disputing the contention, the Centre said, ""Disqualifications made under the impugned sections are limited by time as a matter of parliamentary policy and it would not be appropriate to substitute the petitioner's understanding of the issue and impose a lifetime ban. As a matter of judicial review, the court can declare the provisions to be unconstitutional and declare them to be inoperative, however, the relief that he is seeking amounts to rewriting of the provision as it effectively seeks to read 'lifelong' instead of 'six years' in all sub-sections of Section 8 of the Act.""The govt said whether a lifetime ban would be appropriate or not was a question that was solely within the domain of Parliament. ""Numerous laws provide for penalties limited by time, in the same manner as in the impugned Act. It is submitted that this is in line with well-established principles governing penal law. By confining the operation of the penalty to an appropriate length of time, deterrence is ensured while undue harshness is avoided,"" the affidavit said.""The issues raised by the petitioner have wide-ranging ramifications and clearly fall within the legislative policy of Parliament and the contours of judicial review would be suitably altered in such regard. SC has held that legislative choice over one option or the other cannot be questioned in courts over its efficacy or otherwise,"" it added. ""A lifetime disqualification is the maximum that can be imposed under the provisions and to impose such a disqualification is certainly within the power of Parliament.""The prayer of the petitioner amounts to rewriting of the statute or directing Parliament to frame a law in a particular manner which is wholly beyond the powers of judicial review. It is trite law that courts cannot direct Parliament to make a law or to legislate in a particular way,"" the affidavit said.","'only parl can decide if lifetime ban would be appropriate or not' says centre in affidavit.

What Canada’s potential exit from Five Eyes means for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-canadas-potential-exit-from-five-eyes-means-for-india/articleshow/118582864.cms,"Driving the news

According to a Financial Times report, a proposal by Peter Navarro, a senior adviser to US President Donald Trump , to remove Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and intelligence circles. The Five Eyes alliance—comprising the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—has been a cornerstone of Western intelligence cooperation since World War II.

, to remove Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and intelligence circles. The Five Eyes alliance—comprising the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—has been a cornerstone of Western intelligence cooperation since World War II. The move comes at a time when Trump has openly derided Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, repeatedly referring to him as ‘governor Trudeau’ in a veiled assertion of US dominance over its closest ally. Trump’s vision for Canada—jokingly or not—as America’s “51st state” has intensified with economic pressure, including a fresh wave of 25% tariffs on Canadian imports, set to take effect in March 2025.

Navarro has denied the report, calling it ""crazy stuff,"" but the idea is consistent with Trump’s America First approach, which has often questioned traditional alliances. While it remains uncertain whether this proposal will gain traction within the Trump administration, the implications are significant—not just for Canada but also for India, a country with growing intelligence ties to Five Eyes members.

Cracks in the Five Eyes?

For nearly 80 years, the Five Eyes alliance has been the gold standard for intelligence-sharing among Western nations. Born out of World War II codebreaking cooperation between the US and the UK, the alliance has grown into a sophisticated network coordinating signals intelligence (SIGINT), counterterrorism efforts, and geopolitical monitoring. Expelling Canada—a founding member—would mark an unprecedented rupture, one that intelligence officials warn could embolden adversaries like China and Russia.

“Sitting where I’m sitting and looking at the array of threats that are coming at us, we need all the partners we can get,” a Five Eyes intelligence official told the FT.

Former CIA official Dennis Wilder echoed the sentiment, describing the Five Eyes as “by far the most successful intelligence-sharing arrangement in world history.” Disrupting it, he warned, would be “met with cheers from Moscow, Beijing, Tehran, and Pyongyang.”

Yet, within Trump’s MAGA movement, skepticism toward America’s traditional allies is growing. The Trump administration has frequently accused Canada of taking advantage of the US economically and politically, positioning Ottawa as a target for policy changes that reflect Trump’s aggressive trade and national security priorities.

Between the lines

India’s calculus

For India, this shift in US foreign policy presents a mixed bag. On one hand, a weakened Five Eyes could mean less coordination on global intelligence matters, reducing the quality of intelligence India receives. On the other hand, a sidelined Canada might be forced to recalibrate its diplomatic approach towards India.

Canada has used intelligence from Five Eyes in its accusations against India, most notably in the case of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Khalistani terrorist killed in Canada in 2023. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly cited Five Eyes intelligence when accusing India of involvement in the killing—claims New Delhi has vehemently denied. If Canada were removed from the alliance, its access to such intelligence could be curtailed.

, a Khalistani terrorist killed in Canada in 2023. Canadian Prime Minister publicly cited Five Eyes intelligence when accusing India of involvement in the killing—claims New Delhi has vehemently denied. If Canada were removed from the alliance, its access to such intelligence could be curtailed. From India’s perspective, this could be beneficial. The Five Eyes framework has allowed Canada to access intelligence that it might not be able to gather independently. Without Five Eyes support, Ottawa may find it harder to substantiate allegations against India in future diplomatic disputes. This could lead to a reduction in tensions and a potential recalibration of India-Canada relations, especially after Trudeau steps down on March 9, 2025.

Final thoughts

The proposal to remove Canada from Five Eyes is more than just a bureaucratic reshuffling—it represents a fundamental shift in the way alliances are structured under Trump’s vision of US foreign policy.

The move signals a more transactional US approach to alliances, one that prioritizes short-term leverage over long-term strategic cooperation. If intelligence-sharing becomes a tool for economic and political coercion, many other countries may need to rethink their reliance on US-led security frameworks.

The US is by far the largest contributor to Five Eyes intelligence, and any fragmentation within the alliance could undermine coordinated intelligence efforts on issues like cyber threats, counterterrorism, and China’s military movements in the Indo-Pacific.

There are risks for India as well. A weakened Five Eyes could mean less effective intelligence cooperation between India and its key partners like the US and UK. New Delhi has been working toward closer intelligence collaboration with Five Eyes members, with discussions in recent years about potentially expanding the alliance to include India, Japan, and South Korea. If Five Eyes fractures, it could derail these efforts and weaken India’s intelligence-gathering capabilities.

In the Trump era of shifting alliances and growing geopolitical tensions, the intelligence-sharing framework of the Five Eyes is facing a seismic challenge.This proposal is not an isolated event but part of Trump’s broader strategy to reshape global alliances based on ideological alignment with his nationalist agenda. The Five Eyes network has been the backbone of Western intelligence for decades, facilitating deep cooperation on signals intelligence (SIGINT), counterterrorism, and cyber threats.However, Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement has been increasingly skeptical of traditional alliances, particularly those with nations governed by left-leaning leaders. JD Vance, Trump’s vice president, has called Britain “the world’s first truly Islamist country” due to its growing Muslim population, raising further concerns about the administration’s willingness to work with historically close partners. Meanwhile, Australia and New Zealand—both under left-leaning governments—have also seen their strategic importance questioned by Trump’s allies.(With inputs from agencies)","A proposal by peter navarro, a senior adviser to us president donald trump, to remove canada from the five eyes intelligence-sharing alliance has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and intelligence circles.

NEW DELHI: The Sino-Indian ties are set for a reboot, following the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan last year and the subsequent visits to Beijing by NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri that resulted in a series of “common understandings on the boundary question and practical cooperation”, said Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong Tuesday.The remarks followed the recent meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Wang Yi in which the former had lauded cooperation between the 2 countries on multilateral forums, particularly the G20. Doval had visited China in December for talks between the Special Representatives that took place after a gap of 5 years. This was followed by Misri’s visit to China during which India and China agreed to resume Kailash Mansarovar Yatra , trans-border river cooperation and, in principle, direct air services.“Since the meeting between President Xi Jinping and PM Modi in Kazan last year, the 2 sides have earnestly implemented the important consensus reached by the two leaders, engaged in active interactions at various levels, and reached many common understandings on improving bilateral relations,’’ said Xu, interacting with journalists on the margins the 3rd China-India Youth Dialogue. Calling India-China relationship one of the most important in the world, the ambassador said that the 2 countries are promoting positive changes in the international balance of power.For the first time in 5 years, Modi and Xi had met in Russia in October 2024 on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, days after the 2 countries reached an agreement to complete the military disengagement process in eastern Ladakh. India, however, wants to tread cautiously in normalising ties with China and, in his meeting with Wang last week, Jaishankar stressed the importance of restoring mutual trust in bilateral ties and jointly maintaining border peace.Calling for respecting each other’s core interests, Xu said that Xi and Modi had agreed to handle relations from a long-term perspective, prevent “specific disagreements” from affecting the overall relationship, enhance strategic mutual trust and ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas.China will host the SCO summit later this year and expects Modi to participate. Appreciating India’s contribution to the Eurasian bloc, Xu said China is willing to work with India to host a “friendly, united and fruitful” summit. China holds the rotating presidency of SCO this year.According to the ambassador, the recent high-level engagements had created an important opportunity for the “reboot of China-India relations and provided a broader platform for exchanges and cooperation between the youth of our 2 countries”.","The modi-xi meeting in kazan last year and the subsequent visits to beijing by nsa ajit doval and foreign secretary vikram misri resulted in a series of “common understandings on the boundary question and practical cooperation’, said chinese ambassador xu feihong tuesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118567866,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1050506,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Anna Horford: More Than Just an NBA Star’s Sister

If you thought NBA drama was wild, wait until you hear about the latest feud between Anna Horford and two of the biggest names in politics and business—Donald Trump and Elon Musk . The outspoken sister of Boston Celtics veteran Al Horford is known for never holding back on social media, and this time, she’s got her sights set on the 2024 president and his billionaire ally.While Al Horford is making his mark on the court, Anna has built her own platform off of it. With a strong social media presence, she’s carved out a reputation for her unfiltered takes on sports, pop culture, and, most notably, politics. And if there’s one thing she’s made crystal clear over the years, it’s that she’s no fan of Donald Trump or his policies.On Tuesday, Anna once again took aim at the former president—who reclaimed the White House in 2024—and his new right-hand man, Elon Musk. This time, her criticism was aimed at their latest government initiative, and she didn’t hold back.When Trump returned to office, one of his first moves was appointing Tesla CEO Elon Musk as the head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The goal? To cut unnecessary spending and streamline government operations. However, since its inception, the program has faced widespread scrutiny for its aggressive budget cuts—especially in the federal workforce.Anna Horford wasn’t about to let this slide. She took to her Instagram story to share a report revealing that, despite Musk and Trump’s promises, DOGE isn’t actually expected to save any money. With her signature bluntness, she added her own commentary:“It’s almost like Elon Musk & Trump have no f*cking clue what they’re doing. Huh…”That wasn’t Anna’s only dig of the day. She also shared another post that made scathing accusations about Trump’s personal hygiene—because, apparently, no topic is off-limits when it comes to her critiques. Meanwhile, as Anna roasts Trump and Musk online, her brother Al Horford is chasing his second NBA title with the Celtics. At 38, he remains a key piece of Boston’s championship aspirations.ALSO READ: Denver Nuggets Star Aaron Gordon Bares It All in Eyebrow Raising in New Underwear Campaign Trump, of course, is no stranger to reality TV feuds, after all, he spent years hosting ""The Apprentice"" before entering politics.

Elon Musk’s connection to Canada and his response

A petition demanding the revocation of Elon Musk 's Canadian citizenship has rapidly gained traction, with hundreds of thousands of Canadians signing in just a few days. The petition, launched on February 20, 2025, accuses Musk of acting against Canada’s national interests and allegedly influencing its elections. The controversy emerges against a backdrop of rising tensions between the US and Canada, particularly after former US President Donald Trump’s recent return to politics and his provocative statements regarding Canada’s sovereignty.Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, was born in South Africa and holds both Canadian and US citizenship. His Canadian citizenship, granted through his mother’s birth in Saskatchewan, has now come under public scrutiny. The petition, despite being largely symbolic and lacking direct legal consequences, reflects a broader public outcry against Musk’s political influence and recent statements regarding Canada. As signatures continue to mount, the movement has sparked a wider debate on national identity, foreign influence, and citizenship laws.The petition, which has amassed over 250,000 signatures within days, was started by a British Columbia-based author and is endorsed by Member of Parliament (MP) Charlie Angus from the New Democratic Party (NDP). The document claims that Musk has ""used his wealth and power to influence Canadian elections"" and has allegedly aligned himself with a foreign government that threatens Canadian sovereignty.This comes in the wake of Donald Trump’s return to political prominence, where he repeatedly suggested that Canada could become the 51st US state. The former president has also proposed economic tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and other goods, further escalating tensions between the two nations.Musk, who has previously voiced support for Trump’s hardline immigration policies, has now become a target of public backlash in Canada. His response to the petition was a controversial post on X (formerly Twitter), stating,The post was later deleted, but it fueled further outrage among Canadian citizens.Under Canadian law, citizenship can only be revoked under specific circumstances, primarily if an individual:Since Musk acquired his Canadian citizenship through his mother’s birth in Saskatchewan, there is no known legal basis for revoking it under the current framework. Even if the petition reaches its goal, it remains a symbolic gesture with no immediate legal force.However, under Canada’s parliamentary petition system, any petition with at least 500 signatures and an MP’s sponsorship typically receives a government response. Given that the country may head into a spring election, it remains uncertain whether the petition will be formally addressed.The petition and Musk’s comments have surfaced at a time of increasing geopolitical strain between Canada and the US. Since Trump’s return to the political scene, he has:Beyond government disputes, public sentiment has also shifted, with:MP Charlie Angus, who sponsored the petition, has been an outspoken critic of Musk’s growing political and economic influence. However, Angus has also announced that he will not seek re-election, raising questions about the long-term impact of his endorsement.The BBC has reached out to Angus' office for an official statement, but no response has been issued so far.Elon Musk’s ties to Canada date back to his early years as a young immigrant. He moved to Canada from South Africa at the age of 18, working odd jobs before enrolling at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. Eventually, he immigrated to the United States, where he later became a naturalized US citizen in 2002.In response to accusations of working illegally in the US on a student visa, Musk has denied any wrongdoing, stating that he did not violate immigration laws. However, his strong political ties with the US—and support for Trump’s policies—have made him a controversial figure in Canada.In a recent interview, Steve Bannon, a former Trump advisor, criticized Musk, calling him a “parasitic illegal immigrant”. Musk has dismissed these claims, but the public debate over his citizenship status continues to escalate.","Elon musk, the billionaire ceo of tesla and spacex, was born in south africa and holds both canadian and us citizenship.

Social and Ethical Considerations:

In the United States, the term ""Green Card"" refers to the Permanent Resident Card, a well-established document granting individuals lawful permanent residency. Recently, President Donald Trump introduced a proposal for a ""Gold Card"", a new visa program aimed at affluent foreign investors. This initiative is designed to replace the existing EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program . This analysis delves into the distinctions between the traditional Green Card and the proposed Gold Card, examining their eligibility criteria, benefits, and potential implications.A Green Card allows non-US citizens to live and work permanently in the United States. Holders can eventually apply for US citizenship, provided they meet certain residency and legal requirements.On February 25, 2025, President Trump announced the ""Gold Card"" visa program, targeting wealthy foreign investors willing to contribute $5 million to the US economy. This initiative aims to attract affluent individuals who can stimulate economic growth and job creation.The Gold Card is designed to replace the EB-5 program, which has faced criticism for being ""full of nonsense, make-believe, and fraud,"" according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. By increasing the investment threshold and streamlining the process, the administration aims to attract high-caliber investors and reduce potential abuses.The administration anticipates that the Gold Card program could attract up to a million investors, potentially generating $5 trillion in revenue. These funds could play a significant role in reducing the national debt and stimulating economic growth.Implementing the Gold Card program may face legal hurdles, as changes to immigration laws typically require Congressional approval. The administration asserts that the program can proceed without new legislation, but this stance may be contested.The introduction of a pay-to-immigrate system raises questions about equity and the values underpinning US immigration policy. While the program aims to attract individuals who can contribute economically, it may be perceived as favouring the wealthy over other deserving immigrants.","A green card allows non-us citizens to live and work permanently in the united states.

Red Wings shed Ville Husso’s contract, creating financial flexibility

The Detroit Red Wings traded Ville Husso to the Anaheim Ducks , clearing $3.6 million in cap space. The move, seen as one-sided, benefits Detroit while puzzling fans about Anaheim’s motives.

With no clear benefit to Anaheim, the trade appears one-sided, helping Detroit clear $3.6 million in cap space.The 30-year-old goaltender struggled in the NHL this season, posting a 3.69 goals-against average and an .866 save percentage, though he performed better in the AHL.

Donald Trump plays gold card to US citizenship to entice the world's wealthy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-plays-gold-card-to-us-citizenship-to-entice-the-worlds-wealthy/articleshow/118580773.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Wealthy people around the world can potentially buy their way to an American citizenship for $ 5 million (approx Rs 44 cr) per head under a ""Gold Card"" program US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday.In a move that he hoped would generate a windfall for the US economy, Trump indicated the Gold Card would be a premium version of a Green Card, which currently gives permanent residency in the US to eligible foreigners, and it would replace the EB-5 visa program, under which foreigners are eligible to apply for Green Card if they invest around $ 1 million in the US.""We're gonna be selling a gold card. You have a green card, this is a gold card. We're gonna be putting a price on that card of about $5 million and that's gonna give you green card privileges plus...,"" Trump said at a White House presser, providing sketchy details. ""It's gonna be a route to citizenship. And wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card,"" he added.The US President did not reveal when exactly the program would come into effect, but said there would be vetting involved in the process. He also suggested the scheme could be kicked off with executive action from his office although visa categories and citizenship pathways are the domain of the Congress and requires legislative approval.Many countries around the world, notably some Caribbean nations, have similar programs for much less investment. St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda all have programs that offer direct citizenship for investments ranging from $ 200,000 (Rs 1.75 cr) to $ 400,000 (Rs 3.4 cr), as do Turkey, Jordan, and Egypt.While all these countries have specific requirements for job creation or economic contribution, as does the US EB-5 visa, Trump's blandishment was thin on details. ""They'll be wealthy and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,"" he said.Concern rippled across the political spectrum that the scheme could simply sell US citizenship to high-rollers and those looking to park illicit money. ""Would a Russian oligarch be eligible for a gold card?"" one reporter asked Trump snarkily. ""Yeah, possibly. Hey. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people,"" the President clapped back.There was also disquiet in immigrant communities stuck in the so-called Green Card limbo, including more than a million Indians, who fear that their merit-based exertions to gain green cards and citizenship, which already has a waiting time of decades, would be sidelined by uber-wealthy elitists who are fast tracked for $ 5 million.But Trump supporters are already toting up the takings and how it would help wipe out the US debt. ""If just 200 rich people take this, that's $1 BILLION,"" one MAGA minion exulted on social media, while another calculated that at $5 Million per Card, 7 million Gold Card immigrants could pay off the national debt that now tops $ 36 trillion.By all accounts, that is a very long shot. The EB-5 program currently caps visas at 10,000 annually and even that limit is rarely crossed.","Us president donald trump announced a 'gold card' program on tuesday.

The child had been hospitalized in Lubbock before passing away, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Lubbock health officials confirmed the death but did not provide further details.According to ABC7, the outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 124 confirmed cases across nine counties, making it the state’s largest measles outbreak in nearly 30 years. There are also nine reported cases in eastern New Mexico. The majority of cases involve children between the ages of 5 and 17. Texas health department data indicates that most cases have occurred among people younger than 18, particularly in an ""undervaccinated"" Mennonite community where many children attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled.CNN reported that all 18 people hospitalised so far in the outbreak were unvaccinated. While Robert F Kennedy Jr., the US Health and Human Services secretary, initially stated there had been two measles-related deaths, Texas health officials confirmed that only one had occurred. Kennedy also said during a cabinet meeting that hospitalizations were “mainly for quarantine,” but Dr Lara Johnson, chief medical officer of Covenant Health Lubbock Service Area, refuted that claim. “We don’t hospitalize patients for quarantine purposes,” she said. “We admit patients who need acute supportive treatment in our hospital.”Measles, a highly contagious airborne disease, can cause severe complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling, blindness, and death. According to the CDC, ""Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed."" Dr Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist with UTHealth Houston, stated, “These outbreaks last between two to six months. That’s a long time. That’s a lot of kids infected … death is rare, but tragic when it happens.”Vaccination rates in the affected counties remain low. ABC7 reported that nearly 14% of school-aged children in Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, have opted out of at least one required vaccine. CNN highlighted that nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in Gaines County did not receive the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in the 2023-24 school year. Free vaccination clinics have been set up in Lubbock, but only about 70 doses have been administered so far.Experts warn that the outbreak is likely to continue. “I very rarely say I’m 100% sure of something, but I am 100% sure we will see an increase in cases,” said Troisi. Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, noted that cases may be undercounted and expressed concern about potential further spread at upcoming public events.

A wildfire in northern Japan has damaged over 80 buildings and forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents, with military helicopters mobilised to help put it out, authorities said Thursday.Aerial footage from public broadcaster NHK showed the bright blaze reducing several houses to charred frames in forested areas of Ofunato in the region of Iwate.Nearly 600 nearby residents have been evacuated, according to the local municipality, with no injuries confirmed so far.As of Thursday morning, city officials estimated that at least 84 buildings had been damaged by the fire, which the Self-Defence Forces were trying to extinguish from the sky.Ofunato's mayor Kiyoshi Fuchigami described the fire as ""large-scale"" on Wednesday evening, saying around 600 hectares (1,500 acres) of land -- three times the size of Monaco -- had been burned.The cause of the blaze remained unknown, he added.There were about 1,300 wildfires across Japan in 2023, concentrated in the February to April period when the air dries out and winds pick up.In the case of the latest Iwate fire, ""strong wind"" from the west helped spread a series of smaller wildfires in the same area, Fuchigami said.One evacuee, a 45-year-old woman, told NHK that the fire had been approaching her house when she returned from work.""I was relieved that my kids were safe,"" she said.Another, a 32-year-old man, told the broadcaster it was ""my first time to see a series of fires happen in such rapid succession"".","A wildfire in northern japan has damaged over 80 buildings and forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents.

Trump plans EU tariffs

US President Donald Trump held his first cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday. The meeting turned into a long question-and-answer session with reporters, lasting more than an hour.Trump sat with his cabinet and Elon Musk, who was wearing a ""tech support"" T-shirt. He spoke on various topics, including government spending, immigration, the economy, and the war in Ukraine.Here are some key takeaways from Donald Trump's first Cabinet meeting:Wearing a black ""Make America Great Again"" cap, Elon Musk was among the first advisers to speak at the cabinet meeting.His comments came shortly after an administration memo instructed federal departments and agencies to prepare for workforce reductions. The federal government has more than 2 million employees, many of whom are nonpartisan civil servants.Musk downplayed DOGE’s role in government, explaining that its main focus is updating government technology.On his first day back in office, Trump replaced the US Digital Service with DOGE, transferring its employees to the new department.“I actually just call myself humble tech support here because, as crazy as it sounds, that is almost a literal description of the work that the DOGE team is doing: helping to fix the government computer systems,” Musk said.When asked which government department or cabinet members were the most resistant to his policy changes, Trump said, ""So far, I'm happy with all of those choices.""He acknowledged that some groups are more cooperative than others. He specifically praised Elon Musk, who is not a cabinet member, and secretary of state Marco Rubio.Trump said his administration is working on reducing the size of the government. ""We want to have a balanced budget within a reasonably short period of time... meaning maybe by next year or maybe the year after,"" he said.Trump confirmed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit the White House on Friday.He said the US and Ukraine will sign a minerals deal, though details are unclear. He described it as a way for the US to ""get our money back"" from the aid given to Ukraine since Russia's invasion.""We're going to get a lot of money in the future, and I think that's appropriate, because we have taxpayers that shouldn't be footing the bill,"" Trump said. ""It's all been worked out.""Zelensky has called the deal preliminary and said he wants further agreements, including security guarantees.When asked about providing security guarantees, Trump said the US would not do so, arguing that Europe should take on that responsibility.Trump supported Elon Musk and the department of government efficiency (DOGE), which is responsible for cutting government spending and reducing the federal workforce.He dismissed speculation about any disagreements between Musk and other cabinet members. ""They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this, and some disagree a little bit,"" he said.

A group of federal workers marched through the US Senate, to protest massive job cuts ordered by billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday.The demonstrators visited multiple Republican senators, urging them to take action against the workforce reductions, while security personnel followed closely, warning them not to obstruct the halls, reported news agency AFP.President Donald Trump’s second term has brought sweeping executive orders targeting federal agencies including USAID. Musk, who is spearheading the downsizing, has left many career civil servants uncertain about their futures. Unlike the large-scale protests of Trump’s first term, opposition this time has started with federal employees themselves.Some employees have resigned instead of accepting Musk’s drastic changes. This week, about a third of technology workers at Musk’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) quit, claiming the restructuring would harm national security. Before leaving, they created a website called “We are the builders” to highlight the damage caused by the cuts.Protesters have adopted the spoon as a symbol of resistance. This comes from a Musk-led initiative called “Fork in the road,” which gave federal workers a choice: leave with eight months’ pay or risk future dismissal. Employees flooded internal message boards with spoon emojis and added them to their work profiles as a silent act of defiance.Several lawsuits have been filed against Musk’s actions, with mixed outcomes. The largest federal employee union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), has vowed to fight what it calls “unlawful terminations.”Musk, however, remains unfazed. He has used his social media platform, X, to mock federal workers and promote polls conducted by his own political group, America PAC, claiming that DOGE is widely supported.","Federal workers marched through the us senate, to protest massive job cuts ordered by billionaire elon musk.
