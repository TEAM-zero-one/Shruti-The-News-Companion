'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

New Delhi: Supreme Court has expressed reluctance to accede to requests from SC Bar Association president Vikas Singh and solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against advocate Rakesh Kishore for attempting to hurl a shoe at CJI B R Gavai, and restrain social media from glorifying the incident.Though the attorney general has granted consent to initiating contempt actions, as is statutorily required, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi Thursday appeared to be wary of the possibility of contempt proceedings providing fresh fodder to those justifying his action.The mentioning was jointly made by Vikas Singh and other SCBA office bearers along with Mehta, who informed the bench that as per the requirement under Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, AG R Venkataramani has granted consent for initiation of contempt proceedings against Kishore for his act, which grossly undermined institutional dignity and interfered with administration of justice.Singh said Kishore is being projected as a hero in a section of social media, which may encourage others to indulge in such reprehensible acts. The SG said SC must consider passing a John Doe order restraining all social media channels from glorifying the incident.Justice Kant said, “There will be multiple problems. SC as an institution has over the decades zealously protected the right to free speech. But we are also of the view that the right to free speech cannot be at the cost of the dignity and reputation of others.How to deal with these competing issues is the question. A John Doe order will trigger the next wave of derogatory comments.”Justices Kant and Bagchi said the CJI had magnanimously ignored the incident and appealed to everyone to follow suit. “The institution never gets affected by such incidents. It is our acts and behaviour which determine our dignity and respect. It is in that spirit that the CJI had brushed aside the incident as an irresponsible act of a citizen.”An unrepentant Kishore had claimed he had hurled the shoe to protest CJI's alleged remarks on the decapitated Vishnu idol at Khajuraho.The bench, on repeated pleas to initiate contempt proceedings, said, “Our request to you is to consider whether taking up the contempt plea would give fresh winds to intensify the contemptuous chirping in social media. Moreover, when we are already burdened with a heavy caseload, should we waste judicial time on such issues?”Mehta said the algorithm of social media is such that an incident like the present one gets amplified to monetise the content for the maker. Justice Bagchi said, “The algorithm is so programmed that the contents which appeal to the baser instincts of people go viral. Mere mentioning for initiation of contempt proceedings would go viral and monetise the makers. Let it die its natural death.”Justice Kant said, “The incident is to be treated with the contempt it deserves.”",Justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi appeared to be wary of the possibility of contempt proceedings providing fresh fodder to those justifying his action.

Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold prices are currently trading around the ₹1,27,000 mark, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the international front, COMEX gold is comfortably holding above the $4,000 level, further reinforcing the positive trend. This price behaviour indicates that gold is consistently forming higher lows, which is a classic sign of strength in technical analysis. The ability to protect previous support levels suggests that buyers are active at lower levels, absorbing selling pressure and preparing for potential upside moves.From a short-term trading perspective, gold prices have the potential to move towards the ₹1,30,000 level if the current momentum continues. Traders can consider accumulating positions near the ₹1,26,000 support zone, where buying interest has previously emerged. A strong support base is seen at ₹1,23,500, and any dip toward this level may offer a good risk-reward entry for bullish positions.Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary concerns, and a weak global economic outlook, gold remains a preferred safe-haven asset.These factors are likely to keep demand strong and prices buoyant in the near term. As long as prices sustain above the key support levels, the outlook for gold remains optimistic with further upside potential.MCX Silver has shown significant strength and has outperformed MCX Gold in recent sessions, currently trading around ₹1,60,000 levels. This rally reflects robust bullish sentiment driven by a combination of industrial demand, investment interest, and a positive technical setup. Silver's strong price action suggests that market participants are confident in its upside potential, especially as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a clear sign of an ongoing uptrend.Compared to gold, silver tends to exhibit more volatility, which can offer attractive trading opportunities. Any corrective move or dip toward the ₹1,57,000 level can be seen as a buying opportunity, supported by strong demand and momentum. On the upside, prices have the potential to move toward ₹1,63,000 in the near term. Traders should maintain a stop-loss at ₹1,54,000 to manage risk effectively in case of unexpected price reversals.Silver's dual role as both a precious and industrial metal makes it a favored asset in times of economic uncertainty, as well as during periods of industrial recovery. With favorable fundamentals and technical strength, silver remains well-positioned for further gains, and buying on dips strategy could prove rewarding in the current market environment.","Gold and silver prices are exhibiting strong bullish momentum.

As an Indian company, we are deeply committed to supporting the nation’s energy security and fostering economic growth.""""We categorically state that this unilateral move by the European Union is founded on baseless assertions, representing an undue extension of authority that ignores both international law and the sovereignty of India,"" it added.The UK said its latest measures also directly target Russia's oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, which together export about 3.1 million barrels per day.The FCDO noted that Rosneft alone accounts for nearly half of Russia’s oil production and around six per cent of global supply.","The uk government announced 90 new sanctions on wednesday, targeting russia’s oil exports and entities linked to its energy trade.

‘Modi loves Trump... he is a great leader’, says US president

WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed he was assured by PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday that New Delhi was tapering its purchase of Russian oil to help stop the Russia-Ukraine war, but the external affairs ministry in Delhi denied knowledge of any such conversation.In Washington, in his customary freewheeling banter with pool reporters in the White House, Trump indicated that India’s pledge was conveyed through the new US ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, who was present in the Oval Office to brief the president about his meeting with Modi and India’s ministry of external affairs (MEA) earlier this week in New Delhi.“He’s assured me, there will be no oil purchase from Russia. I don’t know. Maybe that’s a breaking story. Can I say that? Would you say there will be no oil?” Trump said, waving towards Gor, and adding, “He’s not buying his oil from Russia.”New Delhi responded with a carefully worded statement that “it has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario” and that it is broad-basing its energy sourcing. While there was no explicit denial by India of Trump’s claim, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal did say that he wasn’t aware of any conversation between Modi and Trump on Wednesday.India also didn’t confirm if there was any discussion on this issue when the leaders last spoke, on October 9.India also didn’t confirm if there was any discussion on this issue when the leaders last spoke, on October 9. The MEA statement didn’t directly refer to Trump’s remarks and the ministry said it was responding to media queries on comments on India’s energy sourcing. India’s response also underscored the fact that as far as the US is concerned, India has for years sought to expand its energy procurement. “This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current government has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India. Discussions are ongoing,” said the official.Trump also conceded that India’s oil purchases may not stop immediately. “It started... It’s a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,” he said, adding that he would also try and get China to stop buying Russian oil in an effort to stop the war. Once this oil revenue spigot for Moscow is turned off and war is over, Trump indicated India could go back to purchasing Russian oil.His hypothesis that Moscow would end the war if it does not get oil revenues from India and China is among the reasons holding up a trade deal between Washington and New Delhi. Both sides are said to be close to an agreement, with India indicating it is open to stepping up US energy purchases even as it draws down on buying Russian oil, although officials privately fumethe Trump’s performative public diplomacy tends to queer the pitch.Trump called Modi a “great man” and India “an incredible country”, and claimed that “he (Modi) loves Trump”. “Now, I don’t know if the word love… I don’t want you to take that any different... I don’t want to destroy his political career, but you have to understand… I’ve watched India for years... every single year you’d have a new leader. I mean, some would be in there for a few months, and this was year after year after year. And my friend has been there now for a long time, and he is, and he’s assured me, there will be no oil purchase from Russia,” the US president said.","Us president donald trump claimed he was assured by pm narendra modi on wednesday that new delhi was tapering its purchase of russian oil.

Fantastic Opportunity For Both: British Chambers of Commerce Hails UK-India Trade Deal as 'Win-Win'

The Indian Army on Wednesday signed the agreement with UK-based Thales group for the procurement of the Light Weight Modular Missile (LMM) system to significantly boost its air defence architecture and strengthen its air capabilities.Thales will manufacture the missiles and launchers at Belfast, Northern Ireland, before delivering them to the Indian Army.The contract follows days after India-UK defence initiatives unveiled during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to India.In a joint statement, the Centre said the deal will further support India’s air defence capabilities and, in the spirit of ' Atmanirbhar Bharat', meet current and future requirements of the Indian Ministry of Defence while fostering long-term collaboration on complex weapons between the two countries.British defence secretary John Healey had said, ""The defence deals announced today show how our growing strategic partnership with India will boost UK business and jobs. I am hopeful this will pave the way for a deeper relationship between our two defence industries, particularly in the development of electric engines for naval ships and in air defence"" he added.The LMM is a lightweight, man-portable missile system that can be deployed in operational areas, including high-altitude regions, the Indian Army said.The missile operates on a laser beam riding guidance system, allowing precision strikes with minimal collateral damage. Equipped with a triple-effect warhead and proximity fuse, it is effective against aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, and UCAVs, including low-infrared signature targets, at ranges beyond 6 km in all-weather conditions.Weighing just 13 kg, the LMM is a supersonic weapon with speeds above Mach 1.5. Its advanced sighting system and high-explosive warhead give it a high single-shot kill probability. The system is optimised for air, land, and naval deployments, enabling rapid response against drones, light aircraft, and helicopters near borders or frontline positions, reported news agency ANI.",The indian army on wednesday signed the agreement with uk-based thales group for the procurement of the light weight modular missile.

NEW DELHI: Aggrieved by the preliminary inquiry into the June 12 AI 171 Ahmedabad crash which indirectly put the blame on the pilot, the father of the pilot in command of that flight and the Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) have moved Supreme Court Their plea: The apex court order an independent investigation by a panel of aviation experts headed by a retired Supreme Court judge that takes into account all possible causes that could have led to the crash. Pushkaraj Sabharwal, 91, and FIP have contended that the preliminary investigation into the crash is ""profoundly flawed”. And they say the probe team is predominantly focusing on the pilots, who can no longer defend themselves.Pushkaraj Sabharwal had earlier written to aviation authorities also to express his anger at the preliminary report of Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) had “tarnished” his son Captain Sumeet Sabharwal's reputation. First leaks in the US media and then the AAIB report released within a month of the probe had, some directly & others indirectly, blamed a pilot for switching off the engines’ fuel supply.Government, on its part, says the investigation is fair and unbiased.The plea in Supreme Court says: “The current approach of the investigation has resulted in a failure to adequately examine, or rule out, other more plausible technical and procedural factors… The petitioners emphasise that factual misdirection through selective disclosure, especially against crew who cannot defend themselves, impedes root cause discovery and threatens future flight safety-calling for a neutral judicial lens. ”Questioning the composition of the five-member probe panel, it says: “The team is dominated by officers from DGCA, the State aviation authorities whose procedures, oversight, and possible lapses are directly implicated in the investigation. Moreover, the officers are placed under the control of the DG, AAIB, thereby creating a situation where the very entities responsible for regulating and overseeing civil aviation are effectively investigating themselves. ”The pilots’ union have long questioned the AAIB preliminary report which, they sources there say, “has rushed to give a clean chit to Boeing and blaming a dead pilot who can no longer defend himself.”Pushkaraj Sabharwal’s plea says as much. The AAIB investigation team appeared to ""predominantly focus on the deceased pilots ... while failing to examine or eliminate other more plausible technical and procedural causes.” He and FIP, which has about 5,000 members, have sought the current probe be stopped and a new panel of aviation experts headed by a retired Supreme Court judge conduct the investigation.","Pushkaraj sabharwal, 91, and fip have contended that the preliminary investigation into the crash is ""profoundly flawed"" they say the probe team is predominantly focusing on the pilots, who can no longer defend themselves.

Who Cut the Fuel? Inside the Mystery of the Air India 171 Cockpit Audio

MUMBAI: The investigation into the fatal crash of Air India Flight AI171 by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is facing legal challenges. A second case, this time a writ petition, has been filed before the Supreme Court of India demanding an independent, judicially monitored inquiry into the loss of the Boeing 787-8 (VT-ANB) on June 12, 2025, in Ahmedabad, which claimed 260 lives.The petition was filed by Pushkaraj Sabharwal, father of the deceased pilot Capt Sumeet Sabharwal, and the Federation of Indian Pilots. It directly challenges the preliminary report issued by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which attributed the crash to ""pilot action."" The petitioners allege the AAIB report is technically flawed, incomplete, and biased.A month ago, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court by the NGO Safety Matters Foundation seeking full disclosure of flight data, cockpit voice transcripts, and technical records related to the Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner accident. The PIL sought the appointment of independent professionals to monitor the investigation. It alleged that the preliminary report released by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau a month after the accident was ""selective''.The incomplete disclosure of critical information, coupled with the premature attribution of pilot error while overlooking systemic faults is a violation of the articles of the Indian Constitution and international law governing accident investigations.The writ filed by the Capt's father alleges technical flaws and system failure played a role in the accident. The petition focuses on several critical technical inconsistencies that suggest a catastrophic system failure occurred before any crew input, such as premature RAT Deployment, for instance.The Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed during take-off, an event which typically indicates a major electrical or digital power failure, predating any alleged pilot error. Another point was about a possible total systems collapse. The simultaneous failure of all power and data systems, including the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), points to a single-point electrical collapse, it said.As for the fuel control switches, the AAIB report's finding of both fuel control switches moving from RUN to CUTOFF within one second is called physically improbable under take-off conditions, it said. The petition suggests these points to an automatic or corrupted FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) command.The writ petition stated that the AAIB allegedly failed to investigate a known risk in the Boeing 787's Common Core System (CCS)—the unified software that links all avionics, flight controls, FADEC, and electrical power. This is a crucial line of inquiry for potential cascading or common-mode failures. The petition cites anomalies in forensic evidence, including thermal damage to the Enhanced Flight Recorder without soot deposits. This suggests battery-induced combustion, not an external fuel fire, as the cause of damage.Beyond the technical arguments, the petitioners assert that the AAIB's investigation violates international standards for independence. Conflict of interest was brought to focus, the petition argued the investigation breaches the legal doctrine of nemo judex in causa sua (""no one should be a judge in their own cause""). It highlights that DGCA officials and representatives of the manufacturers (Boeing and GE) are part of the probe, compromising its objectivity. This arrangement allegedly violates ICAO Annex 13 principles for an independent investigation.Addressing the media reports in certain foreign publications that appeared before the preliminary report was made public, the petition accused the AAIB of unlawfully leaking confidential cockpit voice data (CVR) in violation of the Aircraft Investigation Rules, 2017 (Rule 17(5)).The selective leaks, the petition said, had fueled a prejudiced media narrative against the deceased flight crew. The petition ultimately prays for the constitution of a Judicially Monitored Committee, to be headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge, with the inclusion of independent aviation and systems experts. This move aims to ensure a transparent, technically sound, and unbiased inquiry consistent with global safety standards.","A writ petition has been filed before the supreme court of india demanding an independent inquiry. The petition was filed by pushkaraj sabharwal, father of the deceased pilot. It directly challenges the preliminary report issued by the aircraft accident investigation bureau (aaib) the petitioners allege the aaib report is technically flawed and biased.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124606692,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-237926,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will stop buying Russian oil, months after Trump imposed punitive tariffs over the purchases.""He's assured me there will be no oil purchased from Russia,"" Trump said. ""You know, you can't do it immediately.

That's a big stop. Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.""""He's a friend of mine. We have a great relationship. He just said that two days ago, as you know,"" the Republican chief added.Trump made the remarks during a joint news conference with FBI director Kash Patel at the Oval Office.The US President also criticised India's previous oil imports from Russia and said: ""We were not happy with him buying oil from Russia, because that lets Russia continue on with this ridiculous war, where they've lost a million and a half people, by the way.Russia has lost a million and a half people, soldiers mostly.""He called the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict unnecessary, sayin, ""This is a war that should have never started, but it's a war that Russia should have won in the first week, and they're going into the fourth year.""""And I want to see it stop.

Early in the fourth quarter, Jared Goff’s thrilling receiving touchdown appeared to give momentum to the Detroit Lions in their matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs. However, just as the team and fans celebrated, a late flag was thrown, and the touchdown was called “Illegal motion. ” Head coach Dan Campbell demanded an explanation from referee Craig Wrolstad, who revealed the call came from the league office. Later, in a radio discussion with Jim Costa and Jon Jansen on 97.1 The Ticket, Campbell confirmed, when asked, that the call came from New York. Lions' wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown recounted on his podcast the surprise at the delayed penalty: “The craziest part is we’re all celebrating. We get to the sideline.

Marcus Mariota’s career earnings: From Titans to Commanders

Marcus Mariota has been in the spotlight since his first NFL snap. Back in 2015, the Oregon Ducks star stunned fans with a record-setting debut, throwing four touchdowns and finishing with a perfect passer rating of 158.3. That performance made him the first player since 1933 to hit that mark in his first game. Even with all the hype, Mariota downplayed the moment, saying, “We have to find ways to get better.” Now, after more than a decade in the league, the Washington Commanders quarterback is still collecting big checks.In 2025, Marcus Mariota’s net worth stands at $75,541,683. The number reflects his steady run of NFL salaries, bonuses, and endorsements. He once ranked 83rd on Forbes’ list of highest-paid athletes, pulling in $23.9 million in 2020 alone. That season, $20.9 million came directly from NFL salary and winnings, while $3 million came through endorsement deals.Fast forward to today, Mariota is in his second season with the Washington Commanders. After working as a backup to Jayden Daniels last year, he signed a fresh one-year, $8 million contract in March 2025.The deal includes a $5.5 million signing bonus, $7.39 million guaranteed, and carries an $8.08 million cap hit. According to Spotrac, his dead cap value sits at $7.49 million. Even as a backup, Mariota’s bank account shows he remains a valuable veteran presence.Mariota’s 2025 pay package is structured in layers. His base salary is $1.89 million, with $2 million in possible incentives and another $1 million as a workout bonus. When all is added up, the Commanders are investing heavily in their QB2.Looking back, his salary journey tells the story of a long NFL grind. With the Commanders in 2024, he made $6 million plus $3 million in bonuses. A year earlier with the Eagles, he took home $5 million and $3.8 million in bonuses. His biggest checks came during his Tennessee Titans run (2015–2019), when he banked $6.05 million in salary and $15.9 million in bonuses. In total, Mariota’s career earnings now hit $83 million. That number got a huge boost in 2019 when the Titans gave him a $20 million base, which alone makes up nearly 20% of his career income.Also read: Seahawks dealing with key injuries as Saints look for edge in Week 3","Washington commanders quarterback marcus mariota has a net worth of $75,541,683.
