Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold prices are currently trading around the ₹1,27,000 mark, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the international front, COMEX gold is comfortably holding above the $4,000 level, further reinforcing the positive trend. This price behaviour indicates that gold is consistently forming higher lows, which is a classic sign of strength in technical analysis. The ability to protect previous support levels suggests that buyers are active at lower levels, absorbing selling pressure and preparing for potential upside moves.From a short-term trading perspective, gold prices have the potential to move towards the ₹1,30,000 level if the current momentum continues. Traders can consider accumulating positions near the ₹1,26,000 support zone, where buying interest has previously emerged. A strong support base is seen at ₹1,23,500, and any dip toward this level may offer a good risk-reward entry for bullish positions.Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary concerns, and a weak global economic outlook, gold remains a preferred safe-haven asset.These factors are likely to keep demand strong and prices buoyant in the near term. As long as prices sustain above the key support levels, the outlook for gold remains optimistic with further upside potential.MCX Silver has shown significant strength and has outperformed MCX Gold in recent sessions, currently trading around ₹1,60,000 levels. This rally reflects robust bullish sentiment driven by a combination of industrial demand, investment interest, and a positive technical setup. Silver's strong price action suggests that market participants are confident in its upside potential, especially as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a clear sign of an ongoing uptrend.Compared to gold, silver tends to exhibit more volatility, which can offer attractive trading opportunities. Any corrective move or dip toward the ₹1,57,000 level can be seen as a buying opportunity, supported by strong demand and momentum. On the upside, prices have the potential to move toward ₹1,63,000 in the near term. Traders should maintain a stop-loss at ₹1,54,000 to manage risk effectively in case of unexpected price reversals.Silver's dual role as both a precious and industrial metal makes it a favored asset in times of economic uncertainty, as well as during periods of industrial recovery. With favorable fundamentals and technical strength, silver remains well-positioned for further gains, and buying on dips strategy could prove rewarding in the current market environment.","Gold and silver prices are exhibiting strong bullish momentum.

What is the case against Mehul Choksi?



A Belgian court on Friday ordered the extradition of fugitive Mehul Choksi to India, news agency PTI reported citing officials. Choksi faces charges related to the massive Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.""The order has come in our favour. The court has termed his arrest by the Belgian authorities on India's request valid. The first legal step in getting him extradited is now clear,"" a senior official told PTI.Officials stated that the order marks a significant validation of India's efforts to secure Mehul Choksi's extradition, although he still has the option to appeal the decision in a higher Belgian court. Prosecutors argued before the court that Choksi poses a flight risk and should not be released from custody, the officials told PTI.Choksi, who relocated to Belgium in 2023 after leaving Antigua and Barbuda, was arrested there in April following India’s extradition request. He and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused of defrauding the bank of over Rs 13,000 crore.India had earlier assured Belgian authorities that if extradited, Choksi will be housed in Barrack No. 12 at Arthur Road jail, Mumbai, with adequate space and no risk of overcrowding or solitary confinement.The Union home ministry, in a September 4 communique, confirmed that the cell meets the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) of Europe’s minimum space standards.Choksi fled to Antigua and Barbuda, where he acquired citizenship, before being apprehended in Belgium. India’s agencies swiftly coordinated to secure his extradition. The cell assigned to Choksi measures roughly 20 by 15 feet, with a separate toilet, ventilation, and security measures. Inmates receive daily cleaning, fresh water, outdoor exercise, board games, yoga sessions, and access to media and telemedicine. Weekly family visits and daily legal consultations are permitted.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused in a Rs 13,000 crore fraud involving fraudulent Letters of Undertaking issued by Punjab National Bank. Nirav Modi, a declared fugitive economic offender, is currently jailed in London and contesting extradition. The CBI’s extradition request cites the UN conventions against corruption and organised crime, supported by arrest warrants from Mumbai courts. The fraud involved PNB issuing 165 LoUs and 58 Foreign Letters of Credit in 2017 without limits or proper records, leading to massive losses covered by the bank.Authorities allege that loans were obtained from overseas banks across locations including Mauritius, Hong Kong, Antwerp, and Frankfurt based on these fraudulent guarantees. When the companies failed to repay, PNB was forced to pay over Rs 6,300 crore, including interest, to these foreign banks.","Belgian court clears fugitive jeweller mehul choksi's extradition to india.

Rajnath Singh, Yogi Adityanath Flag Off First Batch of BrahMos Missiles from Lucknow Unit

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday warned Pakistan that every inch of its territory is now within the range of India’s BrahMos missiles, calling Operation Sindoor “just a trailer” of India’s capabilities. The operation showed that victory has become a habit for India, he added.Singh, along with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, flagged off the first batch of BrahMos missiles manufactured at the BrahMos Aerospace unit in Sarojini Nagar, Lucknow.Describing BrahMos as a symbol of India’s rising strength, Singh said, ""BrahMos is not just a missile, it is proof of India's strategic confidence. From the Army to the Navy and the Air Force, it has become a key pillar of our defence forces.""He added that India’s defence capabilities now serve as a strong deterrent. ""Every inch of Pakistan's territory lies within range of BrahMos. What happened during Operation Sindoor was just a trailer. It made Pakistan realise that if India could create Pakistan, then if the time comes... I need not say more, you all are wise enough,"" he said.Operation Sindoor, Singh said, proved that ""victory is not just a small incident for us but it has become a habit.""He said the operation instilled confidence among Indians and demonstrated BrahMos’ effectiveness to the world. ""Maintaining this confidence is now our collective responsibility. The entire world now recognises India's capability. BrahMos has strengthened our belief that India can turn its dreams into reality,"" he said.Operation Sindoor, carried out in May, targeted terror infrastructure and defence installations in Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir on April 22 that killed 26 people. Armed forces used indigenously developed BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to strike Pakistan’s air bases during the operation.On the manufacturing of BrahMos at Lucknow, Singh said the project represents India’s growing confidence and capability in defence production. “Lucknow is not just my parliamentary constituency, it resides in my soul. Today, it has become a city of technology and industry, apart from culture and tradition. The successful production of BrahMos missiles here shows that what was once a dream has now become a reality. The project represents patience, hard work and determination,” he said.UP CM Adityanath said the event is a proud moment for Uttar Pradesh and reflects Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ vision. “Under the Defence Industrial Corridor, Uttar Pradesh is emerging as a major hub of indigenous defence manufacturing. The BrahMos unit is a shining example of that. With a missile like BrahMos, India is now not only able to meet its own security needs but also those of its allies in the world,” he said.The UP CM added that his government is committed to supporting projects that strengthen national security and create employment and technical expertise in the region.Inaugurated on May 11, the state-of-the-art BrahMos Aerospace unit includes facilities for missile integration, testing, and final quality checks. After successful testing, the missiles are prepared for deployment by the armed forces.","Rajnath singh warns pakistan that every inch of its territory is now within the range of india’s brahmos missiles.

Pakistan army chief Asim Munir on Saturday repeated his anti-India rhetoric amid its ongoing border tensions with neighbouring Afghanistan. Warning Indian military of a ""decisive response"", Munir's unprovoked remarks came during graduation ceremony address at Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) Kakul in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.""I advise and firmly caution the Indian military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearized environment,"" he said.He further warned of military and economic losses ""beyond imagination"" if a ""fresh wave of hostilities be triggered""""Should a fresh wave of hostilities be triggered, Pakistan would respond much beyond the expectations of the initiators.

In the weeks leading up to the Pahalgam attack, Munir had stirred controversy by invoking the two-nation theory—the ideological foundation of Pakistan’s creation—urging citizens to inculcate in their children a sense of distinction from Hindus. He had further escalated tensions by describing Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein,” a phrase long associated with Islamabad’s territorial ambitions.Just days after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, Munir reiterated his stance, declaring, ""The two-nation theory was based on the fundamental belief that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations, not one.

How a social media rumor spiraled out of control

Super Bowl SHOCK: Turning Point USA Plots Its OWN Halftime Show Amid Bad Bunny Drama

Adam Sandler remains focused on comedy and film, not politics

A bizarre viral rumor suggesting that Adam Sandler was set to perform at Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show has officially been debunked. The claim, which spread rapidly across Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), alleged that the comedian would headline a rival event to the Super Bowl halftime show, but fact-checkers and sources close to Sandler have confirmed that the story is entirely fabricated.The rumor began earlier this week after a series of misleading Facebook posts claimed that “Adam Sandler will join Lara Trump at the Turning Point USA halftime show.” The posts racked up thousands of shares within hours, with users debating whether Sandler had shifted toward political performances. However, no reputable news outlet, nor Turning Point USA itself, ever announced his involvement.According to media watchdog Primetimer, the rumor stemmed from a manipulated headline that mixed genuine coverage of Lara Trump’s recent offer to perform at the event with false claims about Sandler’s participation. The viral graphic even used a photo of Sandler from his Netflix stand-up special, adding to the illusion of authenticity.Fact-checkers later confirmed that Sandler has no known ties to Turning Point USA or its founder Charlie Kirk , and he has never publicly expressed interest in performing at political events.In reality, Adam Sandler’s current schedule is packed with promotional appearances for his upcoming Netflix sequel “Happy Gilmore 2” and a new family comedy project set for release in 2026.Sources close to the actor emphasized that he’s steering clear of politically charged platforms. “He’s focused on creative projects and touring, not partisan events,” one insider told Primetimer.This isn’t the first time Sandler has been the subject of viral misinformation. Earlier this year, fake posts alleged that he had exchanged texts with Charlie Kirk and criticized late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, both of which were later proven false.Also Read: Will Jennifer Lopez join Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl halftime show?

It's our cancer.""According to Union, she was scared, hopeless, and even worried that she would have to raise the kids in Dwyane Wade’s absence. The Bring It On star was overwhelmed with emotions, poured her heart out during the interview. According to Gabrielle Union, her husband was just acting selfish after his cancer diagnosis as she failed to understand the former NBA star's point of view. She said,""I'll speak for myself when I say that the decisions that he was making hurt me about his cancer. It felt like, 'Oh, you're trying to kill me. And I'm going to be alone raising these kids. It's a very selfish response that I had, and it caused all kinds of problems, but [so did] his need for secrecy about his cancer decisions. It just starts sowing the seeds of distrust.""After coming across the life-threatening tumor in Wade’s kidney, Gabrielle Union felt as if the NBA icon was almost near to death. She explained that the Miami Heat's alum was trying to leave her behind all alone raising the kids herself. Gabrielle Union admitted that she had serious trust issues with her husband Dwyane Wade.

She revealed that the during the ninth year of their union, their marriage had hit rock bottom after Dwyane Wade's cancer diagnosis. Gabrielle Union said,“It was year nine of our marriage and ... year nine was very hard. When you mention year nine being hard, he hadn’t revealed his cancer diagnosis and his own cancer journey, so now we can put it in more context.”She further elaborated,""Obviously him getting that diagnosis was traumatic for him: Being faced with your own mortality in your early 40s, and you’re like, ‘Am I going to be here to see my family? Who am I without this big life, and without this healthy body? But you also don’t understand the journey and the toll that it takes on your marriage, on your family, on your kids.”After being married for 11 long years, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union share a daughter named Kaavia via surrogacy.

Exploring Shannon Kobylarczyk's controversy

Did Shannon Kobylarczyk lose her job?

What did MLB say about the Shannon Kobylarczyk controversy?

The ’ clash with the took a sharp turn off the field when a video from Game 2 went viral for all the wrong reasons. A heated exchange between Brewers fan Shannon Kobylarczyk and Dodgers supporter Ricardo Fosado turned into a national talking point after Kobylarczyk was seen making a racially charged remark. Within days, she lost her job, resigned from a charitable board, and was banned from American Family Field.Shannon Kobylarczyk, a Milwaukee-based attorney, worked at ManpowerGroup, a global staffing firm, and also served on the Make-A-Wish Wisconsin board of directors. Until last week, she was largely unknown outside professional circles. That changed during Game 2 of the NLCS on October 14, when she became the center of an online firestorm.The game, played in Milwaukee, had started as a typical postseason battle — the Brewers took an early lead before the Dodgers surged ahead. Amid the excitement, Fosado, a Los Angeles fan and U.S. Navy veteran, began recording the crowd’s reaction after a Dodgers home run. In his clip, Kobylarczyk can be heard mocking him, yelling, “Real men drink beer, p***y!” Moments later, she tapped another fan and said, “You know what, let’s call ICE.”Fosado, calm but defiant, replied, “Call ICE. Call ICE. I’m a U.S. citizen, war veteran, baby girl. War veteran, two wars. ICE is not gonna do nothing to me. Good luck.”The exchange escalated, leading to Fosado’s removal from the stadium after Kobylarczyk reported him to security. However, the story didn’t end there, it was only beginning.The viral video, viewed more than 2 million times, quickly drew outrage online. Many criticized Kobylarczyk for using an anti-immigrant remark, especially toward a Latino veteran. The Brewers soon confirmed that both fans were banned from American Family Field due to “offensive statements” and “physical confrontation.”In a statement, the team said, “The Brewers expect all persons attending games to be respectful of each other, and we do not condone in any way offensive statements fans make to each other about race, gender, or national origin.” They emphasized their commitment to maintaining a “safe and enjoyable experience” for all fans.The fallout was swift. ManpowerGroup announced that Kobylarczyk had been placed on leave and later terminated. “As soon as we became aware of this video the individual was placed on immediate leave and we began an investigation,” the company said. “As a result of this process, the employee is no longer with the organization. We remain committed to maintaining a culture grounded in respect, integrity, and accountability.”She also resigned from Make-A-Wish Wisconsin’s board. The nonprofit confirmed, “Shannon Kobylarczyk resigned from our board of directors this afternoon effective immediately. Make-A-Wish Wisconsin does not condone nor agree with Kobylarczyk’s words and actions.”Major League Baseball and the Brewers shared that such behavior violates league standards. The Milwaukee Police Department also became involved, citing Fosado for disorderly conduct and intoxication, though he wasn’t charged. Both fans, the Brewers said, are barred “from returning to the ballpark for future events.”Interestingly, Fosado himself showed grace toward Kobylarczyk despite the confrontation. Speaking to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, he said, “I don’t think it was like horrible or something that should get her fired. I feel bad for her. We cannot be judged on one mistake, and a lot of emotions were involved.”For Fosado, the night ended on a surprisingly positive note. “This is my first time at a Brewers game and I got kicked out, but you know what? I had a great experience and everybody was really friendly and welcoming,” he said.The viral moment dubbed Kobylarczyk “Brewers Karen” online.Also Read: Brewers 'Karen' fired after viral video identifies her as Shannon Kobylarczyk in racist rant at Dodgers supporter and U.S. war veteran","Shannon kobylarczyk, a milwaukee-based attorney, worked at manpowergroup, a global staffing firm.

Waqf Golden Visa: The UAE eyeing for strategic significance

Looking ahead: How to get started

Awqaf Dubai – for donation guidelines and nomination

GDRFA Smart Services – for Golden Visa application

Nearest Amer Centre in Dubai – for in-person support and document submission.





In a landmark initiative that underscores the UAE’s growing emphasis on humanitarianism and social sustainability, the country has announced that donors to Islamic endowments known as Waqf will now be eligible for the coveted UAE Golden Visa.The decision was unveiled following a strategic agreement signed between the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs – Dubai (GDRFA-Dubai) and the Endowments and Minors Affairs Foundation (Awqaf Dubai). The announcement came during GITEX GLOBAL 2025, one of the region’s largest technology and innovation exhibitions, held at the Dubai World Trade Centre.The initiative now enables both UAE residents and international donors to obtain a 10-year renewable Golden Visa under the specific category of “Financial Supporters of Humanitarian Work”, as clearly laid out in Cabinet Resolution No. 65 of 2022. The move is specifically aimed at encouraging high-impact charitable giving, positioning Dubai as a global hub of generosity, tolerance, and community-driven innovation.Officials say the Golden Visa will not just serve as a token of appreciation for philanthropists, but also as a strategic tool to attract global supporters of sustainable humanitarian work worldwide.“This agreement represents a pioneering model of government integration that empowers endowers to play a vital role in community development,” said Lt.Gen. Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of GDRFA-Dubai.Waqf, in Islamic tradition, refers to a perpetual charitable endowment. This could be in the form of land, buildings, cash, or other valuable assets set aside for public benefit—such as supporting education, healthcare, or religious institutions. The key feature of Waqf is that once donated, the asset cannot be sold or inherited. Instead, it is managed sustainably, with its revenue used for community development.In the UAE, Waqf is regulated and promoted by Awqaf Dubai, which ensures all endowments are Sharia-compliant, transparent, and channelled into meaningful causes.To qualify for the Golden Visa under this new category, donors must fulfil several conditions:According to officials, the scheme is expected to boost charitable contributions while offering donors several tangible benefits:Awqaf Dubai Secretary-General Ali Mohammed Al Mutawa called the initiative a “natural extension of Dubai’s vision to position endowment work as a key partner in sustainable development.”The Golden Visa scheme for Waqf donors is being seen as a forward-thinking policy that not only aligns with Islamic charitable values but also resonates with the UAE’s long-term vision of sustainable, human-centered growth.It also broadens the appeal of the Golden Visa, which is already available to investors, scientists, entrepreneurs, and outstanding professionals in fields like medicine and engineering.Officials believe the latest addition will attract global philanthropists, foster cross-border partnerships in social development, and further establish the UAE as a beacon of generosity and inclusive progress.With this move, the UAE is reinforcing its commitment to becoming a global humanitarian capital. The partnership between GDRFA-Dubai and Awqaf Dubai is also expected to usher in a new era of digitally-enabled social initiatives, wherein charitable giving is not just encouraged but actively integrated into national development policy.Those interested can begin by visiting:","The united arab emirates announced new golden visa for waqf donors.

The resulting Yang-Mills theory described how three of nature’s four fundamental forces — the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions — operate in the subatomic world.The Yang-Mills theory also laid the mathematical foundation for what came to be known as the Standard Model, which unifies these forces and explains the behaviour of all known elementary particles.In addition to his ground-breaking research, Yang was a prolific author, with numerous articles published in journals including the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, Physical Review, Reviews of Modern Physics, and the Chinese Journal of Physics.","Chen ning yang, who won the 1957 nobel prize in physics, died of illness in beijing on saturday.

""No King"" protest returned with its second edition. No, this is not a joke, but a group of people is staging a second round of ""No Kings"" protests across the country on Saturday in response to what they describe as the abuse of power by President Donald Trump and his administration, including his immigration crackdown.Organizers predict millions will hit the streets in over 2,600 events, spanning New York, D.C., Chicago, and LA, powered by grassroots volunteers—and, apparently, a dash of celebrity sparkle, with Jane Fonda Kerry Washington , and Alan Cumming on the roster.The daylong ""No Kings"" protests set for October 18 follow up on the thousands held in mid-June. They are being run by a coalition of organisations including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Indivisible, 50501, and others, ABC news reported.""They have been organised by regular people, by volunteers,"" Deirdre Schifeling, Chief Political and Advocacy Officer of the ACLU, told ABC News.Senate Majority Leader John Thune asserted on Wednesday that Democrats are waiting to resolve funding issues until after Saturday's ""No Kings"" rallies. ""The truth is -- what Democrats really want is something Republicans can't give them. And that is the approval of their far-left base,"" Thune said.House Speaker Mike Johnson has framed the ""No Kings"" protests as a series of ""Hate America"" rallies, stating, ""And I encourage you to watch -- we call it the ‘Hate America Rally’ that will happen Saturday. Let's see who shows up for that. I bet you see pro-Hamas supporters. I bet you see Antifa types. I bet you see the Marxists in full display, the people who don't want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic.""Johnson did not provide any evidence to support his claims that “pro-Hamas supporters” and “Antifa types” will attend. Organisers have stated they cannot control who joins the protests from outside groups and have emphasised their intent to maintain respectful and nonviolent gatherings. In an interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on Thursday, Trump dismissed being referred to as a ""king."" ""They're referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,"" he said.In advance of Saturday’s rallies, law enforcement is actively monitoring social media and the internet, as well as collaborating with local organisers and potential counter-protesters to anticipate events. This vigilance reflects ongoing concerns about large-scale public gatherings, especially political ones.Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, announced on X on Thursday that he ""directed the Dept of Public Safety and National Guard to surge forces into Austin"" ahead of the rallies. ""Texas will NOT tolerate chaos. Anyone destroying property or committing acts of violence will be swiftly arrested,” Abbott wrote. State Representative Gene Wu, chair of the state House’s Democratic caucus, responded, ""Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do -- and Greg Abbott just proved he’s one of them. ""Organisers have countered that Republicans in power are responsible for the ongoing shutdown and have noted that Johnson and some other Republicans’ reluctance to mention the protest’s name is significant.“I think it's really telling that he spent an entire week calling this a 'hate American Rally,' on the attack against this coalition and Americans across the country, and he won't even say the name of the protest,"" Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, one of the major groups in the ""No Kings"" coalition, told reporters on a press call on Thursday.Greenberg added, ""That's because if you say the name of the protest, 'No Kings,' the entire argument falls apart … there is nothing more American than saying that we don't have kings and exercising our right to peaceful protest.""When asked if they believed the Republican claims would impact participant turnout on Saturday, organisers responded that it might have the opposite effect. ""I think, if anything, it will increase turnout,"" said Schifeling. ""I think Americans can really see through these sad attempts to distract attention from the failure of these Republican Congress people and Republican Trump administration to actually address what most Americans want and need from their govt. ""Ezra Levin, co-executive director of Indivisible, told ABC News that he welcomes the publicity but believes Republicans are attempting to prevent Americans from exercising their First Amendment rights.""I think the Republicans and Trump see that the largest peaceful protest in modern American history is coming together on Saturday to push back against the authoritarian overreach by this regime and its supporters in Congress, and they're looking for ways to message against it ahead of time,"" he said.Celebrities including Jane Fonda, Kerry Washington, John Legend, Alan Cumming, and John Leguizamo are slated to attend, according to a fundraising email on Thursday from the political action committee Progressive Change Campaign Committee. ""We'll be in the streets for immigrant families under attack and for voters who are being silenced.For communities being terrorised by militarised policing. For families who are about to lose their health insurance. And for every single person whose rights are threatened by this administration's cruelty,"" the group wrote in the email.The tension ahead of Saturday’s “No Kings” protests isn’t just political — it’s logistical. Several Republican leaders are already talking troop deployments.“We’ll have to get the National Guard out,” Sen. Roger Marshall warned this week. “Hopefully it’ll be peaceful. I doubt it.”Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has already sent his state’s National Guard to Austin, labeling the event “antifa-linked.” Democrats fired back, accusing him of acting like the very “king” protesters are rallying against.“Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do,” said Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu. “And Greg Abbott just proved he’s one of them.”Organizers insist they’re ready. The Indivisible Project says it has trained tens of thousands in nonviolence and de-escalation, coordinating closely with cities that have National Guard units on alert. “We don’t expect a need for troops,” said ACLU’s Deirdre Schifeling, “but if the administration tries to use them to intimidate peaceful protesters, we’re prepared.”Meanwhile, the Trump administration has planned ain California on the same day — a move critics see as a pointed countermessage.Experts warn the legal groundwork is already laid for a broader show of force. Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice said the same memorandum used to send troops into Los Angeles could be invoked nationwide — even for peaceful protests. “It’s a direct attack on First Amendment freedoms,” she said.And while mobilizing troops takes planning, Goitein noted, “If we see them deployed this weekend, it means those orders were in motion long before anyone took to the streets.”For now, organizers say they’re focused on turnout — not troop counts — as millions prepare to march for democracy, not monarchy.","Organisers predict millions will hit the streets in over 2,600 events, spanning new york, d.c. chicago, and la.

Mark Sanchez breaks silence after stabbing and arrest, thanks his surgeon for saving his life

Former Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez has been sidelined from Fox Sports’ Week 7 NFL coverage following his recent arrest in Indianapolis. Once considered a rising star in sports broadcasting, Sanchez now faces growing uncertainty about his future in the booth as legal troubles threaten to overshadow his television career.Fox Sports’ updated NFL Week 7 broadcasting lineup was released this week, and noticeably absent from the roster was Sanchez’s name. The 38-year-old was slated to call the Colts vs. Raiders game on October 5 but was abruptly replaced after his arrest the night before. His sudden absence raised eyebrows across the league and the broadcasting world.According to reports, Sanchez was arrested on October 4 following a violent altercation in downtown Indianapolis. The former quarterback allegedly attacked 69-year-old Perry Tole after a heated dispute over a delivery truck’s parking spot turned physical. Both men were hospitalized after the fight, Tole reportedly suffered a deep facial wound, while Sanchez was treated for multiple stab wounds.Tole has since filed a lawsuit against both Sanchez and Fox Corporation, claiming the network “should have been aware of Sanchez’s unfitness” and “propensity for drinking and/or harmful conduct.”Prosecutors have now added a felony charge to the case, carrying a potential one-to-five-year prison sentence.After days of silence, Sanchez finally spoke outside the Marion County Jail in Indianapolis. “Right now, I’m just focused on my recovery,” he told local reporters. “I just wanted to thank the first responders, Eskenazi Hospital. I just want to thank Dr. [Lindsey] Mossler, the surgeon. She saved my life, so I’m grateful for that.”While Fox Sports has yet to issue an official statement, sources close to the network suggest Sanchez’s return to the booth is “highly unlikely” in the near future. His substitute, Brady Quinn, admitted the experience was “not ideal,” adding, “Not much sleep and mixed emotions… concerned for Mark’s health and the well-being of all those involved.”Also Read: Is Mark Sanchez’s silence about his broadcasting comeback hinting at a bigger story behind the stabbing incident?

FULL: Trump’s Shocking U-turn On Tomahawks After Putin’s Call | Watch Big Russia Announcement





US President Donald Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, a day after he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting came amid renewed efforts to end the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.“It’s an honour to be with a very strong leader, a man who has been through a lot,” Trump said as he welcomed Zelenskyy. “We’ve gotten along really very well.” He added that his recent call with Putin had been “productive” and that he believed “something can get done” to bring peace between the two countries.Trump said both leaders Putin and Zelenskyy “don’t like each other,” calling the hostility “tremendous bad blood.” “These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everyone,” he said. “So one way or another, we’ll be involved in talks, but it might need to be in separate settings.”Asked about military aid, Trump expressed hesitation over supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. “One of the reasons we want to get this war over is that it’s not easy for us to give massive numbers of very powerful weapons,” he said.“Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”He added, “We’d much rather have them not need Tomahawks. We’re in it to get the war over. We’re not in it to sell weapons.” Trump’s comments came after Putin reportedly warned that supplying long-range missiles could escalate the conflict and make peace talks harder.The meeting, their third in the Oval Office and sixth this year, also included discussions on Ukraine’s proposal to store US liquefied natural gas in its facilities.Before the lunch, Trump briefly joked about Zelenskyy’s “very stylish jacket,” referring to their earlier tense February meeting where the two had clashed on live television.Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his Middle East ceasefire efforts and urged him to use that to help end the war in Ukraine. “With your support, we can stop the war,” Zelenskyy said. “Their army and economy are weakened, and this is a crucial moment.” He also noted that he had met with American energy and defence companies “ready to assist after the attacks on our infrastructure.”Trump, who has frequently described himself as a peacemaker, said, “I solved eight wars. I’ve saved millions and millions of lives.” Referring to India and Pakistan, he added, “That would have been a bad one.

No more shooting, no more Death, no more vast and unsustainable sums of money spent. This is a War that would have never started if I were President. Thousands of people being slaughtered each and every week — NO MORE, GO HOME TO YOUR FAMILIES IN PEACE!""Speaking to journalists outside the White House after meeting President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said, “I think that Russia is afraid about Tomahawks, really afraid, because it’s a strong weapon.”",Us president donald trump met ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy at the white house on friday.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently backed President Donald Trump ’s plan to deploy troops in San Francisco. Joining him is now Tesla CEO Elon Musk who recently said that “This is the only solution at this point”. The tech billionaire was responding to a local advocate T Wolf's post citing a March 2025 survey where 61% of voters strongly support federal intervention to deport illegal fentanyl traffickers, rising to 83% including those who somewhat agree.The quoted post references SFPD's seizure of over 90 kilos of fentanyl in the past year and approximately 4,300 overdose deaths since 2020, aligning with official data showing 3,367 confirmed unintentional drug overdose fatalities from 2020 to 2024, with 2025 figures ongoing.“Pretty much 80% of San Francisco wants federal intervention on deporting drug dealers. That's how insane it's been here. 90+ kilos of fentanyl seized in one year by SFPD. 4,300 OD deaths since 2020. Hard data doesn't lie,” T Wolf wrote in the post. In another post, Wolf said “It's simple. If you want to keep federal troops out of San Francisco, remove the organized drug dealers and 80% of the problem goes away. If you don't, you reap what you sow.Replying to the post, Elon Musk wrote “It’s the only solution at this point. Nothing else has or will work.”In an interview last week, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he supports former President Donald Trump’s proposal to send federal troops to San Francisco, a plan that city leaders have called unacceptable.Benioff said he “avidly supported President Trump” and backed the idea of deploying troops to help reduce crime. “We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,” The New York Times quoted him as saying.Trump had reportedly discussed sending federal troops to San Francisco during an Oval Office meeting in August, naming it among several Democratic-led cities he said had been “destroyed.” He added that he would “clean that one up, too.”Benioff also praised Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative to cut federal spending and voiced support for venture capitalist David Sacks, who chairs Trump’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.San Francisco Democrats strongly criticized Benioff’s remarks.",Salesforce ceo marc benioff recently backed president donald trump’s plan to deploy troops in san francisco.

Unpaid days and job cuts

Shutdown hits economy

Tourism

Travel

Small businesses

Political standoff hardens





The federal government shutdown in the United States is moving closer to becoming the second longest in history, with no signs of a breakthrough. Some lawmakers have even warned that it could soon surpass the record 35-day shutdown that took place during US President Donald Trump’s first term.The standoff began on October 1.The Trump administration is using the shutdown to advance its priorities and cut funding for programmes it opposes, while Democrats insist that any funding deal must include support for millions of Americans who risk losing health insurance or facing steep premium increases if Congress fails to act.Here's how it has affected workers, economy and government services:As of March 31, the federal government employed around 2.3 million civilian workers. Each day, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, about 750,000 of them are furloughed, forced to stay home without pay until the shutdown ends.Others are considered “excepted” and continue working in essential services.Both groups will eventually be paid retroactively, but many could miss a full paycheck later this month after already receiving only a partial one for late September.Active-duty military personnel, roughly 1.3 million people, narrowly avoided missing their pay on Wednesday, after Trump ordered the Pentagon to redirect funds, according to AP.However, officials say another temporary fix is unlikely.The CBO estimates that paying furloughed workers who are not working is costing the government about $400 million a day.In a break from how previous administrations have handled shutdowns, the current Republican administration is moving to lay off thousands of federal employees in departments it considers low priority. A first round of job cuts affecting 4,100 workers has already been announced, with the biggest reductions at the Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education, and Housing and Urban Development departments.White House budget chief Russ Vought told “The Charlie Kirk Show” that more layoffs are coming.“I think we’ll probably end up being north of 10,000,” Vought said, as quoted by AP.“We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy,” he added. “Not just the funding, but the bureaucracy, that we now have an opportunity to do that.”Lawmakers admit many federal employees live paycheck to paycheck. Food banks in some communities have increased support, with the Capital Area Food Bank announcing extra food distributions in the Washington region from Monday to help federal workers and contractors.Economists warn that the longer the shutdown continues, the greater the economic fallout. Oxford Economics estimates that each week of the shutdown cuts US economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points. A full-quarter shutdown, which has never happened before, could reduce growth by 1.2 to 2.4 percentage points.Tourism is among the worst-hit sectors. The US Travel Association expects losses of around $1 billion a week as visitors cancel trips to national parks, historical landmarks and Washington DC Many public sites, including Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, remain shut for visitors.Air travel is feeling the strain as well. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported shortages of air traffic controllers in cities including Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Houston. Flight delays have spread to airports in Nashville, Dallas, Newark and other locations.Small businesses are also affected. The US Chamber of Commerce expects the Small Business Administration normally backs around $860 million in loans for about 1,600 small firms each week, but new loans have stopped. The shutdown has also delayed mortgage approvals and property transactions by freezing the issue and renewal of flood insurance policies.Neither side appears willing to compromise. Historically, the party that ties funding bills to demands rarely gets its way, as Republicans experienced in 2013 and 2018.Public opinion is divided. A poll by The Associated Press–NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that six in ten US adults blame Trump and congressional Republicans “a great deal” or “quite a bit” for the shutdown, while 54% also hold Democrats responsible.The administration has frozen about $18 billion for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River and an extension of New York City’s Second Avenue subway. It also cancelled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants across 16 states that backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the last presidential election. Officials say these moves are unrelated to the shutdown.Negotiations remain stuck. Republicans want health care talks to happen only after the government fully reopens. “We’re not conducting negotiations in a hostage situation,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-SD.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Democrats “are not going to bend and we’re not going to break because we are standing up for the American people.”","The federal government shutdown in the united states is moving closer to becoming the second longest in history.
