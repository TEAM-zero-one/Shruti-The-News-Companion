Major airstrike by Russia



Poll Do you agree with Trump's criticism of Putin's actions in Ukraine? Yes, he should be criticized. No, I think it's unjustified.

Sanctions on Russia?



US will send Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine







US President Donald Trump on Sunday delivered a sharp rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's continued attacks on Ukraine.Responding to the reporters, Trump said, ""I am very disappointed with President Putin. I thought he was somebody that meant what he said. And he'll talk so beautifully and then he'll bomb people at night. We don't like that.""His remarks came after Russia launched its fourth major airstrike this month, targeting several western Ukrainian cities.According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , the Russian assault involved 597 drones and 26 missiles, killing two people, injuring 20, and damaging civilian infrastructure from Kharkiv and Sumy in the northeast to Lviv, Lutsk, and Chernivtsi in the west.Asked whether the US would impose sanctions on Russia, Trump replied, ""We're going to see what we will see tomorrow. Okay. We have the secretary general. As you know, Europe has announced sanctions. But I am very disappointed with President Putin.""A bipartisan group of US senators is pushing a sanctions bill that would give Trump broad powers to hit Russia with what they call ""sledgehammer"" measures. While Trump has so far held off, hoping to convince Putin to end the war through diplomacy, recent developments suggest his position may be shifting.During a cabinet meeting, he said, ""I'm looking at it very strongly.""A major announcement is expected Monday, when Trump will address the Russia situation and meet Nato secretary general Mark Rutte in Washington. At the same time, US special envoy Keith Kellogg will begin a new visit to Ukraine.Trump also confirmed that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems to Kyiv. ""We will send them Patriots, which they desperately need,"" he said. ""I haven't agreed on the number yet, but they're going to have some because they do need protection.""This marks a reversal from the White House's earlier consideration to pause some arms deliveries. A new deal is now in the works that would involve Nato paying the US for the weapons sent to Ukraine.""We basically are going to send them various pieces of very sophisticated military and they're going to pay us 100 percent for them,"" Trump said. ""It'll be business for us.""With the war in Ukraine now stretching into its fourth year and Russian strikes intensifying, Trump’s latest statements suggest a possible turning point, combining military support, diplomatic pressure, and the looming threat of economic sanctions against Moscow.","Us president donald trump delivered a sharp rebuke to russian president vladimir putin over moscow's continued attacks on ukraine.

LONDON: Relatives of flyers who died in the June 12 Air India crash have slammed the preliminary probe as a “cover-up” to protect the Tatas-owned airline, Boeing and the Indian government.“This report is wrong. We don’t accept it,” said Ameen Siddiqui, whose British brother-in-law and Gloucestershire resident Akeel Nanabawa, died alongside his wife Hannaa Vorajee and their daughter Sara in the June 12 crash of the Ahmedabad-London flight.Speaking to the UK’s The Telegraph from Surat, Siddiqui alleged that “they want to blame dead pilots who can’t defend themselves”. Siddiqui added that he had rejected Air India ’s compensation offer and would take the airline to court for “killing our family members”.UK law firms are already representing families of dozens of passengers who died in the AI 171 crash and considering legal action against Boeing and Air India.Tushar Joge, whose male cousin’s in-laws, Vallabh Nagji Agheda and wife Vinaben Vallabh Agheda, both in their 70s, died in the crash, echoed the claim that the probe report was a “cover-up” for Air India and Boeing.“We were pre-empting that they would start blaming the pilots.Why are they not looking for a mechanical fault? How qualified are the people in the Indian Air Accident Investigation Bureau? The FAA (US aviation regulator) gave an advisory in 2018 to check the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature. Shouldn’t they have made this a mandatory requirement rather than an advisory?” Joge asked.The Agheda couple were coming to the UK to spend time with their youngest daughter and her family in Reading. Speaking to TOI from Vadodara, their son-in-law said: “It does not look like it’s the pilot’s fault. It could be Boeing’s design fault with the switches, or it could be Air India’s maintenance issues. Most of the families believe it’s a problem withthe aircraft. Air India is helping us with compensation but we are more concerned about getting the right report. We want the truth to make sure another disaster doesn’t happen.”Imtiyaz Ali Syed, whose London-based brother Javed died with his wife and two children lamented that the probe report was replete with “aviation jargon praising Boeing’s systems” while saying “nothing conclusive”. “Everyone, Air India, Boeing, government, has something to protect. But we have lost our entire families. How can we move on without the truth?” Imtiyaz asked.Sameer Rafik, cousin of crash victim Faizan Rafik from Leicester, told the BBC he did not trust the Indian government. “Until the airline provides the cockpit recording to us, I’m not going to believe the report,” Rafik said.","Relatives of flyers who died in the june 12 air india crash have slammed the preliminary probe as a “cover-up” to protect the tatas-owned airline, boeing and the indian government.

NEW DELHI: The April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that claimed the lives of 26 civilians was a conspiracy hatched by Pakistan's ISI and terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba on the directions of the country's political and military brass and executed exclusively by Pakistani terrorists , according to sources in the security establishment.In what sources described as an LeT-ISI project akin to the 26/11 Mumbai attack, ISI gave specific directions to Pakistan-based Lashkar commander Sajid Jutt to deploy only foreign terrorists operating in J&K. To ensure secrecy, no Kashmiri terrorist was taken on board. He was directed to ensure minimal local involvement on a ""need-to-know"" basis.The attack was led by Sulaiman, a suspected former Pakistani special forces commando who had participated in training at LeT's Muridke hub in Pakistan's Punjab before crossing the LoC into the Jammu region in 2022. Two other Pakistanis were also in the hit squad.Satellite phone analysis has revealed that Sulaiman's location on April 15 was in Tral forest, indicating he was in the vicinity of the attack site at Baisaran for almost a week before the incident.Sulaiman was also involved in the April 2023 attack on an Army truck in Poonch in which five soldiers were killed. However, he laid low for the next two years. Sources did not reveal the identities of the two other Pakistani terrorists.Although J&K Police had suspected the role of Pakistani terrorists Hashim Musa and Ali Bhai, probe has only confirmed Sulaiman's role till now. There is no corroboration of the role of local terrorist Adil Hussain Thoker as a facilitator, either.Even the two locals arrested by NIA last month - Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar and Bashir Ahmad Jothar, both from Pahalgam - are believed to have had a limited role, having provided the Pakistani terrorists food, shelter and other logistics in return for a few thousand rupees. They have also denied any knowledge of the terrorists' plan to hit tourists in Baisaran.There are currently about 68 foreign terrorists and three local terrorists active in the Valley.","The april 22 terror attack in pahalgam that claimed the lives of 26 civilians was a conspiracy hatched by pakistan's isi and lashkar-e-taiba.

Half of Air India's Dreamliners cleared in lock switch check

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: India on Monday directed its airlines using certain Boeing aircraft, like the B737s and B787 Dreamliners, to check fuel control switch locking mechanisms on them by July 21.The regulators and airlines of some other countries, like South Korea and the UAE, are also doing the same. The US Federal Aviation Administration had in December 2018 issued a ""special airworthiness information bulletin"" regarding potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking mechanism on certain Boeing planes.The directive comes two days after the release of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's reliminary report which put the fuel control switches centre-stage in its investigation of the June 12 AI 171 crash that killed 270 people. Airlines are required to submit their inspection plans and subsequent reports to DGCA headquarters and relevant regional offices.It has come to the notice of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation that several operators, internationally as well as domestic, have initiated inspection on their aircraft fleet as per the SAIB NM-18-33,"" DGCA order said.The inspection requirement affects a wide range of Boeing aircraft, including various 737 series, 747 models, 757 series, 767 variants, and all 787 models. ""Strict adherence to the timeline is essential to ensure continued airworthiness and safety of operations,"" said the order signed by R B Jamir, director of airworthiness.Air India is learned to have checked half of its 33 Dreamliners over the weekend and found nothing wrong with the locking mechanism of those switches. ""As and when the remaining Dreamliners fly to India or to a base that has engineering support, they will be checked too in the next two days,"" said sources. AI Express is also learned to have checked 26 B737s & 49 B737MAX aircraft and not found any defect on them. Vistara's wet-leased Dreamliners are not registered in India so do not come under the DGCA order.AI had replaced the throttle control module (which houses, among other things, the fuel switches) in 2019 and 2023 on the Dreamliner (VT-ANB) that crashed in Ahmedabad. ""However, the reason for the replacement was not linked to the fuel control switch. There has been no defect reported pertaining to the fuel control switch since 2023 on VT-ANB,"" AAIB's preliminary report says.The preliminary report did not recommend actions to Boeing 787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers. ""Data downloaded from the forward enhanced airborne flight recorder is being analysed in detail... Investigation is continuing and the investigation team will review and examine additional evidence, records and information that is being sought from the stakeholders,"" the report said.Meanwhile, news agencies reported that FAA and Boeing have privately issued notifications that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe.This is not the first time that airlines and regulators worldwide have stepped away from FAA directives to independently take decisions impacting flight safety. In 2019, a day after an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX aircraft crashed, it was grounded by 51 aviation regulators worldwide. The regulators, led by China's Civil Aviation Administration, kept aside FAA's affirmation of B737 MAX's airworthiness.Five months earlier, Indonesian carrier Lion Air's B737 MAX crashed in similar manner during take-off. It was only after the Lion Air crash that Boeing revealed to airlines that it had installed an operating system on the MAX aircraft that lowered the aircraft nose automatically in certain conditions.",The directive comes two days after the release of the aircraft accident investigation bureau's reliminary report which put the fuel control switches centre-stage in its investigation of the june 12 ai 171 crash that killed 270 people.

65 in-flight engine shutdowns reported since 2020: RTI data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/65-in-flight-engine-shutdowns-reported-since-2020-rti-data/articleshow/122471505.cms,"Air India crash

HYDERABAD: Sixty-five in-flight engine shutdowns in five years. Eleven ""Mayday"" distress calls from aircraft cockpits in 17 months, excluding the London-bound AI-171 that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 and a diverted domestic IndiGo flight.These numbers, obtained by TOI through a Right to Information (RTI) query to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), suggest a scary reality: engine malfunctions plague airlines operating in India at the rate of nearly one incident a month.Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's report mentioning fuel cut-off to engines of the crashed AI Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner fits the broader pattern of technical failures being handled by experienced pilots, until one crops up that is unmanageable.DGCA data covers all engine shutdowns, including failures during take-off and mid-air. ""A total of 65 incidents related to in-flight shutdown of engines from 2020 to 2025 (till date) were reported across India,"" states the aviation regulator's RTI reply.In all 65 of these instances, pilots were able to safely manoeuvre aircraft to the nearest airport with a single, unaffected engine. Experts attribute engine shutdowns to technical issues ranging from low fuel to turbine malfunction and faulty electronic components.""Primary causes of engine shutdowns include blocked fuel filters, fuel contamination with water, interrupted fuel supply to engines, and foreign objects entering engine stack, all of which can halt flight operations,"" Capt C S Randhawa, president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told TOI.The RTI data shows that between Jan 1, 2024, and May 31, 2025, there were Mayday calls from 11 flights, reporting various technical glitches and seeking emergency landing. Besides AI-171, the list doesn't include a June 19 IndiGo flight from Guwahati to Chennai that had to be redirected to Bengaluru due to congestion at the destination, only for the aircraft to report low fuel around 35km before landing.RTI data reveals that four of the 11 flights issued distress calls due to technical glitches and landed at Hyderabad.Airline Pilots' Association of India states that Mayday signals are exclusively used in life-threatening situations, distinguishing them from ""Pan Pan"" urgency alerts.""Flight crew initiate MAYDAY calls when confronted with critical emergencies such as aircraft fires, engine failures or situations posing imminent danger, necessitating immediate landing or grounding as continued flight becomes unsafe,"" said Anil Rao, secretary of ALPA India.AX Joseph, director of air safety at DGCA, said the aviation regulator was responsible for promulgating ""civil aviation requirements, circulars, aeronautical information circulars and public notices for compliance by the stakeholders to ensure safe operations"".While experts say that in-flight engine shutdowns and Mayday calls aren't uncommon across the world, India's position in global aviation safety standards may not be confidence-inspiring.

Need to avoid restrictive trade measures: EAM

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar's first visit to China in six years, amid the thawing of Sino-India ties, saw him pressing Beijing to further address border issues, including through de-escalation, while also urging China to avoid restrictive trade measures.In a meeting with his counterpart Wang Yi, Jaishankar acknowledged ""good progress"" in efforts to normalise the relationship saying it's a result of the resolution of friction along the border and both sides' ability to maintain peace and tranquillity.""This is the fundamental basis for mutual strategic trust and for smooth development of bilateral relations. It is now incumbent on us to address other aspects related to the border, including de-escalation,"" said the minister.

He said that as neighbouring nations and major economies in the world today, there are various facets and dimensions of their bilateral ties. ""Measures towards normalising our people-to-people exchanges can certainly foster mutually beneficial cooperation. It is also essential in this context that restrictive trade measures and roadblocks are avoided,"" he said in his opening remarks, expressing hope that he and Wang would continue their ""strategic communication"" not just on the margins of multilateral events but each other's countries.Ahead of the SCO meeting on Tuesday, Jaishankar touched upon the issue of terrorism too as he reminded Wang that the primary mandate of the grouping is to combat terrorism, separatism and extremism. ""This is a shared concern and India hopes that zero tolerance for terrorism will be strongly upheld,"" he said, while backing China's SCO presidency and efforts to ensure good outcomes.In the meeting, Jaishankar also underlined the need for cooperation on trans-border rivers, including resumption of provision of hydrological data by the Chinese side.The minister also told Wang that stable and constructive ties between India and China are not only to their benefit, but that of the world as well. ""This is best done by handling relations on the basis of mutual respect, interest and sensitivity,"" he said, recalling the agreement earlier that differences should not become disputes, or competition turn into conflict.

According to author Howard Kohn there were ""two nuclear-powered monitoring devices"", allegedly for surveillance of Chinese atomic weapons testing, high in the Himalayas.The devices, containing plutonium, were placed on two mountains, one of which, Nanda Devi, is the source of India's Ganges River, the holy river for millions of Hindus, the letter stated. The then Congress government's decision to let CIA surveil on China's plans for nuclear tests has long been an open secret in many quarters. So was the unsuccessful effort to retrieve one of the monitoring devices, which was buried by an avalanche, by sending expeditions.But BJP's decision to ignite a fresh debate at this juncture is significant because of indications that Congress may double up on its allegation that US president Donald Trump coerced Modi government into agreeing to pause Operation Sindoor.Dubey linked Nehru government's decision and disapparance of the devices to natural calamities by citing the article which said the untraceable device could be ""leaking plutonium into the Ganges. If this is true, it would be a serious problem, indeed"".Sharing the letter, Dubey asked whether Kedarnath disaster, Teesta River flooding, melting glaciers in Gangotri and Yamunotri, and even decreasing water level of Ganga could be linked to this incident.""The Nehru-Gandhi family bowed before America. Rahul Gandhi ji, Congress is responsible for the destruction of farmers and played with India's faith...""

Aviation Expert Links Mid-Air Fuel Cut-Off to AI171 Crash After AAIB Preliminary Report

Until final report is out, any speculation unacceptable: Union

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A day after Airline Pilots' Association of India said Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India 171 crash led to the promoting of a ""presumption of pilot guilt"" even before the probe was complete, Indian Commercial Pilots' Association (ICPA), one of the Air India pilots' unions, on Sunday slammed the ""reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide"" that has been doing the rounds since the report was made public on Saturday.AAIB had stated that both fuel switches on the Boeing 787 transitioned from ""run"" to ""cut-off"" three seconds after it took off from the runway, cutting off fuel supply to the engines. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other, 'Why did you cut off (the fuel supply)?' The other responded he did not do so,"" according to the report. However, it didn't elucidate why the fuel control switches were cut off.Soon after the report's release, pilots and aviation experts, in interviews and posts on social media, claimed one of the pilots had knowingly cut off the fuel supply switch.The pilots of AI 171, which crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 killing 270 people, acted in line with their training and responsibilities under challenging conditions, ICPA, one of the AI pilots’ unions, said, adding the crew should not be vilified based on conjecture.Referring to a 2018 safety bulletin issued by the US aviation regulator that instructed airlines to look out for a possible mechanical fault with the fuel control switches — which could cut off fuel supply to the engines without pilot input — the report said that Air India did not carry out the inspection as it was not deemed mandatory.“In the aftermath of this incident, we are deeply disturbed by speculative narratives emerging in sections of the media and public discourse — particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide. Let us be unequivocally clear: there is absolutely no basis for such a claim at this stage, and invoking such a serious allegation based on incomplete or preliminary information is not only irresponsible — it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved,” said ICPA.“Pilots undergo extensive psychological and professional screening, recurrent training, and operate under the highest standards of safety, responsibility, and mental fitness. To casually suggest pilot suicide in the absence of verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting and a disservice to the dignity of the profession,” it added.“As aviation professionals, we trust and respect the rigorous investigative protocols established by competent authorities. These inquiries are designed to uncover facts methodically and without bias. Until the official investigation is concluded and the final report is published, any speculation — especially of such a grave nature — is unacceptable and must be condemned,” ICPA said, calling on media and public commentators to act with restraint, empathy, and respect for due process.","The pilots of ai 171, which crashed in ahmedabad on june 12 killing 270 people, acted in line with their training and responsibilities under challenging conditions.

Poll Do you trust the official statements from the Indian Army regarding the drone attacks? Yes, they are credible No, I have doubts

GUWAHATI: Paresh Baruah-led Ulfa-I, the banned anti-talks faction of the original militant outfit of the same name that he co-founded in 1979, claimed Sunday that three of its senior members were killed in targeted pre-dawn drone attacks by the Indian Army on some ""mobile camps"" in Myanmar's Sagaing region.The Army officially denied carrying out any such aerial attacks on the camps purportedly shared by Ulfa-I and Manipur's Revolutionary People's Front (RPF) across a stretch of the India-Myanmar border, adjoining Longwa in Nagaland and Pangsau Pass in Arunachal Pradesh.Ulfa-I said the attacks came in waves between 2 am and 4 am - involving over 150 drones of Israeli and French make - and resulted in the outfit losing insurgent veterans Nayan Asom, Ganesh Asom and Pradip Asom. The last two were killed in the second drone strike while attending Nayan's funeral, while 19 members were wounded, the outfit said.""There are no inputs with the Indian Army on such an operation,"" defence ministry PRO Lt Col Mahendra Rawat told TOI in Guwahati.Ulfa-I contested the statement, specifying that three drone attacks took place in the span of two hours. The outfit said residents of the border belt in Arunachal Pradesh would testify to the attacks.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, who started his stint in office with an offer of talks to Ulfa-I, and state police denied any involvement or knowledge of operations against the outfit. They said there could be clarity on Ulfa-I's claim as more information arrives from the remote border.A source in the security establishment confirmed casualties in the Ulfa-I camps in Myanmar, suggesting the attacks could be the outcome of the civil war in that country with several ethnic armed groups at heart of the strife."" The ongoing civil war there has led to frequent clashes, shifting alliances and a general breakdown of state control in many areas, particularly near the international border,"" the source said. ""In this environment, attacks on insurgent camps - including those used by Ulfa-I - could plausibly originate from Myanmar's own ethnic armed organisations, or even the Myanmar military, rather than by Indian forces.""Insurgent outfits of the Northeast have had a presence in Myanmar since the late Eighties, taking advantage of the porous border and ongoing conflict there.Indian security agencies have repeatedly expressed concern over the use of Myanmarese territory by militants for hit-and-run attacks in the Northeast. There have been instances of unconfirmed Indian military action on militants across the border on several occasions.Ulfa-I's camps are said to be in the dense forests of Sagaing, with additional bases at Waktham Basti, Hoyat Basti and Hakiyot (opposite Longding district of Arunachal). Some camps are near the Pangmi Naga-inhabited area, and along the China-Myanmar border. Manipur-based groups, including Manipur outfits like People's Liberation Army (PLA), KYKL and PREPAK. RPF is the political wing of PLA.The NSCN-K(YA) faction has its headquarters and camps in Naga-inhabited regions of Sagaing, often within a 6 to 10km radius of the other militant bases.

How he’ll cope with Earth’s gravity

A landmark mission for India

NEW DELHI: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla , the first Indian astronaut to visit the International Space Station (ISS), is set to return to Earth on Tuesday, July 15, marking the end of an 18-day scientific mission aboard the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) crewed flight.The Dragon spacecraft, carrying Shukla and fellow crew members Commander Peggy Whitson, ESA astronaut Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, and Hungarian astronaut Tibor Kapu, is scheduled to undock from the ISS on Monday at 4:30 pm IST, with splashdown expected in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California around 3:00 pm IST on Tuesday. The journey back is expected to last approximately 22 hours.The Ax-4 farewell ceremony was held aboard the ISS on Sunday evening, also attended by members of Nasa 's Expedition 73. Speaking at the event, Shukla reflected on his experience: “It almost seems magical to me... It has been a fantastic journey for me.” Channeling the iconic words of Rakesh Sharma, India’s first astronaut in space, he added, “Even today, Bharat looks 'saare jahan se accha' from above.”In Lucknow, anticipation is high. Shukla’s mother, Asha Shukla, told ANI, “We pray to God that he completes his mission successfully and comes back to Earth as soon as possible and meets us… We will give him a grand welcome.”His father, Shambhu Dayal Shukla, confirmed the flight timeline, saying, “We were waiting for this, so we are happy that he is coming back. We pray to God that he comes back safely.”Asha added that she is preparing all his favourite dishes: “He told us that this time, after coming back, he wants to eat everything he hasn't had in the past five-six years due to being abroad.”Before launch, Shukla had packed mango nectar, carrot halwa, and moong dal halwa for his time in space, saying, “There will be plenty of food to eat in space, but I will be carrying mango nectar, carrot halwa, and moong dal halwa with me.”Launched on June 25 from Nasa ’s Kennedy Space Center aboard a Falcon-9 rocket, Axiom-4 docked with the ISS on June 26. Over 18 days, the team carried out more than 60 experiments, including studies on human health, space agriculture, mental well-being, and space suit materials. The mission will return with over 580 pounds of cargo, including scientific equipment and research samples.Shukla focused on testing glucose monitors in microgravity, contributing to efforts aimed at enabling diabetic individuals to participate in future space missions.In his final remarks from space, Shukla said, “I carry with me a lot of memories and learnings. But what stays with me most is what humanity can achieve when we all come together for a common goal.” He also thanked ISRO, Nasa , SpaceX, and Axiom Space, and acknowledged the contributions of Indian students and researchers to the mission’s outreach goals.After splashdown, Shukla and his crewmates will be transported to Nasa ’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will undergo post-landing protocols under medical supervision before being cleared for return to their home countries.He will undergo a series of medical and psychological evaluations, covering physical fitness, balance, reflexes, cardiovascular function, and immune response. Nasa ’s Human Health and Performance team will lead the assessments.Shukla will also be debriefed on his mission experience and the experiments he conducted. This data will aid both Axiom and ISRO as they plan future collaborative space missions. He is expected to be formally recognised by Indian scientific institutions, including ISRO and the Indian Air Force, and may receive honours from government bodies for his achievements in space exploration.After spending over two weeks in microgravity, Shukla’s body will need time to readjust to Earth’s gravity. Space travel leads to temporary loss of bone density and muscle mass, along with fluid redistribution that affects blood circulation and organ function.Nasa specialists note that astronauts often experience symptoms such as ""puffy face,"" ""chicken legs,"" vision changes, and even increased height during the early days in space. Upon return, rehabilitation protocols kick in. These include compression garments to stabilise blood pressure, hydration with salt tablets and water, and physical therapy to rebuild strength, coordination, and balance.According to Dr. Dervay from Nasa, “Almost every organ system in the body is impacted to some degree – whether it's the skin, the neurovestibular, the bone, muscle, the immunological system, the cardiovascular system.”However, Nasa says no extraordinary measures are needed in Shukla’s case. “We don’t see any need for any special precaution,” said Dina Contella, deputy manager of Nasa’s ISS Program. “Like any astronauts coming back, there is an acclimation period, and so that will vary by crew member.”Shukla’s recovery will also help space agencies better understand the impact of short-duration missions, crucial for long-term exploration goals such as missions to the Moon and Mars.Shukla’s mission is being seen as a symbolic and scientific milestone in India’s space journey. Coming ahead of ISRO’s Gaganyaan mission, it represents India’s growing presence in international space collaboration. At the farewell, Shukla noted, “If we decide, then even stars are attainable (taara api prapyante).”As he prepares to step back on Earth, Shukla brings not just research findings and experience, but a message of aspiration, unity, and national pride.(With inputs from agencies)","Shubhanshu shukla is the first indian astronaut to visit the international space station (iss) he is set to return to earth on tuesday, july 15, marking the end of an 18-day scientific mission aboard the axiom-4 (ax-4) crewed flight.

Jets’ $130 million Garrett Wilson extension draws praise — but the contract’s secret weapon is genius,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jets-130-million-garrett-wilson-extension-draws-praise-but-the-contracts-secret-weapon-is-genius/articleshow/122472423.cms,"Jets' Garrett Wilson contract extension (Getty Images)

Inside Garrett Wilson’s $130M Jets deal: One brilliant detail changes everything



In a bold move that speaks volumes about their long-term ambitions, the New York Jets have officially locked in one of their brightest stars. On Monday, NFL insider Adam Schefter reported that wide receiver Garrett Wilson has signed a groundbreaking 4-year, $130 million extension with the Jets—featuring a stunning $90 million guaranteed. This deal not only reaffirms the Jets' belief in Wilson but also marks NFL history, as he's now the first receiver to average $31 million annually after just three professional seasons.The 24-year-old Ohio State product has earned every bit of this payday. Since entering the league, Wilson has delivered three straight 1,000-yard seasons, including a career-best 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns in 2024. He’s amassed 279 catches for 3,249 yards over his young career, remaining both consistent and durable—despite playing without a true franchise quarterback.What makes this extension even more impressive is its timing and structure. With the Jets exercising Wilson's fifth-year option, his new deal won’t kick in until 2027. That means the team has effectively secured one of the league’s premier receivers through the 2030 season. As ESPN’s Rich Cimini highlighted, “New York now owes Wilson $150.3 million over the next six seasons,” which averages out to a manageable $25.05 million annually—an absolute bargain for elite production at a premium position.While his $32.5 million average places him fifth among NFL receivers—behind Ja’Marr Chase, Justin Jefferson, CeeDee Lamb, and DK Metcalf—Wilson's deal is a win for the Jets. In a league where young stars are expected to reset the market, this contract gives New York top-tier talent without blowing up their cap flexibility. More importantly, it helps the Jets avoid future standoffs and public negotiations that often plague high-profile extensions.The timing also aligns perfectly with another significant storyline: Wilson will be reunited in 2025 with his former Ohio State quarterback, Justin Fields. This long-anticipated pairing could finally give Wilson the consistent quarterback connection he’s lacked. While Fields may not be a guaranteed fix, the chemistry from their college days offers hope.So far, Wilson has looked every bit like a superstar in the making—held back only by instability at quarterback. His route running, hands, and explosiveness have never been questioned. The Jets, by committing early, are betting on his best years still being ahead.For a franchise often marred by misfortune and missed opportunities, this extension signals something rare: hope with purpose. Garrett Wilson is staying in East Rutherford—and the Jets might finally be building something worth watching.Also Read: ""We get to talk once a week"": Jason Kelce hails Travis as a ‘great uncle’ and the ‘best friend’ he could ever ask for","The new york jets have signed wide receiver garrett wilson to a four-year, $130 million contract extension.

But this creator has always been in the pages of controversy.Her recent death hoax has been stirred by a summary from Meta AI. This summary claimed that on July 15m 2025, Cooney passed away at the age of 30. This dispute got even more heated up by another claim from one of Cooney’s alleged neighbors, named Trixie, who stated that she lived around the block from her and saw an ambulance and a body bag carrying a body.These two claims were the real reason the death hoax of Cooney is trending all around the internet.For some seconds, these claims might sound very real.

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.W hen Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former uk prime minister rishi sunak is returning to goldman sachs as a senior adviser.
