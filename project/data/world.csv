Inqilab Moncho issues ultimatum, warns of tougher protests



Government promises speedy trial as arrests continue







The brother of slain youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi accused Bangladesh’s interim government, of orchestrating the killing to destabilise the country and derail the upcoming national election in February.Sharif Omar bin Hadi, speaking at a protest rally in Shahbagh on Tuesday, said those in power could not evade responsibility for his brother’s murder, which took place just days after the election schedule was announced. Osman Hadi, a convenor of the political platform Inqilab Moncho, was shot on December 12 and later died of his injuries in Singapore on December 18.Addressing a “Shahidi Shopoth” programme organised by Inqilab Moncho outside the National Museum, Omar Hadi accused “a quarter within the government” of planning the killing to disrupt the electoral process. “It is you who had Osman Hadi killed, and now you are trying to foil the election by using this as an issue,” he said as quoted by The DailyStar.He said his brother had been firmly in favour of holding elections by February and had actively worked on the ground to prepare for them. “Respecting his wish, we demand that the election environment is not disturbed,” Omar Hadi said, warning that the government had so far shown “no visible progress” in delivering justice.He claimed Osman Hadi was targeted because he refused to bow to any agency or “foreign masters”. If justice was denied, Omar Hadi warned, those responsible would one day be forced to flee the country. Protesters later took an oath vowing to remain on the streets until “speedy and exemplary justice” was secured.Earlier, Inqilab Moncho’s member secretary Abdullah Al Jaber, speaking as the keynote speaker, alleged a “deep conspiracy” involving international intelligence agencies and domestic “fascist associates” aimed at undermining Bangladesh’s sovereignty and the gains of the July uprising.The platform has given the government a 30-working-day deadline to identify and arrest the killers, warning of tougher nationwide programmes if the demand is not met. While the group said it would pause formal protests on December 25, the day BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman is due to return to Bangladesh, it announced wall-writing and social media campaigns across December 24 and 25, with further agitation planned from December 26.In a parallel development, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina also blamed the interim government for the deteriorating law-and-order situation, saying the killing reflected “lawlessness” under Yunus.The interim government has rejected suggestions of inaction, with Law Adviser Asif Nazrul saying the case would be tried under the Speedy Trial Tribunal Act, requiring completion within 90 days of the investigation report being filed. Home Adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said the case was being treated as a top priority.Joint forces comprising police, the Rapid Action Battalion and Border Guard Bangladesh have arrested at least 10 people so far, including family members of the prime suspect, Faisal Karim Masud. Authorities say efforts are ongoing to arrest the main accused.Osman Hadi’s killing came a day after the Bangladesh Election Commission announced February 12 as the date for the next national polls. A prominent figure of the 'July Uprising' and a potential candidate for Dhaka-8, his death had fuelled major protests in Bangladesh.","Sharif omar bin hadi said those in power could not evade responsibility for his brother’s murder.

‘Not Misleading Propaganda’: Bangladesh Responds To India Over Delhi High Commission Protest

Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], December 23 (ANI): The Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) on Monday wrote to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , seeking urgent intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of Indian medical students currently studying in Bangladesh amid ongoing protests, tensions, and incidents of violence, particularly in Dhaka and surrounding regions.In the letter addressed to the Prime Minister, the Association urged him to intervene to ensure the safety and protection of Indian medical students in view of the prevailing unrest and uncertain conditions in Bangladesh.National Convenor of the Association, Nasir Khuehami, said that there are around 9,000 Indian students pursuing medical education in various colleges across Bangladesh, among them over 4,000 students from the Kashmir Valley.Khuehami said, ""We have been told by students studying in Dhaka that they have been advised to hide their identity for their own safety, which is deeply disturbing and unacceptable for young Indians who have gone abroad solely to pursue education."" He added that the reported ""death and lynching of a student leader has further shocked and alarmed the entire student community and their families back home,"" underlining the gravity of the situation and the potential risks faced by Indian students on the ground.Highlighting the plight of students, the Association said, ""Many students are confined to hostels and accommodations, facing restrictions on movement, lack of clarity, and fear of being caught in violence. Parents in India are living in constant anxiety, unsure about the safety of their children. The prevailing conditions are unsafe and uncertain, and students feel vulnerable and stranded.""Khuehami said the Association has been receiving distress calls and messages from students and their families, who are extremely anxious about the rapidly deteriorating situation and the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty prevailing there.Urging immediate action, Khuehami said, ""We urge the Prime Minister to kindly intervene to ensure the immediate safety and protection of Indian medical students in Bangladesh. We request the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian High Commission in Dhaka to urgently take up this matter with the Government of Bangladesh and seek firm assurances for the security, dignity, and well-being of our students.""The Association also appealed for evacuation if the situation worsens, stating, ""If the situation of tension and violence continues or worsens, the Government of India should kindly consider making arrangements to evacuate and bring back Indian students safely to India, so that no young life is put at risk. Timely evacuation, if required, will go a long way in preventing any untoward incident and in reassuring anxious families across the country. ""Reposing faith in the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Association said, ""India has always stood by its citizens abroad in times of crisis. We are confident that every possible step will be taken to protect our students and uphold India's responsibility towards its youth.

NEW DELHI: Bringing a long-running financial and criminal dispute to an end, the Supreme Court of India has disposed of the Sandesara matter after recording complete compliance with its earlier directions on deposit of funds and settlement with lender banks.The petitioners informed the Court that they had complied with the November 19 order by depositing a total sum of Rs 51,11,43,36,390.40, which also included an additional amount deposited as a measure of abundant caution.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the petitioners along with advocate Hemant Shah, confirmed the compliance during the hearing.The Bench comprising Justices J.K.

In view of this, the Court directed the Registrar (Judicial Administration) to disburse Rs 5,100 crore to the consortium of lender banks on a proportionate basis, following due verification and transfer to their respective accounts.According to the legal team representing the Sandesara brothers, the original FIR pertained to alleged dues of about Rs 5,383 crore, whereas recoveries effected so far have touched approximately Rs 9,800 crore, nearly double the amount cited in the FIRWith the consent of all parties, the Supreme Court also ordered a complete closure of criminal and enforcement action against the petitioners. It directed that all investigations and proceedings arising from the FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation, along with cases and attachments initiated by the Enforcement Directorate under the PMLA, proceedings under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, SFIO inquiries, and matters relating to black money and income tax laws, shall stand quashed.Clarifying the scope of the closure, the Court said that a ""quietus"" had been reached in the matter and instructed all investigating agencies to formally communicate the closure of proceedings at every level, including to authorities at airports, through the Ministry of External Affairs.The Bench further accepted the submission that the excess amount deposited in excess of Rs 5,100 crore, lying with the Bank of Maharashtra's Supreme Court branch, along with accrued interest, be transferred to the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee. The funds are to be utilised for benevolent purposes at the Committee's discretion.In light of the affidavit filed by the petitioners and confirmation of compliance with its directions, the Supreme Court formally closed the proceedings by disposing of the miscellaneous application in full satisfaction of its earlier orders.The litigation originated in multiple writ petitions filed by the Sandesara brothers seeking the quashing of FIRs, ECIRs, prosecution complaints, attachments, and coercive proceedings under several statutes, including the PMLA, the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, the Companies Act, and the Black Money Act.","Supreme court of india has disposed of the sandesara matter after recording complete compliance with its earlier directions.

Yunus Govt Takes Responsibility Of Dipu Das Family After India Erupts Over Hindu Man's Lynching

KOLKATA: Tabla player Mainak Biswas and photographer Kallab Ghosh, who accompanied Sarod player Shiraz Ali Khan for his December 19 concert at Chhayanaut in Bangladesh, found themselves in a precarious situation in Dhaka after the event was cancelled.Recounting 48 hours of intense anxiety they endured before finally managing to return home on December 22, Biswas said he had never felt so vulnerable in the neighbouring country, which he has earlier visited at least five times. He said he had always received warmth from the people of Bangladesh.“However, this visit turned into my worst nightmare. I could never have imagined how difficult life could become as a Hindu trapped in Bangladesh when anti-Indian rhetoric was at its peak,” said Biswas after his return to Kolkata.The tension, he said, was suffocating, and every moment was spent in anticipation of what could go wrong. “It is easy to identify me as an Indian. Hence, the fear of being targeted was ever-present. The ordeal is a constant reminder of the vulnerability.”“My mother and grandmother were at home in Kolkata. But I didn’t call them up to share my tension. I still feel a shiver down my spine when I recall those helpless hours,” Biswas recounted.“I had switched off my phone. My mind went blank when I learned what had happened to Dipu Das. I couldn’t fathom what might await me if a mob attacked me.”The situation became increasingly challenging after Shiraz’s departure. “He had reputation of a renowned musician and the advantage of a Khan surname. Unlike him, I couldn’t even speak local dialect. They say those who can’t speak have no enemies. I decided to remain silent and pretend I couldn’t speak. Shiraz’s mother was with us, and I had the added responsibility of ensuring her safety,” Biswas said.","Tabla player mainak biswas and photographer kallab ghosh found themselves in a precarious situation in dhaka after the event was cancelled.

KOLKATA: Foreign courts can hear divorce and maintenance proceedings of a marriage solemnised in India if one of the spouses resides in that country, the Calcutta high court has said while setting aside a lower court order putting an injunction on a UK district court order in favour of the wife.In its December 15 ruling, a division bench of justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Supratim Bhattacharya held that under the Hindu Marriage Act, it is specified a petition can be heard by ""district court with the local limits"" of the residence where a couple last resided.The bench clarified that though under a different section of the same law, ""district court"" means Indian courts and not foreign courts, ""taken in its true spirit and in a liberal perspective"", the UK family court can have jurisdiction if prima facie the wife resides there and at least ""the parties last resided together as spouses in the UK.""""It cannot be said outright that the judgment which might ultimately be passed in the divorce suit of the wife in the UK would be inconclusive in India,"" the judges said.The couple got married in Kolkata on December 15, 2018. The husband first filed for divorce on Sept 4, 2024, at Alipore court. On October 10, 2024, the wife moved the UK court for divorce and the next day for maintenance. She said she had been residing in the UK since 2015 on student and work visas with occasional visits to India and they last stayed as a married couple in the UK.On May 16, 2025, the UK family court directed the husband to pay maintenance. However, on Nov 1, Alipore district court put an injunction on that order saying the wife cannot proceed with her case in the UK.The Alipore court reasoned that the husband had moved the divorce suit first and held that the UK court had no jurisdiction in the case as the wife was not a permanent resident of the country. It said the maintenance amount granted by the UK court was ""onerous and oppressive"" as it exceeded the earnings of the husband.The woman challenged the order in the high court which heldeven if the pleas were filed by the wife later, the husband filed a response and adduced evidence in the UK court. ""Prima facie, it is not credible that the husband is not in a position to contest the wife's divorce proceedings and alimony application in UK"", the high court said.","The couple got married in kolkata on december 15, 2018.

Navy Chief Confirms India’S Third Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine Soon

NEW DELHI: India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called K-4, which is designed to hit targets 3,500-km away, from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday.There was no official word from the defence ministry on the missile test conducted off the coast of Visakhapatnam from the 6,000-tonne INS Arighaat, which is operated by the tri-service strategic forces command.Sources, however, confirmed the missile was the solid-fuelled K-4, which can carry a two-tonne nuclear payload and is critical for India to strengthen the sea leg of its nuclear weapons triad.""A comprehensive analysis will determine whether Tuesday's test actually met all laid down technical parameters and mission objectives or revealed some shortcomings. It usually takes several tests for ballistic missiles, especially those launched from submarines, to achieve full operational status,"" a source said.After multiple trials from undersea platforms in the shape of submersible pontoons over the last several years, the two-stage K-4 missile was tested for the first time from INS Arighaat in Nov last year.INS Arighaat, the country's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN in naval parlance), was commissioned on Aug 29 last year.Her forerunner INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018, can carry only the 750-km range K-15 missiles.India will commission its third SSBN as INS Aridhaman in the first quarter of 2026 and the fourth in 2027-28 under the secretive over Rs 90,000 crore ATV (advanced technology vessel) programme launched decades ago. These two SSBNs are slightly larger, with a displacement of 7,000 tonnes each, than the first two 6,000-tonne ones.There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones on the first four submarines.India's existing SSBNs, of course, are less than half the size of the ones with the US, China and Russia. The operational deployment of K-4 missiles, which will be followed by the K-5 and K-6 missiles in the 5,000 to 6,000-km range class, will somewhat help India narrow the huge gap with countries like the US, Russia and China, which have a range of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).The first two legs of India's nuclear triad are much more robust, with the land-based ballistic missiles led by the Agni-5 with a strike range of over 5,000 km and fighters like Rafales, Sukhoi-30MKIs and Mirage-2000s capable of delivering nuclear gravity bombs.The SSBNs, however, impart India's deterrence posture with much more credibility because they are considered the most secure, survivable and potent platforms for retaliatory strikes in line with the country's ""no first-use"" policy.","India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called k-4 from the nuclear-powered submarine ins arighaat in the bay of bengal on tuesday.

Indian Travel Vlogger Anant Mittal Held In China, Comments On Arunachal Pradesh Trigger Detention

NEW DELHI: China now actively covets Arunachal Pradesh, much like it does Taiwan and other areas in the South and East China Seas, as part of its strategy to achieve ""great rejuvenation"" as a nation, while it continues to arm Pakistan with latest military hardware like multirole J-10C fighters, the latest US department of defence report says.""China's leadership has extended the term 'core interest' to cover Taiwan and China's sovereignty claims amid territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the Senkaku Islands, and the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh,"" the annual Pentagon report on China's military capabilities said Tuesday.TOI has repeatedly reported that China progressively upped the ante in the eastern sector (Sikkim, Arunachal) of the 3,488-km LAC after its People's Liberation Army (PLA) made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in the western sector in April-May 2020.Though troop disengagement between India and China from the two remaining immediate face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh took place in Oct last year, there is still no actual de-escalation on the ground with the rival armies remaining forward deployed for the sixth successive winter all along LAC.Indian officials say Arunachal, especially Tawang sector that China claims as ""South Tibet"", is ""heavily guarded"" with ""a very high density"" of troops and weapon systems to counter any threat.Taking note of the ongoing thaw in overall India-China ties, the Pentagon report says China ""probably seeks to capitalise on decreased tensions"" along LAC to stabilise bilateral relations and prevent the deepening of US-India ties, after the Modi-Xi meeting on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Oct last year.""However, India probably remains sceptical of China's actions and motives. Continued mutual distrust and other irritants alm-ost certainly limit the bilateral relationship,"" it added. The report largely dwells upon China's rapid and formidable development of its military capabilities across all domains, from land, air and sea to space, cyberspace and electronic warfare, which has ""made the US homeland increasingly vulnerable"".The PLA, for instance, has continued its ""massive nuclear expansion"" and is fully on track to have over 1,000 warheads by 2030 from the stockpile of around 600 at present. It also plans to have six more aircraft carriers by 2035 to add to its three existing ones.China has also steadily armed Pakistan to bog India down in South Asia. As of May this year, it had delivered 36 J-10C fighters to Pakistan, apart from the earlier four 054A/P multi-role frigates and other platforms. Pakistan had effectively used the Chinese J-10s armed with PL-15 air-to-air missiles in a fully networked sensor-shooter loop, against IAF during in May, as was reported by TOI earlier.Another concern for India is that the PLA now has an ""operational presence"" at Ream naval base in Cambodia, according the Pentagon, which is the second ""official"" Chinese overseas military base in the wider Indian Ocean Region after Djibouti on the Horn of Africa.","China now actively covets arunachal pradesh as part of its strategy to achieve ""great rejuvenation"" as a nation.

Protesters target Bangladeshi media outlets

(With inputs from agencies)

Ties between India and Bangladesh have hit another roadblock after the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka sparked anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year’s July uprising in Bangladesh, was killed amid rising political tensions, triggering widespread unrest. Bangladesh government suspended visa services in India following protests outside Bangladeshi missions.Protests also erupted in Bangladesh following the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu man lynched in Mymensingh. Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a demonstration outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday. Protesters described the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.Speakers said Dipu Das, a factory worker recently promoted for his dedication, was falsely accused of religious defamation before being brutally killed.India, meanwhile, has raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions, and what it describes as misleading narratives emerging from Bangladesh.Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.Yunus used the call to reiterate his pledge to hold general elections on February 12, saying the country was “eagerly waiting” to reclaim voting rights allegedly denied under the previous regime.Sharing the details of the conversation, US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said during the call Gor discussed the ""recent events"" in Bangladesh.""Today, Special Envoy for SCA Ambassador Sergio Gor held a productive call with Chief Advisor Yunus @ChiefAdviserGoB to discuss recent events in Bangladesh and shared US interests to advance prosperity through trade,"" US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs wrote on X.Amid mounting protests, Bangladesh suspended visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi and missions in Tripura and Siliguri, citing unavoidable circumstances. The decision followed demonstrations outside Bangladeshi diplomatic premises, while India had earlier suspended visa services at its Chittagong mission after protesters attempted to storm the compound.Yunus insisted the interim government remained committed to delivering a “free, fair and peaceful” election within roughly 50 days, describing the vote as an opportunity to restore democratic legitimacy. At the same time, he warned that supporters of the ousted Awami League regime were allegedly spending millions to disrupt the electoral process, with a fugitive leader inciting violence from abroad.Inqilab Moncho, the platform Hadi led, issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding justice, warning that failure to act would trigger a mass movement to oust the interim government. The group demanded a speedy trial tribunal, involvement of international agencies like the FBI and Scotland Yard, and accountability from home and law advisers. Its leaders accused intelligence agencies of failing to identify perpetrators and alleged Awami collaborators were embedded within security structures.Concerns deepened after another leader of the student-led uprising, Motaleb Shikder, was shot in the head in Khulna days after Hadi’s death. Police launched a manhunt but said they remained unclear about the motive or perpetrators. The attack reinforced fears that a coordinated campaign of violence was targeting figures linked to last year’s protests. With multiple leaders injured or killed, questions grew over whether the interim government could guarantee safety during the election period.Earlier on Wednesday, India had summoned Bangladesh’s envoy and expressed strong concern over extremist elements threatening diplomatic missions and minority communities. On December 21, the ministry of external affairs rejected what it called false narratives suggesting security breaches at Bangladesh’s High Commission in Delhi, insisting protests were brief and controlled. New Delhi urged Dhaka to bring perpetrators of the lynching of Hindu man Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained vigilant over minority safety.Bangladesh’s interim government said that it may review the scale of its diplomatic presence in New Delhi if the situation continues to worsen. Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain's remarks came hours after India dismissed Bangladeshi media reports on protests outside the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”.“Regarding the Indian press note, we completely reject it, entirely reject it. The issue has been presented as if it were very simple, whereas in reality it is not,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted Hossain as saying at the media briefing.From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed Yunus entirely for Bangladesh’s instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities, and undermining relations with India. She warned that lawlessness under Yunus had damaged Bangladesh’s credibility and endangered regional stability. Hasina claimed radical groups were exploiting Yunus to reshape foreign policy without a mandate, insisting that ties with India would normalise only after legitimate governance was restored. Her remarks added a powerful external voice to an already volatile political landscape.The assassination of Sharif Osman Hadi, shot at close range in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area and later dying in Singapore, became the catalyst for widespread protests. A key figure in the 'July uprising' that toppled Sheikh Hasina, Hadi’s death sparked anger among supporters who accused the state of inaction. Demonstrations erupted across Dhaka, with calls for accountability growing louder as Yunus declared a national day of mourning. The killing also fuelled fears that political violence was returning just weeks before a pivotal election.The unrest soon spread to Bangladesh’s media houses, with violent mobs attacking the offices of Prothom Alo, The Daily Star, and other outlets in Dhaka. Prothom Alo was forced to halt print publication for the first time in its 27-year history. Yunus condemned the attacks, calling them assaults on truth and press freedom, and pledged full justice. Authorities later said 31 suspects had been identified through video footage, with several arrests made, but the damage to Bangladesh’s democratic image was already significant.","Muhammad yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with us special envoy for south and central asia sergio gor.

From a new look to a new era in music and openness with fans

Madison Beer, who is dating Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert , has once again caught fans’ attention with her new post on Instagram .

Legal trouble further deepens career decline for Andrzej Wawrzyk



Once seen as one of Poland’s top heavyweight boxers, Andrzej Wawrzyk is now facing serious trouble far from the boxing ring. The 38-year-old has been detained in Sarasota County, Florida, in connection with a shoplifting case. His arrest has raised fresh concerns about his future in the United States and added another low point to a career that has steadily declined in recent years.Wawrzyk was once linked with title fights and major opportunities. He competed at a high level and carried strong expectations from fans back home. Today, his name no longer appears on fight posters but in police reports. With previous legal issues already on record, this latest incident could have consequences that go beyond fines or court dates.According to authorities, Andrzej Wawrzyk was taken into custody on suspicion of stealing items worth more than $300. Police also allege that he was carrying tools meant to bypass store security systems. In addition, he is accused of resisting a law enforcement officer, though officials say no violence was involved. Together, the charges paint a serious picture and suggest more than a simple misunderstanding.This is not Wawrzyk’s first legal problem in the United States.Back in 2023, he was arrested on similar theft-related charges in Chicago. The repeated nature of these incidents has now led to concerns that deportation proceedings could be considered. If that happens, Wawrzyk may no longer be allowed to remain in the country.His boxing career has also struggled. Wawrzyk last fought in February 2025, when he suffered a third-round TKO loss to Damian Knyba. That defeat marked his third straight loss and continued a long slump. Once a WBA “Regular” heavyweight title challenger, he now fights mainly to stay relevant.Controversy has followed him before. In 2017, Wawrzyk withdrew from a world title fight against Deontay Wilder after testing positive for a banned substance. His team disputed the test results and pointed to a clean follow-up test in Poland. Still, the damage to his reputation was done, and the title opportunity never returned.Despite everything, Wawrzyk’s record remains strong on paper. He has 34 professional wins, including 20 knockouts, and he was once a national champion.With deportation now a real possibility, his story is turning into a warning.Also Read: Andrew Tate’s brother Tristan Tate claims the boxer earned $52 million from misfits mania despite shocking defeat against Chase DeMoor","Andrzej wawrzyk has been detained in sarasota county, florida, in connection with a shoplifting case.

warning to Kick streamer Braden “Clavicular.” The clash began after Hall shared a clip from Clavicular’s IRL livestream on December 23, 2025.

Godfather of AI Yoshua Bengio’s career advice





Godfather of AI Yoshua Bengio recently admitted that the moment he truly started worrying about artificial intelligence (AI) was not decades into the future, but in 2023 after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Bengio appeared on The Diary Of A CEO podcast hosted by Steven Bartlett where he was asked why an introverted scientist was suddenly stepping into the public eye to talk about AI risks. To this, the Turing Award–winning “Godfather of AI” replied saying “Because I have to. Because since ChatGPT came out, I realized that we were on a dangerous path and I needed to speak.” He continued: “I needed to raise awareness about what could happen, but also to give hope that there are some paths that we could choose in order to mitigate those catastrophic risks.”“What was it about ChatGPT that caused your mind to change?,” the host asked. Bengio replied saying that before ChatGPT, “most my colleagues and myself thought it would take many more decades before we would have machines that actually understand language.”Explaining further, the AI scientist continued: “Alan Turing, founder of the field in 1950, thought that once we have machines that understand language, we might be doomed because they would be as intelligent as us.He wasn’t quite right. So we have machines now that understand language, but they lag in other ways, like planning.”Stating that the AI bots are not a real threat for now, Yoshua Bengio reiterated “but they could be in a few years or a decade or two.”“So it is that realization that we were building something that could become potentially a competitor to humans or that could be giving huge power to whoever controls it and destabilizing our world, threatening our democracy. So all of these scenarios suddenly came to me in the early weeks of 2023, and I realized that I had to do something, everything I could about it,” he said.When asked about jobs getting replaced by AI and career advice for the future generation, Bengio advised to “Work on the beautiful human being that you can become. I think that that part of ourselves will persist even if machines can do most of the jobs"".Continuing further, Bengio said “there will be jobs where we want to have people. If I’m in a hospital, I want a human being to hold my hand while I’m anxious or in pain. The human touch is going to, I think, take more and more value as the other skills become more and more automated.”","Yoshua bengio, the godfather of ai, spoke on the diary of a ceo podcast.

Khaleda Zia’s Tenure

A new political landscape

The India ties

Islamic radicals loom





Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman is scheduled to arrive in Dhaka around 12.00 pm noon on Thursday, ending more than 17 years in self-exile in the UK. His return comes at a time when the country has been marred by a series of incidents of violence, weeks after the announcement of parliamentary elections slated for February 12.Rahman, the elder son of former prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, is widely seen as the party’s principal face ahead of the polls, particularly as Zia remains unwell.BNP leaders say Rahman will complete formalities to become a registered voter on December 27, a step that would enable him to play a direct role in electoral politics.According to BNP standing committee member Salahuddin Ahmed, senior party leaders will receive Rahman at the airport before he proceeds to a reception venue on the July Expressway, also known as the 300 Feet Road, where he is expected to address the nation.He will then visit Khaleda Zia at the hospital and return to his residence in Gulshan-2, Ahmed said. Details of Rahman’s first three days back were outlined by Ahmed at a press conference on Wednesday, as reported by Prothom Alo.On Friday, December 26, Rahman is slated to visit the grave of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, followed by a visit to the National Martyrs’ Monument in Savar.On Saturday, December 27, he is expected to complete national identity card procedures to become a voter, visit the grave of martyred Osman Hadi at Dhaka University, and meet those injured in the July mass uprising at the National Orthopaedic Hospital in Shyamoli, Prothom Alo reported.Rahman’s homecoming has been facilitated by the interim government. Earlier this month, foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain said the government could issue a “one-time” travel pass within a day if Rahman wished to return. Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus also discussed Rahman’s return at a recent meeting, according to officials.Tarique Rahman, 58, is the acting chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the elder son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia. He has lived in self-exile in London since 2008 after leaving Bangladesh amid multiple criminal convictions in Bangladesh, including money laundering and charges linked to an alleged plot to assassinate then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.Over the past year, Bangladesh’s higher courts have acquitted him in all major cases, including the 2004 grenade attack and the Zia Orphanage Trust graft case, clearing legal hurdles to his political return. He is widely regarded as the BNP’s de facto leader, Rahman has now announced plans to return and contest the February 2026 general elections.Bangladesh for over the last three decades has changed powers between hands of two - now ousted PM Sheikh Hasina and Rehman’s mother former PM Khaleda Zia.Zia was the first female Prime Minister of Bangladesh and was in power from 1991-1995, and then again from 200-2006. Her tenure is still fresh in people’s memories, especially the political factions which ousted Hasina on the plank of corruption. Her regime also saw atrocities and discrimination against minorities. In 2018, Zia was sentenced to a five year term in prison, on the graft charges.Bangladesh’s political order has been reshaped following the violent 2024 uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina’s ouster and the disbanding of her Awami League by the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus.With Hasina’s Awami League barred from elections, traditional alliances have fractured, including the long-standing BNP–Jamaat partnership. The emergence of the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP), born out of the July protests and now registered with the Election Commission, has added further uncertainty to an already fluid electoral landscape.With Khaleda Zia, 80, battling health issues, the BNP sees Tarique Rahman as the party’s most viable leader going into the first election in nearly two decades without the Awami League. His decision to contest signals an attempt to consolidate party unity, reclaim the Zia family’s political legacy, and present the BNP as the default governing alternative. Political observers view the BNP as a frontrunner, and Rahman is being tipped as a possible prime ministerial candidate if the party secures a majority.India-Bangladesh relations have sharply deteriorated since Sheikh Hasina’s ouster and her political asylum India, where she continues to reside despite arrest warrants and extradition requests from Dhaka.The BNP has criticised New Delhi for sheltering Hasina, with Rahman saying India risks alienating the Bangladeshi public by doing so. A BNP return to power could further strain ties, given the party’s historically closer relations with Pakistan, in contrast to Hasina’s pro-India stance that included cooperation against insurgent and extremist networks.As the BNP regains political prominence, it faces growing challenges from rising mob violence and the resurgence of Islamist groups advocating stricter religious norms. Party leaders have warned against attempts to impose Shariah law and curtail women’s freedoms, cautioning that extremist forces are seeking to replace liberal democratic politics.Recent attacks on religious sites and political offices, along with survey data showing widespread public concern over mob violence, underscore the risks confronting the BNP as it prepares for elections.The political stakes are high. Hasina’s Awami League has been barred from contesting the upcoming elections, leaving the BNP as a frontrunner. The BNP-led alliance is set to face a coalition headed by Jamaat-e-Islami.Rahman and BNP have previously pressed the interim administration for early elections and, in May, questioned Yunus’ mandate to take long-term foreign policy decisions, arguing that such authority rests with an elected government.","Tarique rahman, 58, is the acting chairman of the bangladesh nationalist party (bnp) and the elder son of former prime minister khaleda zia.

Dana White antitrust case moves into critical phase



Dana White's antitrust case follows years of legal battles



Dana White is preparing to take the stand as legal pressure mounts on the UFC. A federal judge has ordered the longtime promotion boss to testify under oath in an ongoing antitrust lawsuit that could carry major consequences for the company. The ruling places White at the center of a case that has been years in the making.The order arrived during a recent status conference, signaling that the court is moving deeper into unresolved disputes tied to evidence handling and fighter agreements. With multiple hearings scheduled early next year, attention has now shifted from filings and motions to sworn testimony from UFC leadership.Judge Richard Boulware ordered White to testify during a spoliation hearing scheduled for Feb. 4 and Feb. 5. UFC vice president of athlete compliance and regulatory affairs Tracy Long is also set to testify. An additional hearing on Jan. 6 will address outstanding discovery disputes and define the scope of the spoliation proceedings. The judge also instructed both sides to file a joint status report outlining unresolved discovery issues by December 30 this year.Spoliation refers to the destruction, alteration, or loss of evidence relevant to a legal matter.In this case, the court is examining if gaps exist in produced records related to fighter pay and contract discussions. It will also include data from personal cell phones used by White and Long.This lawsuit is led by former UFC fighter Misha Cirkunov. It focuses on athletes who signed contracts containing arbitration clauses or class action waivers. The case seeks to address fighters who competed from July 1, 2017 onward and signed agreements that limited their ability to pursue collective legal action.Per the lawsuit, Cirkunov brought the case to avoid delays in related litigation and to challenge the enforceability of those clauses. The filing states that the goal is to ensure arbitration agreements and class action waivers can be adjudicated and potentially invalidated.The current dispute builds on a long history of antitrust litigation involving the UFC. An earlier lawsuit led by Cung Le, covering fighters from 2010 to 2017, ended in a $375 million settlement approved by Judge Boulware. A separate case led by Kajan Johnson, representing fighters from 2017 to the present, remains active.The UFC recently attempted to limit that case by arguing that some fighters signed arbitration clauses or class action waivers. The Cirkunov lawsuit directly targets those provisions, seeking damages and an order eliminating such clauses from existing and future contracts.White has previously questioned Judge Boulware’s impartiality and addressed the issue publicly. “I don’t think I did anything to this guy,” White said earlier this year. “But there’s no doubt in my mind this feels absolutely personal… whatever it is with this guy, we’ll let the lawyers deal with it.”Now, the process moves forward in court.Also Read: Why Conor McGregor's UFC return remains unclear?

On the eve of his return, the country’s largest political party described the moment as “both politically significant and emotionally charged. ”His return, along with wife Zubaida and daughter Zaima, comes less than two months before the parliamentary elections and BNP sources said his presence in campaigns as its star leader will help boost its prospects and its workers’ morale.BNP is facing the challenge of growing popularity of the coalition led by the country’s largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, especially among the youth. To mark his return, BNP has organised a reception in the outskirts of Dhaka, for which the party expects thousands to gather.Rahman was detained by the 2007-2008 military-backed caretaker govt, and he went to Britain after the regime released him and has been living in London since then. He had faced multiple criminal convictions, including a case related to a plot to assassinate Hasina. He was, however, acquitted of all charges after Hasina’s removal.Though he has been leading the party from abroad, his return now comes as he prepares to take a more direct role in party affairs, sources said.","Tarique rahman, former pm khaleda zia’s son, returns to bangladesh thursday along with his family, ending over 17 years of self-exile.
