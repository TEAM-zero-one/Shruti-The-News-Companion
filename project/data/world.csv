UK PM in India: Keir Starmer sidesteps query on New Delhi's import of Russian oil; won’t relax visa rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uk-pm-keir-starmer-sidesteps-query-on-indias-import-of-russia-oil/articleshow/124398010.cms,"Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, centre right, at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai (Picture credit: PTI)

LONDON: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer insisted he will not relax visa rules to offer more to Indians just before his flight touched down in Mumbai on Tuesday night in his first major trade mission to India.Accompanied by 125 CEOs, entrepreneurs, cultural institutions and 14 university vice-chancellors, it is the largest delegation to India in decades.Starmer also promised he would raise with Prime Minister Narendra Modi the case of Jagtar Singh Johal, the British Indian Sikh activist detained in India on terror charges, according to reports in the UK media.The visit seeks to build on the momentum from the UK-India trade deal, signed in July, which will lower tariffs on exports to either country.Starmer was repeatedly asked by the press on the flight if he would increase visas for highly-skilled Indian workers and students. ""The issue is not about visas. It's about business-to-business engagement and investment and jobs and prosperity coming into the UK,"" he told UK mediapersons accompanying him on the flight.He said visas ""played no part"" in the trade deal with India and that situation had not changed. He said no business leaders in his delegation had ""raised with him the question of visas"" either.Instead, the visit to India was about providing opportunities for Indian and UK businesses to take advantage of the UK-India trade deal.Asked whether Britain might consider poaching Indian-origin tech entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley in the wake of US President Donald Trump upping new H-1B visa fees to $100,000 for fresh applications, the UK PM said: ""Broadly, and not necessarily related to India, yes, where there is very top talent across the globe. I want to have top talent in the UK to help us grow our economy.""Starmer also said the UK would not seek to bring more Indian students to Britain, and instead would encourage UK universities to establish campuses in India, as several have done.Starmer confirmed the UK government was looking at linking visas to whether a country accepts returns of its citizens. ""With India that is a non-issue because we have got a returns agreement that is operating really well,"" Starmer said. ""We've returned, I think, 6,300 or so (Indians) already - that's a 55% increase.""Asked about India's purchase of Russian oil, Starmer joked he had not ""sent birthday congratulations to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, nor am I going to do so"", and sidestepped the question, saying the UK's focus was on Russia's shadow fleet of oil tankers which bypasses Western sanctions.","Uk prime minister keir starmer arrives in mumbai on first major trade mission to india.

NEW DELHI: IAF's ""bold and precise"" attacks on targets in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor showed the world how air power can be effectively used in shaping military outcomes in just a few days, air chief marshal A P Singh said on Wednesday.The deep precision strikes during the cross-border hostilities from May 7 to 10 also ""restored the rightful place of offensive air action in the national consciousness"", ACM Singh said, reviewing the annual IAF Day parade at Hindon airbase.Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan, in turn, said IAF had repeatedly demonstrated how air power could shape strategic outcomes, with the force reaffirming its ability to strike deep inside enemy territory with precision during Operation Sindoor.At the parade, the IAF chief presented 97 medals to air warriors and six unit citations, including to Rafale , Sukhoi-30MKI and S-400 squadrons, for their exemplary performance during Operation Sindoor.He called upon air warriors to ""remain prepared"" for future security challenges, emphasising that the force's planning must be ""innovative, practical and adaptive"" while its training must be based on the principle of ""train like we fight"".Describing Operation Sindoor as ""a shining example"" of what can be achieved through ""meticulous planning, disciplined training and determined execution"", ACM Singh said, ""Our robust air defence architecture and offensive employment of long-range surface-to-air missile systems limited the adversary's ability to operate and ensured safety of our vital assets.""""The outstanding performance of the indigenously developed and integrated weapons, which delivered precise and devastating blows deep inside enemy territory, vindicates our faith in home-grown capabilities,"" he added.Noting how the air warriors have ""created history in every era"", from the 1948, 1971 and 1999 wars to the destruction of the Jaish-e-Muhammed facility at Balakot in Feb 2019 and Operation Sindoor, he said, ""We are not only the protectors of the skies, but also the guardians of the nation's honour.""ACM Singh also said there has been ""an increased culture of accountability, safety and security"" in the force, which is ""directly reflecting in our reduced incidents and accidents"".He also praised IAF's role in Operation Sindhu, which was carried out in June to evacuate Indians from conflict zones in Iran and Israel.","Iaf's attacks on targets in pakistan during operation sindoor showed the world how air power can be effectively used in shaping military outcomes, air chief marshal a p singh said.

The ceasefire occurred after a single tweet from the US President,” Tejashwi said.“The PM is upset at this. The hopes we had from the PM have shattered,” he added.Earlier in the day, PM Modi said that Congress should clarify who prevented India’s military response after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.“A Congress leader, who has also been Union Home Minister, has said that a country prevented India's military retaliation post-26/11 Mumbai terror attack in 2008. The party should clarify,” PM Modi said.“This weakness of Congress strengthened terrorists. The nation has the right to know who stopped India from going ahead with a military retaliation after the Mumbai terror attack,” he added.“For us, nothing is more important than the safety and security of our nation and its citizens,” Modi said, referring to Operation Sindoor launched after the Pahalgam terror attack.This comes days after former Union home minister P Chidambaram, in an interview, recounted that he was inclined towards retaliatory action against Pakistan after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks but was ultimately persuaded against it.Chidambaram said the decision-making process of the Manmohan Singh-led government was shaped by international diplomatic pressure, particularly from the United States.“It did cross my mind that we should do some act of retribution. I did discuss it with the Prime Minister and other people who mattered. The PM had discussed this matter when the attack was going on, I can surmise. And the conclusion was largely influenced by the MEA and the IFS that we should not physically react to the situation but employ diplomatic means,” he said.“The conclusion was reached amid pressure from the world that was descending upon Delhi to tell us not to start a war,” he added. Chidambaram specifically mentioned that then-US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had travelled to New Delhi to meet him and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, urging India not to retaliate militarily.","Rashtriya janata dal leader tejashwi yadav accuses pm modi of agreeing to a ceasefire with pakistan following a ""single tweet from us president donald trump"" earlier in the day, pm modi said that congress should clarify who prevented india’s military response after the 26/11 mumbai terror attack.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124388030,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-851007,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Shedeur Sanders on Joe Flacco: mentor, teammate, and friend



What’s next for Sanders and Flacco



Shortly after Cleveland Browns benched veteran quarterback Joe Flacco for rookie Dillon Gabriel, the team moved quickly, trading the 40-year-old quarterback to the Cincinnati Bengals on Tuesday. Flacco started four games this season, but after a 1–3 start, the Browns opted to give their third-round pick a chance. The trade not only reshaped Cleveland’s quarterback room but also elevated fifth-round rookie Shedeur Sanders to the backup position.Shedeur Sanders, who had been listed as the third-string quarterback, will now serve as Dillon Gabriel’s backup. The rookie spoke candidly about Flacco’s impact, telling John Sabol of Fox 8 News, “Dang, that happened quick.” Despite the sudden move, Sanders expressed admiration for Flacco’s guidance.“He’s definitely somebody I leaned on for wisdom, and I feel like he helped me a lot,” Sanders said. “He helped a lot while my time being here in Cleveland and his time being here in Cleveland. Everybody has their own destinies and has their own plans in life, so I’m just happy for him.”Even though Flacco never considered himself a formal mentor, his presence proved supportive.Sanders recalled Flacco offering encouragement after a challenging final preseason outing. “He’s definitely a person that adjusts to any situation he’s in,” Sanders added. “He’s an old man, so it’s funny though. … I always bring the youngness out of him, and he always smiles at the funny things I do.”The trade, though surprising, reinforced the bond between the veteran and the rookie. Sanders’ reaction shows the respect and friendship that grew during their time together, highlighting how mentorship in the NFL often comes from the locker room, not just the playbook.With Flacco heading to Cincinnati, he faces an immediate challenge: stepping in for the struggling Bengals offense, which has felt the absence of Joe Burrow. Flacco could replace Jake Browning as soon as this week, potentially rejuvenating a team that has struggled with passing efficiency.Meanwhile, Sanders will lean on the lessons he learned from Flacco as he embraces his new responsibilities with Cleveland. His positive outlook on Flacco’s future emphasizes maturity beyond his years. “Everybody has their own destinies and have their own plans in life. So, I’m just happy for him,” Sanders reiterated.As the NFL season continues, this trade illustrates more than a strategic move; it’s a moment of growth for a rookie and a fresh opportunity for a seasoned quarterback seeking a second wind.Also Read: Deshaun Watson flaunts luxury private jet date night with wife amid Browns quarterback drama","Cleveland browns traded veteran quarterback joe flacco to the cincinnati bengals on tuesday.

On October 8, Mike Florio of NBC Sports reported that New Orleans Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan was the latest high-profile victim of a home burglary last month. The incident occurred on September 14, when the Saints hosted the San Francisco 49ers at the Superdome. Two men allegedly broke into Jordan’s home and stole several expensive items. No one was at home during the invasion. On October 7, Jordan tweeted, “Yah that Sunday sucked… the most important things,my family, was and is safe,” referencing WDSU reporter Travers Mackel’s tweet.According to Travers Mackel’s WDSU report on X, Cameron Jordan’s home was burglarized on the same day the Saints played the 49ers in September. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office later arrested two suspects. Mackel shared this news by tagging NFL Insider Adam Schefter and linking to WDSU’s article on the incident's latest update.WDSU’s Investigative Reporter, Cassie Schirm, reported that the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office arrested 28-year-old Donald Robinson of Stockbridge, GA, and 19-year-old Jadon Brown of Conyers, GA, in connection with the burglary. Two additional men were also identified as suspects: 20-year-old Jahaun Suber and 19-year-old Devell Ortiz.Police confirmed that Cameron Jordan was the latest victim of a home break-in and theft.The burglary occurred on September 14 in the old Metairie neighborhood, renowned for its exclusivity and safety, where Jordan’s family resides. Sources told WDSU that two men broke into his house, stealing several high-value items. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office was contacted immediately, and within 48 hours, arrests were made in Georgia. Old Metairie is considered one of the safest places in metro New Orleans, with many homes costing over $2 million.Back in January, the NFL studied a series of home invasions targeting prominent players, including Travis Kelce, Patrick Mahomes, and Joe Burrow. The league believed at the time that an organized and skilled crime ring could be responsible. According to a memo issued by the NFL, the FBI referred to it as an international organized crime group, possibly linked to a South American crime syndicate.

Prosecutors focus on toxicology report as key evidence emerges

The violent altercation and eyewitness accounts paint a troubling scene



Former New York Jets quarterback and current FOX Sports analyst Mark Sanchez is facing mounting legal pressure following a violent incident in Indianapolis that left a 69-year-old truck driver seriously injured. What began as a chaotic early-morning confrontation has evolved into a full-blown criminal case, with prosecutors now awaiting toxicology results that could determine the next steps in Sanchez’s legal future.Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears told NBC News that the upcoming toxicology report could prove vital to understanding what fueled Sanchez’s behavior that night. “We’re very interested in what the toxicology reports are going to reveal,” Mears said, confirming that his office is working closely with investigators.“The good thing about this case is that there is surveillance footage all up and down that alley, so we do have a pretty clear picture of what took place,” he added. The footage reportedly shows Sanchez sprinting before his violent encounter with Tole, further raising concerns about his state of mind.Sanchez, who posted a $300 bond, has yet to make a public statement. FOX Sports, his current employer, has not commented on whether he will continue appearing on air.The altercation unfolded near a downtown Indianapolis hotel loading dock, where Sanchez reportedly approached truck driver Perry Tole, who was attempting to back up his vehicle. According to police reports, Sanchez appeared agitated and possibly under the influence when the encounter turned physical. The confrontation ended with Tole sustaining a deep facial wound and neck trauma, injuries that required immediate medical attention.Tole has since filed a civil lawsuit against both Sanchez and FOX Sports, citing “emotional distress, permanent scarring, and negligence.” Witnesses at the scene described Sanchez as “slurring his speech” and “smelling of alcohol.” Surveillance footage from multiple cameras appears to corroborate the victim’s version of events, showing Sanchez “running erratically up and down the alley” before initiating contact.Prosecutors have since upgraded the charges from a misdemeanor to a Level 5 felony for battery resulting in serious bodily injury, a charge that carries a potential prison sentence of up to six years.Also Read: Prosecutor calls Mark Sanchez stabbing incident ‘completely unnecessary’ as truck driver faces permanent scarring As both the criminal and civil cases advance, the toxicology results could determine whether Sanchez faces a lengthy legal battle or a possible fall from grace that could end his broadcasting career altogether.","Former nfl star mark sanchez is facing felony charges and a civil lawsuit after a violent confrontation in indianapolis.

After commentator Candace Owens revealed chilling text messages of Charlie Kirk two days before he was assassinated in Utah, Kirk's organization Turning Point confirmed that those messages were genuine.

21 US lawmakers urge Donald Trump to 'repair and reset' ties with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/21-us-lawmakers-urge-donald-trump-to-repair-and-reset-ties-with-india-over-tariffs/articleshow/124393034.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Poll What should be prioritized in US-India relations? Economic & trade ties Defense cooperation





Asserting that the punitive tariff measure he has imposed on India is creating “negative consequences” for both countries, a group of 21 American lawmakers on Wednesday urged President Trump to “repair and reset” ties with New Delhi, cautioning that his actions risk upending strategic US priorities.In a letter to the US President sent on Wednesday, the lawmakers warned that his actions have pushed the Indian government to increase its diplomatic and economic engagement with “regimes hostile to the United States, including China and Russia.”“This development is particularly concerning in light of India’s growing importance as a stabilizing force in the Indo-Pacific through its participation in The Quad (in conjunction with the US, Australia, and Japan) and its indispensable role as a counterweight to China’s growing assertiveness,” the 21 House members said.Signatories to the letter, all Democrats, including five members of the so-called “Samosa caucus,” including Ro Khanna of California, Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, Raja Krishnamoorthy of Illinois, Shri Thanedar of Michigan, and Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia. Other signees include California’s Brad Sherman, Eric Swalwell, Jimmy Panetta, Sydney Kamlager-Dove, Sam T Liccardo; Illinois’ Jan Schakowsky and Jonathan Jackson; North Carolina’s Deborah Ross and Valerie Foushee; Texas’ Marc A.Veasey and Julie Jackson.They typically represent urban and suburban districts “with large, vibrant Indian-American communities that maintain strong familial, cultural, and economic ties to India,” as their letter put it. Several commentators from India have panned Indian-Americans for not speaking up for the ties and the letter appears to be a result of lobbying by the community although the outcome is uncertain in a MAGA-infused dispensation.In a critique of Trump’s trade policy that has resulted in India being singled out for 50 percent tariff, the lawmakers argued that while the punitive measures have hurt Indian manufacturers, it is simultaneously raising prices for American consumers and damaging the intricate supply chains that American companies depend on to bring products to market.Furthermore, US trading partnership with India is “exceptionally important,” supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs in both countries, they asserted. American manufacturers depend on India for key inputs in sectors from semiconductors to health care, energy and more. American firms investing in India also gain access to one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the world, while Indian companies have invested billions of dollars here in America, helping to create new jobs and opportunities in the communities we represent, they said.“This indiscriminate tariff escalation jeopardizes these ties, raising costs for American families, undermining the ability of American companies to compete globally, and undercutting ground-breaking innovation and cooperation,” the letter argued.The letter also underlined that India has become a vital partner in defense cooperation, conducting joint military exercises with U.S. forces and working constructively with America and its allies to secure vital maritime routes.“Given the depth and breadth of US–India cooperation – spanning defense, regional security, energy markets, innovation, and supply chain resilience – it is critical that our nation reaffirm its commitment to India. Strategically, economically, and reputationally, we strongly believe the path forward demands recalibration, not confrontation,” the letter said, urging Trump to take the appropriate steps to restore the relationship, beginning with a review of tariff policy and continued dialogue with the Indian leadership.","21 u.s. lawmakers urged president trump to “repair and reset” ties with new delhi.

Holdover fire and fatal consequences



Court appearance and legal outlook







A 29-year-old former Uber driver, Jonathan Rinderknecht, has been arrested in Florida and charged with maliciously starting the deadly Pacific Palisades fire that tore through Los Angeles earlier this year.The January 1 blaze claimed 12 lives, destroyed 6,000 structures, scorched over 23,000 acres, and caused an estimated $150 billion in damages - making it one of the most destructive wildfires in Los Angeles history.Rinderknecht, who previously lived in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood, was arrested near his home in Florida on Tuesday. He faces three federal criminal charges, including destruction of property by means of fire, according to acting US attorney for the central district of California, Bill Essayli, who announced the arrest on X.“Today we are announcing the arrest of 29-year-old Jonathan Rinderknecht on a criminal complaint charging him with maliciously starting what became the Palisades Fire in January,” Essayli said.“While we cannot undo the damage and destruction that was done, we hope his arrest and the charges against him bring some measure of justice to the victims of this horrific tragedy,” he added.Authorities say Rinderknecht had just finished a ride-share shift and dropped off a passenger in Pacific Palisades when he drove toward Skull Rock Trailhead shortly after midnight on new year's day.He allegedly tried to contact a former friend and then walked up the trail, took photos on his phone, and listened to a rap song whose music video featured fire imagery, reported NBC News.At 12:12am (local time), environmental sensors detected the start of the fire. Investigators allege that Rinderknecht attempted to call 911 several times but couldn’t connect due to poor reception. He later reached emergency services to report the fire, as did a nearby resident.Authorities say Rinderknecht fled the scene in his car but later returned, following fire trucks and filming firefighters battling the flames just after 1am.Among the evidence collected from his digital devices, investigators found an AI-generated image created via ChatGPT depicting a burning city. While the purpose or context of the image has not been disclosed, it is part of the case presented by prosecutors.Officials said the Palisades fire was a “holdover” blaze, meaning it was a continuation of the Lachman fire allegedly started by Rinderknecht. Fire crews took 24 days to fully contain the inferno, which ravaged parts of Pacific Palisades, Topanga, and Malibu.Essayli described the case starkly, “A single person’s recklessness caused one of the worst fires Los Angeles has ever seen, resulting in death and widespread destruction.”Rinderknecht’s initial court appearance is scheduled for 1:30 pm EDT (local time) today in US district court in Orlando. He is expected to be transferred to California for trial. Authorities have reminded the public that Rinderknecht is presumed innocent until proven guilty.Under federal law, arson resulting in death can carry life imprisonment or the death penalty. The case may also fall under President Donald Trump’s executive order directing the attorney general to seek the death penalty in cases of extreme severity.The investigation was led by the US bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives (ATF), the Los Angeles fire department, and the Los Angeles police department.

US President Donald Trump was holding a roundtable with conservative influencers about Antifa on Wednesday when Secretary of State Marco Rubio , standing in the back of the White House’s Blue Room, got his attention.Rubio said he had news for Trump but it would have to wait until after the media left. Then he handed the president a note.An AP photographer captured the note, written on White House stationery, which read, “You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.”Trump told the media, “I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we’re very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they’re gonna need me pretty quickly. So we’ll take a couple of more questions.”The influencer event had already been going on for over an hour when Rubio first approached. Trump invited him over, and Rubio whispered something to him before giving him the note.Trump, then also shared the news on his Truth Social account, writing, “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan. This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.”He also thanked Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey for helping make the deal possible, adding, “This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America. BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!”Speaking to Fox News after the announcement, Trump said, “It has really been an amazing period of time -- and so great for Israel, so great for Muslims, for the Arab countries, and so great for this country... in that we could be involved in making a deal like this happen.”On the upcoming exchange, he said, “The hostages are going to be released, our time would be probably Monday... We think they'll all be coming back on Monday, and that'll include the bodies of the dead.”Trump mentioned that he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , saying, “It’s brought the whole world together. It’s amazing -- and it’s so good for Israel. I spoke to Bibi Netanyahu just a little while ago... I said, ‘Israel cannot fight the world, Bibi. They can’t fight the world.’”He added that Arab nations once hesitant to engage were now playing a major role in the peace effort. “I develop relationships with people -- and sometimes those relationships lead to great things,” Trump said.The president also spoke about rebuilding Gaza. “Gaza, we believe, is going to be a much safer place, and it’s going to be a place that reconstructs, and other countries in the area will help it reconstruct because they have tremendous amounts of wealth and they want to see that happen.”In Israel, the army said it was preparing for the return of hostages. “The Chief of Staff instructed to be prepared to lead the upcoming operation to return the abductees with sensitivity and professionalism,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) posted in Arabic on X.",Us president donald trump was holding a roundtable with conservative influencers about antifa on wednesday when secretary of state marco rubio got his attention.

An 82-year-old woman in eastern China has drawn widespread attention after swallowing eight small live frogs in an attempt to cure her lower back pain, following a local folk remedy.The woman, identified only by her surname Zhang, was admitted to a hospital in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, in early September after suffering from severe abdominal pain, South China Morning Post reported citing Hangzhou Daily.“My mother ate eight live frogs. Now the sharp pain has made her unable to walk,” her son told doctors.Zhang had long been suffering from a herniated disc and believed that consuming live frogs could ease her pain. Without explaining her plan, she asked her family to catch some frogs for her.Once they did, Zhang swallowed three frogs on the first day and five the next, all smaller than the size of an adult’s palm.She initially experienced mild discomfort, but the pain worsened over the next few days. Only then did she confess to her family what she had done.Doctors at Zhejiang University No 1 Affiliated Hospital examined Zhang and ruled out the presence of a tumour.However, they discovered a high number of oxyphil cells, an indicator of potential parasitic infections or blood disorders. Further tests confirmed that Zhang had indeed contracted parasites.“Swallowing frogs has damaged the patient’s digestive system and resulted in some parasites being present in her body, including sparganum,” a hospital doctor said.Zhang was discharged after two weeks of treatment.Dr Wu Zhongwen, a senior physician at the same hospital, said similar cases are not uncommon.“We have received several similar patients in recent years. Besides swallowing frogs, some individuals consume raw snake gall or fish gall, or apply frog skin to their own skin,” he said.He explained that most of these patients are elderly and often avoid discussing their health problems with their families. They typically seek medical help only when their condition becomes serious.“For instance, putting frog skin on one’s body is rumoured to treat skin diseases. However, there is no evidence to support this remedy. On the contrary, it could allow parasites to enter the body, resulting in vision impairment, intracranial infection, and even life-threatening conditions,” Wu added.In one recent case from the same province, a six-month-old baby girl developed lead poisoning after her mother used an online “remedy” for eczema by soaking her hand in a lead acetate solution.The lead residue then transferred to the baby’s skin, doctors said.","An 82-year-old woman in eastern china has drawn widespread attention after swallowing eight small live frogs in an attempt to cure her lower back pain.
