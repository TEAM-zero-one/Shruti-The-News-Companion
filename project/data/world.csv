Charlie Kirk's Murder Triggers Nationalist Protest In London; Tommy Robinson's Rally Turns Violent

London’s streets turned into a stage for Britain’s anxieties on Saturday, as far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew a crowd count in six figures for the anti immigrant ""Unite the Kingdom"" rally. Tens of thousands of people marched, leading to sporadic clashes with police.The marchers came to London by train and coach for what was called a ""festival of free speech,"" but speeches during the event spread racist conspiracy theories and anti-Muslim comments across Whitehall, The Guardian reported.Police said some officers were punched, kicked, and hit by bottles thrown from the edges of the ""Unite the Kingdom"" rally. More than 1,000 officers were deployed, with reinforcements in helmets and riot shields sent in when needed, as per a report by news agency Associated Press.According to police, the crowd count was estimated at 1,10,000 to 1,50,000 people, much larger than expected. However, it was still smaller than the pro-Palestinian march in November 2023 that drew a crowd count of about 300,000 people.A rival protest, the ""March Against Fascism"" organized by Stand Up To Racism, attracted a crowd count of around 5,000 participants.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founded the English Defense League and is one of the most prominent far-right figures in Britain.The march was presented as a defense of free speech. However, much of the messaging from speakers, including far-right politicians from Europe, centered on migration.""We are both subject to the same process of the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture, you and we are being colonized by our former colonies,"" French politician Eric Zemmour said.Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and owner of X, joined by video and criticized the UK government. ""There’s something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion, but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration,"" he said.Robinson told the crowd that migrants had more rights in court than the ""British public, the people that built this nation.""The rallies come amid political debate in the UK over migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats without authorization. This summer saw several anti-migrant protests outside hotels housing asylum-seekers, following the conviction of an Ethiopian man for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in London. Some of these protests turned violent and led to arrests.At the ""Unite the Kingdom"" march, participants carried St George’s flags and the union jack and chanted ""we want our country back.""Flags have become more common across the UK in recent months, with some viewing them as national pride and others as a sign of growing nationalism.Protesters held placards saying ""stop the boats,"" ""send them home,"" and ""enough is enough, save our children.""Counter-protesters carried signs that read ""refugees welcome"" and ""smash the far right,"" while chanting ""stand up, fight back.""Robinson’s supporters also shouted crude remarks about UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and expressed support for slain US conservative activist Charlie Kirk.","Far-right activist tommy robinson drew a crowd count in six figures for the anti immigrant ""unite the kingdom"" rally.

Durga Prasad Subedi, the husband, was one of three men who commandeered a Royal Nepal Airlines de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft in 1973 that had Bollywood star Mala Sinha among the passengers.Speaking fondly of Karki (73), Prof Dipak Malik, a retired BHU professor and former director of Gandhian Institute of Studies, said: ""We have had a cordial relationship with her since her days in BHU... We are happy Nepal is going to get a neutral and honest person to lead the country.""""I do not forget to meet her whenever I go to Nepal,"" he added, having last visited her in Nov 2024. Prof Malik highlighted Karki's strong reputation for integrity, zero tolerance for corruption, and political neutrality, and landmark rulings against corrupt officials that earned her widespread respect.Prof Malik said Karki met her husband, a Nepali Congress youth leader who led the June 10, 1973 hijacking during the protests against the Panchayat regime of King Mahendra, while studying at BHU.The other two hijackers were Nagendra Dhungel and Basanta Bhattarai. The operation was orchestrated to fund rebellion against the monarchy. Among the conspirators were future Nepal PMs Girija Prasad Koirala and Sushil Koirala.According to reports, the three hijackers directed the pilot to land in Forbesganj, a border town in Bihar near Nepal's Biratnagar. The hijackers got off the plane there and fled into the jungle with a large amount of cash which, according to reports, belonged to a Nepalese bank and was being transported on the flight to Kathmandu.Subedi went into hiding in Varanasi after the incident and was ultimately arrested after Emergency was imposed in India in 1975. He remained in jail for two years before being handed over to Nepalese authorities.The other hijackers were also convicted and jailed but released after the Emergency was lifted in India.In a recent interview to CNN-News18, Karki called herself a ""friend of India"", attributing this bond to her time at BHU. ""My years at BHU left a lasting impression,"" she said, remembering her teachers and friends. Karki emphasised the long-standing relationship between India and Nepal, highlighting India's support and goodwill towards Nepal. Talking about the Indian leadership, she said she has ""a good impression of Modi-ji"".Born on June 7, 1952, in Biratnagar, Karki obtained a BA from Mahendra Morang Campus in 1972, followed by an MA from BHU. She obtained a law degree from Nepal's Tribhuvan University in 1978 and began her legal career in 1979, becoming a senior advocate in 2007 and a Supreme Court judge in 2010. Karki served as the acting chief justice of Nepal's Supreme Court from April 13, 2016 to July 10, 2016, and then as chief justice until June 7, 2017.","Sushila karki has an ma in political science from banaras hindu university in 1975.

'Steadily progressing': Russia reaffirms strong bond with India; asserts US attempts to disrupt alliance will fail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/steadily-progressing-russia-reaffirms-strong-bond-with-india-asserts-us-attempts-to-disrupt-alliance-will-fail/articleshow/123887010.cms,"PM Modi and Russian President Putin

Moscow on Sunday praised its longstanding relationship with Delhi, describing it as “reliable and steadily progressing” and warning that any effort to disrupt the partnership is “destined to fail. ”The Russian foreign ministry welcomed India’s commitment to continue and expand multifaceted cooperation with Russia, despite pressure from US President Donald Trump to impose US-like tariffs on Indian goods for continuing to buy Russian oil.Officials added that “frankly, anything else would be hard to imagine,” as quoted by RT International.The ministry highlighted that New Delhi’s approach, despite Western criticism, reflects “the spirit and traditions of long-standing Russia-India friendship” and embodies what it called “strategic autonomy in international affairs.”Moscow emphasised that the partnership between Russia and India is based on “the highest value of sovereignty and the primacy of national interests,” making the relationship “reliable, predictable and truly strategic in nature.”Officials noted that the two countries are engaged in large-scale joint projects across various fields, including civilian and military production, manned space missions, nuclear power, and Indian investments in Russian oil exploration projects.The ministry also highlighted ongoing cooperation on payment systems, expanding the use of national currencies, and creating alternative transport and logistics routes. These initiatives are described as long-term efforts and not merely a response to “unfavorable geopolitical realities.”The comments come amid rising tensions with the United States, which last month imposed unprecedented duties on most Indian products, including an initial 25% tariff and an additional 25% “penalty” for Indian purchases of Russian oil and defense equipment.US officials claimed India’s energy imports from Russia have indirectly fueled the Ukraine conflict. India rejected these accusations, calling Washington’s move “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.”The US measures also followed stalled efforts to reach a bilateral trade deal. While officials confirmed this week that negotiations have restarted, earlier reports suggested India was refusing to give concessions on agriculture and dairy, areas it regards as “very big red lines.”","Russian foreign ministry welcomes india's commitment to expand cooperation.

The Indian-built jets are expected to feature longer-range air-to-ground missiles than the Scalp used in Pakistan strikes.Dassault plans to establish a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility for Rafale’s M-88 engines in Hyderabad, complementing an existing maintenance firm in India.Indian partners such as Tata are likely to be involved in the production.The IAF sees the deal as crucial to bolstering its force structure alongside Su-30 MKIs, the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mark 1A, of which 180 have already been ordered, and the indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet planned for induction beyond 2035.","The deal is estimated to be worth over rs 2 lakh crore, with more than 60 percent indigenous content.

The announcement followed PM Narendra Modi’s bilateral meeting with his counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam in Varanasi.The 2 countries signed several other agreements aimed at helping Mauritius improve infrastructure and healthcare, augment maritime security and enhance defence preparedness, while allowing India to expand its footprint in the Indian Ocean. The projects announced under the package, along with budgetary assistance of $ 25 million, are together worth $ 680 million.The PM said both sides will work towards enabling trade in local currencies. Modi also said the projects, based on both grant and grant-cum-line of credit basis, are designed to support Mauritius’ needs and priorities, adding India will advance projects such as the Chagos Marine Protected Area, ATC Tower at the international airport and the expansion of highways and ring roads.“This package is not assistance. It is an investment in our shared future,” said Modi in his media remarks after the meeting, adding Mauritius was not a partner but family for India.The PM also announced signing of an agreement for cooperation in the field of hydrography, saying that, over the next 5 years, the 2 countries will work together on joint surveys, navigation charts, and hydrographic data of the Mauritius EEZ.Mauritius EEZ has expanded significantly after its recent treaty with the UK established its sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India was Mauritius’ preferred partner in the latter’s pursuit of protecting and securing its interests in the region. “It has many more responsibilities now. It needs maritime resources, and to be able to fully develop and exploit those resources, it will need assistance, and India is a preferred partner in providing that assistance,” said Misri.India had strongly backed the transfer of Chagos sovereignty to Mauritius through the treaty that also allowed the UK to retain control of the Diego Garcia island from where the UK and US operate a vital military base. In his remarks after the meeting, Ramgoolam appreciated India’s support.“We want to visit the Chagos Islands, including Diego Garcia, to plant our flag. The British offered us a vessel, but we said we preferred one from India because, symbolically, it would be more meaningful,"" said Ramgoolam.Modi also said in his statement that a free, open, secure, stable, and prosperous Indian Ocean is a shared priority. “In this context, India remains fully committed to strengthening the security of Mauritius’s EEZ and enhancing its maritime capacity,” said the PM, adding India has always stood as the first responder and a net security provider in the Indian Ocean region. The PM highlighted the refitting of the Mauritius Coast Guard ship that is being undertaken in India and also training of its officers here.The PM congratulated Ramgoolam for the Chagos Agreement, calling it a historic milestone for Mauritius’ sovereignty. “India has always supported decolonization, and the full recognition of Mauritius’ sovereignty. India has always stood firmly with Mauritius in this journey,” he said, adding that Mauritius was a key part of India’s Neighbourhood First policy and Vision MAHASAGAR.

Envoy Drops Bombshell | Watch

NEW DELHI: Chinese Embassy officials of interfering directly in the local affairs of South Asian countries, particularly in Nepal, former Tibetan Prime Minister-in-exile Lobsang Sangay claimed, and also warned India to be vigilant about its dealings with Beijing.In an conversation at ANI podcast, Sangay voiced concern over China’s “expansionist” policies and its efforts to “checkmate” India’s influence in the region.Asked whether India, like some Southeast Asian nations, avoids the Tibet issue to preserve ties with Beijing, Sangay replied that he did not believe India followed that approach, but stressed that “China is systematically working” to curb New Delhi’s reach.""India has a bigger stake with China,"" Sangay said. ""Just look at not just Tibet, not just the border area. Look at all the neighbouring countries. In Southeast Asia or Central Asia, wherever India wants to have its influence or relationship, China is always there to checkmate.""Using Nepal as an example, he alleged that Chinese officials had become “the most powerful” players in Kathmandu, “perhaps more powerful than the Indian or American embassies.”He said similar patterns of interference were visible in Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. “They come and interfere and influence. I don’t want to say they control you, but they come inside your own house,” he said.""And the larger point that you raised about, you know, in Asia, how many people will take up the issue of Tibet because they don't want to have conflict with China, which is a fact on the one hand. On the other hand, what we say is that what happened to Tibet will happen to you. So if you don't understand and study Tibet, it will happen to you,"" he added.He pointed to Nepal as a clear example of Chinese political overreach. ""Let's say Nepal -- they didn't believe so, right? Now, yes, the Chinese embassy and the officials are interfering in local issues,"" he said. ""The Chinese Embassy, perhaps, some of my friends say, is the most powerful in Kathmandu -- more powerful than the Indian Embassy or American Embassy. Some say that.""He highlighted China's full physical control over Tibet and its current approach in other countries. ""The difference is the physical control of Tibet,"" Sangay said. ""Other than that, political influence of the Chinese government -- and through the embassies -- in all these neighbouring countries and all these Asian countries is a fact.""He also framed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visits to Tibet as strategic signals aimed at India, noting the region’s shared border and China’s large military deployment there. While transcripts of Xi’s latest speech to troops were not released—coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Beijing—Sangay said he was “sure” it echoed previous calls to “prepare for war or incursion” against India.Reflecting on his own experience, Sangay described how Tibetans had found a temporary home in India after fleeing their homeland. “As a Buddhist, we believe in impermanence. Once you lose your country, you’re nomadic,” he said, adding that India became “our home” after Tibetans fled. Although he now lives in the United States, he said he feels an enduring cultural bond with India: “As soon as I come out of Indira Gandhi Airport, when you smell the Delhi air… for your mind, it’s just calming. ”He stressed that ties between Tibetans and Indians remain strong. “Whenever I meet Indians, I immediately say Namaskar… immediately, you become friends.”Sangay also recalled how, during his tenure from 2011 to 2021, Chinese pressure often accompanied periods of India–China rapprochement. He cited the 2018 “Thank You India” event planned by the Tibetan administration, which was scaled back after India reportedly advised officials to avoid participation in the midst of efforts to ease tensions with Beijing.Despite such episodes, Sangay emphasised India’s consistent support. ""No matter which party or which person becomes Prime Minister, India has always treated Tibetans well. We cannot think of any better host for Tibetans,"" he said, adding that the preservation of Tibetan identity, education, and religious institutions has been possible due to India's support.","Former tibetan prime minister-in-exile lobsang sangay warns india to be vigilant about its dealings with beijing.

Suspense Grows in Nepal PM Race: Four Names, One Decision, A Nation on Edge

NEW DELHI: Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh on Friday said that Operation Sindoor , the punitive strike targeting terror bases in Pakistan, served as a “reality check” for India’s armed forces, highlighting areas where the country can improve its defence capabilities.Speaking at the Southern Command Defence Tech Seminar (STRIDE 2025), Singh noted that the operation revealed certain capability gaps, including in electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems, low-level radars and the need for a stronger ecosystem to manufacture military-grade drones capable of operating in GPS-denied and contested environments.“It's pretty clear in the context of the geopolitical situation now that most countries are paying a lot of attention to defence and hard power again. Given our neighborhood, India is no exception, and we've just had this experience with Operation Sindoor, which was in some ways a reality check for us in terms of where we can do better, where we need to adapt to changing needs for future warfare,” Singh said.In the context of military operation, defence secretary said that it highlighted certain capability gaps in the armed forces.These gaps included areas such as electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems and the need for a stronger manufacturing ecosystem for military-grade drones that can operate effectively in GPS-denied and contested environments.He also pointed to the requirement for improvements in low-level radar systems. Singh added that these were areas where the armed forces recognized the need to strengthen and enhance capabilities.The defence secretary also emphasised India’s push for indigenous defence production, highlighting that 88 per cent of defence capital expenditure in 2024 was spent within the country.When asked about solutions to address these capability gaps, Singh said the armed forces were given flexibility through emergency procurement rules to quickly acquire equipment needed immediately.For the long term, the focus remains on developing indigenous equipment in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Singh added that while short-term purchases from global suppliers may be necessary, the ultimate goal is to achieve fully indigenous capabilities across all areas.He also reaffirmed that DRDO would continue to work on indigenous alternatives for critical systems, ensuring self-reliance in defence production.The defence secretary praised India’s multi-layered air defence system, which performed effectively during military operation. He said the system prevented major losses or casualties despite repeated attempts by drones and missiles to penetrate it.Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7 in response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. It was designed as a targeted campaign to dismantle terror infrastructure along and beyond the Line of Control , reflecting precision, professionalism and strategic purpose.","Rajesh kumar singh said that operation sindoor served as a “reality check’ for india’s armed forces.

“As a society, we must be reminded that human life is sacred and never disposable.

We must learn again to disagree with words, not weapons. That is exactly what Charlie Kirk modeled — he met opposition with dialogue, not violence, and proved that conviction and civility can walk hand in hand. Evil does not have the final word. Jesus does. And because of Him, Charlie’s voice still echoes — calling us to live with conviction, courage, and hope.

Well done good and faithful servant.”

Charlie Kirk Assassin’s Motive: FBI Uncovers Tyler Robinson’s Hateful Motive Behind Killing Kirk

Who is Lance Twiggs ?







The assassination of 31-year-old Charlie Kirk, known to be openly transphobic, took a new turn Saturday as it was revealed that the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, has a trans partner . The Daily Mail revealed the name of the trans partner -- transforming from a man to a woman -- as Lance Twiggs. According to the report, Twiggs lived with Tyler Robinson in a three-bedroom apartment in Saint George, Utah.Twiggs is the person who received text messages from Tyler after the shooting about stashing a gun. Twiggs' grandfather Jerry Twiggs told Daily Mail that he was unable to comment on rumours that Twiggs is trans and there was a transgender motive to Kirk's murder. He also said he never met Robinson but he confirmed that his grandchild had been talking with the police.Authorities are yet to confirm a motive, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox told the Wall Street Journal that Robinson was, 'deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology'.South Utah native, Twiggs, studied at Utah Tech University, according to his Facebook page. Robinson, 22, was also taking electrician training at a nearby technical college. Like Tyler, Twiggs is also an avid gamer. He posted himself on social media playing popular games including Apex Legends, Valorant and Rocket League.Other comical videos he shared included adding spaghetti to an Italian sandwich and microwaving a bottle of Mountain Dew. Friends told the Daily Mail that Robinson and Twiggs were part of a large group chat of dozens of gamer friends mostly from Robinson’s alma mater, Pine View High School, hosted on online chat network Discord.Twiggs, however, has not been named in the affidavit that the police filed supporting the murder, obstruction and felony firearm charges against Robinson. ""The messages also refer to engraving bullets, and a mention of a scope and the rifle being unique,"" the affidavit said. ""Messages from the contact Tyler also mention that he had changed outfits.""","Tyler robinson reportedly has a trans boyfriend, lance twiggs.

The partner of Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating US President Donald Trump ally Charlie Kirk, is cooperating fully with investigators and had no knowledge of the alleged plan, senior FBI officials told Fox News Digital.Robinson, who lived in St George, Utah, shared an apartment with the individual, described by officials as a male transitioning to female. The FBI confirmed the two were in a romantic relationship.One FBI official said the partner has been “extremely cooperative,” stressing that the person “had no idea” Robinson was planning to target Kirk. The partner has not been accused of any wrongdoing, according to Fox News.Investigators revealed they obtained text messages and communications between Robinson and the partner, which helped them identify Robinson as the suspect. Agents also seized computers and other evidence from the couple’s apartment, which has been sent to FBI headquarters in Quantico for analysis.While the Bureau declined to say whether Robinson’s partner could face charges, a spokesperson emphasised the scale of the probe.“The FBI is investigating a record number of tips. Every connection, every group, every link will be investigated, and anyone involved in this matter, anywhere in the world they might be, will be brought to justice,"" the spokesperson told Fox News.The apartment is located in the same southern Utah community where Robinson’s parents live, about four hours from Utah Valley University in Orem. It was on the university’s campus that Kirk, 31, was fatally shot on Wednesday while addressing a crowd.Authorities believe Robinson fired a single round from the roof of a building roughly 200 yards away.","Fbi says shooter tyler robinson's transgender partner 'had no idea'; fully cooperating in investigation.

NFL’s lack of consistency compared to past public statements drew more criticism



""Last night’s moment was the league’s decision. It’s up to the clubs for this Sunday’s games,""

""There have been moments following school shootings or an attack on a house of worship such as the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. There also have been moments following major international incidents such as Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 and weather-related incidents such as major hurricanes and fires,""

The Green Bay Packers and the NFL held a moment of silence for conservative activist Charlie Kirk before Thursday Night Football against the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field. Kirk, 31, was shot and killed Wednesday during a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.The tribute took place about 25 minutes before kickoff. The in-stadium announcement said, “The National Football League asks that you please join us in a moment of silent reflection following the murder of Charlie Kirk. The NFL condemns all violence in our communities. It will take all of us to stop hate. Thank you.”Former President Donald Trump confirmed Kirk’s death on Wednesday and later said he would posthumously award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The FBI released a photo of a person of interest Thursday, but no arrests have been made.Fox News senior NFL writer Armando Salguero shared video of the silence. The MLFootball account also circulated the clip, describing the moment as a league-wide honor. Critics, however, said the execution fell flat.One frustrated fan in attendance wrote, “They did it when the stadium wasn’t even half full half an hour ago, and it went right to. It was terrible.” Another attendee added, “It was ridiculous; they didn’t even display it on the jumbotron.”On social media, the pushback was even stronger. One user posted, “We doing for just anyone now? There was a school shooting yesterday (AND today) AND a shooting at a US naval academy but I guess that’s not important.” Another wrote, “That wasn’t even a moment. Couldn’t even count one second of silence.”The NFL’s silence in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s assassination frustrated many. The league has issued statements in the past on events such as the killing of George Floyd and support for LGBTQ rights. The absence of a message for Kirk led some to accuse the NFL of picking and choosing when to speak up.Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker posted Kirk’s final text message, calling him a “strong witness for Christ.” Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson also paid tribute, as did New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who wrote, “Praying for him and his family. Charlie did great things for our country!! Political Violence NEEDS TO STOP!! Pray for our country man. This is disgusting and Sad!!”ESPN analyst Pat McAfee called the shooting “startling, saddening, and maddening.” Former NFL players Tim Tebow and Julian Edelman also acknowledged Kirk’s death.Former NFL punter Chris Kluwe, on the other hand, stirred controversy on BlueSky this week after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Kluwe, who earlier this year lost his job as a high school football coach for calling the MAGA movement “Nazi,” posted a profanity-laced message backing Sen. Elizabeth Warren for rejecting claims that Democratic rhetoric had fueled the attack. In his post, Kluwe argued that Republicans are responsible for the hostile climate, writing that they “could stop it at any time” and shouldn’t be treated like “children. ”The NFL addressed its tribute to Charlie Kirk in a statement released Friday, noting that teams will decide for themselves whether to observe a similar gesture on Sunday. During Thursday night’s matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Washington Commanders, the league held a moment of silence for Kirk before kickoff.the statement read, according to multiple reports.The league explained the decision by pointing to its history of holding moments of silence after tragedies or significant losses.the statement continued. It added that tributes have also honored figures within the NFL family, from Damar Hamlin to Kobe Bryant, and reflected on changes to pre-game protocols after the death of George Floyd.Outside football, the New York Yankees held a moment of silence before their Wednesday game against the Detroit Tigers. Trump later appeared at Yankee Stadium during a separate 9/11 ceremony.","Green bay packers and nfl held a moment of silence for conservative activist charlie kirk before thursday night football against the washington commanders at lambeau field.

Wayne Gretzky’s silence amid Trump’s mounting controversies

Is personal loyalty blinding public responsibility?

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

Wayne Gretzky, hockey legend and longtime public figure, has found himself at the center of controversy due to his noticeable silence amid the growing scandals surrounding President Donald Trump . Known as ""The Great One"" for his record-breaking NHL career, Gretzky’s friendship with Trump has led many to wonder whether personal loyalty is taking precedence over moral responsibility.Over the past several years, Donald Trump has been embroiled in multiple scandals, from the January 6 Capitol riot to numerous allegations of misconduct during his presidency. Despite these serious accusations, Wayne Gretzky has remained publicly silent. Unlike other public figures who have openly criticized or distanced themselves from Trump, Gretzky has consistently avoided commenting on the former president’s controversial actions.Sources close to Gretzky suggest that the two share a longstanding friendship, dating back to when Donald Trump frequently attended high-profile NHL events. Some insiders believe that Gretzky’s silence stems from a personal sense of loyalty rather than political alignment or public indifference.Critics argue that Gretzky’s silence is troubling, especially given his influence as a global sports icon. “When public figures stay silent in the face of moral wrongdoing, they send a dangerous message,” says political analyst Laura Jennings. Many believe that neutrality in such high-stakes matters amounts to tacit approval.Supporters, however, argue that Gretzky’s primary focus has always been hockey, not politics, and that his friendship with Donald Trump should not overshadow his legacy in the sport. Still, the debate continues over whether Gretzky’s decision to stay quiet is an attempt to protect his personal relationship or a failure to take a stand when it matters most.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky and the Canadian identity crisis: why the Great One no longer defines hockey As public pressure grows, all eyes remain on Gretzky—will he continue to stay silent, or will he break his silence and address the controversy directly?","Wayne gretzky, hockey legend and longtime public figure, has found himself at the center of controversy.
