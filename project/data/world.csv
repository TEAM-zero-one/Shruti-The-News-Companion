Miraj’s sitars find a home abroad but face an uncertain future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mirajs-sitars-find-a-home-abroad-but-face-an-uncertain-future/articleshow/118131011.cms,"The sitars of Miraj still sing. They resonate with the same depth of sound that once captivated the world through Pandit Ravi Shankar’s fingers, enchanted by Vilayat Khan’s mastery, and found an unexpected champion in George Harrison’s “Norwegian Wood”.. For now, the chisels still strike, the polish still gleams, and the strings still hum. But how much longer?The artisans of this small city in Maharashtra’s Sangli district have breathed life into the sitar for 300 years. Today, these same hands, calloused by generations of craftsmanship, struggle to hold on to a tradition that is more inheritance than profession.Inside the timeworn workshops in the narrow alleys of Miraj, the artisans stand at a crossroads. While the craft wavers at home, Miraj’s sitars are finding a market across the oceans. In US, Germany, and UK, musicians cherish the handcrafted instruments.The demand for these instruments is vast — greater than ever, in fact — but the hands that craft them are growing fewer. Where once thousands laboured, only a few hundred remain.Mohsin Mirajkar, a seventh-generation sitar maker, knows this struggle intimately. At 43, he has dedicated his life to carving, stringing, and tuning the instrument that defines his family’s legacy. Yet, he watches helplessly as younger generations turn away.“The effort it takes to make a sitar is immense,” he said. “With less effort, they can earn more in IT or engineering. The demand is huge, but we can’t even meet 25% of it.”The irony is stark. While the world craves the authentic voice of Miraj’s sitars, the very hands that shape them are forced to consider a future without them.“During the pandemic, only doctors and essential workers were in demand,” said Mohammed Saeem Shikalgar, a young sitar maker, who balances the art with his medical studies. “I love making sitars, but I needed a backup. If this tradition fades, I will have something to fall back on.”To the untrained eye, a sitar might seem like just another instrument, its shape familiar, its sound enchanting but distant.Yet, behind its curved frame lies a labour of profound patience.It begins with a kaddu (gourd) — immersed in water, softened, and then dried until the moisture evaporates, leaving behind a hard ened shell. This humble vegetable is carved and shaped into a hollow body, its curves sculpted with an understanding that is more instinct than technique.Craftsman Imran Salim described the process: “The polishing, the carving, the bridge, the turning pegs… everything has to be perfect. Each sitar takes about 20 to 25 days. You can’t rush it. It must be allowed to find its own voice.”But time, the very thing these artisans honour, is now their greatest adversary. The rise of mass-produced sitars — factory-made imitations that lack the warmth of handmade ones — has only added to their woes.Miarj’s fame was built upon its musical heritage, attracting luminaries like Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, Pandit Venkatesh Kumar, Ustad Rashid Khan, and sitar virtuosos Shujaat Khan and Ustad Shahid Parvez Khan. Even Hridaynath Mangeshkar turned to Miraj for instruments that carried not just notes but soul.The city’s sitars still travel across borders, finding homes in concert halls, in the hands of maestros, in the quiet corners of music lovers who understand their worth. Yet, one cannot ignore the silence creeping in behind the melodies.","The artisans of miraj in maharashtra have breathed life into the sitar for 300 years.

There Should Be Clearer Guidelines for Content Creators Should Be More Mindful of Their Words

NEW DELHI: The Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar faction) became the latest in chorus of political parties slamming YouTuber and podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia for his ""inappropriate"" remark on the show India's Got Latent, calling it ""in poor taste"". However, the party also raised issue against the ""disproportionate outrage"" surrounding the controversy.Party spokesperson Anish Gawande warned that the backlash could be used to justify tighter government control over digital content creators under the proposed Broadcasting Bill.""Ranveer's comments on India’s Got Latent were in poor taste, but the disproportionate outrage risks setting a dangerous precedent,"" he said in a post on X.Gawande said that while Allahbadia’s comments were offensive, the response should not pave the way for increased censorship. “Many of us have spoken out against the proposed Broadcasting Bill, which threatens independent digital creators—we should not let this case become the pivot upon which the bill gains public support,” he said.The proposed legislation, designed to overhaul India's broadcasting regulatory framework, had sparked concerns about classifying independent news creators as broadcasters. Initially intended to focus on OTT platforms and digital news, the scope of the legislation was later broadened to include social media accounts, TOI had earlier reported. ""This law is not about accountability—it’s about control. The government has already scrutinised political YouTubers for their 2024 election coverage, and this bill would make it easier to regulate and silence them. We must be careful. Outrage against one creator should not justify a law that will curb free speech for all,"" Gawande added.Allahbadia, widely known as BeerBiceps, apologised after facing a wave of criticism for his controversial question to a contestant on the show. In a video statement, he admitted his comment was ""not just inappropriate, it wasn't even funny"" and distanced himself from comedy, saying, ""Comedy is not my forte. I am just here to say sorry.""A formal complaint was lodged against Allahbadia, comedian Samay Raina, and influencer Apoorva Makhija with the Mumbai Police and Maharashtra Women's Commission, accusing them of using obscene language to gain online popularity.The national human rights commission (NHRC) has also taken cognisance of the matter, writing to YouTube’s public policy head in India and calling for the episode’s removal. The NHRC’s letter alleged the show contained ""highly objectionable, inappropriate, and obscene remarks,"" which violated various laws, including the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Information Technology Act.Allahbadia, who has collaborated with the government in the past and received a National Creators Award from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has since requested the show’s producers to remove the controversial sections. “All I can say in the end is sorry. I hope you can forgive me as a human being,” he said in his apology video.","Nationalist congress party (sharad pawar faction) slams youtuber and podcaster ranveer allahbadia for his ""inappropriate"" remark on india's got latent.

"Should convicts be barred for life from polls? SC seeks responses from Centre, EC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/should-convicts-be-barred-for-life-from-polls-sc-seeks-responses-from-centre-ec/articleshow/118129773.cms,"Next SC hearing on convicts fighting polls on March 4

NEW DELHI: If a convicted person is barred from government employment, what is the rationale behind provisions in the Representation of the People Act that allow a convicted criminal to contest elections and become a lawmaker six years after he has served the sentence, Supreme Court asked on Monday.After two landmark judgments on electoral reforms - mandatory disclosure of assets and criminal antecedents by candidates, and prescribing automatic disqualification on conviction and sentence beyond two years - a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan decided to foray into a possible third by agreeing to test the constitutional validity of parts of Sections 8 & 9 of RP Act - should there be a life ban on the convicted on contesting election?The SC asked government and EC to file replies to the plea by advocate-petitioner Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay in three weeks.Supreme Court said if Union government and EC did not file their responses within the stipulated period, it would still proceed with the matter and posted further hearing on March 4.Under the RP Act, a person is eligible to contest elections six years after he has served out the sentence awarded to him upon conviction in a criminal case or one concerning moral turpitude or corruption. Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Vikas Singh gave the example of a convicted criminal not being eligible for a peon's job in government but being eligible, six years after completion of prison term, to be a lawmaker. Drawing the court's attention to rising crimes by juveniles, Singh said even if held guilty for murder, a juvenile aged 17 would not get imprisonment of more than three years. This means, by the age of 26, he would be eligible to contest elections and if backed by a political party, he would stand a fair chance of becoming a lawmaker.Though this example caught the bench's imagination, Justice Manmohan appeared more aware of ground realities and machinations of convicted politicians in getting around even the six-year ban, making their wives either the CM or lawmaker. ""We must not do something that would provide another ruse for politicians to retain control through remote control,"" he said.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Vijay Hansaria supported the petition and told the court that the time had come to test the constitutional validity of certain parts of Sections 8 and 9 of RP Act that allowed a convicted criminal/politician to enter/re-enter the political arena.Tamil Nadu's additional advocate general Amit Anand Tiwari said the main stakeholders, national and state parties, should be given notice for their responses. The bench said these days SC proceedings were widely reported and it would hear arguments from all stakeholders, whosoever decided to address the court on this issue.In 2003, in People's Union for Civil Liberties case, SC had for the first time directed candidates contesting an election to declare their assets and criminal antecedents. This order was reinforced by another order in 2018, mandating candidates to file affidavits giving details of their criminal antecedents and details of their own and spouses' assets.","Next sc hearing on convicts fighting polls on march 4.

India to cite recent duty cuts in bid to escape Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-cite-recent-duty-cuts-in-bid-to-escape-trump-tariffs/articleshow/118129430.cms,"25% steel tariff won't hit India's shipments to US

NEW DELHI: As President Trump issued fresh threats of 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US (on top of existing metal duties), India is getting ready to unbracket itself from countries he has called ""worst tariff manipulators"", citing its recent duty cuts to point to a reduction in average duties in recent years.On Monday, Trump's economic adviser Kevin Hassett said India has high tariffs that lock out imports, and added that Modi had a ""lot to discuss"" with Trump as they meet later this week.Following Budget announcements on tariff cuts for bikes, including the iconic Harley Davidson, and other products in the run-up to PM Modi's meeting with Trump, officials said they have prepared the ground for the PM to point to Trump that his govt is sensitive to White House's concerns and has undertaken a comprehensive look at tariffs to bring them down to Asean rates. They also pointed out that the reduction was a signal to the world that tariff rates were not high as perceived by some trading partners.The reduction in the Union Budget is estimated to have lowered the average duty by a percentage point to 10.6%. Average tariffs on imports from US have also come down over the years. In fact, for the top 30 imports from the US, including oil, gas, diamonds and airplanes, the levy is going up to 7.5% at the most, officials have said.Officials are also laying store by US' strategic requirement to have good strategic ties with India, that Trump may not breach New Delhi's pain barrier on threshold.Though Modi and Trump have enjoyed a good rapport since the latter's first term, the govt recognises that nothing can be taken for granted while dealing with a US president who sees himself as a transactionalist with an unrivalled capability to get the best deals for the US.While the proposed 25% tariff on steel and aluminium has rocked the world, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on India's shipments to the US. During the last fiscal year, India's export of iron and steel was estimated at $475 million, with iron and steel products adding up to another $2.8 billion. Export of aluminium and articles made of this metal were estimated at just under $950 million in 2023-24. The largest sources of US steel imports are Brazil, Canada and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to govt and American Iron and Steel Institute data.In 2018, the previous Trump administration had imposed 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium, citing national security concerns. These tariffs covered most primary steel products, except stainless steel, and included steel pipes and tubes. The tariffs applied to most countries, triggering a wave of retaliatory measures and escalating tensions in global trade. This had also prompted American auto companies to slash production.Trump had clubbed India, along with China, Brazil and Mexico, as a high-tariff country and threatened action. So far, however, India has not faced any specific action and both sides have spoken about strengthening trade and economic relations. Modi's meeting with the US president is expected to only smoothen the process, given the close bond that the two leaders share.Trump's announcement pushed up gold prices, seen as a safe haven during turbulent times, while the dollar inched higher. While the sensex closed 550 points lower on Monday, global stocks seem to have shrugged off the threat. Global markets have been on the edge, wary of a possible trade war. The prospect of higher tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium in particular is, however, not good news for India as the domestic industry is already complaining of cheap imports flooding the markets. This could get worse if Trump goes ahead with his plan, likely Monday, as China would look at the vast Indian market to cover some of the probable losses in the US.The domestic steel industry has petitioned govt to impose 20-25% safeguard duty on steel to shield domestic players from predatory imports. Small businesses and exporters are, however, wary of these levies and have sought a ""balanced response"" so that Indian consumers do not end up paying more. An analysis by GTRI showed that India's iron and steel imports have grown from $10.4 billion in FY2018, when the US-China trade war began, to $18.6 billion in FY2024.","25% steel tariff won't hit india's shipments to the us.

Did USAID and George Soros Foundation give money to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust or not? I demand that Congress should answer and a govt probe be conducted,"" Dubey said as Congress members protested.Dubey's attack coincided with growing outrage in America over details of USAID's funding - from promotion of a transgender concert and publication of transgender comic books in South American countries to promotion of atheism in Nepal and helping migrant workers in Tamil Nadu ""deal with loneliness"". Last week, Republican Senator Geoge Kennedy brought up the issue of funds for opening of a clinic for transgenders in India and got the support of the influential billionaire Trump ally, Elon Musk.Dubey saw USAID's hand in Nepal ceasing to be a Hindu republic, and blamed the US agency also for the turmoil in Bangladesh.Several Congress members rose in protest against Dubey's remarks and sought to raise a point of order but were disallowed by presiding officer Sandhya Ray who said such provisions did not apply to Zero Hour proceedings.

RAIPUR: At least 31 Maoist insurgents and two security personnel were killed Sunday in a fierce gunfight in the dense forests of Chhattisgarh's Bastar region, one of the last Naxal strongholds in the country. The operation is ongoing and officials expect the Maoist death toll to rise.This is the second-largest Maoist casualty count in a single security strike, after 38 guerrillas were gunned down in Narayanpur's Thulthuli on October 3 last year. Since 2024, more than 280 Maoists have been killed in Bastar. The number of Maoists killed this year has risen to 81 in just six weeks. Major operations include the killing of 16 Naxal fighters in Gariaband on Jan 21 and eight in Gangaloor on February 2. Security forces have also faced fatalities. On January 6, eight constables and a driver were killed when Maoists targeted their vehicle with an IED weighing nearly 70kg in Bijapur.Union home minister Amit Shah praised the security forces for the successful operation. ""The nation will always be indebted to these heroes.... I once again reaffirm that by March 31, 2026, we will eradicate Naxalism from the roots of this country so that no citizen loses their life due to it,"" he said. The gunfight erupted early Sunday after a contingent of over 650 security personnel launched a coordinated operation from multiple directions to hem in insurgents in the jungles of Bijapur's Indravati National Park.Intelligence reported the presence of a large group of Maoists and senior commanders.By late afternoon, 31 bodies of Maoist guerrillas had been recovered, Bastar deputy inspector general of police Kamlochan Kashyap said. Two securitymen were wounded, apart from the two killed.A large cache of Maoist weapons was seized, including AK-47s, SLRs, INSAS and .303 rifles, barrel grenade launchers (BGL) and explosives.

The Rumors Behind Musk’s Super Bowl Ad Campaign

Tesla and Electric Vehicles – The Super Bowl could be the perfect stage for Musk to unveil Tesla’s latest advancements, such as the highly anticipated Roadster 2.0 or new self-driving capabilities.

X (formerly Twitter) and Free Speech – Musk has repeatedly positioned X as a platform for unrestricted speech. A Super Bowl ad could promote its vision as the ""everything app.""

Dogecoin and Cryptocurrency – Musk has long been a supporter of Dogecoin. A playful ad could reinforce his support for the cryptocurrency, potentially driving up its value.

SpaceX and the Future of Space Travel – A teaser for the first human mission to Mars or a futuristic ad about space tourism would undoubtedly capture global attention.

Will Musk Attend Super Bowl LIX?

As the excitement builds for Super Bowl LIX , speculation is swirling about whether billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk will make a surprise appearance in the coveted lineup of commercials. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, known for his unconventional marketing strategies and social media presence, is rumored to be spending a staggering $40 million on multiple Super Bowl ads. But is there any truth to these claims? Here’s what we know so far.Super Bowl commercials are among the most expensive advertising slots in the world, with millions tuning in to watch the spectacle. This year, a viral tweet from a user suggested that Musk is planning to run five commercials during the game, allegedly targeting government spending inefficiencies, particularly through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).Musk has been vocal in his criticism of USAID, calling it a ""viper’s nest of radical-left Marxists"" and questioning its funding. His newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly been working to expose what he perceives as unnecessary expenditures. While there has been no official confirmation from Musk or his representatives, the billionaire has a history of making bold, unexpected moves, which keeps fans and critics on edge.If Musk were to air a Super Bowl ad, it would likely focus on one of his flagship ventures. Here are a few possible themes:Despite widespread speculation, Elon Musk did not attend the game. He was present at the last two Super Bowls—once with media mogul Rupert Murdoch and later with his son, X Æ A-12. With former U.S. President Donald Trump making history as the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl, many speculated whether Musk would do the same, especially considering his increasing political influence.",Speculation is swirling about whether billionaire entrepreneur elon musk will make a surprise appearance in the coveted lineup of commercials.

""disappeared""

In a hilarious yet wild twist, Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, is asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to return a Super Bowl ring that Putin allegedlyback in 2005. This whole drama resurfaced thanks to the release of Apple TV’s “The Dynasty” series, leaving everyone questioning: Did Putin really just walk off with Kraft's bling? Let’s dive into this strange, almost comical, story.Back in 2005, Kraft was in Russia for a business trip. Naturally, he took his Super Bowl ring along to show off—because who wouldn't, right? He had the world's attention, and Putin was in the room. According to Kraft, he showed the ring to Putin, who then put it on, made a chilling comment like,and then—just like that—took it. Yep, he walked away with it while three KGB agents apparently stood around, making it pretty clear this wasn’t your average “Hey, take a look at my ring” moment.Kraft’s ring was valued at around $25,000, although Super Bowl rings typically range between $30,000 and $50,000, depending on customization and diamond quality. So, it’s not exactly a cheap piece of jewelry—each ring is a symbol of victory, crafted with precision and sentiment. Now, imagine how much cooler it would look in Vladimir Putin’s collection of extravagant gifts from world leaders, which just so happens to include Kraft’s shiny treasure, proudly displayed in the Kremlin. Among rare artifacts and diplomatic tokens, the Super Bowl ring stands out as a unique, unexpected piece of sports history tucked away in Russia’s halls of power.After the ring mysteriously disappeared into Russian hands, Kraft publicly asked for it back. But here’s where things get weird. The White House reportedly told him to claim that he hadthe ring to Putin in order to avoid causing any tension in US-Russian relations. Kraft went along with it, stating the ring was a token of respect for the Russian people. However, he later admitted that wasn’t true at all—it was actually the U.S. government’s idea, not his.In the end, Russia insists the ring was a gift, so it's now part of Putin's private collection, safely housed in the Kremlin. But Kraft is not letting go. At a lighthearted event honoring Tom Brady, Kraft humorously asked for the ring back, joking that it hadand was still missing.This story is far from over, and with the public attention now back on it, maybe Kraft will get his bling back after all.Also read - How the Super Bowl Got Its Name: The Surprising Story Behind the Iconic Title","Robert kraft, owner of the new england patriots, is asking russian president vladimir putin to return a super bowl ring that putin allegedly stole in 2005.

Donald Trump's Super Bowl Prediction: Chiefs for the Win

, ""I have to go with Kansas City.""

“I’ve watched this great quarterback, who’s got a phenomenal wife, she is a Trump fan and a MAGA fan, I happen to love her, she’s a great person.”

Trump Makes History as First Sitting President to Attend Super Bowl

Donald Trump has made his Super Bowl LIX prediction loud and clear—he’s backing Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs to take home the Lombardi Trophy. In a recent interview, the former president not only praised Mahomes’ talent but also gave a special shoutout to his wife, Brittany Mahomes, calling her a “MAGA fan” and a “great person.”During his interview with Fox News' Bret Baier, Trump confidently statedHe highlighted Mahomes’ skill on the field and appeared to reference Brittany’s past support for him, saying,While Trump’s claim about Brittany being a MAGA supporter raised eyebrows, it’s not entirely out of the blue. In 2020, Brittany Mahomes liked several pro-Trump tweets, including one that criticized President Joe Biden’s policies. However, she later unliked them, sparking speculation about where she truly stands politically.While Trump is backing the Chiefs now, his history with the NFL has been anything but smooth. He previously feuded with the Philadelphia Eagles, even disinviting them from the White House in 2018 after their Super Bowl win. His clashes with the league over player protests also made headlines, making his current support for the Chiefs all the more interesting.Trump’s presence at Super Bowl LIX is historic—he becomes the first sitting U.S. president to attend the game. Security has been ramped up significantly, given the high-profile nature of the event.Upon arrival at Caesars Superdome, Trump participated in a meet-and-greet with honorary coin toss participants, including the families of victims from a recent terrorist attack and first responders from the New Orleans Police Department.With the Chiefs taking on the Eagles, the game is expected to be intense. Trump’s endorsement of Kansas City has sparked discussions, especially after his remarks about Brittany Mahomes. Now, all eyes are on the field to see if the Chiefs can prove him right.Also read - Super Bowl LIX Fashion Battle: Patrick Mahomes’ Teal Suit vs. Jalen Hurts’ Violet Look – Who Won the Style Game?","Donald trump has made his super bowl lix prediction loud and clear.

Normalised Indian hate? Why Vivek Ramaswamy was fired from DOGE but Marko Elez wasn't,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/normalised-indian-hate-why-vivek-ramaswamy-was-fired-from-doge-but-marko-elez-wasnt/articleshow/118121642.cms,"A Controversy That Won’t Die

JD Vance’s Response: Gaslighting or Genuine Belief?

The Hypocrisy: Why Wasn’t Vivek Given the Same Grace?

The Big Balls Moment: Musk’s Flippant Justification

The Takeaway: Who Gets to Be Forgiven?

There’s something insidious about how Indian Americans are treated in political and media circles. It’s not the outright racism—the kind that fills anonymous message boards or fuels hate crimes. It’s the casual, smirking kind, the type that doesn’t invite consequences. It’s the racist joke that lands a TV deal. The meme that goes viral. The “funny” stereotype that Hollywood keeps recycling.And it’s the double standard in outrage. Vivek Ramaswamy , a billionaire entrepreneur who once seemed destined to become the brown face of MAGA , found himself unceremoniously ousted from his government role for saying things about America that the establishment didn’t like. No poll. No second chances. Just the door.Meanwhile, Marko Elez—a 25-year-old former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer—posted “Normalize Indian Hate” on social media and was fired… before Elon Musk , backed by Vice President JD Vance , reinstated him after a poll on X. The same Musk who rants about cancel culture conveniently had no issue with Elez’s return.This isn’t just about Elez or Ramaswamy. It’s about how Indian Americans are treated in the public sphere: tolerated when useful, discarded when inconvenient.Elez’s tweet—“Normalize Indian Hate”—wasn’t some edgy joke. It was a straight-up racist proclamation, something that would have been career-ending if he had swapped “Indian” for any other group. Normalize Jewish Hate? Gone. Normalize White Hate? Fired. But Indian hate? A poll, some hand-wringing, and back in the office by Monday.Elez was initially forced out after the backlash but was quickly rehabilitated by Musk, who justified it with, “To err is human, to forgive divine.” Of course, forgiveness only applies when it’s a white conservative making the “mistake.”The contrast with Vivek Ramaswamy is impossible to ignore. The former biotech mogul turned MAGA cheerleader was dropped from DOGE, not for racism, not for corruption, but for questioning the establishment. Where was his second chance? Where was his poll?Indian Americans watching this unfold weren’t just angry. They were taking notes.When confronted about Elez’s reinstatement, JD Vance could have taken a stand. He could have said, “Yeah, actually, my wife and kids are Indian American, and I don’t think we should normalize hate against them.” Instead, he doubled down, framing the backlash as “emotional blackmail.”“For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,” Vance scoffed on X. “Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don’t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes.”It was the kind of gaslighting that would make a Reddit therapist proud. The issue wasn’t that Elez had made a mistake—it was that his mistake wasn’t seen as a big deal.Congressman Ro Khanna asked the obvious question: ""Are you going to tell him to apologize for saying ‘ Normalize Indian Hate ’ before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids.""Others were even less charitable. Journalist Wajahat Ali wrote: ""Your wife is Indian American. Your kids are Indian American. Elez said he wants to ‘normalize Indian hate.’ Have some pride, man. Have some dignity. For your family’s sake, you pathetic Reek.""Meanwhile, social media users pointed out the hypocrisy. One tweet summed it up perfectly: ""Say ‘Normalize hate against White people’ and see how the MAGA clowns react.""The disparity is glaring. Elez, a white staffer who posted outright racist content, gets a poll, a redemption arc, and a Musk pardon. Ramaswamy, an Indian American conservative who spent his career toeing the MAGA line, gets an unceremonious exit.The message to Indian American conservatives? You’re useful, but you’re not one of us.Harshil, an Indian-American commentator, put it bluntly: ""While Vivek Ramaswamy was deselected for DOGE, Elez has the backing of Vance for saying ‘Normalize Indian Hate.’ Indian-Americans, this is straight to your face. No matter how much you succeed, you will always be a second-class citizen.""Elon Musk’s “forgiveness” narrative collapses when held up against MAGA’s past behavior.When Black NFL players kneeled for the anthem, MAGA called for lifetime bans. When liberal figures made offensive remarks, MAGA demanded boycotts and firings. When an Indian-American MAGA figure was ousted, there was silence.Instead of acknowledging the gravity of the situation, Musk and his inner circle treated it as a joke. David Sacks, a venture capitalist close to Musk, summed up their attitude with this mock exchange:""Sir, the Pentagon has failed another audit.""""Send in Big Balls.""That’s how unserious they are about racism against Indian Americans. It’s all one big meme to them.For now, the message from Vance, Musk, and Trump couldn’t be clearer: Indian Americans in MAGA are valued for their usefulness, not their belonging. They can play the game, push the rhetoric, and even rise in the ranks, but when the chips are down, they will always be expendable. The Elez controversy isn’t just about one racist tweet—it’s a reminder that no matter how much loyalty Indian Americans show to the movement, it will never truly be reciprocated.","Marko elez, a former department of government efficiency (doge) staffer, posted “normalize indian hate” on social media and was fired.

Elon Musk backs British MP's disapproval of London tube sign in Bengali,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/elon-musk-backs-british-mps-disapproval-of-london-tube-sign-in-bengali/articleshow/118126145.cms,"TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: Elon Musk has backed a British MP’s disapproval of a sign at Whitechapel London Underground station being written in Bengali.Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe , who Musk frequently retweets, and whose party is opposed to immigration, tweeted a photo of Whitechapel station showing its sign in English and in Bengali script and wrote: “This is London — the station name should be in English, and English only.”Musk replied “Yes.”Abdal Ullah, a Tower Hamlets councillor and founder of the British Bangladeshi Power & Inspiration, spearheaded the Bengali script sign. He told TOI it came about during events to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh as there is a large British Bangladeshi community in Whitechapel.“We did a number of events to celebrate the contribution of the Bangladesh community to Britain, like building the rag trade and the Brick Lane curry houses,” Ullah said. “During that time we initiated the lighting up of the London Eye in red and green, we organised a bike ride to promote climate change and British Bangladeshi artist Mohammed Ali created a mural in Brick Lane saying ‘Mateer Tan’ (Land is calling). At that time the Elizabeth line was about to open, so I initiated a plan to ask TfL to recognise the contribution of British Bangladeshis in the East End and to have the Whitechapel sign written in Bengali. Chinatown already had street signs in Chinese characters, even Brick Lane already had signs in Bengali. I did a campaign and TfL told me they thought it was a great idea to recognise our contributions and so we launched it,” he explained.When the sign was approved, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee did a tweet on it. “That was my claim to my fame and I was very honoured when she did that,” he said.“So, to be woken up and nowtold that Elon Musk is commenting on it, well he clearly has nothing better to do,” Ullah said. “ He seems to have too much time for everything related to Britain. Lowe is just pandering to the right-wing and trying to attract attention,” he added.Southall, known as Little Punjab, has had a sign in Gurmukhi script at its station saying “Southall” for many years. Even St Pancras International, the station for Eurostar, has signs in French.Ansar Ullah, director of the Swadhinata Trust, a Tower Hamlet-based Bengali community group, said the sign was meant to acknowledge the community rather than because they could not read English. “I suspect Lowe’s comments were purely political.But Hindi teacher Indu Barot said she was against the signage. “It makes Punjabis think Southall is their area and Bengalis think Whitechapel is their area. It is wonderful to see everyone promoting their languages. However, I sense a touch of politics in this, which seems to be dividing rather than uniting. We are living in Britain so the signs should just be in English,” she said.","Reform uk mp rupert lowe tweeted a photo of whitechapel station showing its sign in english and in bengali script.

As it aired: the Trump pregame interview on FOX

Poll What Do You Think Should Be the Key Focus in Resolving the Gaza Situation? Ensuring Fair Rights and Justice for All Involved Providing Better Housing and Support for Those Affected

US president Donald Trump remained relentless in his plan to take control of Gaza . Adding to the anguish of Palestinians who are already wary of his strategy, Trump announced on Monday that the Gazans would have no right to return to the territory after they has left.When asked by Fox News ' Bret Baier if the Palestinians would have the right to return, the US president said, ""No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing. In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them.""In the Fox interview -- which will be broadcast on Monday after the first half was screened a day earlier -- Trump said he would build ""beautiful communities"" for the more than two million Palestinians who live in Gaza.""Could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,"" added Trump.A day before, he reiterated his commitment to capture Gaza describing the war-torn enclave as a ""big real estate site.""He had first announced his plans to take over Gaza on Wednesday during a press conference with Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it, too. We'll own it,"" he had said.Trump did not rule out sending US troops to secure Gaza. ""As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that,"" he said.He also suggested that Palestinians should move to other Middle Eastern countries, such as Egypt and Jordan, a proposal rejected by these nations.Following this, Netanyahu had praised Trump, calling him ""the greatest friend Israel has ever had.""The Palestinian leadership including President Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas both have said they won't let this happen and that Gaza was a part of Palestine .The criticism was not limited to the Arab world, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday labeling the plan ""a scandal,"" adding that the forced relocation of Palestinians would be ""unacceptable and against international law.""Trump's plan has also threatened to disrupt the fragile six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the chances of it progressing to a second, more permanent phase.Trump, however, repeated his insistence that he could persuade Egypt and Jordan, both major recipients of US military aid, to come around.""I think I could make a deal with Jordan. I think I could make a deal with Egypt. You know, we give them billions and billions of dollars a year,"" he told Fox.Since taking office for a second term, the President has continuously expressed his intentions to take control of foreign territories including Gaza and Greenland.","Trump said he would build ""beautiful communities"" for the more than two million palestinians who live in gaza.

Several employees at the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responsible for election security have been placed on administrative leave, news agency Associated Press reported. This move affects critical support for state and local election offices across the country.Seventeen CISA employees who worked with election officials on cybersecurity, ransomware threats, and physical security have been placed on leave pending a review, news agency AP reported, quoting a source familiar with the situation. Ten of them are regional election security specialists who were hired to strengthen election security efforts ahead of the 2024 election. The review will examine efforts to counter foreign interference in US elections, which have been assigned to other staff members.These employees, all former state or local election officials, were brought in to build relationships across all 50 states and more than 8,000 local election jurisdictions. They spent the past year working with officials, attending conferences, and providing guidance on cybersecurity and physical security measures.State election officials from both political parties have defended CISA’s role. Kentucky secretary of state Michael Adams, a Republican, said CISA’s local staff had been especially helpful for county clerks.""The most value that we've got from CISA has been the people that they have on the ground in our state that build direct relationships, not just with us but with the individual county clerks,"" Adams said. ""They're teaching them and helping them check their physical security and their cyber hygiene, and that's been extremely popular.""Michigan secretary of state Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, also supported CISA’s work.""And I hope that leaders in the federal government who claim to care about election integrity will recognize that,"" she was quoted as saying by news agency AP.The remaining employees placed on leave are current or former members of CISA’s election security and resilience team. The review is focused on the agency’s efforts to address misinformation and disinformation, as per the AP report. The ten regional election security specialists who worked with state and local officials were part of CISA’s field operations division.The personnel changes come amid criticism from some Republican officials. Kristi Noem, President Donald Trump’s new homeland security secretary, said during her Senate confirmation hearing that CISA had strayed ""far off mission"" and pledged to work with senators ""should you wish to rein them in.""Trump has not named a replacement for former CISA director Jen Easterly. CISA officials were also absent from recent meetings of state election officials in Washington, DC.CISA was established in 2018 during Trump’s presidency and is responsible for protecting critical infrastructure, including voting systems. Although it operates under the department of homeland security, it has its own Senate-confirmed director.Trump and his allies have criticized CISA’s efforts to counter misinformation related to the 2020 presidential election and the Covid-19 pandemic. CISA officials have said they did not engage in censorship but helped states notify social media platforms about misinformation without directing them to act.For the 2024 election, CISA and other federal agencies have warned about foreign misinformation campaigns, including three fake videos linked to Russia that falsely suggested election misconduct in key states.","Seventeen cisa employees who worked with election officials on cybersecurity, ransomware threats, and physical security have been placed on leave pending a review.

Kennedy ’s assassination following President Trump’s executive order to release the secret files.According to a report on Axios, the document contains 14,000 pages worth of material that disclosure board was supposed to review but never saw. However, the newly discovered documents remains secret at least for now.“This is huge. It shows the FBI is taking this seriously,” said Jefferson Morley, the vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation , which has the largest online record of JFK assassination records.“The FBI is finally saying, ‘Let’s respond to the president’s order,’ instead of keeping the secrecy going,” he added.Earlier in January, Trump had ordered the declassification of all remaining classified records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, fulfilling a long-standing promise.The move was formalised through an executive order, which also called for the release of files concerning the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.“The families and the American people deserve transparency and truth,” the order said, adding that it is in the national interest to release these records without further delay.While the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 mandated full public disclosure of the files by October 2017, exemptions have allowed for the continued withholding of certain documents.Trump’s order claimed that continued redactions are “not consistent with the public interest.”""I have now determined that the continued redaction and withholding of information from records pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is not consistent with the public interest and the release of these records is long overdue,"" it read.During his re-election campaign, Trump had pledged to release the remaining Kennedy assassination files, a promise he also made during his first term but later walked back, citing advice from intelligence officials.Former CIA Director Mike Pompeo was among those who urged Trump to keep certain files classified, citing potential national security concerns.Speculation around Kennedy’s assassination has persisted for decades. Kennedy was fatally shot in Dallas on November 22, 1963, and while Lee Harvey Oswald was identified as the lone gunman, conspiracy theories have long overshadowed the official narrative.","Us federal bureau of investigation has discovered around 2,400 new records related to president john f. kennedy ’s assassination following president trump’s executive order to release the secret files. The newly discovered documents remains secret at least for now.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118131423,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-980842,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Musk-led group offers $97.4bn for OpenAI takeover; Sam Altman gives counter-offer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-led-group-offers-97-4bn-for-openai-takeover-sam-altman-gives-counter-offer/articleshow/118131254.cms,"A group of investors led by Elon Musk has made a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the nonprofit entity that controls OpenAI, escalating a long-running power struggle between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the future of artificial intelligence .The consortium includes Musk’s AI firm xAI , investment firm Vy Capital, and Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel, according to sources familiar with the offer.The bid, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, marks Musk’s latest and most aggressive attempt to take control of OpenAI, a company he helped found in 2015 but left in 2018 after a dispute over its direction. The offer, however, faces significant challenges, as OpenAI’s board is closely aligned with Altman, who swiftly dismissed Musk’s proposal.""No thank you but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want,"" Altman posted on X, the platform owned by Musk. In response, Musk replied with a single word: ""Swindler.""The bid could complicate OpenAI’s efforts to secure a $40 billion funding round led by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, which values the company at $300 billion—making it one of the world’s most valuable private firms alongside SpaceX and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. SoftBank is reportedly willing to invest up to $40 billion, with other investors providing the remainder.Musk’s unsolicited offer comes amid a legal battle he launched against OpenAI, alleging the company has strayed from its nonprofit mission. His attorney, Marc Toberoff, argued that if OpenAI intends to shift fully into a for-profit entity, the nonprofit should be fairly compensated for relinquishing control over ""the most transformative technology of our time.""The nonprofit entity at the center of Musk’s bid has only two employees and approximately $22 million in assets. However, it holds legal control over OpenAI, which is why Musk and his investors are offering billions to acquire it. Legal experts note that the board has a fiduciary duty to sell its assets at fair market value, and Musk’s bid now sets a high benchmark.Ellen Aprill, a nonprofit law scholar at UCLA, noted that OpenAI’s leadership may face scrutiny if they reject a significantly higher bid in favor of a lower offer from the for-profit arm. ""It’s an enormous complication for the current plan,"" she said.Musk’s offer could further delay OpenAI’s transition to a fully for-profit model, which Altman and his allies have been working toward since his dramatic reinstatement as CEO in late 2023. The proposed structural changes are already under review by charity regulators in Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, and California, where it is headquartered.Musk, now a key adviser to President Donald Trump, has also been locked in a broader competition with Altman, launching his own AI company, xAI, in 2023. Despite his efforts, OpenAI has maintained a dominant position in the AI race, aided by political and corporate alliances.Just a day after Trump’s inauguration for his second term, the former president endorsed a $100 billion AI infrastructure plan backed by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle. Meanwhile, Altman, attending an AI conference in Paris alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and US Vice President JD Vance, has continued to consolidate his influence on the global AI stage.As Musk pushes forward with his bid, OpenAI’s board must now weigh its legal obligations against its strategic goals, setting the stage for a high-stakes showdown over the future of artificial intelligence.","Elon musk has made a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the nonprofit that controls openai.
