'JD Vance understood': Shashi Tharoor in US on Operation Sindoor; says 'India won the narrative',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jd-vance-understood-shashi-tharoor-in-us-on-operation-sindoor-says-india-won-the-narrative/articleshow/121662738.cms,".

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday said that US vice president JD Vance understood there could be no mediation between India and Pakistan, as it would imply an equivalence between the two countries.Speaking in Washington, Tharoor, who leads Group 5 of the all-party delegation tasked with conveying India's message against terrorism abroad, said they made India’s position “very clear” to the US vice president.Tharoor said, “The meeting with VP Vance was very clear. Mediation implies an equivalence between two parties, and there can be no equivalence between terrorists and their victims. Vance fully understood our points, and so did other levels of the system.”Commenting on the Pakistani delegation also visiting the United States, Tharoor said the Americans who met the Pakistani delegation had not publicly expressed any support for the country. “We've seen some of them tweeting about their meetings. But we haven’t seen those they met say anything publicly supportive or appreciative of Pakistan,” he said.Speaking about the Pakistani delegation in the United States, Tharoor noted that the people the Pakistani delegation met in the US didn't say anything supportive of Pakistan.""We've seen some of them tweeting about their meetings. We've not seen the people they met saying anything very supportive or appreciative of Pakistan in public.""He also underlined the strength of India’s diplomatic outreach, saying the Indian team had more meetings and at a higher level. “Whether it was Senators and Congressmen on the Hill or government officials, our list of appointments was far better,” he said. “We’ve got the better of the argument.”On various statements coming from the Congress, Tharoor stressed that any internal Congress discussions would take place later. “There'll be a time for internal discussions when one gets back. I'm not anticipating anything because I've not been told anything directly. All I see is in the media, some of which is speculative. But on the whole, my view is that we are facing a situation where the country is united. And that unity was very apparent in the delegation. ""Reflecting on the five-day effort, Tharoor called the visit a success. “We had good conversations, high-level contacts, and clear outcomes. We got our message across about Pahalgam and Operation Sindoor and reaffirmed India’s relations globally.”","Congress mp shashi tharoor said they made india’s position “very clear” to the us vice president. He said the americans who met the pakistani delegation had not publicly expressed any support for the country. “whether it was senators and congressmen on the hill or government officials, our list of appointments was far better,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121662756,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-28154,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

FULL: ‘Trump Won’t Tolerate...’: US State Dept Warns After Decision To Revoke Chinese Student Visas





US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending international visas for new Harvard University students, as announced by the White House on Wednesday. This action represents a significant intensification of efforts to prevent foreign students from attending this prestigious institution.The directive halts entry for new Harvard students under F, M, or J visa categories and instructs the Secretary of State to evaluate revoking existing visas for current students meeting specific criteria, according to the White House statement on Wednesday.Citing national security concerns, the White House expressed apprehension about Harvard's foreign connections. The administration criticised the university's alleged inadequate reporting of foreign student information, noting deficiencies in data submission for three students.The White House statement claimed Harvard either inadequately reports foreign student disciplinary records or insufficiently monitors these students. Additional criticisms included the university's handling of antisemitism and its continued emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).Also read: 'Retaliatory step': Trump blocks visas for new foreign students at Harvard; here's how the University responded The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has long warned that foreign adversaries take advantage of easy access to American higher education to steal information, exploit research and development, and spread false information, as per the White House.""Harvard has also developed extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries, receiving more than $150 million from China alone. In exchange, Harvard has, among other things, hosted Chinese Communist Party paramilitary members and partnered with China-based individuals on research that could advance China’s military modernization,"" the White House said in a statement.""Harvard has failed to adequately address violent anti-Semitic incidents on campus, with many of these agitators found to be foreign students."" it added.The President said that there are people who wants to go to Harvard but they can't get in because of foreign students. He also said that they are waiting for the foreign student lists from Harvard so that the administration can determine how many ""radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all"" should not be let back into the US.“The students? Well, we want to have great students here. We just don’t want students that are causing trouble. We want to have students. I want to have foreign students. We have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can’t get in because we have foreign students there. But I want to make sure that the foreign students are people that can love our country,"" he said.“We are still waiting for the Foreign Student Lists from Harvard so that we can determine, after a ridiculous expenditure of BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, how many radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all, should not be let back into our Country. Harvard is very slow in the presentation of these documents, and probably for good reason!” Trump added.This development came after US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs's recent ruling, which indefinitely prevented the Trump administration from modifying Harvard's international student visa programme. This ruling came shortly after the judge temporarily stopped the administration's attempt to revoke the university's authority to enrol international students.The ongoing showdown stems from Harvard's refusal to submit to a series of federal government demands. The situation escalated recently after the department of homeland security said Harvard refused to provide records related to misconduct by foreign students.Trump had already froze more than $2.2 billion in funding and now had terminated $450 million in grants to the country's oldest university.Members of the Republican Party have introduced new bills aimed at substantially raising tax rates on endowments held by elite universities, with Harvard being a primary target. The former president had previously indicated his intention to revoke the university's tax exemption privileges.Following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the US President has repeatedly criticised the university for its perceived inadequate protection of Jewish students. In response, Harvard has broadened its legal challenge against the Trump administration, contesting both the suspension of federal funding and what the institution considers to be demands that compromise its autonomy and violate constitutional principles.",Us president donald trump issued a proclamation suspending international visas for new harvard university students.

NEW DELHI: In an unexpected turn, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor was left shocked when he received a question from his son on foreign soil during a briefing.As Tharoor sat poised, addressing a room filled with foreign policy experts, diplomats and journalists, a familiar voice rose from the crowd. He laughed and said, ""that shouldn't be allowed. This is my son.""His son, Ishaan Tharoor, global affairs columnist with the Washington Post, stood up and said, ""Ishaan Tharoor, Washington Post. Definitely asking a question in a personal capacity. Mostly to say hi before you go off to your next engagement.""He then asked his father whether government interlocutors sought evidence of Pakistan's culpability in the Pahalgam attack, to which Tharoor said, India would not have conducted Operation Sindoor without convincing evidence.""I'm curious though, on this tour you've been to various countries in the Western Hemisphere. Have any of your government interlocutors asked you to show evidence of Pakistan's culpability in the initial attack? And what do you say to the repeated Pakistani denials of having any hand in the initial attack?” Ishaan asked.""I'm very glad you raised this, Ishaan. I didn't plant it. I promise you. This guy does this to his dad,"" Tharoor replied to Ishaan's question amid laughter.""Very simply, no one had any doubt, and we were not asked for evidence, but media have asked, and so you are speaking for your tribe, and that in two or three places, media asked this question,"" Tharoor said.""Let me say very clearly that India would not have done this without convincing evidence,"" he added.""I can assure you, India is not the kind of country that would undertake a military operation without a very solid basis for doing so. This was not some random terror attack. I must say, our government counted 24 terrorist attacks in the course of last year emanating from Pakistan, but none of them required this kind of response,"" he said.""We dealt with them. We either got the terrorists or killed them, minimal damage, a very little loss of life. We dealt with it. This showed all the hallmarks of a sophisticated, planned, deliberate operation with reconnaissance, with intelligence work, with a modus operandi worked out this cynical exercise of asking people their religion, shooting them between the eyes,"" the Congress leader added.He then stressed that India has a 37-year pattern of repeated terror attacks from Pakistan.""Americans haven't forgotten that Pakistan allegedly didn't know where Osama bin Laden was until he was found in a Pakistani safe house right next to an army camp in a cantonment city,"" he said.Tharoor then recalled the Mumbai terror attacks and said that Pakistan denied any link with them. He then added that one of the terrorists was caught, whose name, identity and address in Pakistan were revealed.""The US intelligence, as well as ours, recorded the voice of a Pakistani handler giving minute-by-minute instructions to the killers in Mumbai. So, we know what Pakistan is all about,"" he added.""They will dispatch terrorists. They will deny they did so until they're caught with red hands,” he saidTalking about the Pahalgam terror attack, he said that minutes after the tragedy, the Resistance Front claimed credit. ""Who are the Resistance Front?

US correspondent from US: An Indian parliamentary team tasked with highlighting Pakistan's terrorist depredations has conveyed to US interlocutors that New Delhi will not talk to Islamabad ""with a gun pointed to our head"" even as a Pakistani delegation tailing the Indian team in Washington DC desperately sought President Trump's mediation between the two sides.Summing up India's stance, delegation leader Shashi Tharoor likened Pakistan to a neighbor who ""unleashes a rottweiler to bite your children and do worse and then says 'let's talk."" Talks are not possible unless Pakistan locks up the rottweilers (terrorists) or puts them to sleep, Tharoor said.Tharoor also rejected efforts to insinuate US into bilateral issues saying India has enormous respect for the American presidency and the American president, but ""we have never particularly wanted to ask anyone to mediate.""The Indian delegation met US vice-president JD Vance at the White House on Thursday morning to convey India's stance. Vance, who initially said the India-Pakistan scrap was ""not our business"" as New Delhi launched punitive strikes against Pakistan for the Pahalgam terrorist attacks, virtually greenlighting the retribution, later jumped into the fray to bring about a truce.India has since made it clear that he was merely conveying Pakistan's desire to stand down, and New Delhi will not brook any mediation.""Excellent meeting with Vice President @JDVance today in Washington D.C. with our delegation. We had comprehensive discussions covering a wide array of critical issues, from counter-terrorism efforts to enhancing technological cooperation. A truly constructive & productive exchange for strengthening India-US strategic partnership, with a great meeting of minds,"" Tharoor said after the meeting.At a press conference hours before the team met Vance, Tharoor said India can speak all the languages Pakistan speaks and is happy to talk to them in any of them if they roll up their terrorism policy and infrastructure, ""but as long as they use the language of terrorism, we will use the language of force.That doesn't require a third party,"" even as the team from Islamabad, in its meetings, rolled out the familiar trope of ""Pakistan is a victim of terrorism,"" which the Indian delegation ridiculed.In one vivid presentation, BJP MP Tejasvi Surya listed five Pakistanis and five Indians who are famous in the US to highlight the difference between the two countries. For Pakistan: Ramzi Yousuf, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Faisal Shahzad, Tashfeen Malik, and Muhammad Shahzeb Khan -- all of whom conducted terrorist attacks on the US. For India: Indra Nooyi, Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Ajay Banga, Arvind Krishna -- all corporate titans who have generated billions in economic activity in the US.""India gives tech titans, Pak gives terrorists,"" Surya noted.The Indian delegation met US vice-president JD Vance on Thursday morning to convey India's stand after engaging dozens of US lawmakers from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the India Caucus, which has nearly 200 legislators, including 40 Senators, compared to the Pakistan Caucus, which has only around 50 members -- a differential the Indian side mentioned to highlight the breadth of support for India.The Pakistani team meanwhile labored to make an impression on the few meetings its cobbled together on the Hill, insisting that the Kashmir issue was an “unfinished agenda of the United Nations” despite being outed repeatedly on UN resolutions that seek Pakistan's withdrawal from the territory it has occupied.""Raised concerns over India’s recent provocations, the deepening humanitarian crisis in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir,"" Bhutto posted on X after one such meeting, even though there is no humanitarian crisis in J&K other than terrorist attacks initiated by Pakistan. The Indian delegation in fact told US interlocutors that J&K was seeing unprecedented economic activity and travel boom, ""with more tourists than in Aspen, Colorado"" before Pahalgam terrorist attack.","The indian parliamentary team tasked with highlighting pakistan's terrorist depredations has conveyed to us interlocutors that new delhi will not talk to islamabad ""with a gun pointed to our head"" a pakistani delegation tailing the indian team in washington dc desperately sought president trump's mediation between the two sides.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121652585,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49622,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

In his account of the conversation, Ushakov said other than Ukraine, a number of other international issues were raised ""as well as the armed conflict between India and Pakistan, which has been halted with the personal involvement of President Trump"".Putin strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and also backed India's efforts to bring perpetrators to justice. However, Ushakov's remark about Trump's role is unlikely to go down well with Indian authorities who have repeatedly denied that the US or any other country brought the conflict to an end. India also rejected Trump's offer of mediation on the Kashmir issue, saying it will always engage bilaterally with Pakistan.External affairs minister S Jaishankar had said earlier that while American leaders were in touch with India and Pakistan, the pause in fighting was directly negotiated by the Indian and Pakistani armies, after Pakistan reached out to India for a dialogue. US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick had later said on oath in a US court that Trump had used trade to avert a full-scale war between the ""nuclear armed"" countries.Putin is likely to visit India later this year for the annual India-Russia summit.

‘Chinese Kill Chain Couldn’t…’: Tharoor Mocks Pakistan & Its Cabal As US Officials Stare In Shock

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is leading a parliamentary delegation to the United States in a diplomatic outreach to highlight India's firm stance against terrorism, launched a scathing attack and called out the nation's long-standing policy of harbouring terrorism.Taking aim at Pakistan's parallel delegation led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto , Tharoor invoked Hillary Clinton's famous rebuke: ""How can you breed vipers in your backyard and expect them to bite only your neighbours?""The diplomatic face-off in Washington comes in the wake of Operation Sindoor , following the Pahalgam terror attack. While India has deployed seven delegations across 33 countries, Pakistan's smaller diplomatic initiative covers just five capitals - Washington, New York, Brussels, London, and Moscow.Tharoor's delegation has embarked on a comprehensive outreach program in Washington, including appearances at the National Press Club, meetings with diaspora media, and a reception hosted by the ambassador. ""The message must be spread as widely as possible — through media, diaspora, and direct government outreach,"" he said.“Indeed, I know that Bilawal Bhutto's mother was killed and one sympathise with the young man for the loss of his mother to terrorism,” he added.Addressing Pakistan's diplomatic efforts, Tharoor remarked, ""They can come with their narratives... But anybody who has followed this issue beyond official headlines will have absolutely no doubt as to what the Pakistani denials are worth — which is not very much.""Pakistan's mission seeks international mediation and the revival of the Indus Waters Treaty , which India suspended on April 23 in response to the Pahalgam attack which claimed lives of 26 people.Speaking about India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Tharoor had earlier stated in Colombia, ""The time for acting on the basis of goodwill unilaterally is frankly no longer with us.""Despite India's strong stance, Tharoor highlighted the country's balanced approach, noting, ""We sympathise with victims of terror wherever they may be. I remember Parliament once passed a resolution condemning a terrorist attack that killed 40 schoolchildren in Pakistan. But it's very difficult to sympathise with the Pakistani authorities who have unfortunately created this phenomenon.""","Congress mp shashi tharoor is leading a parliamentary delegation to the united states in a diplomatic outreach.

'Madam N' and influencer spies: How Pakistani businesswoman built sleeper cell network in India; ISI-backed spy ring under lens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/madam-n-and-influencer-spies-how-pakistani-businesswoman-built-sleeper-cell-network-in-india-isi-backed-spy-ring-under-lens/articleshow/121651701.cms,"This is an AI generated image, used only for represenative purpose (Image credit: Denny)

As India cracks down on a suspected Pakistan-backed spy ring spreading across the country, one unsettling question emerges: How did Indian influencers end up working against their own country?At the center of this mystery is Noshaba Shehzad, a Pakistani businesswoman with high-level connections and a seemingly ordinary travel agency, Jaiyana Travel and Tourism. But behind the tourist brochures, Shehzad allegedly helped orchestrate a sophisticated espionage network with the backing of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).According to sources cited by NDTV, Shehzad isn’t just a travel agent, she’s “Madam N”, an ISI codename for the woman who reportedly laid the groundwork for a sleeper cell network inside India, with a target of recruiting up to 500 operatives who could blend in with the population unnoticed.Her strategy? Start with influencers. Arrested Instagram personality Jyoti Malhotra was allegedly among the many Indian citizens Shehzad lured into Pakistan under the pretext of cultural trips and tourism.But what began as guided visits soon turned into groundwork for spying.Sources say Shehzad worked hand-in-hand with Pakistani officials and ISI handlers, even manipulating the visa process through the Pakistani Embassy in Delhi.With just a call to key officials like Suhail Qamar (First Secretary, Visa) and Umar Sheryar (Counsellor, Trade), Shehzad could reportedly get Pakistani visas approved almost instantly for people she handpicked.She was also in close contact with Danish aka Ehsan-ur-Rehman, a known ISI operative working at the embassy until he was expelled in May—shortly after Malhotra’s arrest. Notably, Madam N’s husband is said to be a retired officer of Pakistan’s civil services, adding another layer to her insider access.Though there is no official tourism corridor between India and Pakistan, Shehzad allegedly managed to send over 3,000 Indian citizens and 1,500 NRIs across the border in just six months. Many of these trips were organized under the banner of religious pilgrimage, Sikh and Hindu yatras permitted only through her agency, thanks to a tie-up with Pakistan’s Evacuee Trust Property Board.Investigators believe the agency was used not only to facilitate travel but also to funnel funds into anti-India propaganda efforts. Pilgrims were reportedly overcharged, with the excess diverted for covert operations.Shehzad’s network didn’t stop at Pakistan’s border. She’s said to have recruited travel agents in Delhi and other Indian cities, creating a domestic pipeline to push unsuspecting Indian citizens into her espionage web.","Noshaba shehzad allegedly helped orchestrate a sophisticated espionage network with the backing of pakistan’s inter-services intelligence (isi) her agency, jaiyana travel and tourism, was used to facilitate travel and funnel funds into anti-india propaganda efforts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121652045,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-179059,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

He was explaining his biting remarks that were apparently directed at Congress officebearers who ran down the govt campaign.Khurshid termed the trip as successful after his delegation met with external affairs minister S Jaishankar for a briefing. Congress MP Manish Tewari too praised his delegation's efforts in Gulf and African countries, where it effectively ""busted false equivalence"" Pakistan has drawn between Palestine and Kashmir, and sensitised the hosts about Pakistan's terror agenda against India.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is leading a delegation that is in the US at present, said, ""I think anybody who thinks that working in national interest is some sort of anti-party activity really needs to question themselves rather than us.""However, unfazed by the criticism of these party members, Congress continued its offensive against the programme, saying the foreign visits achieved little with the delegations failing to meet big leaders in host countries.When asked about Khurshid's praise of the outreach, All India Congress Committee spokesman Ajoy Kumar said the issue was not about any party or individual because it is govt that decides the script for any such delegation. ""And the problem is that govt did not give the script,"" he felt.Kumar added that the delegations did not even name China as the force behind Pakistan's devious agenda or call out US president Donald Trump for his claim that he was behind Indo-Pak ceasefire. ""The media was busy pitting Congress against Congress by talking about Tharoor, etc, but this was Modi's surrender,"" he claimed.Nevertheless, Khurshid stuck to his guns and said he had been in touch with the party high command throughout the tour.Citing an example of what the trip had achieved, he said Pakistan had to issue a ""frustrated press release"" after his delegation's three-day visit to Malaysia.""While some questions were raised by Malaysia, given its strong membership of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, we received a firm letter of support from the prime minister of Malaysia.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has urged the US to broker a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between India and Pakistan. Addressing an event at the US embassy in Islamabad on Wednesday, Sharif lauded US President Donald Trump for what he said was his role in defusing a four-day military clash last month that was triggered by the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives. India has rejected all claims of a US role in bringing about a cessation of hostilities.Sharif's praise for Trump as a leader ""against escalation and war"" was mirrored by Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Washington. Bilawal credited Trump's diplomacy for the ceasefire and suggested that US mediation could facilitate broader talks. ""If America can help sustain this ceasefire, its role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would benefit both nations,"" he said.

and the challenges in Dhaka's political transition

Ten months down the line do you think that the Yunus government has been successful in carrying out key reforms as was demanded by the July-August protesters?

What is your opinion of how the interim govt has handled Islamic fundamentalism and the rise of the Jamiat's influence in the country?

How has the political climate impacted the welfare of minorities, especially Hindus? There have been reports of persecution of Hindu residents.

Major political parties like BNP have demanded early elections preferably by December. The demand has now been endorsed by the army chief. Do you see the Yunus govt committing to the deadline of Dec 25-Jun 2026?

How do you see the Bangladesh army's role in the current situation? It was initially criticized for having abandoned former PM Sheikh Hasina.

Students in the country have metamorphosed from a group of protestors to a political party. As a former Pro-VC do you think they have the capability and capacity to meet the aspirations of the people?

As someone who was teaching and mentoring women students till recently what is your opinion of women's freedoms in Bangladesh? Are they more free now than before?

You have studied civil society in south Asia closely. Chief advisor Yunus was very successful at groundbreaking volunteer work and creating the SHG system in Bangladesh that has been lauded by the world. Do you think his transition as a politician has been as successful?

Do you think elections can be inclusive and fair when one of the major political parties has been banned?

Progress in carrying out key reforms has been slower than the protesters had hoped. Yunus's strategy has been to try to create a consensus around a list of reforms, some of which will require major constitutional changes. This consensus has not been easy to achieve, given the political divisions between the major parties as well as the expectations of the protesters. The dilemma that he faces is that to produce a well thought out programme of reform will take time, while the political parties that had lost out during the period of Awami League rule want to seize the moment to come to power.The evidence here is somewhat anecdotal and I don’t feel I have enough data to make an informed comment. The interim government has created space for the Jamaat by lifting the ban on its activities but it is too early to say whether it has been able to enlarge its support base. Nor is it clear how far the Jamaat is prepared to operate within the constitutional framework that the interim government puts in place.As far as I can see, the reports of attacks on members of the Hindu minority are best seen as isolated, if worrisome, events rather than part of any concerted campaign. However, times of political uncertainty such as the present create conditions in which such attacks are more likely.This is the dilemma that Yunus and his colleagues face. The logic of democracy would call for early elections but the most likely beneficiary of early elections would be the BNP, which in many ways is part of the previous political system against which the students revolted. The BNP had been the target of state repression under the Awami League, it’s true, but its approach to political power would most likely be very similar in its use of patronage and its vulnerability to corruption.As in Pakistan, the army has the power to intervene in politics either directly or indirectly. While it is clear that its decision not to back Sheikh Hasina’s violent crackdown on protesters was crucial in her downfall and that it preferred to bring in an interim government, it also seems plausible that it really does want to see fresh elections and a fresh start. There are parallels here with its role in the 1990s upheavals in Bangladesh.Students in many countries have taken the lead in protesting against autocratic regimes but the next step of creating a permanent voice in politics is often very difficult. In Bangladesh the National Citizen Party represents the view of an important section of the student movement but it is likely to find it difficult to sustain a sufficiently high level of support to win power.I don’t see a major shift in the position of women in Bangladesh. Economic development over the last few decades has created new opportunities for women from all socio-economic classes but there have been only gradual changes to social expectations of women’s roles except among small sections of the middle and upper class.Muhammad Yunus has been an effective figurehead for a process of political transition but needs to move faster if he is to maintain popular support.There’s huge public feeling in favour of banning the Awami League, given the experience of the July/August 2024 movement and the use of state violence against it, but there’s also a significant residual support for the party as well. If it can’t participate, it may shore up trouble for the future.","Former dean of humanities and interim pro-vice chancellor of the asian university for women in bangladesh's chittagong talks to toi about the forthcoming polls.

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday urged that the political consensus and swift government response seen after the Pahalgam terror attack in April should become a lasting feature of India’s national security approach.Speaking at the concluding event of the Karyakarta Vikas Varg in Nagpur, he praised the collective political will and military resolve demonstrated in the aftermath of the attack.“Action was taken after the heinous terror attack in Pahalgam. The valour of our Army shone once again in it. The firmness of the administration was also seen. The political class showed mutual understanding. The society gave the message of unity. This should continue and become a permanent feature,” Bhagwat said, referring to retaliatory actions under Operation Sindoor , including strikes on terror hubs in Pakistan and PoK.He said the people were angry after the massacre of tourists in Pahalgam on April 22 and wanted justice, which led to the military response. Operation Sindoor marked a significant escalation, with Indian armed forces bombing terror-linked airbases in Pakistan and repelling drone attacks.Bhagwat warned that enemies were engaged in a proxy war against India. “Those who can't win a direct fight with India want to bleed our country by the policy of a thousand cuts,” he said, invoking Winston Churchill’s WWII speech to highlight societal resilience.“Churchill had said that society was the true lion, and he merely roared on its behalf.”He further called for national unity and restraint, cautioning against provocation and internal conflict. “No group or class should come into conflict with another. Acting impulsively or taking the law into one’s own hands is not in the country’s interest.”Bhagwat came down strongly against religious conversion through coercion or inducement, calling it a form of violence. “Conversion is violence. We are not against it when done by choice. But luring, forcing and pressurising is something we are against,” he said, adding that such acts insult people’s ancestors and heritage. “We are with you (in the fight against conversion),” he told tribal leader and former Union minister Arvind Netam, who was present as chief guest.Netam, hailing from Chhattisgarh, echoed these concerns and criticised successive governments for ignoring religious conversions in tribal areas. “I think RSS is the only institution which can help us in this area,” he said, urging the Sangh to push the central government for a post-Naxalism action plan to prevent recurrence.He also criticised the non-implementation of the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), saying it was vital for tribal self-governance and community empowerment.Earlier, in an interview with Organiser, Bhagwat had said India must become militarily and economically self-reliant, asserting, “We have no option but to be powerful as we have been witnessing the wickedness of the evil forces on all our borders.” He emphasised that true strength must be matched with righteousness, or it risks becoming directionless and violent.The RSS chief concluded that unity, moral strength, and readiness are the pillars of a resilient and powerful India. “Our roots lie in unity, not in division,” he said.","Rss chief mohan bhagwat calls for lasting political unity post-pahalgam attack, warns against forced conversions. “our roots lie in unity, not in division,” he said.

Pakistan's propaganda with civilian casualty claims

NEW DELHI: The extent of Pakistan’s losses is becoming increasingly clear as more details emerge from the recent cross-border military conflict dubbed Operation Sindoor Indian Air Force (IAF) retaliatory strikes in response to the Pahalgam terror attack , which killed 26 civilians, led to the decimation of significant Pakistani military assets, including fighter jets, surveillance aircraft, drones, and missile systems, forcing Islamabad to seek a ceasefire within four days.According to ANI report on the basis of defence sources involved in the operation, the IAF destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, and one C-130 military transport aircraft. More than ten armed drones (UCAVs), several cruise missiles, and radar sites were also taken out during India's calibrated air campaign, which began late on May 6 and concluded by May 10.The strikes, which included hits on key Pakistani airbases such as Bholari, were executed exclusively using air-launched cruise missiles, avoiding surface-to-surface weapons like the BrahMos. The strikes were carried out by a mix of Rafale and Su-30 MKI fighters, with support from electronic warfare and surveillance assets.One of the most significant hits came in the form of a long-range Sudarshan missile strike, which neutralised a high-value aerial platform, possibly an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEWC) aircraft or an electronic warfare jet, at a range of nearly 300 km.Another AEWC aircraft of Swedish origin, believed to be stationed at the Bholari airbase, was also reportedly destroyed. Although there is suspicion that additional fighter aircraft may have been inside the damaged hangars, officials are not including those in confirmed kill counts due to Pakistan's refusal to clear debris from the site.Meanwhile, Indian air defences effectively intercepted multiple Pakistani air and ground-launched cruise and ballistic missiles. The IAF also scored multiple kills on Pakistani drones, including Chinese-made Wing Loong variants, during strikes and airspace incursions.A dossier showed Pakistan accusing India of targeting seven locations beyond the Indian military's officially disclosed targets, including Attock, Bahawalnagar, Gujrat, Jhang, Peshawar, Chhor, and Hyderabad, alleging civilian casualties. Indian officials, however, dismissed the claims as “propaganda”, asserting that all Indian strikes were limited to terror infrastructure, not civilian or military Pakistani centres.“We disclosed our targets transparently. This Pakistani document seems like an attempt to falsely portray Indian actions as indiscriminate,” said an Indian defence official.Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed civilians in Jammu & Kashmir. On May 7, India struck four terror hubs in Pakistan and five in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, including high-profile targets like the Sawai Nala camp in Muzaffarabad, Markaz Taiba in Muridke (Lashkar-e-Taiba HQ), and Markaz Subhan in Bahawalpur (Jaish-e-Mohammed HQ).After Pakistan escalated with missile and drone attacks on Indian military and civilian centres, India responded with force, targeting nine Pakistani airbases and multiple radar sites. The intense four-day conflict ended when Pakistan sought a ceasefire on May 10, reeling under mounting losses.","Operation sindoor was launched in retaliation to the pahalgam terror attack that killed civilians in jammu & kashmir.

The sports media world lit up this week after a war of words ignited between two of its biggest voices—Pablo Torre and Bill Simmons. At the center of the controversy? Torre’s extensive coverage of former Patriots coach Bill Belichick’s relationship with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson—a saga that continues to stir public fascination and criticism alike.Pablo Torre, host of Pablo Torre Finds Out, has gone all in on the story, offering detailed reports that include allegations of Jordon Hudson being banned from UNC’s football facilities, which the university denied, and even securing an Airbnb once used by the couple. “Dear @BillSimmons: Since you have such a strong public opinion about my work… I happen to have a few questions for you,” Torre tweeted, adding, “Unless you’re afraid of @pablofindsout and someone just ‘pretending to be a journalist,’ of course. ”Bill Simmons, founder of The Ringer, took a sharp jab at Torre during a recent episode of his “Rewatchables” podcast. “I’ve never seen anybody dine on a stupider story for a week and a half while pretending you’re a journalist. What the f–k was that? Seriously. ‘Belichick’s dating a girl. Oh, let me do nine shows about it. Settle the f–k down,’” Simmons scoffed. While he later admitted the topic was publicly relevant, he suggested Torre was milking it: “Maybe do two shows about it.The irony? The two are reportedly set to appear together on an upcoming podcast—an episode that may bring more sparks than insights.Torre’s reporting hasn’t been casual. He has pursued public records, explored legal options for transparency, and unpacked the impact of the Belichick-Hudson drama on UNC's football program, where Belichick currently works in an advisory role. Meanwhile, critics debate whether this is journalism at its boldest or a tabloid-style obsession wrapped in podcast branding.With the June 1 date—marking Belichick’s drop in buyout—from $10 million to $1 million now passed, speculation around his future continues to mount. So does curiosity over what Torre might release next.Also Read: Hollywood bribe?

The UAE’s Golden Visa has become a powerful symbol of the country’s ambition to attract the best minds from across the world. Ten years of residency, no need for a local sponsor, family sponsorship rights, and the promise of professional freedom in one of the most connected hubs of the 21st century—few offers are more attractive to high-achieving graduates.That allure only grew stronger after a landmark policy update in April 2022. In a bid to sharpen its competitive edge in the global talent race, the UAE Cabinet expanded the eligibility criteria to include graduates from the world’s top 100 universities. Whether you studied in Boston, Beijing, Bengaluru, or Berlin, if your alma mater features in the upper echelons of the QS World University Rankings, you now have a gateway to the Emirates.The reforms are part of the UAE’s broader strategy to pivot from an oil-based economy to a knowledge-powered one, as outlined in its ambitious Centennial 2071 vision. Science, technology, research, and innovation aren’t just buzzwords—they’re pillars for national transformation.In addition to global graduates, the programme now welcomes high-performing students in UAE schools and exceptional local university alumni.Assessment criteria include academic performance, year of graduation, and the global standing of the institution—making this one of the most merit-based visa regimes in the world.Experts say the UAE is making a deliberate shift from a traditional sponsorship model to a self-sponsored, skills-first approach.Read: Why UAE is a great destination for students According to the Emirates News Agency, the new visa policy is designed to “attract and retain global talents and skilled workers” and enhance the UAE’s competitiveness in the global job market.The Golden Visa is open to:Applications from graduates will be evaluated based on:These criteria are aligned with QS World University Rankings, which consider factors like teaching quality, research output, and employability.“The UAE’s visa program shows that university rankings are an important tool for comparing university performance in a global context,” said Leigh Kamolins, Director of Analytics and Evaluation at QS.“It highlights the importance that governments and employers are placing on reputable, quality education for enabling career mobility and driving knowledge economies.”The updated policy also allows Golden Visa holders to sponsor family members, another step toward encouraging longer-term settlement and professional development within the UAE.“The recent changes… mark a shift from immigration based on a sponsorship model to a self-sponsored model,” said Abeer Husseini, Partner at immigration law firm Fragomen.Below is the complete list of the top 100 universities worldwide, whose graduates are eligible to apply for the UAE Golden Visa:",ო ჉ “ლ” ““’” ‘”’ “œ’ ‘ ’: “what do you think?”: ‘i think i’m going to vote for hillary clinton.’ : “i think she’s a great candidate for president.” : ‘who is eligible?

Lee Jae-myung is once again in the spotlight after winning South Korea’s presidential election . After the country’s former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, was impeached for trying to impose martial law, Lee became the leading candidate to take over.Lee, from the opposition Democratic Party, became a central figure during the political crisis last December, when he live-streamed himself jumping over the fence of the National Assembly to help stop Yoon’s emergency order. “It was a race against time,” he later said in an interview with news agency AFP.Earlier this year, Lee survived a knife attack at a public event. The man who stabbed him admitted he wanted to kill Lee to stop him from becoming president.The 60 years old Lee grew up in poverty and had to quit school early to work in a factory. He injured his arm in an accident there but went on to earn a scholarship, study law, and become a lawyer. His life story, from hardship to high office, earned him strong support among working-class voters.Lee first entered politics as mayor of Seongnam, just south of Seoul. He shut down South Korea’s biggest dog meat market, which once sold 80,000 dogs a year.Later, as governor of Gyeonggi Province, the country’s most populated region, he built a reputation for being outspoken and bold.However, he’s also faced many controversies. He’s currently fighting corruption charges linked to a property deal and is accused of spreading false information during the 2022 election, which he narrowly lost. His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the conservative People Power Party, says Lee should not be allowed to run, “With these kinds of corruption allegations, how can you seek public office?” he said in a debate.Lee’s wife, Kim Hye-kyung, has defended him. “He’s someone who’s come up from the very bottom,” she said. “Just like how a flea has to jump to be noticed, I hope people can understand and view him in that context.”Before elections, Lee said that he wanted to advance South Korea’s artificial intelligence industry and punish those involved in the failed martial law attempt.",Lee jae-myung won south korea's presidential election.

What’s gone wrong between Musk & Trump?

Tesla share price crash: Where’s the stock headed?

The situation appears precarious now. Initially, Tesla's stock benefited substantially from Musk's association with Trump.

Currently, investor confidence appears shaken, resulting in substantial paper losses for Musk's personal Tesla shareholding, dropping $20 billion in a single day.

SpaceX in trouble?

Tesla share price crash: Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s escalating spat has wiped out a whopping $150 billion from Tesla’s market cap. Tesla's share price crashed over 14% as shareholders hastily sold their positions during an escalating verbal dispute between the US President Donald Trump and the Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is currently the wealthiest individual globally.Following Donald Trump's election, investors poured vast sums into Tesla shares, prioritising political considerations over financial performance.The consequences of this strategy became evident on Thursday when within three hours, the situation took a dramatic turn!The conflict originated from discussions about the president's budget legislation before intensifying rapidly. Following Musk's assertion regarding his role in Trump's electoral victory, Trump suggested potential governmental actions against Musk's enterprises, including Tesla and SpaceX.Trump expressed his views on Truth Social, stating: ""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!""Also Read | ‘Electric cars that nobody else wanted…’: Donald Trump’s shocking words on Elon Musk; says Biden should have terminated Musk’s subsidies Tesla share price crash on Thursday partly offset a significant increase that occurred during the eight-week period after Musk announced Tesla's plans to launch an autonomous, driverless ""robotaxi"" service in Austin, Texas, this month.The market participants are concerned that Trump's potential stance might slow down the advancement of autonomous vehicles in the United States, which could adversely affect Tesla.The company's current electric vehicle business faces challenges, making it crucial for them to swiftly transition into the era of driverless vehicles.""The whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a prominent Tesla supporter who now expresses concern. ""If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path,” Ives said according to an Associated Press report.He further stated, ""There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.""Following the November presidential election, investor enthusiasm drove Tesla's market value up by over $450 billion within weeks. Investors anticipated substantial gains from reduced regulatory oversight under Trump's administration and were optimistic about Musk's autonomous vehicle initiatives for American roads.The shares peaked on December 17, but subsequently declined when Musk's leadership of a government efficiency committee sparked boycotts and damaged Tesla's image. The stock has recently rebounded after Musk announced his renewed focus on Tesla and its forthcoming autonomous taxi service.The potential reduction in government contracts appears to majorly affect SpaceX rather than Tesla. SpaceX, a private space enterprise, has secured substantial NASA funding for International Space Station missions, including astronaut transport, cargo delivery, and various space operations. The company is currently developing a large-scale rocket for NASA's upcoming lunar mission scheduled for next year.Starlink, operating as a SpaceX division specialising in satellite internet services, has seemingly profited from Musk's previous cordial relationship with Trump.During his Middle Eastern visit with Trump last month, Musk revealed Saudi Arabia's approval for Starlink's aviation and maritime operations. Although the influence of political factors remains uncertain, recent agreements in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and other nations have emerged amid Trump's tariff warnings and diplomatic pressures.SpaceX's recent achievements are reflected in its valuation, which reached $350 billion through private financing and share sales, marking a significant increase from $210 billion in the previous year.","Investor confidence appears shaken, resulting in substantial paper losses for musk's personal tesla shareholding, dropping $20 billion in a single day. The day's trading concluded with tesla's market value reduced by $150 billion, an amount that exceeds the total market capitalisation of starbucks and several other major us-listed corporations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121662658,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-94887,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

In Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill: Volume 1, the Bride doesn’t just seek revenge—she draws blood with elegance, precision, and a katana. Elon Musk , freshly unshackled from his stint inside Trump’s government, seems to be channelling the same energy—only this time, the blade is fiscal discipline, and the target is Donald Trump ’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.”On Wednesday, Musk tweeted to his 180 million followers with a message that could’ve come straight out of Tarantino’s trailer: “Call your Senator. Call your Congressman. Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.” Attached was a photoshopped poster of Kill Bill, with Trump’s face clumsily plastered over David Carradine’s and the bill clutched like a samurai scroll of doom.The Bill in question? H.R.1, passed by the House on May 22. A sprawling $4 trillion mega-package that extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, pumps funds into border security, expands defence spending—and raises the debt ceiling to eyewatering new heights. MAGA Republicans call it “historic.” Musk calls it “a disgusting abomination.”Only days ago, Musk was working inside the belly of the beast as head of DOGE—Trump’s ironically titled Department of Government Efficiency. Appointed as a “special government employee,” he spent 130 days trying to trim Washington’s flab.Today, he’s torching it from the outside.“This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk posted on X. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.”He followed up with a flurry of economic memes, deficit graphs, and that now-viral Kill Bill parody poster, putting him squarely at odds with the very president who once called him “America’s Tech Da Vinci.”Musk didn’t stop at aesthetics. He’s gone full Paul Revere with PowerPoint slides. Calling the bill “Debt Slavery,” he warned that America is “in the fast lane to fiscal suicide.” By his math, the legislation could blow the deficit past $2.5 trillion and inflate the national debt by as much as $5 trillion—figures echoed, though slightly more cautiously, by the Congressional Budget Office.“This spending bill contains the largest increase in the debt ceiling in US history!” Musk wrote. “Congress is making America bankrupt.”Some in the GOP are rattled. Musk was the largest Republican donor of the 2024 election cycle—and now he’s threatening to fund primary challenges against any lawmaker backing the bill. “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,” he posted, turning his money cannon on the very party he helped prop up.The White House, meanwhile, responded with Trumpian defiance. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt shrugged it off: “This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.”Trump even posted a nostalgic screenshot of Musk thanking him for the DOGE appointment—equal parts reminder and rebuke. House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to reach out. Musk left him on read, then shared a video clip of Johnson’s defence of the bill with a blunt caption: “We need a new bill that doesn’t grow the deficit.”Senator Kevin Cramer was less concerned. “I don’t think very many senators are that interested in what Elon has to say,” he told reporters. “It’s amusing. But we’re serious policymakers.”Some men campaign. Elon Musk campaigned on something. What that ""something"" was, in hindsight, feels like a mix of politics, pharmaceuticals, vanity, and chaos theory.Musk’s drug use didn’t begin with the Trump campaign—it simply became more theatrical. While the Wall Street Journal had reported as early as 2023 that Tesla board members were alarmed by his use of Ambien, The New York Times now paints a darker picture.By 2024, Musk was reportedly taking ketamine so frequently it affected his bladder function. MDMA and psilocybin mushrooms followed, often at private parties across the globe. One image reviewed by NYT showed a pill organiser containing around 20 substances—some labelled as Adderall.The effect? Public incoherence, private panic. What Musk claimed was bi-weekly therapeutic use looked, to many insiders, like daily microcosmic meltdown.Musk didn’t just endorse Trump—he practically embedded himself in the campaign. He appeared at rallies, brought his son X into the Oval Office, and travelled with the child on the trail.Grimes, the boy’s mother, objected—saying it violated a custody agreement. But that was just one chapter in Musk’s domestic soap opera. In February, right-wing influencer Ashley St. Clair revealed she had given birth to Musk’s 14th child. She claimed Musk offered $15 million and $100,000 a month to keep it quiet. When she refused, Musk filed for a gag order.Simultaneously, Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis was pregnant with two more of Musk’s children via surrogate—reportedly unaware of St. Clair. If his public persona was spiralling, his private life was already in freefall.Inside the administration, things were just as unhinged. After Trump’s win, Musk helped design DOGE, rented a cottage at Mar-a-Lago, and joined transition calls with foreign leaders. But colleagues quickly became alarmed.He insulted cabinet members, showed up disoriented to briefings, and raised eyebrows at the inauguration with what neuroscientist Philip Low later condemned as a Nazi-style salute. At CPAC, he donned sunglasses, accepted a chainsaw on stage, and delivered a performance that many said looked more like Burning Man than Beltway.His exit in May 2025 wasn’t shocking. The only surprise was that it hadn’t come sooner.Musk’s departure from government wasn’t a clean break. It was a scorched-earth retreat. He arrived as a tech messiah, a billionaire savant here to trim the fat of government. He left as a psychedelic Cassandra—raging on social media, estranged from his allies, and battling legislation he once helped shape.","Elon musk has taken aim at donald trump’s ‘one big beautiful bill’ h.r.1, passed by the house on may 22, is a sprawling $4 trillion mega-package.
