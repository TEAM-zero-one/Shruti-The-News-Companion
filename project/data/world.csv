""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump

NEW DELHI: India has rejected China's claim of mediation in its conflict with Pakistan, reiterating its stand that the military action was paused following a request from the Pakistani DGMO to his Indian counterpart.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi claimed on Tuesday that the crisis involving India and Pakistan were among the ""hotspot issues"" mediated by his country in 2025. The assertion, similar to the US President Donald Trump's boasts of having played the peace broker in May, came as a surprise because of the time lag and the assessment here that Beijing was the undeclared participant in the4-day conflict arrayed on Pakistan's side.Indian govt sources expressed surprise at Wang's statement, whose country, in fact, provided crucial military assistance to Pakistan in May 7-10 conflict, and said it was as baseless as the repeated assertion of President Trump that he brokered a ""ceasefire"".They emphasised that China was not part of any conversation related to the cessation of military action. India, from PM Modi downwards, has repeatedly asserted that it agreed to pause the military action after Pakistani DGMO Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah reached out to his Indian counterpart Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai.India has consistently maintained there is no place for any third-party intervention in matters related to India and Pakistan, terming them bilateral.Wang had said, ""China mediated in northern Myanmar, Iranian nuclear issue, tensions between Pakistan and India, issues between Palestine and Israel, and the recent conflict between Cambodia and Thailand.""India had targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK - following the killing of civilians, mostly tourists, by terrorists in Pahalgam - as part of Opeartion Sindoor, and had then responded to the hostile neighbour's military action.","China's foreign minister wang yi claimed on tuesday that the crisis involving india and pakistan were among the ""hotspot issues"" mediated by his country in 2025.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Compared with the uae and saudi arabia, bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry. Golden residency visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Bahrain’s golden residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126234204,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-648989,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'India Will Be 3rd Largest Economy': PM Modi Sounds Warning To Trump, Says World is Betting on Delhi

India Becomes Fourth Largest Economy

High Growth, Low Inflation - The Goldilocks Situation

In a major feat, India has moved past Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy in nominal GDP terms, according to the government’s year-end economic review. Not only that, the Indian economy is set to overtake Germany to become the third largest after the US and China in the coming years. A final confirmation will depend on the data released by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in the first half of 2026 when the final figures for 2025 will be released.“With GDP valued at $4.18 trillion, India has surpassed Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy and is poised to displace Germany from the third rank in the next 2.5 to 3 years with projected GDP of $7.3 trillion by 2030,” the government release said.India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now. The size of its economy has doubled in the last ten years, and it is now eyeing the position of being the third largest in the world.A government economic note issued late Monday highlighted that India remains one of the fastest-expanding major economies globally and is well placed to maintain its growth pace.IMF forecasts for 2026 value India’s economy at $4.51 trillion, slightly above Japan’s projected $4.46 trillion.The government’s optimistic outlook comes even as the economy faces headwinds following the imposition of steep US tariffs in August linked to India’s purchases of Russian oil.Recent high-frequency data signals that economic momentum is holding firm. Inflation has stayed below the lower bound of the tolerance band, joblessness is easing, and exports are showing steady improvement, the government review noted.Financial conditions also remain supportive, marked by healthy credit expansion to businesses, while demand continues to be resilient, aided by a further pickup in urban consumption.India’s real GDP expanded by 8.2% in the second quarter of FY 2025-26, accelerating from 7.8% in the preceding quarter and 7.4% in the final quarter of FY 2024-25. This growth was driven by strong domestic demand, even as global trade and policy uncertainties persisted. Real gross value added rose 8.1%, underpinned by solid performance in the industrial and services sectors.The Reserve Bank of India raised its growth projection for FY 2025-26 to 7.3%, up from 6.8% earlier. The upward revision factors in sustained domestic demand, rationalisation of income tax and GST, softer crude prices, an early push in government capital spending, and accommodative monetary and financial conditions, all supported by contained inflation.“Ongoing reforms are likely to further enable growth prospects. The present macro-economic situation presents a rare “goldilocks period” of high growth and low inflation,” the review said.CPI inflation stood at 4.26% in January and gradually moderated over the first half of the year, before declining further to multi-year lows during the latter half. Headline inflation continued to soften and touched historic lows of around 0.25% in October. This sharper-than-expected disinflation was primarily driven by a correction in food prices.RBI has cumulatively cut the repo rate by 1.25% this year, down from 6.5% to 5.25%. The move reflected a balanced approach between supporting growth and managing inflation, aided by a favourable outlook for both headline and core inflation.India’s external position continues to display considerable strength. Supported by healthy growth in services exports and a steady rise in overseas remittances, the current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 1.3% of GDP in the second quarter of FY 2025–26, down from 2.2% in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, the government release said.Remittance inflows rose by 10.7% year-on-year during the quarter, reinforcing external stability. With services exports maintaining momentum and remittance flows remaining strong, the CAD is expected to stay contained through 2025–26.“India’s growth outlook remains buoyant, with global and domestic institutions upgrading their assessments on the back of strong economic fundamentals. Reflecting broad-based momentum across key sectors, the Reserve Bank of India revised its GDP growth projection for FY 2025–26 upward from 6.8% to 7.3%,” the review said.","India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now.

Khaleda Zia’s funeral: EAM Jaishankar Hands Over Modi’s Letter To BNP Chief Tarique Rahman In Dhaka

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia in a personal letter addressed to her son and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman, describing her as a leader of “rare resolve and conviction” whose legacy would continue to shape ties between India and Bangladesh.The letter was handed over by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who represented India at Khaleda Zia’s funeral in Dhaka on Wednesday. Zia, a three-time prime minister and the founding figure of the BNP, died on Tuesday after a prolonged illness, prompting an outpouring of condolences from regional leaders.In his message, PM Modi wrote, “Dear Tarique Rahman Saheb, I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing away of your mother, Her Excellency Begum Khaleda Zia, former Prime Minister of Bangladesh and Chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Please accept my heartfelt condolences on this profound personal loss.” He recalled his meeting with Zia during his visit to Dhaka in June 2015, saying she “made many important contributions to the development of Bangladesh, as well as to the strengthening of India-Bangladesh relations”.PM Modi described Zia as “the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh” and said that while her death left “an irreplaceable void”, her “vision and legacy will endure”.Expressing confidence in Tarique Rahman’s political role, he added, “I am confident that her ideals will be carried forward under your able leadership of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and will continue to serve as a guiding light to ensure a new beginning and the enrichment of the deep and historic partnership between India and Bangladesh. ”The prime minister also extended his thoughts to the Bangladeshi people, praising their “shared values, democratic traditions, and a deep sense of national unity”, and wished Rahman strength and fortitude in overcoming the loss.Jaishankar echoed similar sentiments during his interaction with Rahman, later posting on social media that he had conveyed “deepest condolences on behalf of the Government and people of India” and expressed confidence that “Begum Khaleda Zia’s vision and values will guide the development of our partnership”.On the sidelines of the funeral, Jaishankar exchanged greetings with several regional dignitaries, including Pakistan National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Nepal’s foreign minister Balananda Sharma.","Pm modi paid tribute to former bangladesh prime minister khaleda zia in a personal letter addressed to her son and bangladesh nationalist party (bnp) acting chairman tarique rahman.

Throwback 25: Five Indian Weapons That Crushed Terror And Dominated Pakistan in Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: India welcomed the New Year 2026 with vibrant celebrations across the country, as people gathered in large numbers to mark the occasion with joy and festivity on Thursday night.Cities came alive with fireworks, cultural events, live music performances, and themed decorations as the nation stepped into another year.The outgoing year, 2025, was remembered for India’s focus on reforms, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.“What makes the reforms of 2025 significant is not only their dimension but also their underlying philosophy.

NEW DELHI: The ""new normal"" in India's national security playbook took on a harder edge in 2025. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi , the country's zero-tolerance doctrine against terrorism, especially the kind nurtured across the border in Pakistan, became not just policy but a mindset. For years, Pakistan has acted much like a hostile neighbour, failing short of India's expectations while cultivating, training and unleashing anti-India sentiment and activities from its soil. In 2025, that long-running tension erupted into one of the darkest chapters in Kashmir's recent history.Crossborder terrorism and India's counterterror responses became defining markers of 2025. The Pahalgam massacre, one of the most horrifying attacks in recent years, shook the nation and ignited widespread grief and anger.The Prime Minister, who was abroad at the time, cut short his trip and returned to New Delhi immediately.In his first public remarks after the attack, switching briefly and unusually to English, he signalled India's mood and mission. ""Today, from the soil of Bihar, I say this to the whole world, India will identify, trace and punish every terrorist and their backers. We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth,"" he declared, framing a battle of ""Yuddha"" against terror from the land of ""Buddha.""The year went on to witness not just an ugly terror attack but also India's most far-reaching counteroffensive since the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 Balakot airstrikes. Operation Sindoor , New Delhi's military retaliation after Pahalgam, targeted terror infrastructure deep inside Pakistan and PoK, making this the first time India expanded its precision strikes beyond PoK into mainland Pakistan.The operation, the government says, remains in a ""paused"" state. Alongside Sindoor, several other counterterror operations were carried out through the year, keeping a firm and continuous check on terror.April 22 began as a quiet spring morning in the Baisaran Valley in Pahalgam, a routine day for a popular tourist spot. Within hours, it became the scene of one of the gravest terror incidents in recent years. Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, from a proxy group of Lashkar-e-Taiba, opened fire on civilians in the meadows, killing 26 people and leaving the region shaken.Eyewitnesses recounted the attackers tried to identify victims' faith by demanding Aadhaar cards or driving licences, asking them to recite the kalma, and even forcing some to unzip their pants so they could check for circumcision. Unlike many other terror incidents, this attack reportedly did not follow a usual pattern, as the killings appeared to be carried out selectively.As soon as the news reached the national capital, New Delhi moved quickly. Union home minister Amit Shah reached the Valley the same day and also visited the site in Baisaran later. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was on an official trip to Saudi Arabia, cut short his two-day visit, skipped a scheduled state dinner to be hosted by Kingdom and returned to India immediately.Global leaders spoke to the Prime Minister, expressing condemnation and solidarity. The attack also coincided with the visit of US Vice President JD Vance, who was in India on a four-day trip with his family. From US President Donald Trump to then Nepalese prime minister KP Oli, several world leaders reached out to PM Modi, conveying support for India and strongly condemning the attack.""President Donald Trump @realDonaldTrump @POTUS called PM @narendramodi and conveyed his deepest condolences at the loss of innocent lives in the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir . President Trump strongly condemned the terror attack and expressed full support to India to bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous attack. India and the United States stand together in the fight against terror,"" The ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X.As investigations began, it quickly became evident that the conspiracy once again traced back to Pakistan and its proxy terror networks. Evidence pointed clearly to crossborder involvement, with the planning and execution of the Pahalgam attack fitting the same pattern seen in past incidents in the region.For the agencies, Pakistan’s role was no mystery. Army units and intelligence teams followed the trail, identified those behind the killings, and eventually eliminated the Lashkar terrorists responsible for the April 22 massacre during Operation Mahadev in August.The very next day of attack, on April 23 -- India initiated retaliatory measures diplomatically against Pakistan. New Delhi announced a series of strict punitive actions, signalling a decisive diplomatic response.That evening, the ministry of external affairs, led by foreign secretary Vikram Misri, briefed the media after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) chaired by Prime Minister Modi. The intent was communicated unambiguously: India would respond firmly to the Pahalgam attack and hold Pakistan accountable.The decisions taken were strong retaliatory steps aimed at exerting diplomatic and economic pressure on Pakistan, whose soil has long been used to support terror networks targeting India.The long-standing Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 with World Bank mediation, was put in abeyance with immediate effect. The move sent a clear message. The waters of the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab are vital for Pakistan’s agriculture, particularly wheat and cotton, and form the backbone of its water security.Following the suspension, Pakistan faced a heightened risk of inadequate water storage earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025. Roughly 80% of Pakistani farmland depends on the Indus basin, as do most of its hydropower projects.India closed the Attari border ICP and instructed individuals who had crossed with valid endorsements to return through the same route immediately.Pakistani nationals were barred from travelling to India under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme. All previously issued SVES visas were cancelled with immediate effect, and Pakistani nationals in India were instructed to leave within 48 hours.India declared the defence, naval and air advisors at the Pakistani high commission in New Delhi as Persona Non Grata, giving them a week to leave the country.India simultaneously withdrew its own defence, naval and air Advisors from its high commission in Islamabad. These posts in both missions were formally annulled, along with the withdrawal of five associated support staff on each side.The staff strength in both high commissions was ordered to be reduced from 55 to 30, with the changes taking effect by 1 May 2025.These measures underscored a clear shift: Pakistan was pushed to the margins of India's diplomatic priorities, a direct consequence of the Pahalgam attack and its continuing role in crossborder terrorism.After days of rising tension and diplomatic fallout with Pakistan, India launched a decisive military response. On the intervening night of May 6 and 7, almost two weeks after the Pahalgam attack, the Indian armed forces carried out Operation Sindoor, targeting key terror bases, including high-value targets.The terrorists responsible for the Pahalgam attack were linked to LeT's proxy, The Resistance Front (TRF). The operation struck nine terror installations, including the Muridke base of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed. The Bahawalpur base of JeM chief Masood Azhar was also targeted, resulting in the deaths of several of Azhar’s family members.According to the ministry of defence, the operation was so far ""focused, measured and non-escalatory,"" deliberately avoiding Pakistani military facilities.The Indian Air Force struck nine high-value terror camps where militants harboured and trained. These included:India made it clear that the precision strikes targeted only terrorist infrastructure and did not affect Pakistan's state or army installations.But in the following night, Pakistan carried out another misadventure and attempted retaliation with the barrage of drones and missiles, which were seen from several cities on border line.However, India's Sudarshan Chakra, a multi-layered integrated air defence system including IADS and the S-400, intercepted and neutralised all threats, including Turkish drones, Chinese missiles, and possibly some Pakistani aircraft, preventing any damage on Indian soil.The day after the operation, the MEA held a briefing led by foreign secretary Misri, joined by Colonel Sofia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, to provide updates on the military action of the night.""These were neutralized by the Integrated Counter Unmanned Aerial System and other Air Defence systems,"" said Wing Commander Vyomika Singh during an MEA briefing.In response, India carried out further strikes inside Pakistan, targeting 11 key airbases, including Nur Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Bholari, Rafiqui, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Skaru, and Jacobabad. The strikes reportedly destroyed around 20 percent of Pakistan Air Force infrastructure, including fighter jets and a SAM system. Over 50 personnel were killed at Bholari Air Base, including Pakistan squadron leader Usman Yousuf.Some bases, such as Rahim Yar Khan, remained non-operational for months.Military tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours eventually eased on May 10 after Pakistan's DGMO contacted the Indian counterpart to agree on a ceasefire on land, air, and water.However, India maintains that Operation Sindoor is just ""paused"" as the Prime Minister Modi, and Amit Shah clearly stated.In his first address after the strikes, he said, ""India has only paused military action and will retaliate on its own terms if another terror attack occurs."" He added, ""The three armies of India -- Air Force, Navy, and Army, along with BSF and military forces -- are on alert. After the surgical strike and air strike, Operation Sindoor is India’s policy against terrorism. Operation Sindoor has drawn a new line against terrorism. """"Operation Sindoor is not just a name but it's a reflection of the feelings of millions of people of the country,"" Prime Minister Modi said.Months later, IAF chief Amar Preet Singh confirmed the scale of losses inflicted on Pakistan. ""We have signs of one C-130 class aircraft and at least four to five fighter jets, most likely F-16s, along with one SAM system destroyed. We have clear evidence of a long-range strike exceeding 300 km, along with five high-tech fighters between F-16 and JF-17 class,"" he said.Soon after Operation Sindoor, the Army launched large-scale raids and counterterror operations across the Valley. One of the major actions was Operation Keller, a ""search and destroy"" mission initiated in May in the Keller forest area of Jammu and Kashmir's Shopian district.The Army, CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir Police conducted a coordinated manhunt to track terrorists believed to be hiding in the dense forest belt.During the operation, security forces eliminated three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists and recovered a significant cache of arms and ammunition, including AK-47 rifles, grenades and hundreds of rounds.Those killed included Shahid Kuttay, an LeT/TRF commander, and Hussain Thokar, both linked to recent terror activities in the region.Operation Keller underscored the heightened synergy between security forces and intelligence agencies after the Pahalgam massacre, marking the start of a sustained crackdown on terrorist networks in the Valley.The terrorists responsible for the April 22 Pahalgam massacre, in which 26 civilians were killed, remained on the run for months. Under Operation Mahadev, they were finally tracked down and neutralised.The operation, carried out over 12 days with precise intelligence inputs, led to the elimination of three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists confirmed to be involved in the Pahalgam killings.Union home minister Amit Shah announced the outcome during the Monsoon Session of Parliament: “I want to tell the House and the people of the country that those who killed our people in Baisaran Valley … all three terrorists have been killed.”He added that “Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev have sent a clear message to the masterminds of terror about the consequences of playing with the lives of Indian citizens.”The three high-profile Lashkar terrorists were killed on July 28 in an encounter in the Dachigam forest near Srinagar, where they had been hiding since the April attack.","The pahalgam massacre, one of the most horrifying attacks in recent years, shook the nation and ignited widespread grief and anger. India's zero-tolerance doctrine against terrorism, especially the kind nurtured across the border in pakistan, became not just policy but a mindset.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126273555,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-760078,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
US and India Stand Strong Against China: The Real Geopolitical Dynamics Unveiled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-us-china-relations-strategic-altruism-keji-mao-trumps-second-term-shift-on-india-india-and-china-relations/articleshow/126273059.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump

Why it matters: No more US “Strategic altruism” for India

The core claim of Mao, an analyst at China’s International Cooperation Center and founder of the South Asia Research Brief, starts with history. Since the late 1990s, he argues, Washington practiced what many Chinese scholars label “strategic altruism” toward India-absorbing real diplomatic costs to integrate New Delhi into the global order. The most visible example was the civil nuclear deal that carved out an exception to global nonproliferation norms. The logic: A rising democratic India would eventually help balance China in Asia.

That logic, Mao says, has broken down. During Donald Trump’s second term, the US imposed steep tariffs on Indian goods, raised visa fees, tightened outsourcing rules, and adopted rhetoric towards New Delhi that often sounded dismissive. Many Western observers, Mao notes, wave this away as a “Trump anomaly.” He rejects that view.

For Mao, the driver is structural. “The root driver is US anxiety over its declining strength, which now outweighs concern about external geopolitical threats.” In this frame, Washington is cautious with hard retaliators like China and Russia, but tougher on allies. His most vivid line captures the shift: Allies become “blood bags”, with the US preferring to squeeze partners for immediate gains over paying uncertain costs for long-run strategic contests.”

India, Mao argues, is especially exposed. It “has enjoyed US indulgence but lacks the industrial/economic heft of Japan, Europe or Korea to make major concessions-and is less willing to bend-so it is cast as ‘conspicuously ungrateful’.” Over time, he suggests, this friction could reduce tensions between Beijing and both Washington and New Delhi, paving the way for a realignment favorable to China.

The big picture

Zoom in: American decline, exaggerated

China’s numbers

Between the lines: Political turbulence in Beijing

Geography still matters

Why India won’t stay in China’s shadow

What next

Then as the Economist wrote, ""hubris haunts the Communist Party and in 2026 Mr Xi will be tempted to assert China’s interests more aggressively. That creates a risk of dangerous overreach in three areas: trade, Taiwan and new Chinese-run global rules.""

Bottom line

A new narrative about upcoming geopolitical upheaval is taking shape in a section of strategic analysts. As per this: China is destined for the top spot, while the United States and India slide into a “battle for second place. ”The argument is gaining traction among Chinese strategists and analysts, including Keji Mao, who says Washington’s long bet on India has soured and US decline anxiety is reshaping alliances.Mao’s logic is coherent-and comforting for Beijing. It fits a long-running Chinese conviction that American decline is destined and China’s rise is inevitable and durable. But it rests on assumptions that are far more fragile than they appear.However, the nature of power in the twenty-first century is not one-dimensional. It is a mosaic of capabilities-technological, financial, military, demographic, institutional-spread across domains and regions. In some, China will lead. In others, the US remains preeminent. India is carving out a distinct pole that neither mirrors China nor fully aligns with Washington.Framing the future as a simple race for first and second place flatters hierarchy but obscures how influence actually accumulates-and how constraints bite.The first weak link in Mao’s thesis is its linear view of US decline. History suggests a more cyclical pattern.From the Sputnik shock of the 1950s to Vietnam, from Japan’s rise in the 1980s to the 2008 financial crisis, predictions of American eclipse have been routine. Each time, internal dysfunction and polarization produced dire forecasts. Each time, scale, innovation, institutions, and alliances enabled adaptation.Trump can be read less as proof of terminal decline than as a backlash phase-an ugly but familiar spasm in democratic systems under stress. Democracies and market economies are messy, but they self-correct in ways centralized systems struggle to replicate.Nor does current evidence show a US retreat from Asia. Even amid trade disputes, Washington has deepened security cooperation with Japan, Australia, and the Philippines; reinforced ties with South Korea; expanded technology controls aimed squarely at China; and maintained a robust Indo-Pacific military posture. These are not the actions of a power resigning itself to second place.Also read: India–US ties: US embassy shares key moments of 2025; eyes stronger year ahead



Mao’s confidence also leans heavily on assumptions about China’s economic trajectory. Recent data complicate that story.As Bloomberg has reported, China’s economy looked resilient on the surface in 2025. Exports surged, growth hovered near the official target, and Beijing avoided a “bazooka” stimulus. Manufacturers moved up the value chain, and the trade surplus widened.Beneath the headlines, however, momentum has softened. Investment is heading for its first annual contraction since 1998. Retail sales growth has slowed to its weakest pace outside the pandemic. New home prices continue to fall, extending a property crisis with no clear end. To stabilize growth, Beijing has pledged broader fiscal support in 2026-targeting advanced manufacturing, technology innovation, and human capital.None of this signals collapse. But it does question the notion of effortless, linear ascent-and highlights the difficulty of rebalancing an economy while demographics worsen and political control tightens.Economic stress is compounded by political anxiety. Bloomberg reports that Xi Jinping probed a record number of senior officials for corruption in 2025, following earlier purges of top generals. With jockeying intensifying ahead of the next Communist Party congress, questions are emerging about governance quality and elite cohesion.As Alfred Wu of the National University of Singapore told Bloomberg, “For China, there is much more turbulence domestically.” Anti-corruption drives consolidate control, but they also raise uncomfortable questions about military readiness and decision-making in a system increasingly centered on a single leader.These internal stresses matter because they constrain how aggressively China can translate ambition into action abroad.GDP is not destiny. Geography and geopolitics remain powerful constraints-and here, China faces enduring disadvantages.China shares land borders with 14 countries and maritime boundaries with several more. It has unresolved disputes or strained relations with many of them, from India and Japan to the Philippines and Vietnam. That creates a neighborhood defined less by deference than by hedging and quiet balancing.Former Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan captured this reality in Foreign Policy: “No country will ever shun China. Every country wants as good a relationship with China as possible. But China’s overall geopolitical situation is not favorable.” He asks which states would “meekly acquiesce to China occupying the apex of a regional hierarchy.”For Japan, the Koreas, and Vietnam, national identities have long been defined in opposition to China’s civilizational pull. Subordination would require a wrenching redefinition of identity-making almost any alternative more attractive.This limits Beijing’s ability to convert economic weight into political dominance, a lesson the Soviet Union learned at great cost.Mao is right that India is not China in manufacturing-yet. But the leap from that observation to a future of permanent second place misses the dynamics of India’s rise.India’s strengths lie in demographics, services, digital public infrastructure, and strategic geography. Unlike China, India does not face the same pace of demographic aging. Its market size and political pluralism make it attractive to firms and governments seeking diversification away from China.India’s geography matters too. Sitting astride key Indian Ocean sea lanes and bordering China, it cannot be sidelined by Washington or easily coerced by Beijing. This gives New Delhi leverage-even when relations with the US are tense.US–India frictions under Trump are real. But friction is not rupture. Structural interests-balancing China, securing supply chains, cooperating on defense and technology-continue to pull the relationship back together. India’s rise does not depend solely on American indulgence; it rests on domestic reform, market scale, and a global environment eager for alternatives to China.For Beijing, the danger lies in mistaking temporary US–India strains for a permanent realignment. Overconfidence risks miscalculation-especially at a moment when domestic headwinds are rising and neighbors are wary.If Xi decides to invade Taiwan, whether in 2026 or 2027, China may get entangled in a protracted and unwinnable war. According to some calculations, even a blockade of Taiwan would lead to 7-9% decline in Chinese GDP. This may severely impact China's superpower aspirations.For Washington and New Delhi, the path ahead will be uneven. Trade disputes, immigration politics, and industrial competition will generate friction. But shared strategic interests and mutual leverage argue against a clean break.The more likely future is prolonged, contested coexistence: China rising but constrained; the US adapting rather than fading; India carving out a larger, more independent role.American decline is not destiny. India’s limitations are not permanent. And China’s rise-while real-is neither frictionless nor uncontested. The world they inhabit is too complex, too crowded, and too dynamic for any single power to conduct the orchestra alone.","Keji mao says the u.s. has lost its ""strategic altruism"" toward india. Mao: us anxiety over its declining strength now outweighs concern about external threats. In this frame, washington is cautious with hard retaliators like china and russia, but tougher on allies. Mao is right that india is not china in manufacturing-yet.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126274142,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1075489,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

NEW DELHI: Days after Isro launched its heavy-lift rocket LVM3 carrying US BlueBird Block-2 satellite, rocket debris, suspected of the Indian space rocket, washed ashore on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka. The rocket part was found on Sunday evening along the Malai Munthal sea stretch near Trincomalee. Local residents and fishermen first spotted the object after it was pushed ashore by strong ocean currents, prompting alerts to Sri Lankan authorities.Experts suspect the fragment is a portion of the payload fairing, the protective shell that houses satellites, which typically detaches during the rocket's ascent. The payload fairing is five metre in diameter and 10 metre long. Following the spotting of the debris, Lankan naval officials were deployed to secure the site. This is not the first such incident in the region. In the past, debris from rockets launched from Sriharikota had occasionally been recovered in the waters of Sri Lanka and the Maldives.In the past, parts of Indian rocket debris were also found on the Australian coast. On July 31, 2013, officials had identified an object found on a beach in Western Australia to be a part of a rocket launched by Isro. The Australian Space Agency had then said it was likely debris from the “expended third-stage of a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle”.","The rocket part was found on sunday evening along the malai munthal sea stretch near trincomalee.

SC handled 75k cases in 2025, unmatched by any top court

NEW DELHI: CJI Surya Kant has devised four categories of cases to prioritise listing and hearing of petitions filed by socially, physically, and financially disadvantaged people.The new categories of cases relate to those filed by disabled people and acid attack survivors, by senior citizens above 80 years, persons who are below poverty line and those who have approached the court through legal aid services that provide free advocate assistance to poor litigants.The new categorisation was needed as their cases used to get lost in the crowd of 800-odd cases that get listed on Mondays and Fridays, the two days in a week when 16 benches of SC entertain fresh petitions and determine whether these require longer hearing.A circular by the SC registry said, ""Members of the Bar, parties-in-person and all stakeholders are required to invariably mention the relevant head... under which the matter actually falls, in all the fresh petitions to be filed... and submit an appropriate application/letter along with the documentary proof issued by an appropriate govt authority in this regard.""Further, all concerned are also requested to provide the said details in pending matters/cases to enable the registry to appropriately update the matter under the respective head.This will enable the registry to prioritise listing of such cases,"" it said.The humongous volume of cases handled by the highest court of the country is unmatched by any country's Supreme Court, by a huge margin. In 2025, as many as 75,280 cases were filed in SC - 51,357 civil and 23,923 criminal. It decided 65,403 (87% of the total filing), 42,793 civil and 22,610 criminal.In contrast, though thousands of cases are filed every year in US Supreme Court, it accepts only 70-80 cases for arguments. Till Dec 29, UK Supreme Court had received little over 200 cases and gave judgments in around 50 cases. Their Indian counterpart gave 1,400 lengthy judgments and thousands of orders to dispose of cases.SC, which saw three CJIs in 2025 in Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai and Surya Kant, will not see a new CJI till Feb 2027, when Justice Kant retires.In 2027, SC will see a record four CJIs - Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath (from Feb to Sep), BV Nagarathna (for 37 days) and PS Narasimha.","Sc handled 75k cases in 2025, unmatched by any top court in the world.

NEW DELHI: Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) on Wednesday morning successfully conducted a salvo launch of two ‘Pralay’ missiles in quick succession from the same launcher at the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur, off the coast of Odisha.Defence minister Rajnath Singh has complimented DRDO, IAF, Indian Army, defence PSUs and the industry on the successful launch of the missiles in quick succession. The completion of the salvo launch (simultaneous firing) of Pralay has established the reliability of the missile, he said. Pralay is an indigenously developed solid propellant quasi-ballistic missile employing state-of-the-art guidance and navigation to ensure high precision. The missile is capable of carrying multiple types of warheads against various targets.The Pralay test came just a day after India conducted the first flight test of the Pinaka Long-Range Guided Rocket, also from Chandipur, on Monday and test-fired a 3,500-km range K-4 ballistic missile from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Dec 23. India is developing an array of missiles to reinforce its defences against hostile forces and be ready for counter-attacks.According to a defence ministry’s statement, the flight test around 10.30 am was conducted as part of user evaluation trials. Both missiles followed the intended trajectory and met all flight objectives, as confirmed by tracking sensors deployed by the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur. The terminal events were confirmed by telemetry systems installed on board the ship, deployed near the impact points.DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat has congratulated the teams involved in the successful flight-tests and stated that the achievement indicates imminent readiness of induction of the system with the users.The missile has been developed by Research Centre Imarat, Hyderabad, in collaboration with other DRDO laboratories. For the tests, the systems were integrated by two development-cum-production partners.Pralay is equipped with an advanced Inertial Navigation System (INS), complemented by a radio frequency seeker to ensure accurate guidance throughout its flight. These systems enable the missile to maintain a precise trajectory and achieve a high level of target accuracy. Officials said the latest user trials were aimed at validating the missile’s navigation and precision strike capabilities under operational conditions in order to prepare it for induction into the armed forces.",Pralay is an indigenously developed solid propellant quasi-ballistic missile employing state-of-the-art guidance and navigation to ensure high precision.

Throwback 25: Five Indian Weapons That Crushed Terror And Dominated Pakistan in Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Operation Sindoor stands as a ""resounding testament"" to India's unwavering resolve against terrorism, and with precision and professionalism, the Indian armed forces struck deep into the heart of Pakistan's terror infrastructure delivering a ""calibrated and decisive blow"", the defence ministry said on Wednesday.The operation sent an ""unambiguous message"" to the world -- ""India will not tolerate terror, and those who sponsor it will face the full force of retribution"", it said.""This operation would be remembered as a defining moment in India's military history and as a symbol of military precision and national resolve,"" the ministry said in a year-end review statement.Operation Sindoor was carried out in the early hours of May 7 eliminating at least 100 terrorists in response to the horrific Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 innocent civilians.Indian armed forces had launched a series of precision missile strikes on nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir under this military action, which resulted in a four-day conflict between India and Pakistan.The ministry said the operation stands as a ""resounding testament to India's unwavering resolve against terrorism -- a bold demonstration of decisive leadership, joint operational synergy and the nation's intent to safeguard its sovereignty against brutal killings by Pakistan-based terrorists"".The operation showcased ""unmatched multi-domain capability"" and was executed simultaneously across the traditional domains of land, maritime and air as well as the emerging domains of cyber, space and information warfare.""With strategic foresight and restraint of the forces, Operation Sindoor highlighted India's sustained focus on capability development, i.e., from intelligence dominance to cutting-edge technology and joint operational readiness,"" the ministry said.The operation was a ""classic demonstration of execution of will of the nation"" through ""seamless integration of all organs of the government"". The success of home-grown technologies and weapon systems in combat was validation of the success of the vision of 'Aatmanirbharta' espoused by India, it said.Operation Sindoor also marked a milestone in India's journey towards technological self-reliance in military operations -- whether in drone warfare, layered air defence, or electronic warfare. It was also a shining example of tri-Service coordination, the ministry said.While the Indian Air Force launched attacks from the air, the Army soldiers stood firmly on the Line of Control and ""delivered a befitting reply to every Pakistani action"", the statement said.The Indian Navy maintained its strong posture in the north Arabian Sea, ""sending a clear message to Pakistan that India is capable and prepared to strike at every vital Pakistani base, from sea to land, the ministry quoted an earlier statement of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.Singh had told Parliament that Operation Sindoor had only been halted, and not ended, it said.""If Pakistan again tries to carry out any nefarious act, we are fully prepared for an even more intense and decisive action,"" Singh had said.The ministry said Operation Sindoor was powered by the country's ""transitional shift in its policy against terrorism"".From successfully destroying terror camps in Pakistan and PoK and safeguarding the borders from the ""neighbouring country's misdeeds that followed"", the nation, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the guidance of Defence Minister Singh, ""sent a clear message to its adversaries that the sovereignty, unity and integrity of Bharat will never be compromised"", it said.Singh had also said that the action was completely in self-defence, and was ""neither provocative nor expansionist"".On May 10, at approximately 1:30 am, Pakistan launched a ""massive attack"" on IAF bases, army ammunition depots, airports, and military cantonments using missiles, drones, rockets, and other long-range weapons, along with electronic warfare technologies, it said.However, the Indian air defence system, counter-drone system, and electronic equipment ""completely thwarted the attack by Pakistan"". The adversary failed to hit any targets, and none of the vital assets were damaged, the ministry said.""Major airbases like Chaklala, Sargodha, Rafiqui, Rahimyar Khan, Jacobabad, Sukkur, and Bholari were struck, and the mission was successfully accomplished. On May 10, Pakistan's DGMO contacted India's DGMO and appealed for a halt to military operations. On May 12, formal talks took place between the two DGMOs, and both sides decided to cease military operations,"" it added.The effective use of state-of-the-art 'Made-in-India' weapons during the operation is testimony to the progress the country has made to attain self-reliance, which, in today's geopolitical landscape, is ""fundamental to ensuring strategic autonomy"".From Operation Sindoor to Mission Sudarshan Chakra vision, from record defence production and exports to equipping the soldiers with latest weapons and technologies, and finalising deals for the future, ""2025 gave a glimpse of a secure, self-reliant and prosperous India,"" it said.",Operation sindoor was carried out in the early hours of may 7 eliminating at least 100 terrorists.

'Deeply Concerned': PM Modi Reacts To Reports Of Attack On Putin’s House, Ukraine Responds

Russia claims Putin targetted in attack

Third day of powercuts for Ukrainians after Russian attack

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday expressed concern over reports that the residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin had been targeted and called for restraint and a renewed focus on diplomacy.In a post on X, PM Modi said he was 'deeply concerned' by the reports and stressed that diplomatic engagement remained the best way forward. ""Deeply concerned by reports of the targeting of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation. Ongoing diplomatic efforts offer the most viable path toward ending hostilities and achieving peace. We urge all concerned to remain focused on these efforts and to avoid any actions that could undermine them,"" he said.Russia earlier claimed that Ukraine had launched a drone attack on President Putin’s state residence located between Moscow and St Petersburg. According to Reuters, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov alleged that 91 long-range drones were fired at the residence in the Novgorod region on December 28–29, all of which were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defences.Lavrov described the incident as a “terrorist attack” and said Moscow would revise its negotiating position on ending the Ukraine war.He added that Russia had already selected targets in Ukraine for what he called “retaliation strikes.”Ukraine rejected the accusation. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Russia’s claims as “lies,” alleging that Moscow was using the narrative to justify further attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv. “This alleged ‘residence strike’ story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, as well as Russia’s refusal to take necessary steps to end the war,” Zelenskyy said.He added that Ukraine does not take actions that undermine diplomacy, accusing Russia of doing the opposite, and urged the international community not to remain silent as efforts continue toward achieving a lasting peace.For three days following the latest Russian air attacks on Ukraine, residents have been without electricity or heating in Vyshhorod, a satellite town about 20 km north of Kyiv.As night-time temperatures fall to around minus 3 degrees Celsius, they spend much of the day in a small shelter equipped with heat and electricity, where they can also power their gadgets and devices.Around 20 people gather in the modest building—described on a sign outside as an “islet of warmth and power”—charging mobile phones and laptops to stay connected and continue working.",Pm narendra modi expresses concern over reports that the residence of russian president vladimir putin had been targeted.

NEW DELHI: The Army has launched a training programme for the Village Defence Guards (VDG) in Jammu and Kashmir amid the ongoing counter-terrorism operation in the higher reaches of Chenab valley.According to the Army, around 15 Village Defence Guards, including women volunteers, are undergoing intensive training in handling automatic rifles, minor tactics, self-defence, bunker construction and repelling enemy attacks, they said.Officials told news agency PTI that the raining is being conducted at Shingini panchayat of Balassa, around 90 km from the Doda district headquarters. It aims to equip volunteers with the necessary skills to protect their villages and act as a first line of defence, especially in vulnerable areas.The move complements the ongoing operation by the Army, police and paramilitary forces in the higher reaches to track down and neutralise the terrorists who had managed to infiltrate into Chenab valley, especially Doda and Kishtwar districts, a couple of years back, officials added.The VDGs welcomed the training and the recent upgradation of their weaponry. They expressed gratitude to Union Home Minister Amit Shah for providing self-loading rifles (SLRs), replacing the older .303 rifles, which they said, has significantly boosted their confidence.""This is a major programme bringing together members from 17 Village Defence Groups. We are being trained in weapon handling, bunker construction and self-defence. Receiving such training at our doorstep is highly appreciable,"" Surinder Singh, a VDG member from Shingani, said.He requested the government to provide more automatic weapons to the members, recalling the frequent terror attacks in the region during the early 1990s.Another VDG member, Rajesh Kumar Thakur from Gauala village, said the training by the Army and Jammu and Kashmir Police has instilled a sense of confidence.""Earlier, we only had .303 rifles. After receiving automatic weapons, our confidence has increased, and we now feel capable of defending our villages,"" he said.This comes as he Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts amid the ongoing Chillai Kalan — the 40-day bone-chilling winter period — in Jammu and Kashmir.According to sources, various intelligence agencies asses that there are approximately 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists currently in the Jammu region.Inputs gathered over the past few months suggest that these groups, finding themselves cornered by successful counter-terror operations, have shifted deeper into higher and middle mountain reaches of the region — areas now devoid of habitation. These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection and avoid direct confrontation with security troops, they added.Meanwhile, the Army and security forces have also adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.",The army has launched a training programme for the village defence guards (vdg) in jammu and kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi has claimed that Beijing mediated several global conflicts, including the standoff between India and Pakistan in May following the Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir.Speaking at the Symposium on the International Situation and China’s Foreign Relations on Tuesday, Wang said Beijing had taken an “objective and just stance” to build peace and focused on addressing “both symptoms and root causes”.“This year, local wars and cross-border conflicts flared up more often than at any time since the end of WWII. Geopolitical turbulence continued to spread,” Wang said at the symposium in Beijing.“To build peace that lasts, we have taken an objective and just stance, and focused on addressing both symptoms and root causes. Following this Chinese approach to settling hotspot issues, we mediated in northern Myanmar, the Iranian nuclear issue, the tensions between Pakistan and India, the issues between Palestine and Israel, and the recent conflict between Cambodia and Thailand,” he said.The statement comes despite Beijing’s role during the May 7–10 Operation Sindoor conflict between India and Pakistan coming under serious scrutiny and criticism, particularly over alleged military assistance provided by China to Islamabad.After the conflict flared up, Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt General Rahul R Singh had said Beijing used the confrontation as a “live lab”, while declining to directly elaborate on the charge.Gen Singh said China’s strategy during Operation Sindoor was based on its ancient military doctrine of the “36 stratagems”, accusing Beijing of seeking to hurt India by “killing with a borrowed knife” — a reference to alleged Chinese support to Pakistan.Meanwhile, the Indian Army on Tuesday hailed Operation Sindoor, underlining ten major milestones achieved by the force in 2025.“Nine terrorist camps across the border were destroyed. The Indian Army neutralised seven camps, while the remaining two were destroyed by the Indian Air Force. Pakistan attempted to target military and civilian assets using drones, but Indian Army air defence units successfully neutralised all threats, preventing damage and casualties. More than a dozen terror launch pads along the Line of Control were destroyed using Indian Army ground-based weapons,” the Army said.“The director general of military operations of the Indian Army was approached by his Pakistani counterpart with a request for a ceasefire. An understanding was reached to stop firing and military action,” it added.India and Pakistan were locked in a brief but intense military confrontation in May, triggered by a terror attack in the Pahalgam valley of Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, which claimed 26 innocent lives.India responded with Operation Sindoor, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.India has consistently dismissed claims of any third-party mediation, maintaining that the four-day confrontation was resolved through direct military-to-military communication.New Delhi has maintained that after sustaining heavy damage, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) called his Indian counterpart, and both sides agreed to stop all firing and military action on land, air and sea with effect from May 10.","Chinese foreign minister wang yi claims beijing mediated several global conflicts, including the standoff between india and pakistan in may.
