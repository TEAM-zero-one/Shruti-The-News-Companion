Poll Do you think India should focus more on high-tech solutions for national security today? Yes, technology is key for modern defense No, traditional strategies still matter

Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar: Lieutenant General Vinod G Khandare (retired), who was the principal advisor to the Ministry of Defence during Operation Sindoor , on Sunday said further escalating the recent Indo-Pak conflict by occupying the PoK would have given birth to a ""new monster' for India.""The ceasefire was announced by India after a request from Pakistan DGMO. The war is not a cheap solution, as it comes with heavy expenditure and creates a financial burden. We have to decide where we have to take our country, especially when we are dreaming of becoming a developed nation by 2047,"" he said, adding that we must consider what we are handing over to the next generation.While addressing a public event organised by NGO Gyanyajnah Foundation at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Khandare termed Pakistan a ""nonsensical"" country, to whom he said a befitting lesson was taught as per the principles of war. Khandare, who is the recipient of the Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Ati Vishisht Seva Medal among other honours, termed Pakistan a police state that often witnesses military rules and political anarchy.Calling Operation Sindoor a convergence between political desire and military action, Khandare lauded affordable, modern innovation in the country's warfare during the May Indo-Pak conflict.""We can adopt high-tech solutions where common sense is added.India fought a high-tech war during Operation Sindoor. Many people are unhappy with us and imposing tariffs,"" he said, in an indirect reference to US President Donald Trump's tariff on India.Referring to doubts cast by Pakistan over India's success during Operation Sindoor, Khandare said, ""We are not worried by their accusations, but feel pain when ‘champions' from our country raise suspicions.""Speaking on the occasion, former DRDO scientist Pralhada Ramarao said India must advance in modern warfare tactics, and steps to achieve it are being taken.""The development of modern warfare will also be beneficial for our industrial and economic growth.

Poll Do you think India's strong domestic consumption can mitigate the effects of global tariffs? Yes, definitely No, it won't help

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday downplayed the impact of US President Donald Trump's decision to impose a 50 per cent tariff on India, asserting that India’s economy would be ""least affected"" by tariffs despite global pressures.Addressing a press briefing, BJP national spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam said India was “going to be the least affected by tariffs” due to its strong domestic consumption base.“A lot of people are talking about tariffs these days... I want to tell you in brief that India is such a country that is going to be the least affected by tariffs. What is the reason for that? Today, there is a 57-58% contribution of local consumption to our GDP... Whatever impact there is in our economy, the pace at which it is moving, it is not going to decrease; rather it will grow faster. That is why when the rating agency saw that there is one such positive thing in India that 20% of the world's population lives in India, there is local consumption and this is not an export driven economy, India will comfortably bear this problem too,” Islam said.He further noted that India’s economic performance stood in sharp contrast to Western nations.“Looking at the global scenario today, inflation in America and the UK is higher than ours. Today, the whole world is grappling with inflation, while here, inflation is under control. The Congress often discusses Food Inflation; I want to tell them that today, food inflation in the country is -1.6%. This means the prices of food and drink items have decreased,” he said.The BJP spokesperson also credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic policies for strengthening India’s global position.“At a time, when the world is grappling with economic turbulence and pricing challenges, international rating agencies hold a positive outlook on India’s economy. This transformation has been made possible by the government’s policy measures and reforms. I thank the people of our nation for choosing a stable and strong government three times in a row... The kind of policies that Prime Minister Modi has adopted since 2014, I can proudly say today that the country's economy has not only become stronger but is also racing forward rapidly. From all institutions and economists around the world, only positive signals are coming regarding India's economy,” Islam said.",The bharatiya janata party (bjp) downplayed the impact of us president donald trump's decision to impose a 50 per cent tariff on india.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday called for a mass campaign to highlight that Jawaharlal Nehru , India's first PM, had compromised the interests of the country and its farmers to make big concessions to Pakistan over Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), without taking either his Cabinet or Parliament into confidence, only to ""burnish his image"".At the NDA parliamentary party meeting for the felicitation of the alliance's VP candidate, CP Radhakrishnan, the PM told MPs to awaken the masses about the ""betrayal"" of India's interests by Nehru and how his govt had kept the treaty in abeyance.Modi, according to sources, said that India's first PM had allowed over 80% of the river's waters to be used by Pakistan, betraying the interests of Indian farmers, and it was only later that he admitted his mistake in agreeing to terms that brought no benefit to India.""Nehru partitioned the country once, and then again. Under Indus Waters Treaty, 80% of the water was given to Pakistan. Later, through his secretary, Nehru admitted his mistake, saying that it brought no benefit,"" sources quoted PM as saying at the NDA meeting.This was in contrast to Nehru's earlier defence of IWT, when he had responded to the criticism of the treaty in a parliamentary debate by, among others, BJP veteran Atal Behari Vajpayee, by saying that so much hue and cry was being raised over a few ""buckets"" of water"", Modi said, recalling that it was on a par with how the first PM laughed off the annexation of Aksai Chin by China with his remark that ""not a blade of grass grows there"".Nehru later admitted to his colleague that he had believed Indus Waters Treaty would help resolve other issues with Pakistan, but that did not happen, Modi is said to have noted at the meeting.On Aug 14, India rejected the recent award issued by the Hague-based Court of Arbitration under IWT, citing the court's lack of jurisdiction, legitimacy, and competence.Following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, in which 26 people were killed, India had, in an exercise of its rights as a sovereign nation under international law, placed IWT in abeyance until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.IWT was signed in 1960, following nine years of negotiations between India and Pakistan, with assistance of World Bank, which was also a signatory. The treaty allocated the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan and the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej) to India.","Pm narendra modi called for a mass campaign to highlight that jawaharlal nehru had compromised the interests of the country and its farmers.

NEW DELHI: The recent Sino-Indian detente seemed set for a significant step forward with PM Narendra Modi saying Tuesday that bilateral ties have made ""positive and steady"" progress guided by respect for each other's interests and sensitivities, and accepting President Xi Jinping's official invitation to visit China for the SCO summit.The invitation along with a message from Xi was delivered to Modi by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who called on the PM after his meeting with NSA Ajit Doval for the Special Representatives' talks on the boundary question. Recalling his meeting with Xi in Kazan in Oct, which opened the doors for normalisation of the relationship after an intense military standoff, Modi said he was looking forward to meeting the Chinese president on the margins of Eurasian bl-oc summit in Tianjin on Sept 1.""Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,"" said Modi in a post on X after the meeting with Wang.According to an Indian readout, Modi also emphasised the importance of maintaining peace on the border, and reiterated India's commitment to a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary question.This was underlined by Doval in his meeting with Wang in which they discussed issues related to de-escalation, delimitation and boundary affairs. Wang also shared with the PM his positive assessment about his meetings with both Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar, saying there was ""new consensus"" on border management, maintenance of peace and on starting boundary delimitation talks. .Doval and Jaishankar strongly raised the need to fight terrorism in all its forms, underscoring that it was one of the original objectives of SCO. According to MEA, Wang, who will visit Pakistan this week, concurred that countering terrorism should be given highest priority.""The PM welcomed the steady and positive progress in bilateral ties since his meeting with President Xi in Kazan last year, guided by mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity, including the resumption of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra,"" said the Indian govt, adding Modi thanked Xi for the invitation and expressed support for China's presidency of the SCO Summit.Modi will arrive in Tianjin on Aug 31 for what will be his first visit to China in over seven years. He had last visited China in 2018, again for the SCO summit. SCO has been an important forum for India to assert its strategic autonomy but his visit on this occasion has evoked more than just a cursory interest, as it comes in the middle of what many see as the worst phase in India's ties with the US in decades.While the Trump administration seems to have made peace with Moscow, it continues to target India for its energy imports from Russia, accusing the Indian govt of funding Vladimir Putin's war. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused India of ""now cozying up"" to both China and Russia, as he made his point about the risks involved in transferring cutting-edge US military technology to India.In his meeting with Wang, Doval hailed new energy and momentum in ties, saying with tranquillity in border areas, there had been more substantive engagement. Wang too said this year, the border situation had remained stable and was improving.","Pm narendra modi says bilateral ties have made ""positive and steady"" progress.

EAM raises with Wang trade curbs, dam on Brahmaputra

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar's meeting with counterpart Wang Yi saw efforts by both sides to address each other's concerns and interests, with Beijing agreeing to remove curbs on export of fertilisers, rare earth minerals and tunnel boring machines to cater to India's needs. Indian authorities said these were three key concerns raised in the meeting.Both sides also agreed to re-opening border trade through designated trading points, namely Lipulekh, Shipki La and Nathu La.Wang brought up Taiwan and Jaishankar stressed there had been no change in India's position. Like most other countries, India follows a One-China policy. However, as external affairs ministry said, India emphasised that like the rest of the world it has a relationship with Taiwan focused on economic, technology and cultural ties, and this would continue.The Indian side noted that China also cooperates with Taiwan in these very domains,"" the ministry said.India was among the first non-socialist countries to recognise People's Republic of China in 1950. While it never abandoned its One China policy, India stopped publicly articulating the same 15 years ago amid growing differences with Beijing on issues related to J&K and Arunachal Pradesh. Like most other countries, India doesn't have formal diplomatic or political ties with Taiwan.Jaishankar also underlined India's concerns with regard to the mega dam construction being undertaken by China in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra), which will have implications for lower riparian states, said MEA.In the meeting on Monday, Jaishankar for the second time this year raised issues related to trade restrictions imposed by China. He had flagged it last month in a meeting with Wang on the margins of the SCO foreign ministers' meeting.China announced in April its decision to implement export controls on certain rare earth items. According to MEA, govt remained in touch with the Chinese side, in Beijing as well as in Delhi, to bring ""predictability in supply chain for trade consistent with international practices"". India's rare earth magnet import dependency on China has hovered at 80%-85% in the past three years. India has set up National Critical Mineral Mission to increase domestic capacity and build supply chain resilience in critical minerals.India had earlier also taken up with China the issue of restricted fertiliser supplies. Indian companies had in fact signed long-term agreements with their Saudi counterparts last month for continued supplies of DAP, the fertiliser most used in India after urea. China is one of the countries India has been dependent on for DAP supplies.A foreign ministry spokesperson in Beijing did not confirm if China was going to review export licences or if it was making an exemption for India but said China stood ready to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with relevant countries and jointly keep global industrial and supply chains stable.In his meeting with Jaishankar, Wang had said ""in today's world, the changing situation is evolving rapidly, unilateral bullying practices are rampant, and free trade and the international order face severe challenges"". Jaishankar too had underlined the imperative of working towards ensuring a stable global economy.","Beijing agrees to remove curbs on export of fertilisers, rare earth minerals and tunnel boring machines.

With the order for another 97 jets, HAL will be able to expand and stabilize its supply chains,” a source said.Faced with flak from IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh for the huge delays in deliveries, HAL has promised to progressively scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24-30 per year, with the third production line now fully functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru, apart from private sector supply chains.The project for the six AEW&C aircraft, which will entail mounting active electronically scanned array antenna-based radars, electronic and signal intelligence systems on second-hand Airbus-321 planes bought earlier from Air India, in turn, will cost Rs 19,000 crore. “All six AEW&C aircraft will be delivered by 2033-34,” the source said.The timely induction of the 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters is needed to stem the rapid depletion in the number of IAF fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets), which will go down to its lowest-ever figure of 29 squadrons next month after retirement of the 36 old MiG-21s still in service.The IAF, incidentally, is authorized 42.5 combat squadrons. Pakistan now has 25 fighter squadrons, and is slated to get at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation stealth jets from China in the near future.China, of course, has more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India. In the AEW&C arena, which are required to boost surveillance capabilities along the borders as well as help direct friendly fighters during air combat with enemy jets, India lags far behind even Pakistan.The IAF currently has just three Netra AEW&C Mark-1 planes, with indigenous sensors mounted on Brazilian Embraer-145 jets for 240-degree radar coverage, and three Israeli `Phalcon’ radars mounted on Russian IL-76 aircraft.The new AEW&C project will involve the A-321 narrow-body aircraft first being “hardened and modified” in Spain and then being equipped with an antenna in the nose in addition to the main dorsal antenna to give 300-degree radar coverage. “The project, which was finalized earlier, has seen a cost escalation of around Rs 7,000 crore since a lot of modifications are required on the A-321s,” the source said.To make up numbers, the defence ministry in March also accorded the initial “acceptance of necessity” to a separate project for six Netra Mark-1A on Emb-145 jets, with more advanced technologies than the first three Mark-1 aircraft.On the Tejas front, IAF till now has got only 38 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010.The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-404 engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, as well as weapons and radar integration issues are the main reasons for the delay in the Tejas Mark-1A fighters.","The pm-led cabinet committee on security (ccs) approved the around rs 66,500 crore deal for the 97 “improved” tejas mark-1a fighters.

Yes, absolutely! No, it will take time.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday met Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla , pilot of the Axiom-4 Space Mission to the International Space Station (ISS), at his Lok Kalyan Marg residence. PM Modi welcomed Shukla with a warm hug and walked alongside him with his arm on the astronaut’s shoulder, highlighting the significance of the moment.During the meeting, Shukla presented the Axiom-4 mission patch to the Prime Minister and shared photographs of the Earth taken from the ISS. Shukla, who returned to India early Sunday, had received a rousing welcome at the Delhi airport.After the meeting, PM Modi took to X and posted, “Had a great interaction with Shubhanshu Shukla. We discussed a wide range of subjects including his experiences in space, progress in science & technology as well as India’s ambitious Gaganyaan mission. India is proud of his feat.”Earlier in the day, Shukla was honoured in the Lok Sabha during a special discussion celebrating his milestone mission.Shukla completed an 18-day Axiom-4 mission on July 15, conducting over 60 experiments with three other crew members aboard the ISS—a key step towards India’s human spaceflight ambitions under the Gaganyaan programme.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said the special discussion in the House was aimed at celebrating Shukla’s achievements and India’s growing space capabilities.“Our hero astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla has returned home after a successful mission to the ISS. Parliament will honour him with a special discussion on his historic milestone and India’s journey towards Viksit Bharat,” Rijiju posted on X. He urged Opposition MPs to participate in the debate in the same spirit as they had during Operation Sindoor, though they chose to boycott, causing repeated disruptions.Breaking ranks, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor praised Shukla on social media. “Since the Opposition are not participating in the special discussion, let me say how proud all Indians are of the recent mission of Commander Shubhanshu Shukla to the ISS. It served as a stepping stone to our nation’s human spaceflight program, Gaganyaan,” Tharoor wrote.PM Modi had earlier lauded Shukla in his Independence Day address, reiterating India’s plan to build its own space station. ISRO Chairman V Narayanan said the first module is expected to be placed in orbit by 2028, with the station fully operational by 2035.Union MoS for science and technology Jitendra Singh criticised Opposition MPs for not acknowledging the achievement. “Your anger can be with the government and the BJP, but it is surprising you can be angry with an astronaut. He is not linked to any political party. You are angry with the earth, you are angry with the sky and today you seem to be angry with space as well,” Singh said.Shukla’s journey included nearly a year of intensive training in the US before being selected for the Axiom-4 mission. On his return, he expressed gratitude to the nation and said he would share his experiences with students and scientists across India. He is also set to attend National Space Day events later this month.","Pm narendra modi met astronaut shubhanshu shukla at his residence.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar sought a candid and constructive approach to bilateral ties, as India and China seek to move ahead after a difficult period in the relationship, in a meeting with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Going into the meeting with Wang, their first on Indian soil in over 3 years, the minister also said that the basis for any positive momentum in ties remains the ability to jointly maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas.“It is also essential that the de-escalation process move forward,” he said, underscoring India’s position on the border issue as PM Narendra Modi prepares to visit China next week amid strong signs of a rapprochement in the relationship.Jaishankar touched upon India’s concerns about Chinese trade restrictions, cross-border terrorism and underlined the imperative in the current circumstances of maintaining and enhancing stability in the global economy, alluding in his opening remarks to worldwide unrest over continued conflicts and the US tariff rollout.Wang in his remarks spoke against “unilateral bullying"" and the threat to free trade and international order.A Chinese readout also quoted Jaishankar as saying Taiwan is a part of China, signalling India’s continued support for One-China policy even though it has stopped articulating it in bilateral documents with Beijing.“When the world’s two largest nations meet, it is natural that the international situation will be discussed. We seek a fair, balanced and multi-polar world order, including a multi-polar Asia. Reformed multilateralism is also the call of the day,” said Jaishankar, expressing hope that the talks would contribute to building a stable, cooperative and forward-looking relationship and one that served both countries’ interests and concerns.“The fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is another major priority,” he told Wang.Wang, who spoke about the need to maintain the momentum in the relationship, will hold the 24th round of Special Representatives’ talks on the boundary question with NSA Ajit Doval on Tuesday.

He had also discussed Pakistan’s backing of cross-border terrorism.Wang is visiting India just before the SCO summit that China will host on September 1. Modi is expected to have bilateral meetings with both President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the margins. This will be the first visit by Modi to China in over 7 years. The visit follows the detente in ties after both sides completed the disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh and agreed to take further steps for de-escalation. Following that disengagement agreement, Modi and Xi met on the margins of the BRICS summit in Kazan in October 2024 and agreed to work towards normalising the relationship.According to the Chinese statement on the meeting, Wang stressed that China is willing to uphold the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, and a shared future, and work with neighbouring countries, including India, to jointly build a ""five-home"" of peace, tranquility, prosperity, beauty and friendship. “China and India should strengthen their confidence, meet each other halfway, eliminate interference, expand cooperation, and consolidate the momentum of improvement in China-India relations,” it said.",External affairs minister s jaishankar sought a candid and constructive approach to bilateral ties with chinese counterpart wang yi.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Benin’s coastline, once part of the historic “Slave Coast,” was a major hub in the transatlantic slave trade. From 1580 to 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah, located along today’s Benin coast, exported over a million enslaved Africans to the Americas, including the U.S., the Caribbean, and Brazil.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony. Both Ciara and Russell Wilson know just how to keep the love alive.The power couple, Russell Wilson and Ciara has been married for nearly a decade now, but they have some rules and traditions that keep their relationship going strong.","Russell wilson's wife and grammy-winning singer ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from benin.

From Toronto’s Royal York to a French château: NHL stars’ fairytale weddings

Los Angeles Kings forward Warren Foegele and his longtime partner Alexandra Servos have officially marked 2025 as their summer of love. Earlier in July, the couple said “I do” in a romantic ceremony at the Fairmont Royal York Hotel in Toronto, surrounded by glowing candles, flowers, and friends. Just weeks later, the pair were guests at Leon Draisaitl and Celeste Desjardins ’ fairytale château wedding in France — a celebration that brought together a who’s who of NHL stars. From Alexandra’s lace gown to the league’s star couples cheering them on, both weddings created moments that fans and friends are still swooning over.When Warren and Alexandra exchanged vows at the Fairmont Royal York in Toronto, the historic ballroom was transformed into a glowing backdrop of candles and floral arrangements. Alexandra walked down the aisle in a lace gown with a dramatic veil, before joining Warren at the altar where the two shared their first kiss as husband and wife.On Instagram, Alexandra posted a carousel of photos with the caption “At last.” The images showed the bride’s walk down the aisle, portraits in the hotel’s wood-paneled rooms, and the couple leaving the ceremony hand in hand.The reaction from fellow NHL families was immediate and emotional.Celeste Desjardins, wife of Foegele’s former teammate Leon Draisaitl, commented: “Crying all over again,” later adding, “The most beautiful bride everpppp.” Alannah Hyman, wife of Zach Hyman, shared her excitement with: “Ahhhh” followed by heart-eyes emojis. And Ines Kopitar, wife of Kings captain Anze Kopitar, described it all as simply: “A dream” with a red heart emoji.Only weeks after celebrating their own wedding, Warren and Alexandra traveled to France to attend Leon Draisaitl and Celeste Desjardins’ destination wedding. Alexandra documented the trip on Instagram Stories, sharing a group table photo with Madison Brown, Mara Teigen, and others, as well as a short clip of Warren in a black suit and sunglasses crossing the château lawn.The star-studded guest list read like an Edmonton Oilers reunion. Evander Kane , Connor Brown, Tyson Barrie, Zach Hyman, Calvin Pickard, Cody Ceci , and Tyler Ennis all attended with their partners. Emma Barrie, wife of Tyson, posted multiple snapshots — from her own black evening gown to a group portrait featuring the Barries, the Hymans, and the Pickards.

Their ceremony at the Fairmont Royal York glowed with intimacy and emotion, while their time in France highlighted the bonds shared among players and their families.As Alexandra summed it up with her caption “At last” the moment was long awaited.

Pormanove’s death sparks wider debate on unsafe streaming culture

French streamer and YouTuber Jean Pormanove, real name Raphaël Graven, has tragically died at the age of 46. Known for his daring IRL broadcasts and marathon livestreams, Pormanove’s sudden passing has shaken France’s online community. His death on August 18, 2025, in Contes has sparked both grief and outrage, with fans questioning the extreme culture of streaming that surrounded him.Often called “JP” by fans, Pormanove was best known for his intense in-real-life (IRL) content. From sleep deprivation challenges to marathon streams, his broadcasts often blurred the line between entertainment and endurance.In the days leading up to his death, he participated in a Kick marathon described as “10 days and nights of torture,” where toxic substances, physical dares, and relentless pressure became part of the show.On the morning of August 18, police discovered him unconscious at his home in Contes. He was pronounced dead shortly after.Fellow French content creator Owen Cenazandotti, better known online as “Naruto,” broke the news with an emotional Instagram Story.He referred to Pormanove as his “brother” and “partner of six years,” while asking fans not to circulate distressing footage from his final hours.Naruto’s statement highlighted both the personal loss and the wider community’s grief, as many called Pormanove a pioneer of French IRL streaming.Despite pleas for respect, videos from Pormanove’s last Kick streams, showing moments of humiliation, exhaustion, and violence, have spread across X and Reddit.Pormanove’s death has triggered bigger questions about streaming’s “extreme content” meta. Reddit threads and X discussions quickly filled with debates, many pointing fingers at platforms like Kick for failing to protect creators.The tragedy has fueled anger toward streaming platforms, especially Kick, for allowing such extreme content. Reddit users argued that “toxic grind culture” and “subathon pressure” have created a dangerous environment where creators risk their health for subscribers and donations.Others suggested that Pormanove’s case could become a breaking point, forcing platforms to finally address moderation and creator safety.Beyond the personal tragedy, Pormanove’s passing has ignited a larger conversation. Should streaming platforms be held accountable for content that crosses into dangerous territory? How far is too far when it comes to livestream entertainment?

Connor McDavid’s new contract could reset expectations



Why Connor McDavid’s contract could shape Auston Matthews’ next deal



The NHL’s contract market is once again buzzing, and this time the focus is on Connor McDavid. A recent update from insider John Shannon suggests that the Edmonton Oilers captain’s next deal could be shorter and cheaper than many fans expected. While Oilers fans may be relieved, the news has rippling effects for Toronto, where Auston Matthews’ long-term future remains a delicate balance between health, performance, and financial strategy.Connor McDavid’s contract situation has dominated headlines for months, and while most assumed he would eventually sign a long-term extension in Edmonton, Shannon’s latest comments hint at a surprising shift. “I think it’s a…three or four year deal; I think Connor’s gonna come in lower than a lot of people are expecting; short term,” Shannon noted.This projection diverges from the expected eight-year mega-deal, fueling speculation that McDavid could prefer flexibility in his next chapter. There’s even chatter about a two-year option, which would keep his earnings high while allowing him to revisit the market when the salary cap continues to rise. For Edmonton, this provides security in the short run, but it also ensures McDavid retains leverage over his future.The bigger question, however, is what this means for Toronto.Auston Matthews, who is already the face of the Toronto Maple Leafs franchise, carries a $13.25 million cap hit under his current contract. While locked in for now, Toronto knows his future payday could dwarf McDavid’s, especially as the NHL salary cap is projected to rise significantly in the coming years. If McDavid is in the $16–$17 million range, many expect Matthews to command $20 million annually once his deal is up.But money isn’t the only factor. Toronto must weigh Matthews’ durability. There are lingering concerns about his health heading into the season, raising questions about whether the Leafs will get the full “Auston Matthews experience” when it matters most. Playoff performance, too, looms over his legacy. Despite an impressive 727 points in 629 games, his postseason struggles remain a sticking point for critics.For now, one thing is clear: Connor McDavid’s decision to prioritize short-term security over a long-term extension will likely reset the market. And when Auston Matthews’ contract comes due, Toronto may have no choice but to follow a similar playbook—big money, shorter years, and plenty of pressure to deliver when it counts.Also Read: Maple Leafs fans on edge as Auston Matthews’ health questions emerge before opener without Mitch Marner",Auston matthews’ toronto maple leafs future thrown into spotlight after latest mcdavid contract update stirs debate.
