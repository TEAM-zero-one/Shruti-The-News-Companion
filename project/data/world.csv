AHMEDABAD: A wave of despair spread across many parts of Gujarat as 33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in Ahmedabad early Thursday from Amritsar after they were deported from US. Faces covered by masks, without any luggage and a few with backpacks, they were taken to Gujarat Police vehicles stationed at the airport and whisked away to their homes.Having paid Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore to chase their 'US dreams', all they were left with were shattered dreams and mounting debts.All of them were deported under the 'catch and release' policy of Trump administration and were part of a larger group of 104 Indians who were sent back from the US this week.""My sister was handcuffed during the deportation. She hasn't talked much with us. She had gone to US on a tourist visa . We have no idea why she was deported,"" said Varun, brother of 29-year-old Khushbu Patel of Luna village in Vadodara. Many deportees, including Khushbu, chose to go incommunicado to avoid the intense social scrutiny.Of the 33 deportees, 18 were caught just as Trump took oath as the US president. They stepped on US soil on Jan 19 and 20 and walked straight into the hands of American authorities, sources said.All 18 are from north Gujarat, a region known as a hub for human smuggling operations . ""They were smuggled into US through Mexico border,"" said a source connected with human smuggling network. ""The smugglers pushed them to enter US way before Trump took the oath, fearing stricter immigration policies. But for some reason, they could not cross over in time. They were caught and marked for deportation almost immediately,"" the source added.Sources said the remaining 15 Gujaratis had been in US for periods ranging from one month to four years. They did not get permission to stay even though they sought asylum, citing political persecution. Some deportees like Jignesh Zala, a native of Gandhinagar, said illegal immigration was a traumatic experience that should never be attempted. He had crossed into US with his wife and 11-year-old twin daughters four months ago. ""We went from Delhi to Paris to Madrid to Salvador before reaching Mexico and crossing the border. We were sent back with hands and legs in cuffs. It was a traumatic experience for our entire family,"" Zala said on Thursday.","33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in ahmedabad early thursday from amritsar.

Has WWE released superstars as this week's SmackDown went on air?

Also read:

There has been a report of WWE releasing multiple superstars, some of them who were upcoming on the main roster show while others who had been kept off television for too long.WWE is the ultimate destination for many aspirants who wish to make a career in the professional wrestling world. However, making it to the company and staying in it are two different things.Over the years, the fans have seen many superstars fail to make an impact on the audience and in turn, lose their place in WWE.Moreover, at times, some talents are left unutilized on the main roster despite their impactful tenure in WWE’s developmental territory, NXT. The last round of WWE releases happened back in December 2024 and it seems some more names have been added to that list in recent memory.According to reports by Fightful Select and PWInsider, WWE has released a batch of superstars, with some names coming as a shock. The first name on the list was Sonya Deville. She was the first openly gay WWE superstar and had been in the company for almost a decade.Deville was regarded for her partnership with former WWE superstar Mandy Rose. Moreover, she recently took charge of Pure Fusion Collective alongside Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark. According to the report, Deville’s contract was approaching its end, and WWE decided not to renew it.The next names were WWE Hall of Famer Paul Ellering and The Authors of Pain. The trio had a good tenure in WWE back in NXT and a brief stint on the main roster. They came back to WWE in 2023 and were aligned with Karrion Kross to form ‘The Final Testament.’ With their release, it seems that Kross would now be going alone as a solo competitor.The final releases that happened in WWE recently were Cedric Alexander and Blair Davenport . Cedric was struggling to make a name for himself for years. The only time he was involved in major storylines was during his time as part of The Hurt Business. On the other hand, Davenport was not utilized much on SmackDown after being called up to the main roster last year. Moreover, the report stated that WWE had creative plans for either of them.In a follow-up report to their release by Fightful Select, the call for the releases was made right as the February 7th edition of SmackDown went live. With a wave of WWE releases hitting the roster, it remains to be seen if there could be more names let go from the company.","Has wwe released superstars as this week's smackdown went on air?

""I think, you know, no matter who the president is, I know I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there, you know, it's the best country in the world. So, that'd be pretty cool.” Kelce's neutral comments were met with resentment from Swifties due to Trump's escalating feud with the singer, which escalated last year. The president wrote, ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT"" on Truth Social.Taylor Swift's fan base, Swifties, expressed disappointment and anger over Kelce's comments, with some calling for Swift to end her relationship with him. ""@eagles all the way on Sunday. Even more love for them now that orange lunatic will be there. Travis Kelce is an orange lover. No respect left for him. How can Swift stay with him? Every Trump lover is a maggot in my books,"" fan wrote.Another added, ""Disappointed bc in 2018 The Eagles didn't make their players go and because so many declined, Trump then uninvited the team. Considering Kelce has spoken about social justice as a white man, this is disappointing."" ""Friendly reminder that Taylor Swift said 'f**k that, I don't care' when Trump said he'd come after her. I'm sorry, but Travis Kelce could have said the same thing,"" a third noted.Donald Trump and Taylor Swift have been bickering back and forth over the years: Swift publicly endorses Democratic candidates in 2018, followed by Trump lambasting her at the time; last year saw Trump attack her amid rumors over her potential clout in 2024.Also Read: Taylor Swift bringing Swifties into the NFL, as the league reports that women constitute nearly half of the audience Swift, who followed Kelce to the home games of his team, the Chiefs, during the 2024-25 NFL season, will likely attend the final Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans as the Chiefs seek to make history by winning a record third game in a row against the Philadelphia Eagles.

After Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) made headlines for recommending shutting down of USAID, DOGE became the headlines when its 25-year-old staff, Marko Elez resigned following the unearthing of his past social media posts in which he called himself a racist. Those posts were not made in his name, but a pseudonym account which was suspended in December last year when Elez started to work for DOGE.This snowballed into a major controversy as little was known about DOGE so far but now that they started visiting federal agencies, bureaucrats claimed that they are mostly youngsters with questionable background and no eligibility to question federal workers. They are all ""tech kids"" who dropped out of college.Wall Street Journal reported that Marko Elez made several problematic posts in the past like: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.”; “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity. Normalize Indian hate"" etc. Controversy over his past posts made him to resign, the Wall Street Journal said.Elon Musk ran a poll on X whether DOGE should rehire him and as the majority voters were in favor of Marko Elez, Musk said he would rehire him. But Musl admitted that Elez made some mistakes. ""To err is human,"" Musk wrote.Vice president JD Vance offered his opinion on Elon Musk's poll on Marko Elez and said he does not agree with what Elez wrote in past but he also believes that past social media activities should not ruin his life. Democrat Congressman Ro Khanna asked him whether he would seek an apology for the anti-India statement. ""Just asking for the sake of both of our kids,"" Ro Khanna wrote as their kids have Indian connection -- Ro Khanna is an Indian-American and JD Vance's wife Usha Vance has Indian origin.The 'children' part seemingly irked JD Vance and he took it as an emotional blackmail. ""I cannot overstate how much I loathe this emotional blackmail pretending to be concern. My kids, god willing, will be risk takers. They won't think constantly about whether a flippant comment or a wrong viewpoint will follow them around for the rest of their lives. They will tell stupid jokes. They will develop views that they later think are wrong or even gross. I made mistakes as a kid, and thank God I grew up in a culture that encouraged me to grow and learn and feel remorse when I screwed up and offer grace when others did,"" Vance wrote.Ro Khanna replied that he was only doing an exchange of ideas.Amid all this, journalist Katherine Long who wrote the Wall Street Journal piece on Marko Elez drew the ire of Elon Musk who called her disgusting.

Trump did not like Harry and Meghan's exit from the royal family as Trump's allegiance lies with the late Queen who Trump said liked him.In an interview with the New York Post, Donald Trump said he would not pursue the case against Prince Harry.“I don’t want to do that,” he said. “I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.”After stepping down from their royal duties, Harry and Meghan relocated to Los Angeles in 2020. After the release of Harry's memoir 'Spare' released where he admitted to having taken drugs like cocaine, cannabis and psychedelics in the past, questions were raised as to whether he mentioned this in his visa application or if he lied in his visa application because he should have been disqualified from getting a US visa.Heritage Foundation sued the Department of Homeland Security forcing to release Prince Harry's visa records. Harry won the case as the judge ruled that his visa records won't be released but it was apprehended that Donald Trump would pursue the case.Meghan Markle does not like President Trump and the feeling is mutual as Trump also, in pas, spoke negatively about Meghan. In 2022, Trump said he thinks Harry is ""whipped"". ""I'm not a fan of Meghan, I'm not a fan, and I wasn't right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose,"" Trump said at that time.Rumors were rife that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would end their marriage though later it was said that they would choose professional separation instead implying that they would concentrate on their individual work and make rare joint appearances though the California wildfires saw them together visiting relief centers.",Donald trump said he won't deport prince harry as he believed harry already has a lot of problems because of meghan markle.

Did Ro Khanna blackmail JD Vance?



President Donald Trump was asked about the controversial exit of Marko Elez from Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency over his past social media posts in one of which he called himself 'racist' and also called for normalizing India hate. Trump said he was not aware of it but if Vice President JD Vance is in favor of rehiring the person, he is with the VP.""Well I don't know about that particular thing but if the Vice President said so..did you say that?

WSJ reported that Elez made some problematic posts on social media through a pseudonym account which was closed in December probably when he started to work for DOGE but many of those White supremacist posts were archived. WSJ said when they contacted White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt for a comment on Elez's past posts, Leavitt said Elez resigned from DOGE.His past posts included: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.”; “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity. Normalize Indian hate"" etc.Elon Musk ran a poll on X on whether to rehire him and the maximum votes were in favor of rehiring him. Even JD Vance said Elez should not be victimized for his past social media activities which became another major controversy -- as Vance is married to Indian-origin Usha Vance and he did not call out the India hate.JD Vance said he ""obviously"" disagrees with some of Elez's posts but he also thinks that past social media activity should not ruin Elez's life. Indian-origin Democrat leader Ro Khanna took offence to Vance's stand and asked him whether Vance would seek an apology from Elez for his ""normalize Indian hate"" statement. ""Just asking for the sake of both of our kids,"" Ro Khanna wrote.""For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,"" JD Vance said. ""Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don't threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages congressmen to act like whiny children.""JD Vance called Ro Khanna's statement emotional blackmail. ""I don't worry about my kids making mistakes, or developing views they later regret. I don't even worry that much about trolls on the internet. You know what I do worry about, Ro?

""Christ is King, not some stinky Indian idol.""

""Will there be a cow in the White House soon?""

The Takeaway: Who Gets to Be Forgiven?

Is there any true place for them in MAGA?

Are they only valued as token figures when convenient?

Would their loyalty ever be reciprocated?

The phrase “Normalize Indian Hate” was posted by Marko Elez, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee whose racist social media history resurfaced last week. The revelation sparked a massive backlash, leading to Elez’s resignation. However, Elon Musk, with backing from Vice President JD Vance , reinstated Elez after a public poll on X.Vance’s defense of Elez—despite the blatant racism—has ignited outrage, particularly among Indian-Americans. Critics point to the hypocrisy in how Elez is treated compared to Vivek Ramaswamy , the Indian-American MAGA figure who was pushed out of DOGE without fanfare or second chances.This controversy highlights a deeper, uncomfortable truth. While MAGA claims to be an inclusive, meritocratic movement, it still harbors deep-seated biases against Indian-Americans—whether they are outsiders criticizing the right or insiders trying to fit in.Vance took to X (formerly Twitter) to dismiss concerns over Elez’s racist statements. Instead of addressing why he supported the return of someone who publicly advocated hate against Indians , he attacked critics for engaging in “emotional blackmail.”""For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,"" Vance wrote. ""Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don’t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages Congressmen to act like whiny children.""Vance framed the backlash as part of a cancel culture overreach, ignoring the fact that Elez’s post explicitly targeted Indian-Americans—a group that includes his own wife and children.His dismissive stance infuriated social media users, who called him out for failing to defend his own family.Congressman Ro Khanna responded, saying, ""Are you going to tell him to apologize for saying ‘Normalize Indian hate’ before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids.""Journalist Wajahat Ali added, ""Your wife is Indian American. Your kids are Indian American. Elez said he wants to ‘normalize Indian hate.’ Have some pride, man. Have some dignity. For your family's sake, you pathetic Reek.""Another user, Divya, criticized Vance’s privilege, stating, ""Easy for JD Vance to say this when his kids are covered by 24/7 security. What about regular Indian kids who have been rendered vulnerable because of the normalization of online hatred against Indians?""A well-known activist account, ind_us_immigrnt, pointed out the hypocrisy: ""Say ‘Normalize hate against White people’ and see how the MAGA clowns react.""While Elon Musk and JD Vance rallied to defend Elez, Vivek Ramaswamy—once considered MAGA’s rising star—was swiftly removed from his role in DOGE. Elez gets a poll, a second chance, and full public backing. Ramaswamy gets silence and a quiet exit.This double standard has infuriated Indian-American conservatives, many of whom now feel betrayed by a movement they once supported. The key question remains: Why is a white staffer, who openly promoted racism, given a second chance while an Indian-American leader is pushed aside?Harshil, an Indian-American commentator, pointed out, ""While Vivek Ramaswamy was deselected for DOGE, Elez has the backing of Vance for saying ‘Normalize Indian Hate.’ Indian-Americans, this is straight to your face. No matter how much you succeed, you will always be a second-class citizen.""Musk defended Elez’s return by citing forgiveness, conducting a poll on X in which 78 percent of users voted to reinstate him.Shortly after the results, Musk tweeted, ""He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.""Trump also chimed in, telling reporters, ""I’m with the Vice President.""However, this narrative of forgiveness crumbles when contrasted with MAGA’s past actions.The flippancy of how this issue was handled was best captured by David Sacks, who mocked the situation with this exchange:""Sir, the Pentagon has failed another audit.""""Send in Big Balls.""This level of casual arrogance over racism against Indian-Americans reinforces a harsh truth. Certain groups will always be prioritized within MAGA, while others remain expendable.The ‘Pagan Problem’: MAGA’s Uneasy Relationship With Indian-AmericansIndian-Americans like Usha Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy , and Sriram Krishnan have been prominent in MAGA’s political and business circles. Yet, their presence is often met with hostility from MAGA’s nativist and evangelical factions.An e arlier TOI report captured this underlying racism , highlighting online attacks against Usha Vance.Despite these overt attacks, MAGA leaders—including JD Vance himself—have largely ignored or downplayed the bigotry coming from within their own base. The underlying message is clear. Indian-Americans may be allowed in MAGA circles, but they will never be truly embraced.This controversy exposes the inherent contradictions within MAGA’s stance on race, meritocracy, and inclusion. If you are a white conservative who posts racist remarks, you get a poll, a second chance, and the full backing of Trump, Vance, and Musk. If you are an Indian-American conservative, you are disposable. The fallout from Marko Elez’s reinstatement and JD Vance’s dismissive response has left many Indian-Americans wondering:For now, Vance, Musk, and Trump have made their priorities clear. And for Indian-Americans watching from the sidelines, the lesson is stark. MAGA’s loyalty is conditional. And it does not extend to you.","Vice president-elect j.d.

End of USAID



In 2018, then-First Lady Melania Trump on her first major solo international trip showered praises on the United States Agency for International Development as in Africa she handed out school supplies to children as part of her ""BeBest"" initiative in collaboration with USAID. ""It's really touching. I'm glad that I'm here to see in person what the children are going through, and see that they're educating them in the right way,"" Melania had said at that time.As Donald Trump is now gutting USAID, old records of how his wife Melania Trump and daughter Ivanka Trump promoted the agency surfaced.In 2019, Ivanka Travelled to Africa with USAID and met women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia and rural cocoa farmers.Records now reveal that both Melania and Ivanka used thousands of dollars from USAID to fund their pet projects during the first term. USAID helped Melania Trump's Be Best program and Ivanka Trump's Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. And they traveled with the agency on separate trips to Africa where they praised the work USAID was doing.In his first term, Donald Trump cut USAID funding but the agency was invested in his family's government ventures, records reveal. Elon Musk recently announced that USAID will be shut down as it is draining out a huge amount of government money for no good reason. President Trump said he agreed to the reasoning and USAID will be shut down. ""USAID is driving the radical Left crazy, and there is nothing they can do about it because the way in which the money has been spent, so much of it fraudulently, is totally unexplainable. The corruption is at levels rarely seen before. Close it down!"" Trump posted Friday making it clear that he fully endorses Elon Musk's plan of shutting USAID down.Hundreds of USAID contractors were placed on unpaid leave and some were terminated. Its Washington DC office is closed and employees were either put on leave or told to work from home. A judge has now temporarily blocked Trump from placing the workers on leave.","Melania trump, ivanka trump used usaid funds for their pet projects, records reveal.

Prince William once made a ""savage"" joke about his wife, Princess Kate, over an outfit he deemed inappropriate, a royal adviser revealed. Before becoming a senior royal, Kate was still fine-tuning her style, leading to a moment of playful banter between the couple.According to an adviser who spoke to The Times, William was unimpressed with one of Kate’s fashion choices early in their relationship.“Before Kate realized that as a senior royal, you have to dress carefully, having taken advice, she once bought an outfit that William considered inappropriate,” the adviser said.“He told Kate she looked as if she’d just run through a charity shop covered in superglue. Everyone thought this was very funny, including, to her credit, Kate”, the adviser added.While the exact outfit was not revealed, it likely occurred during Kate’s transition from pre-royal life, where she was seen at London parties in bold ensembles, to her more refined royal wardrobe.Kate has since become a global style icon, with her wardrobe choices sparking trends worldwide. Known as the "" Kate Effect ,"" her fashion choices now include elegant designs from Alexander McQueen and Jenny Packham.She has also mastered ""mindful dressing"", carefully selecting outfits to pay tribute to host countries on royal tours, as per the Hello! magazine.Despite her polished image today, Kate’s earlier fashion moments were far more daring.Notably, she is said to have caught William’s eye in 2002, wearing a sheer Charlotte Todd dress at a St Andrews University fashion show. In 2008, she showcased her style in a green sequin halterneck top, neon-yellow hot pants, pink leg warmers and knee-high boots at a charity roller disco, according to Hello! magazine.This lighthearted teasing is nothing new for the couple. Over the years, they have been seen joking together in public, with Kate often playfully teasing William.During a 2018 visit to a UK military base in Cyprus, William warned soldiers: ""Keep the pizza off the sofas!"" to which Kate quipped: ""You're a nightmare with that.""Kate has also teased William about his appearance, reportedly telling him he is beginning to resemble his great-great-great-grandfather, Edward VII, as per the Mirror.Despite her initial learning curve, Kate quickly adapted to royal life. As per The Times, she took time to observe and absorb royal expectations, rather than trying to change things too quickly.""She bides her time and is very intelligent and intuitive about other people, what they do, and how they behave,"" a royal source told the publication.Kate was also guided by William and palace staff, ensuring she avoided the struggles Princess Diana faced.","Prince william once made a 'savage' joke about his wife, princess kate.

The US Senate confirmed Russell Vought on Thursday as the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is involved in a dispute over freezing federal funding for aid programs.Vought was approved by a vote of 53-47 despite opposition from Democrats. Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer called him ""one of the most fringe and hard-right individuals the Senate has seen in a very long time.""The Thursday night vote followed a marathon effort by Democrats to block the nomination, during which they held the Senate floor with speeches for an entire day and night.

4. $20,600 for drag shows in Ecuador

5. $350 million for a pier in Gaza

15) Hundreds of thousands of meals sent to al-Qaeda fighters in Syria

16) Hundreds of millions for Afghan Poppy cultivation

17) $14 million in cash vouchers for migrants at the Southern border

The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing heavy scrutiny after Trump administration crackdown.US President Trump, who has long criticised USAID, signed an executive order pausing foreign assistance for 90 days. “USAID is being run by radical lunatics,” he said, vowing to end what he calls “waste, fraud, and abuse.”Meanwhile, secretary of state Marco Rubio had called USAID a “global charity” that operates with little regard for US national interests. The agency’s Washington headquarters has been temporarily closed and several senior officials have been placed on leave as investigations continue.Recently, house foreign affairs committee chairman Brian Mast and the White House exposed a series of, what they referred to as “wasteful” expenditures under the Biden administration.From funding drag shows in Ecuador to providing cash vouchers for illegal migrants, USAID’s use of taxpayer dollars has raised major concerns about its accountability.Here are some of the spending decisions, that the committee termed as “outrageous”:Yes, you read that right. In the video, Representative Mast claimed that USAID allocated $15 million worth of condoms to the Taliban, an extremist group known for suppressing women's rights. He mocked this expenditure, stating, “I don’t think anybody’s going to die because we don’t give the Taliban any more condoms.”Through the state department, USAID funnelled nearly half a million dollars to promote atheism in Nepal.The US government spent tens of thousands of dollars to fund a transgender-themed opera in Colombia, a move that left many questioning its relevance to American interests.Another eyebrow-raising expenditure, USAID paid for drag performances in Ecuador as part of an LGBTQ cultural initiative. According to the foreign affairs committee, Fundación Diálogo Diverso, an LGBTQ organization in Ecuador, received nearly $75,000 over a period of three years, which includes a $25,000 grant from last year. The organization utilized those funds to host a two-day drag workshop and create a video documenting the event.This massive sum was spent to build a pier in Gaza, allegedly to facilitate humanitarian aid. However, critics argue that it could easily benefit terrorist groups like Hamas, according to The National Desk.Through the State Department, USAID funded LGBTQ activism in West and Central Africa with a $1 million grant, despite many African nations rejecting Western-imposed social policies.USAID reportedly spent $3 million to support LGBTQ individuals in the Caribbean with no clear explanation of how the funds were distributed or why the initiative was necessary.A USAID-funded climate seminar in Argentina had a strict requirement: participants had to be female or LGBTQ journalists, raising concerns about inclusivity and fairness.The White House disclosed that USAID provided $2 million to support sex reassignment surgeries and LGBTQ activism in Guatemala, a deeply conservative country.US Taxpayer money was used to promote gender inclusivity within Indonesian coffee businesses, sparking outrage over how such spending aligns with American interests.USAID spent $32,000 to create an LGBTQ-focused comic book in Peru. While it is likely meant to promote inclusivity, critics argue that funding a niche cultural project in South America is a waste of American taxpayer money.USAID has funnelled millions of dollars to EcoHealth Alliance, the organization linked to controversial coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.According to The White House, USAID provided food aid that allegedly ended up in the hands of al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Syria. Critics argue this demonstrates the agency’s lack of control over where US funds actually go.USAID has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars on irrigation canals, farming equipment, and fertilizer in Afghanistan—resources that directly benefited the Taliban’s heroin trade. The funding helped sustain one of the world’s largest opium networks, undermining US counter-narcotics efforts.While the US faces its own economic struggles, USAID allocated $14 million in cash vouchers to migrants at the southern border. Critics argue this policy incentivises illegal immigration and misuses taxpayer money that could be spent on domestic priorities.",The us agency for international development (usaid) is facing heavy scrutiny after trump administration crackdown.

Donald Trump says policy of U.S. government is that there are only two genders - male and female

US space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( Nasa ) employees have been directed to remove all pronouns from emails and other applications in an email sent to all staff members, NPR reported.The email was sent in response to executive orders from the Trump administration , including one titled ""Defending women from gender ideology and extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government."" This order was signed by President Trump on his first day in office and includes a directive for agencies to ""end the Federal funding of gender ideology.""The directives come after the White House's office of personnel management distributed instructions last week to department and agency heads, ordering them to remove references to gender ideology from all official materials, including emails. They were also ordered to take down any websites or other public-facing materials that reference gender identity, and ensure that bathrooms in federal buildings were designated for biological males and females.""In response to the Executive Orders, Nasa has disabled features in id.Nasa.gov and Teams that allows users to add pronouns in their display name in Microsoft Outlook and Teams,"" the email said, as per the NPR report. ""For users who have previously added pronouns to their display name, those pronouns will be automatically removed from the system this week.""The email also announced changes to email signatures. ""Nasa has adopted a uniform signature block for emails that are sent using any Nasa.gov email address. All users (civil servants, contractors, and grantees) must modify their signature block to follow the appropriate signature block… the signature block should not include additional embellishment.""This change is part of Nasa’s effort to comply with the White House's directives regarding content within government systems.According to 404 Media, an independent journalist-founded media website, Nasa employees were also instructed to remove specific terms from public-facing websites, including ""Indigenous people"" and references to women such as ""women in leadership.""","Us space agency national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) employees have been directed to remove all pronouns from emails and other applications.

Determining the threat

Further details

Astronomers have identified a newly discovered asteroid with a small yet alarming chance of colliding with Earth in the next decade. The celestial traveller, named 2024 YR4, is nearly 200-foot-wide and has a 1.2 per cent probability of striking Earth on 22 December 2032 raising concerns about its potential impact, especially if it were to crash in a densely populated area.The space rock, discovered last year, is roughly the same size as the Tunguska asteroid, which in 1908 exploded over Siberia, flattening an estimated 80 million trees across 830 square miles and unleashing a blast equivalent to 50 million tons of TNT.Though the event resulted in only three reported deaths due to its remote location, scientists say that today, a similar impact could have a catastrophic effect, particularly over a major city.After a little less than a decade, 2024 YR4 is expected to pass within 66,000 miles of Earth.However, as the data about its current trajectory remains uncertain, the risk of impact could change in case more data is gathered about it.Due to its potential threat, 2024 YR4 has been added to Nasa’s Sentry risk list, which monitors hazardous near-earth objects (NEOs).Experts say that if 2024 YR4 enters Earth's atmosphere intact, it could either explode mid-air in a fiery air burst or crash into the ground, creating a massive crater. However, the extent of destruction relies on the asteroid’s composition and density, the details which have not been gathered by now.Initial calculations suggest that in case it does collide with Earth, the impact zone, known as the risk corridor—could stretch from South America across the Atlantic Ocean to sub-Saharan Africa, as per the Daily Mail.However, this projection is subject to change as astronomers refine the asteroid’s orbit.The asteroid was first detected on 27 December 2024 by Atlas (Asteroid terrestrial-impact last alert system), a Nasa-funded project that scans the sky for potential threats. Automated warning systems quickly flagged 2024 YR4 as a noteworthy object, rating it a 3 on the Torino risk scale, a level that warrants continued monitoring due to its close approach and over 1 per cent chance of impact.Finding out details about the exact size and composition of 2024 YR4 is difficult as it is currently moving away from Earth, making radar observations impossible. Scientists estimate its diameter at 196 feet, but this depends on its surface reflectivity, which remains unknown.Astronomers hope to study 2024 YR4 more closely when it passes within 5 million miles of Earth in 2028, potentially allowing for radar measurements. Until then, researchers must rely on indirect methods, such as brightness analysis, to refine their estimates.While the risk remains low, the asteroid's classification as a potential impactor has set off a scientific race to understand its true threat level before 2032.","The space rock, discovered last year, is roughly the same size as the tunguska asteroid, which in 1908 exploded over siberia, flattening an estimated 80 million trees across 830 square miles and unleashing a blast equivalent to 50 million tons of tnt.
