Surge in Deportations: 8 Indians Deported Daily from the US Under Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-deportations-from-us-double-after-trump-returns-to-office/articleshow/123052105.cms,"File photo

Humane deportation



90% from 5 states



BENGALURU: That deportations of Indians from the US have surged significantly since Donald Trump returned to office in Jan this year is no secret. Now here’s how much more it is when compared to the Biden term and the last year of Trump’s previous term that preceded it: On average, at least 8 Indians were sent back everyday this year, compared to around 3 daily between Jan 2020 and Dec 2024.According to data from the ministry of external affairs (MEA), in the five-and-a-half years between Jan 2020 and July 2025, 7,244 Indians were deported for various reasons, and nearly a quarter of them — 1,703 — were sent back after Trump took office for the second time.This rise also coincides with more aggressive enforcement mechanisms. On June 26, the US state department reminded people that the visa screening doesn’t stop after a visa is issued. “...We continuously check visa holders to ensure they follow all US laws and immigration rules — and we will revoke their visas and deport them if they don’t.”While this was for legal immigrants, a couple of days before this statement, the US had said: “The US has increased enforcement of immigration laws and removal of illegal aliens. Illegal entry will lead to detention, deportation, and permanent consequences for future visa eligibility…Embarking on a costly and dangerous journey will land you in jail or back in your homeland with a permanent mark on your record.”Of the 1,703 deported this year, 864 deportations occurred through state-arranged charter and military flights, as per MEA. US Customs and Border Protection (military flights) repatriated 333 people across three dates in Feb: 5, 15, and 16. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), through its Enforcement and Removal Operations, deported a total of 231 individuals via chartered flights on March 19, June 8, and June 25. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also carried out deportations via charter flights, sending 300 people back to India on July 5 and 18.W hile 747 individuals were deported via commercial flights from the US — they arrived individually or in small groups, depending on when their flight tickets were arranged — another 72 individuals came through commercial flights from Panama in a similar staggered manner.India doesn’t maintain its own firm estimates of illegal immigration into the US. And so far as consular and deportation exercises are concerned, it relies on information shared by US authorities.The MEA has said that “it remains engaged with US counterparts to ensure deportations are carried out humanely. It has also raised concerns regarding the reported use of shackles, particularly on women and children, and other issues related to cultural and religious sensitivities.”Further, a state-wise analysis of the 1,703 Indian deportations in 2025 so far shows that the trend is heavily skewed towards a few northern states. Punjab topped the list with 620 deportees, closely followed by Haryana with 604 — together accounting for over 70% of all cases.Gujarat was a distant third, with 245 individuals sent back, while Uttar Pradesh and Goa followed with 38 and 26 deportees respectively. These top five states collectively represent more than 90% of all deportations recorded this year.The remaining states and UTs reported far fewer cases. Maharashtra and Delhi had 20 deportees each, Telangana 19, Tamil Nadu 17, and Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand 12 each. Karnataka saw only 5.","In five-and-a-half years between jan 2020 and july 2025, 7,244 indians were deported for various reasons.

What India Has Said About the 25% tariff

How will the 25% tariffs hit India?

India’s Exports Uncompetitive?

But is the 25% tariff rate all bad?

25% Trump Tariffs temporary in nature?

US President Donald Trump has hit India with a 25% tariff rate ahead of his August 1 reciprocal tariff deadline. India and the US are working on a trade deal but no interim agreement has been finalised. With this India has become the latest addition to the list of countries subjected to higher tariffs under Trump's ""Liberation Day"" trade strategy, which seeks to restructure American trade partnerships through enhanced reciprocal arrangements.The revised US tariffs will affect India's export of goods to America, projected at approximately $87 billion in 2024. This includes labour-intensive sectors including apparel, medicines, gems and jeweler, and petrochemical products.The trade imbalance between the United States and India is at $45.7 billion, favouring India.Vijay Chauhan, Executive Director, Deloitte India said, “Indian negotiators have done well to remain steadfast in securing national interest. We are watching the situation as the US negotiators are scheduled to visit New Delhi on 25th August.""Taking to social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD! INDIA WILL THEREFORE BE PAYING A TARIFF OF 25%, PLUS A PENALTY FOR THE ABOVE, STARTING ON AUGUST FIRST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. MAGA!The additional penalty for trade with Russia remains unclear for now.Also Read | Donald Trump imposes 25% tariffs on India! How does India compare to other economies like China, Japan, Vietnam on the rate list? Check details In a statement, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said, ""The Government has taken note of a statement by the US President on bilateral trade. The Government is studying its implications.""""India and the US have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months. We remain committed to that objective. The Government attaches the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of our farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs. The Government will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest, as has been the case with other trade agreements including the latest Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the UK,"" India has said.Agneshwar Sen, Trade Policy Leader, EY India says, “The decision to raise the US tariff to 25% on Indian exports is an unfortunate development, particularly given the strong strategic partnership that has been steadily built between India and the USA in recent years.If this tariff is sustained, this move may directly affect key sectors such as marine products, pharmaceuticals, textiles, leather, and automobiles, where bilateral trade has been especially robust. However, it’s important to note that both countries remain positively engaged in active negotiations with the US team expected in India later in August to finalize a comprehensive trade agreement,” he said.“I am confident that, considering our shared interests and history of cooperation, the two sides will be able to address these contentious issues constructively and arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement in the very near term,” he added.Garima Kapoor, Economist and Executive Vice President at Elara Capital sees the 25% tariff as a negative development, and one that may shave off 20 basis points from India’s GDP growth if the tariff rate stays at that level.“The exact details of the tariffs on the exempted items such as pharma and the ones that were charged at a differential rate such as iron, steel and auto is unknown as of now, but inclusion of pharma into tariffs should be incremental negative for India’s exports as US accounts for more than 30% of India’s pharma exports. If no deal is signed by Sept-October, we see a downside to the full year GDP growth estimate for India by 20 basis points,” she said.Also Read | India-US trade deal: Donald Trump announces 25% tariff on India, plus penalty for buying energy and arms from Russia Following the US tariff announcement in April, ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar had initially revised India's GDP growth projection to 6.2 per cent for FY26, considering sluggish export growth and delayed private capital expenditure.""The tariff (and penalty) now proposed by the US is higher than what we had anticipated, and is therefore likely to pose a headwind to India's GDP growth. The extent of the downside will depend on the size of the penalties imposed,"" Nayar added.Agricultural economist Ashok Gulati is of the view that the tariff will significantly affect India's seafood exports, particularly shrimps.The decision by US President Donald Trump to levy higher tariffs on Indian products is ""very bad"" and ""shocking"", noted Gulati, who had anticipated a more modest increase of 10-15 per cent.""This clearly shows Trump is unpredictable and punitive,"" he told PTI.The economist indicated that this development will substantially affect India's shrimp trade, whilst Ecuador stands to benefit due to its reduced tariffs and closer proximity to the United States.The impact of increased US tariffs will extend beyond shrimps to affect India's textile sector as well.Gulati further added that the benefits acquired through the India-UK free trade agreement would be offset by these elevated US tariffs.Earlier this month, an SBI Research report said that even if India is unable to secure a trade deal as per its desire, the impact is likely to be limited. “With India’s service exports reaching a new high each year, a record $387.5 bn in 2024-25 driven by sectors like IT, financial and business services, our total exports are not likely to get significantly impacted,” the report said.The most worrying bit about the 25% tariff is not the figure itself, but the fact that India’s Asian peers have managed to secure deals with the Trump administration that have lower duties. Japan will pay 15%, Vietnam will pay 20% and Indonesia has a tariff of 19%. This will hit India’s competitive advantage for US exports.India is actually looking to secure a trade deal that will give it preferential access to US markets compared to peers.Talking about the India-US trade deal negotiations Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal recently said, “...what is important is to get preferential market access over our competitors, our peers.”Garima Kapoor of Elara Capital says, “The 25% tariff rate is certainly a negative development as it compares to lower rates for peers such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines which compete with India in a similar category of labour-intensive products and electronic goods.”Ajay Srivastava from Global Trade Research Initiative explains, “Some sectors like our top exports to the US are pharmaceuticals, medicines, so Europe will be paying 15%, but European medicines are expensive, high-end proprietary medicines. We are into generics. So if we are paying 25%, I don't think much of the generic market exports to India, exports to the US from India will be impacted.”Regarding smartphone exports, particularly iPhones, he noted that with only China and India being major exporters to the US market, the 5% duty differential (China at 30% and India at 25%) would not significantly affect trade patterns.Garima Kapoor believes a hasty deal would have not helped. “On the positive side, it is pertinent to note that any hotchpotch deal which would have compelled India to give concessions to its agriculture and dairy sector may have had much deeper ramifications politically, socially, and eventually on livelihoods,” she says.“A well negotiated deal that addresses all aspects of trade, investment and tariff and non- tariff barriers by September October 2025 is likely to yield long term benefits than a hurried deal. The India-UK deal template which gave concessions to auto and opened public procurement sector has shown that India is willing to shed its protectionist tag in sectors where it doesn’t impact the marginal producer, which is a huge departure from its earlier stance,” she adds.As trade deal talks appeared to have hit a stalemate with the next round expected in August-end, it appears that India was already bracing for 20-25% tariffs from the Trump administration.""Talks are progressing well,"" a government official had been quoted as saying by Reuters, adding Trump could issue a tariff order in a ""worst-case scenario"".""But, we assume it would be a temporary measure, considering the five rounds of trade talks that have taken place. A deal will soon be worked out,” the official had said.As US officials visit India for the sixth round of talks in August-end, there are hopes that a trade deal will be finalised in the coming months.","India has become the latest addition to the list of countries subjected to higher tariffs under trump's ""liberation day"" trade strategy.

Indian students trapped in the waiting room of their American dreams: Will Marco Rubio unlock the door?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/study-abroad/indian-students-trapped-in-the-waiting-room-of-their-american-dreams-will-marco-rubio-unlock-the-door/articleshow/123032740.cms,"Congressional alarm bells: Letters to Marco Rubio

The numbers paint a bleak picture

March–May 2025: F‑1 visa issuances to Indian students dropped 27% year-on-year, sliding from 13,478 in 2024 to 9,906 this spring.

January–September 2024: A 38% decline compared to 2023, with 64,008 visas issued versus 103,495 the previous year.

First half of FY25 (Oct 2024–Mar 2025): Issuances were down 43.5%, with fewer than 15,000 approvals.



How it feels on the ground: The student fallout

Deferred Dreams: Thousands report receiving appointment slots well past university reporting dates, forcing deferrals to 2026. Some risk losing scholarships tied to fall enrolment. Financial Burn: Families have already paid non-refundable deposits on tuition, flights, and accommodation. For middle-class households, where foreign education is financed through loans, each passing month adds interest without certainty of departure. Academic Disruption: In research-intensive fields like STEM, delayed arrival means missing lab rotations, orientation sessions, and teaching assistantships, disrupting long-term career trajectories. Psychological Toll: Education consultancies report rising stress and anxiety among students, with many scrambling for Canadian or European options as backup. For first-generation learners, the uncertainty translates into fear of losing once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. Knock-on Effect on Universities: U.S. campuses rely heavily on Indian students for graduate research output, particularly in engineering and computer science departments. Delays threaten not just enrolment numbers but ongoing funded research projects dependent on international graduate assistants.

Rubio’s dilemma: Safeguarding America or stalling Indian dreams?

For thousands of Indian students admitted to American universities this fall, the flight to the U.S. may as well be grounded before it takes off—not because of finances or admission hurdles, but because the visa window has slammed shut. A crisis is unfolding across U.S. consulates in India, leaving students in bureaucratic limbo even as tuition deadlines loom and housing contracts run their course. What began as a quiet backlog has now spiralled into a diplomatic flashpoint, with lawmakers on Capitol Hill calling it what it is: a systemic failure that threatens to choke U.S. higher education’s single largest international talent pipeline.Since June 18, 2025, that pipeline has been throttled by a sudden reduction in student visa appointment capacity, as American consulates rolled out new online social media screening norms demanding applicants disclose five years’ worth of digital identifiers. The added scrutiny paused scheduling for weeks and left interview slots painfully scarce, marooning thousands of Indian students—many clutching confirmed admissions and I‑20 forms—as the fall semester nears and their academic futures hang in uncertainty.On 24 July 2025, Congresswoman Deborah Ross, backed by 14 other House members—including Indian-American representatives Pramila Jayapal, Raja Krishnamoorthi, and Shri Thanedar—sent a bipartisan letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.The letter, with a response deadline of 8 August, urges the immediate restoration of full student visa processing capacity across India’s U.S. missions. The lawmakers warn that, without intervention, tens of thousands of Indian students may miss their semester start dates, jeopardising not only academic opportunities but also billions in contributions to the U.S. economy.This follows an earlier May 2025 appeal by the American Council on Education (ACE) and over 50 education associations, protesting a temporary pause in student visa interviews tied to the rollout of enhanced social media vetting protocols. Universities and lawmakers now warn that this procedural bottleneck is no longer a minor hiccup—it is becoming a structural impediment to U.S.–India educational exchange.The gravity of the problem emerges in State Department data:India is now the largest source of international students in the U.S., overtaking China with 29% of the 24,468 students in North Carolina alone in 2024, per the Institute of International Education. Nationwide, over 250,000 Indian students contribute an estimated $9 billion annually in tuition and living expenses. Yet this academic lifeline is being throttled by administrative bottlenecks, leaving students stranded.Beyond numbers, the impact on Indian students is profound and multi-layered:Three converging forces have turned America’s most coveted student visa into one of its hardest to secure.: On June 18, 2025, U.S. consulates quietly rewired the screening process, demanding applicants hand over five years’ worth of social media handles. The added scrutiny slammed the brakes on interview allocations, leaving thousands of hopeful students staring at “no appointments available” screens during the most crucial weeks of the season.When bookings resumed, it wasn’t a floodgate but a trickle. Consulates across India continued to process visas at throttled capacity, unable to catch up with the summer surge. Every day lost pushes departure dates closer to impossibility, tuition deposits closer to forfeiture.Veterans of U.S. immigration policy recall a similar squeeze during the 2018–19 U.S.–China trade war, when F‑1 visas and post-study OPT permissions slowed under a different political pretext. India’s current crisis is framed as security protocol, not geopolitical retaliation—but for students caught in limbo, the distinction is academic.The fallout from America’s choked student visa pipeline doesn’t stop at airport check-ins or abandoned housing contracts—it reverberates through boardrooms, classrooms, and diplomatic channels.International students are not just learners; they are a financial lifeline. Indians alone pump billions of dollars each year into U.S. local economies, sustaining not just universities but the housing market, healthcare providers, neighbourhood restaurants, and even municipal tax bases. A stalled pipeline doesn’t just cost dreams—it drains city coffers from Raleigh to Riverside.The United States has long sold itself as the gold standard for higher education—a place where ambition meets opportunity. But prolonged uncertainty chips away at that promise, pushing families to hedge bets on Canada’s streamlined processes, the UK’s post-study guarantees, or Australia’s increasingly student-friendly policies. Each delayed visa is a crack in the brand America built over decades.Beyond economics and enrolments lies geopolitics. India has now eclipsed China as the largest supplier of international students to U.S. campuses—a quiet pillar of bilateral ties Washington has celebrated as “people-to-people diplomacy.” When that channel clogs, it sends a signal New Delhi cannot ignore: that even high-achieving, fully-funded Indian students can no longer rely on the American system to deliver on its promises. The damage is harder to quantify but no less profound—a trust deficit in a partnership both nations claim to prize.That the bipartisan plea to unclog India’s student visa pipeline landed on Marco Rubio’s desk is no coincidence—it is irony in action. Once the Republican Party’s fresh-faced champion of comprehensive immigration reform, Rubio has, over the past decade, drifted steadily towards a security-first orthodoxy. In May 2025, as U.S. Secretary of State, he vowed to “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students”, citing national security concerns, and warned that future applicants from sensitive fields would face ""stringent, non-negotiable vetting"". Earlier in March, he had said, “a visa is not a birthright,” signalling that speed or scale would never outrun scrutiny .Those soundbites may play well in a domestic political cycle defined by fear of foreign espionage and migration “floodgates.” But for Indian students—caught in a bureaucratic chokehold created by enhanced social media screening, throttled visa slots, and missed academic start dates—it turns a logistical crisis into something darker: a systemic message that America’s door now opens with suspicion, not welcome.The letter signed by Congresswoman Deborah Ross and other legislators urging Rubio’s intervention is, at best, a stopgap appeal. The structural priorities of his State Department lean toward precaution over partnership, viewing every visa as a potential security risk rather than as an instrument of soft power and global academic leadership. Unless Rubio reconciles these two visions—America as a fortress or America as a destination—the Indian student crisis of 2025 won’t be remembered as an accident of process. It will go down as policy by design, and a self-inflicted blow to U.S. higher education’s reputation abroad.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday rejected suggestions of any strain in India-Russia relations following sharp attacks from US President Donald Trump, who questioned the economic and strategic ties between the two countries.Responding to questions at the weekly briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “Our bilateral relationships with various countries stand on their own merit and should not be seen from the prism of a third country. India and Russia have a steady and time-tested partnership.”The MEA’s response came a day after Trump criticised both countries on his social media platform, Truth Social.“I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” Trump posted. “We have done very little business with India — their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together.”Jaiswal, when asked about Trump’s broader comments, reiterated the importance of the India-US partnership: “India and the United States share a comprehensive global strategic partnership anchored in shared interests, democratic values, and robust people-to-people ties.This partnership has weathered several transitions and challenges. We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to and are confident that the relationship will continue to move forward. ”Also Read: Donald Trump's 25% tariff: India expects minimal impact; indicates agriculture, dairy, GM food no-go areas in trade deal talks Asked about defence cooperation, Jaiswal added: “The sourcing of our defence requirements is determined solely by our national security imperatives and strategic assessments.”He declined to comment on Trump’s suggestion that India might one day purchase oil from Pakistan, saying, “I have no comments to offer in this matter.”On questions related to sanctions imposed by the US on Indian companies trading with Iran, Jaiswal said, “We have taken note of the sanctions, we are looking into it.”He also addressed reports suggesting Indian oil firms had stopped sourcing Russian oil: “You are aware of our broad approach to energy sourcing requirements, that we look at what is available in the market and the prevailing global situation. We are not aware of any specifics.”Russia has remained India’s top oil supplier in recent months, accounting for nearly 35–40 per cent of its imports—up from just 0.2 per cent before the Ukraine war.On Thursday, Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal told Parliament that the government is closely examining the developments and will safeguard national interest.“Government gives utmost priority to the safeguarding of welfare of farmers, labourers, entrepreneurs, industrialists, exporters, MSMEs and stakeholders of the industrial sector,” Goyal said. “We will take all necessary steps to safeguard our national interest.”","The ministry of external affairs rejected suggestions of any strain in india-russia relations.

NEW DELHI: Another indigenous multi-role stealth frigate, Himgiri, was delivered to the Navy Thursday that will boost country's blue-water combat capabilities. This is the second such stealth warship to be handed over to the force this month.The 6,670-tonne Himgiri has been built by the Kolkata-based Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), while her predecessor Udaygiri was handed over by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) on July 1. Both the warships are slated to be commissioned together towards end-August.The 149-metre long Himgiri is the third of the seven frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at MDL in Mumbai and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of Rs 45,000 crore. The first was commissioned as INS Nilgiri in Jan, while the remaining four are to be progressively delivered by end-2026.All these multi-mission frigates are packed with advanced sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic precision-strike cruise missiles whose range has been extended to 450-km from the original 290-km, and ""designed to address current and future challenges in the maritime domain"", an officer said.For air defence, the frigates are equipped with Israeli-origin Barak-8 surface-to-air missile system, with an interception range of 70km against fighters, helicopters, drones and cruise missiles, among other weapons.""These frigates reflect a quantum leap in naval design, stealth, firepower, automation and survivability, and are an admirable symbol of aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) in warship building,"" the officer said.Overall, the 140-warship Navy has 58 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards for over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while another 31 warships are in the planning stage.

Indian Footwear Giant Warns of Heavy Blow From Trump’s New Tariffs on Imports

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda has strongly criticized US President Donald Trump over his recent comments describing India’s economy as “dead.” In a sharp statement issued on Friday, Gowda said Trump’s remarks were ""baseless and ill-tempered"" and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for standing firm in the face of US pressure and for not compromising the nation's interests.Calling Trump “a head of state so volatile, uncivil and irresponsible,” Gowda said even a small trader or poor farmer in India, who works with dignity and integrity, could teach the US President a lesson in conduct.""There is something fundamentally wrong with him which reason, diplomacy or statecraft cannot diagnose and address"", the senior leader said.

Responding to Trump’s “dead economy” jibe, he said the US President was either “blind or ill-informed.""He further warned some Indian opposition leaders who echoed Trump’s statements, urging them not to act as “deluded spokespersons” of the US President.Gowda’s statement came after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all Indian goods starting August 1, following a breakdown in interim trade negotiations between the two countries. In his Truth Social post, Trump also said that India and Russia could “take their dead economies down together,” sparking strong reactions.","Former pm hd deve gowda has strongly criticized us president donald trump over his recent comments describing india's economy as ""dead"" in a sharp statement issued on friday, gowda said trump’s remarks were ""baseless and ill-tempered"" he praised prime minister narendra modi for standing firm in the face of us pressure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123044484,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1156175,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

MEA slams UK parliament report on transnational repression as ‘baseless’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mea-slams-uk-parliament-report-on-transnational-repression-as-baseless/articleshow/123050732.cms,"TOI correspondent from London:

India’s ministry of external affairs has condemned a UK parliamentary select committee report that names India as one of 12 countries, alongside Russia, China and Iran, as allegedly involved in “transnational repression” of individuals in Britain as “baseless” and emanating from “dubious sources”.Official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Friday the claims rely “predominantly” on “proscribed entities and individuals with a clear documented history of anti-India hostility. The deliberate reliance on discredited sources calls into question the credibility of the report itself.”The report, titled “Transnational Repression in the UK”, was published on Wednesday by the Joint Human Rights Committee, made up of MPs and peers, which consider matters relating to human rights in the UK. Its members include Indian-origin peer Lord Dholakia.Page 6 states: “Our inquiry received evidence alleging that many states had conducted TNR (transnational repression) activities on UK soil. Multiple evidence submissions accused Bahrain, China, Egypt, Eritrea, India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and UAE of perpetrating TNR in the UK.""China, Russia and Iran were highlighted as the “three most flagrant TNR perpetrators in the UK”.Written evidence submitted to the committee was also published. Those commenting on India include Sikhs for Justice, Dhal Khalsa UK, Sikh Federation UK, and the Sikh Press Association.The report said that the number of state-threat investigations run by MI5 had jumped by 48% in the last year and made recommendations on how the UK should tackle TNR, such as sanctioning perpetrators, expelling diplomats, and taking TNR into account when making international trade partnerships.Former UK security minister Tom Tugendhat told TOI: “This report makes no statement against India. It merely records that evidence was given by a group that has long been hostile to India. As security minister, this conversation on TNR was not a conversation I ever had to have either with the India high commission, or our friends in the Indian govt, or the Indian agencies that we worked with very closely, for the security of all of our people. ”“The report does not suggest that India is doing it. It just states they received evidence about India. That doesn’t mean the committee believes it,” sources told TOI. “You can refuse to admit the evidence, but the bar for doing that is really high. Sikhs for Justice is not proscribed in the UK.”","India's ministry of external affairs has condemned a uk parliamentary select committee report.

NEW DELHI: India on Friday distanced itself from the White House’s call to award the Nobel Peace Prize to US President Donald Trump, saying any such queries should be directed to Washington.

NEW DELHI: Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia has launched a new video series titled “Education Systems of the World and India”, aiming to raise awareness about the importance of quality education in national development.In the first episode, released on Friday, Sisodia compared India’s education system with those of countries such as Japan, Singapore, China, Canada and Finland arguing that these nations achieved global progress by prioritising education reforms.Drawing on international examples, he noted that Singapore, despite gaining independence nearly two decades after India is now among the world's wealthiest nations. He attributed this transformation was possible there due to country's robust education system. Similarly, he pointed to Japan’s early national commitment to education, China’s emphasis on hard work in schools, Canada’s inclusive and diverse approach and Finland’s investment in teacher training and child-centric learning as models worth studying.The series, he said, was inspired by a public conversation he had with Grok AI on education.“Millions of people read our chat, asked questions, and offered suggestions. There was a deep curiosity about how the world educates its children and where India stands in comparison. That interest has motivated me to start this series.”Sisodia argued that for India to achieve meaningful change, education must become a central political priority. “India will only change when its education changes, and education will only change when the thinking of our leaders changes. If their thinking doesn’t change -- change the leaders,” Sisodia said.He also cautioned against blindly copying other countries’ models, stressing the need for India to build an education system suited to its unique social and economic context.“We are India. Our needs and ground realities are different.

"India enters its 2nd orbit, not just to fly, but to lead: Shux",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-enters-its-2nd-orbit-not-just-to-fly-but-to-lead-shux/articleshow/123047158.cms,"BENGALURU: India has entered its “second orbit” in space exploration — this time not just as a participant, but with the clear intent to lead. That’s how Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux), India’s newest spacefarer, described his mission in his first interaction after returning from the International Space Station (ISS).Shux, who flew to space in a multinational private mission led by Axiom Space in collaboration with Nasa and SpaceX, marked India’s return to human spaceflight after 41 years. “It wasn’t a solitary leap. It was the beginning of India’s second orbit. And this time, we are ready, not just to fly, but to lead,” he said.For India, this was more than a symbolic milestone. It was also a rehearsal. PM Modi had asked Shukla to document every aspect of his journey, a detailed assignment meant to feed into the Gaganyaan programme, India’s first human spaceflight mission. “I’ve done that very well,” Shukla said, promising that the knowledge gained will prove “invaluable” for Gaganyaan.Over his 20-day mission, Shukla carried out a suite of Indian science experiments, ranging from stem cell studies to microgravity demonstrations. “I saw stem cells behave in unexpectedly positive ways in space. It was science in motion, 400km above the planet,” he said.Not all of it was lab work. One of his most talked-about microgravity demonstrations involved trapping a bubble inside a bubble — an effort that turned into a group mission with fellow astronauts, drawing laughs and attention on Earth.“Doing science in space is fun as well as challenging,” Shukla said.He emphasised how this flight was as much about inspiring India’s youth as it was about technical validation. “The most common question I got from students was, ‘How do I become an astronaut?’ That’s the real success of this mission. We are halfway there. The rest is just enabling.”To foster that curiosity, the crew conducted live STEM sessions from orbit. But the impact wasn’t just educational — it was emotional. “The messages, the love, the support from every corner of India filled me with something unexpected, a new kind of purpose,” he said.Shukla also reflected on the physiological experience of spaceflight. “Leaving Earth’s gravity showed me how deeply our bodies are shaped by it. After 40 years of living in gravity, adjusting to microgravity was strange. Then coming back, the same phone in my hand felt heavy.” He recounted how even simple tasks like standing or walking needed relearning. “Thankfully, the rehabilitation programme works. Within days, I felt normal again—ready for another mission. ”Humour tinged some of his stories. He recalled waking up one morning after returning, closing his laptop, and letting it fall — instinctively expecting it to float. “Thankfully, the floor was carpeted.”Asked about his biggest learning, Shukla spoke not about any one moment, but the entire machinery behind the mission. “People from across time zones and cultures came together to make 20 days in space possible. That scale of collaboration is what stays with me most.”Just before splashdown, he and Hungarian astronaut Tibor Kapu watched pink and orange plasma streak across the window as their capsule “Grace” re-entered Earth’s atmosphere. We were watching the screen show 1g and feeling it get heavy—by 1.8g we were already struggling,” said Kapu. “But it was beautiful.”And then there was Earth itself. Shukla said the view defied all expectations. “There are no borders, no demarcations. It is all our home. The sense of oneness was very strong,” he reiterated.For a country preparing its own independent crewed mission, these are not just reflections, they are building blocks. As Shux said: “This is only the beginning.”",Group captain shubhanshu shukla (shux) is india's newest spacefarer.

NEW DELHI: On a day when leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi endorsed US President Donald Trump's ""dead economy"" remark on India, Congress leader Rajeev Shukla refuted Trump's view, saying he was ""wrong"", even as party Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor held that US's imposition of 25% tariff and penalties may be just a ""bargaining tactic"" given that trade negotiations are on between the two countries.Another Congress MP, Karti Chidambaram, took a similar line and said, ""Trump is not a conventional politician... We should not panic immediately.

The Indian economy is not dead"". He went on to add that ""economic reforms were introduced when PV Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh were there. Atal Bihari Vajpayee took those reforms forward. Manmohan Singh strengthened them in his 10 years. The current govt has also worked on it. Our economic condition is not at all weak"".""If someone claims they can finish us economically, it's likely due to a misunderstanding. Trump is living in a delusion. Imposing tariffs is wrong,"" Shukla added.With his remarks seen to be contradictory to what Rahul said on the state of the economy, Congress shared a video clip of Shukla responding to a question in Parliament where he said that Rahul Gandhi knows a lot about the economy and went on to list the economic reforms steered by Congress and UPA govt and accused BJP of attacking the party and the Gandhi family without any reason all the time.Tharoor, commenting on the US's tariff decision, said, ""We must give strong support to our negotiators to find the best deal possible. If a good deal is not possible, we may have to walk away"".""Twenty-five per cent plus an unspecified penalty for buying oil and gas from Russia could take it up to 35% or 45%; we don't know how much.
