Experts Analyse India-China Diplomatic Row After Shanghai Airport Incident

What happened in Shanghai

NEW DELHI: Pema Wang Thongdok has hit back at online trolls after facing alleged harassment by Chinese authorities at Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport, using the incident to call for national unity.Thongdok, who was travelling from London to Japan with a transit stop in Shanghai on 21 November, said immigration officials refused to recognise her Indian passport because her birthplace was listed as Arunachal Pradesh.In a post on social media platform 'X', Thongdok thanked those who supported her and clarified that she does not engage with trolls.""I would like to thank everyone speaking in support of this diplomatic issue and while I’m new here & not active on X it’s because I have a very high profile full-time position working in the financial services and don’t have idle time to answer trollers!

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday dismissed Pakistan’s comments on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s participation at the Ram temple ceremony in Ayodhya, with ""the contempt they deserve”.The sharp response came a day after Pakistan’s foreign office issued a statement objecting to the flag-hosting ceremony at the Ram temple on Tuesday. The statement alleged a growing threat to religious minorities in India and claimed Muslim heritage sites were at risk from Hindu extremists.Minitry of external affairs termed the remarks politically motivated and unacceptable, holding that Pakistan has no locus standi on India’s internal matters. The MEA said Pakistan’s statements reflect a habitual pattern of interference and are aimed at provoking communal narratives.MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have seen the reported remarks and reject them with the contempt they deserve. As a country with a deeply stained record of bigotry, repression, and systemic mistreatment of its minorities, Pakistan has no moral standing to lecture others. Rather than delivering hypocritical homilies, Pakistan would do better to turn its gaze inwards and focus on its own abysmal human rights record.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hoisted the dharma dhwaja atop the spire of Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Temple, marking the completion of the temple structure. Addressing the gathering, he said the flag symbolised civilisational resurgence and declared, “This sacred flag will stand as a testament that truth ultimately triumphs over falsehood.”The Prime Minister said democracy was deeply rooted in India’s civilisational fabric and highlighted the government’s commitment to inclusive development. He said, “Ram does not discriminate, and the government is also moving forward with the same spirit,” urging citizens to uphold unity as the nation moves toward Viksit Bharat.Calling the ceremony the fulfilment of a 500 year old resolve, Modi said longstanding wounds were beginning to heal and described Ayodhya as a rising centre where spirituality and modernity would converge. Recounting the moment of the flag installation, he said, “The process started at 11:40 PM. I pressed the button, and the flag was installed at 11:50. The entire process took 4 minutes.”PM Modi held a roadshow in Ayodhya, where crowds lined the streets to welcome him. He later visited Saptmandir, Sheshavtar Mandir, Mata Annapurna Mandir and performed Darshan and Pooja at the Ram Lalla Garbha Grah.","'no moral standing': india slams pakistan's rant on ayodhya event, calls out bigotry and repression.

‘Strong demarche was made with the Chinese side’



NEW DELHI: An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.Prema Wangjom Thongdok, said she is an Indian citizen living in the UK for about 14 years. The ordeal occurred while she was traveling from London’s Gatwick to Japan via a transit in Shanghai.Describing her harrowing experience she told ANI, “I had basically crossed e-gates, standing in the queue for my next flight, and then one of the officials from the Chinese immigration came over and singled me out of the queue. I asked her what was happening, she didn’t say much, just asked me to follow her. And she went on to say, 'Arunachal- not India, China-China, your visa is not acceptable. Your passport is invalid. 'She further went on to narrate the alleged misbehavior of the officials at the airport, accusing them of “mocking” and “laughing” at her.“When I tried to question them, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing, saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian.’”She added that she had transited through Shanghai previously without issue and described the experience as humiliating, with airport and airline staff allegedly laughing and pointing at her passport.Thongdok also claimed that she had already consulted the Chinese embassy in London regarding the transit and she was assured that no visa would be required for a layover.Thongdok claimed she couldn't reach out for any help from anyone as there were wifi issues and social platforms like Google and Whatsapp don’t work in the country.She was eventually assisted by Indian embassy officials from Shanghai and Beijing, who helped resolve the issue and provided support during the prolonged wait. She said she was finally able to leave the airport around 10:30PM.Thongdok went on to add, , ""... We are part of India... We speak 'shuddh Hindi', we don't understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian... I want to raise this awareness that residents of the northeast of India should not face such harassment in terms of being called and being told that you are not a part of the country that you're so proudly a citizen of. I would like the government of India to raise this on a diplomatic level with the Chinese authorities. This is not something a regular citizen can resolve. I would just like to request the government of India to take strict action against the Chinese authorities and the government on such matters...""She further told ANI, after her return she reached out to the higher up authorities in the country, writing to them via mails, requesting such incident not be repeated.I wrote an email to the ministry of external affairs, PMO, CM of Arunachal Pradesh, foreign secretary, that such an incident shouldn't happen to someone who is just a normal citizen…”Thongdok referred to the incident as a possible hassle tactic used by Chinese officials to harass Indian citizens, especially as it was the weekend so there would be less chance of an official intervention, as government offices are closed.“Just to be harassed for so many hours, I think it might be quite a tactic used by the Chinese government to hassle citizens of India, especially from Arunachal Pradesh... I'm just grateful to the team from the Indian embassy who helped me get out of there finally.”Before the interview with ANI she had posted about her order on X, tagging government authorities including Union minister Kiran Rijiju who himself hails from Arunachal Pradesh, and PMO office, highlighting the extended detention and questioning of her citizenship based on her birthplace.Thongdok wrote, “ @pemakhandu @kirenrijuju @PMOIndia I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hrs on 21st Nov, 2025 on claims by China immigration & @chinaeasternair They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh which they claimed is Chinese territory.”ANI citing sources claimed, a “strong demarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place. Our Consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended fullest assistance to the stranded passenger.”It was asserted Arunachal Pradesh is an ‘indisputably Indian territory,’ calling the reason for detention as ‘ludicrous.’“It was stressed that the passenger had been detained on ludicrous grounds. Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports. ⁠It has also been highlighted that the actions of the Chinese authorities are in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation.”The actions were termed “ unnecessary obstructions” to restoring normalcy in the bilateral ties between the two sides.“At a time when both sides are working on restoring normalcy, such actions by the Chinese side introduce unnecessary obstructions to the process.”",'they said arunachal is china': indian woman alleges harassment after passport rejection in shanghai airport.

PM Modi Pens Powerful Letter On Duties And Democracy, Reflects On His Constitutional Journey

NEW DELHi: President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday said women representation in judiciary, legislature and executive continues to be low despite Parliament amending the Constitution to enact Women's Reservation Act in 2023 to reserve one-third of seats for women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies.""Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam is a historic step towards empowering women and a homage to all women who took part in the Constituent Assembly to frame the Constitution. But we continue to lag in giving women adequate representation in judiciary, legislature and executive,"" Murmu said at the Constitution Day celebrations organised by Supreme Court, which has only one woman among 33 judges.Speaking in the presence of CJI Surya Kant and law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, the President said taking steps to give adequate representation to women in all three wings of governance will require a change of mindset. It was SCBA president Vikas Singh who mentioned extremely low representation of women in judiciary - 13% in HCs and 35% in trial courts.She said annual commemoration of the Constitution's adoption on Nov 26, 1949, is often marked by speeches made by dignitaries. ""Have we ever looked back and assessed in the last 75 years how much we have progressed in achieving the constitutional goals of justice, equality, liberty and fraternity for every citizen? If not, can we do it in the next 24 years when we will be celebrating the centenary of the adoption of the Constitution? That is the question, not only for the judiciary, legislature or executive, but for everyone.Addressing another Constitution Day event in Central Hall of old Parliament building or Samvidhan Sadan, Murmu described the Constitution as the bedrock of ""our national pride and national identity"", and as a guiding text for taking India forward with a ""nationalist mindset by abandoning the colonial mindset"".In front of an audience that included Vice-President C P Radhakrishnan, PM Narendra Modi, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, opposition leaders of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi, respectively, and members of both Houses of Parliament, Murmu cited implementation of legislations related to the criminal justice system as an example of the effort to shun the colonial mindset.Murmu also said that by repealing the provisions of Article 370, an obstacle that had been hindering the country's inclusive political integration was removed.At the function in SC, Murmu praised CJI's renewed focus on mediation and termed it a big step to reduce litigation.CJI Kant said when it comes to justice delivery system, there is still a disquieting gap between constitutional vision and the experience of many, especially the marginalised section of population for whom the access to justice remains elusive because of exorbitant cost of litigation, language of courts, distance and delay. Promising to improve the justice delivery system on all these fronts, the CJI said, ""The time is also ripe for us to reinforce predictability in our judicial approach.

But no decision has been made on the Sukhoi-57, F-35 or any other choice,"" a source said.Meanwhile, the PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) is set to approve the Rs 63,000 crore upgrade of the first lot of 84 Sukhoi-30MKI fighters - IAF has 259 such Russian-origin jets - with advanced radars, avionics, longer-range weapons and multi-sensor fusion to ensure they are capable of air combat for another 30 years. ""While the upgrade will be carried out indigenously, Russia will have some role in it,"" another source said.India has been trying to strike a balance between its long-standing arms supplier Russia and the increasingly transactional US under the Trump administration that wants to punish countries for buying Russian oil and arms.Several defence deals are in the pipeline with the US, which has already bagged Indian contracts worth $26 billion over the last 15 years. After the over $1 billion (Rs 8,900 crore) deal with US major General Electric for another 113 GE-F404 engines to power Tejas Mark-1A fighters was inked earlier this month, CCS on Wednesday cleared a Rs 7,000 crore ""follow-on support package"" for the 24 American MH-60R Seahawk helicopters being inducted by Navy for Rs 15,157 crore.On the Russian front, Moscow has assured New Delhi it will deliver by Nov 2026 the remaining two of the original five S-400 squadrons, ordered for $5.4 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) in 2018, after a long delay due to the Ukraine war.IAF is keeping its fingers crossed. Defence ministry has also approved the Rs 10,000 crore procurement of a large number of S-400 missiles - with interception ranges of 120, 200, 250 and 380km - to replenish stocks used during the hostilities with Pakistan as well as build reserves, as was earlier reported by TOI.""While IAF has asked for five more S-400 squadrons, defence ministry has already approved a comprehensive annual maintenance contract for the systems. Russia will set up an MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) facility in India for them,"" the source said.Describing S-400 as a ""gamechanger"" during Op Sindoor, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh recently said it had shot down ""at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters in the F-16 and JF-17-class"" in the ""longest kill ever achieved"" at a distance of 314km.",India is yet to take a call on acquiring two-three squadrons of the russian fifth-generation sukhoi-57 fighter.

NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar will on December 3 take up chairship of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IIDEA) for the year 2026 in Stockholm, reflecting a “global recognition of the Election Commission’s standing as one of the world’s most credible and innovative election management bodies (EMBs),” as per EC.IIDEA is an intergovernmental organisation created in February 1995, with India as a founding member, to support sustainable democracy worldwide. It has, over the past three decades, evolved into a key global convenor for EMBs, constitutional experts, political institutions and democratic practitioners from across continents. It currently comprises 35 member countries including Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Mauritius, South Africa, Chile and Sweden, with the US and Japan acting as observer states. Electoral processes and electoral research are among its focus areas. IIDEA through its council of member states annually elects a chair and two vice-chairs. Its present chairship is held by Switzerland and will now pass on to India.As Chair, Kumar will be presiding over all council meetings through 2026. EC in a statement on Wednesday said the CEC “will leverage the country’s unmatched experience of conducting the world’s largest elections to shape IIDEA’s global agenda”.Ironically, the international appreciation and IIDEA leadership for the CEC comes against the backdrop of constant attacks faced by him and EC from the opposition parties here, on the electoral roll health and the special intensive revision (SIR) exercise.“The collaboration (between EC and IIDEA) will strengthen knowledge-sharing, reinforce professional networks among EMBs, and support evidence-based global electoral reforms,” the poll panel underlined on Wednesday.It added that “Kumar will leverage the country’s unmatched experience of conducting the world’s largest elections to shape IIDEA’s global agenda”.According to EC, India, with the world’s largest electorate of 1 billion and well-documented, transparent electoral processes, will share its best practices with EMBs from across the world, in the coming year.Joint programmes, workshops, and research collaborations between ECI-run India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM) and IIDEA will further enhance global readiness to respond to challenges such as disinformation, electoral violence, and erosion of voter trust, said the commission.","Chief election commissioner (cec) gyanesh kumar will take up chairship of the international institute for democracy and electoral assistance (iidea) for the year 2026 in stockholm.

Nicolas Pepe and Teanna Trump’s romance and rumored engagement

Nicolas Pepe is making headlines off the pitch just as much as he does on it. The Villarreal winger is reportedly planning to take a big step in his personal life: marrying Teanna Trump AKA Keanna Nichele Jones, a former American adult film star and social media personality. Fans have followed the couple’s romance for over a year, and now social media is buzzing with rumors of an engagement, making this one of the most talked-about stories in football circles and online communities right now.The two went public with their relationship shortly before New Year’s Eve last year, after dating since Pépé joined Villarreal in August 2024. Over the past 18 months, they have shared glimpses of their life together online, with Trump often attending matches and celebrating his big wins, cheering for him. Now, reports suggest the couple could be heading toward an engagement, sparking excitement among fans.Teanna Trump began working in adult entertainment at 18. In 2020, she reportedly moved away from adult films and focused on subscription-based platforms like OnlyFans. In a Snapchat post back of her doing laundry back in May, Trump had written, ""Crazy how I switched jobs so quick. I was a po*nstar, now I'm a maid.""Teanna Trump's relationship with Nicolas Pepe reportedly started in late 2024, when she was spotted in the VIP section at Villarreal’s stadium during a match against Atletico Madrid. Trump has been a constant supporter at Villarreal games. She was also seen celebrating with Pepe after he earned the ‘Player of the Match’ award in Villarreal’s 2-2 Champions League draw against Juventus in October. Since then, they’ve been seen going out together and spending time with Pepes children from his previous marriage to Fanny B, according to a report in Marca.According to initial reports, Pepe is “extremely serious” about a long-term future with Trump. Rumors also say he encouraged her to leave the adult industry. However, neither Pepe, Trump, their representatives, nor Villarreal CF have confirmed the news, but their public appearances and social media posts have drawn a lot of attention already.The romance has taken center stage amid Pepe's football journey. After struggling at Arsenal, he had a short spell at Trabzonspor before signing with Villarreal last year. While he has scored two goals and provided two assists this season, it’s his off-field life and high-profile relationship that have dominated headlines.As of now, fans are eagerly waiting to see if an official announcement will confirm what has been widely rumored for months.","Nicolas pepe and teanna trump have been dating for over a year.

Candace Owens On Feminism, Zionism, Who Assassinated Charlie Kirk?





Candace Owens claims Charlie Kirk sent a very scary text message the day before he died. She says Charlie Kirk told a Turning Point USA worker, “They are going to kill me.” She said this message was sent just one day before he was shot on September 10 at an event in Utah. Candace Owens spoke about this on the Myron Gaines podcast, where she made many strong claims about what she thinks happened.She said she does not like the silence from people inside Turning Point USA and believes someone is hiding something. Owens also said Charlie Kirk’s views were changing right before his death and that things around him felt tense. She says he told Tucker Carlson to “go max,” and she believes many people around him were upset about it. Her statements have now created a big debate online.On the podcast, Myron Gaines asked Candace Owens who she thought was “most responsible” for what happened to Charlie Kirk. She said his death did not feel simple and that she believed something bigger was happening. Owens said that one Turning Point USA staff member has the text message from Charlie Kirk where he wrote, “They are going to kill me.”She said this message was not about the trans lobby. She did not name the person who received the text.She said she did not understand why the TPUSA staff member never shared the warning with the public.Candace Owens also said she did not like how Turning Point USA was acting after Charlie Kirk’s death. She said it felt strange and did not match how close people said they were to Kirk. She said Charlie Kirk knew he would die young and believed she would be the one to speak up for him.Owens then said she believes Charlie Kirk’s killing was a “military hit.” She said she does not know who ordered it but feels sure it looked like a planned attack. She also said she sees what she calls “faith infiltration” inside Turning Point USA. She believes some people got close to Charlie Kirk on purpose.Candace Owens also claimed that an Egyptian military plane was sitting at an airport near the event on the day Charlie Kirk was shot.

Here are the top developments

Toll rises to 44

Three arrested

Rescue ops ongoing

Witness account

Styrofoam fanned the flames





The death toll in the massive fire in multiple high rises in Hong Kong rose to 44, with over 270 hundred still missing. Later, several media outlets reported arrest of 3 people in connection to the fire.Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed condolences and urged the city to contain the disaster swiftly.State media reported that Xi called on authorities to “make every effort” to put out the fire and minimise further loss of life.“Xi Jinping expressed condolences for those who died in the major fire at a residential estate in Tai Po District, New Territories, Hong Kong, including the firefighter who died in the line of duty,” it said.The death toll in the incident was revised to 44, after initial count of 36, while 279 are reported missing.Police have arrested three men on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the blaze, as reported by South China Morning Post. Police announced the arrests in a brief, one-sentence advisory that did not detail the suspects’ alleged actions, and said more information would be provided at a later press conference.Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee confirmed the rising toll and said that search teams were still tracing missing residents as smoke continued to billow from the charred towers.The Fire Services Department said it received the first emergency call at 2:51 pm local time and escalated the blaze to a No 4 alarm at 3:34 pm, one level below the highest emergency classification. Dozens of engines, ambulances and rescue teams were deployed as smoke poured from the towers, which house around 2,000 apartments and were undergoing renovation work.“Police and the Fire Services Department have already set up a dedicated investigation team to investigate the cause of the fire,” said John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, as quoted by AP.Witnesses described seeing residents gathered on overhead walkways as flames climbed rapidly up buildings covered in bamboo scaffolding. The Tai Po district, home to nearly 300,000 people, is among Hong Kong’s most tightly packed urban zones.Roads around the area remain closed, with bus routes diverted as firefighters continue sweeping each floor to locate survivors. More details are awaited as authorities verify the number of missing residents and assess structural safety before entering deeper sections of the complex.The blaze tore through the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Tai Po on Wednesday, with flames and thick smoke engulfing the 32-storey blocks for more than ten hours.Fire Services Director Andy Yeung Yan-kin said officers found styrofoam inside the burning buildings, which he believes intensified the blaze. According to the South China Morning Post, the material allowed flames to race through corridors and ignite flats across multiple levels. Yeung noted that firefighters could only enter from the ground floor as many floors were still burning well into the early hours of Thursday. One of the biggest challenges, he said, was the number of levels alight simultaneously.Security Secretary Chris Tang called the fire’s speed “suspicious”. Preliminary checks, he said, showed that the building’s netting and waterproof tarpaulin burned far faster than regulated materials. “We found that the netting and waterproof tarpaulin on the building walls, once ignited, spread flames much faster than they should. This is unusual,” Tang said. He confirmed that police and fire officers would conduct a full investigation, including a criminal probe into any irregularities.Read more: What caused the Hong Kong fire that killed 36 and left hundreds missing","Chinese president xi jinping expressed condolences and urged the city to contain the disaster swiftly.

Candace Owens’ claims and the Macrons’ lawsuit





Candace Owens says her show will not come on air this week. She says she had to stop the show because she believes French President Emmanuel Macron tried to plan her murder. Candace Owens says she sent a report about this to the White House and to US counterterrorism teams. She also says these offices told her they got her report. These are her words, not confirmed by officials. She shared this update on X. She wrote that her show will be off the air and then said she wants people to know what is happening. Owens says someone close to the French first couple told her that Emmanuel Macron tried to organize the plan to kill her.Owens also says she thinks the Macrons were part of the plan to kill Charlie Kirk . Charlie Kirk was the founder of Turning Point USA. He was killed on September 10, 2025, while giving a speech at Utah Valley University. Owens says the Macrons did not act alone. She said that anyone who did not believe her can now wait for the President of the United States and US intelligence groups to make a statement. She says only then will people know if she is telling the truth.Candace Owens has also said before that Emmanuel Macron paid $1.5 million to hire someone to kill her. Again, these are her claims, and she has not shown public proof.Right now, Owens is dealing with a lawsuit from Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron . They filed this lawsuit because Owens kept saying Brigitte Macron is secretly a man.The lawsuit says Owens posted an eight-part series where she claimed Brigitte Macron was born male, took another woman’s identity, and later had surgery to become female.The lawsuit says these claims are “demonstrably false” and that Owens knew they were false. It says she still posted them to get more fame and attention. The Macrons say her words were meant to hurt them and their family. Their lawyers also say they asked her many times to stop, but she did not.The Macrons say they hope the lawsuit will end what they call a “campaign of defamation” and help set the record straight.Also Read: Candace Owens Recalls College Moment She Felt Feminism Was A Lie And Reveals The Class Blamed Men For All Problems",Candace owens says her show will not come on air this week.

Speculations over former Prime Minister Imran Khan's whereabouts are rife across Pakistan after his three sisters were ""brutally"" assaulted by the police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.This comes as several social media handles originating from Afghanistan and Pakistan claimed that Imran has been mysteriously killed inside Adiala Jail.According to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf members, Imran's sisters — Noreen Niazi, Aleema Khan and Dr Uzma Khan — were camped outside Adiala Jail when police personnel assaulted them ""for seeking a meeting with Imran Khan"".""We peacefully protested over concerns for his health condition. We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct. Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel,” Noreen Niazi said.“At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries,” she said.Meanwhile, thousands of PTI supporters also gathered outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi and raised slogans against the arrest of Imran Khan.Noreen Niazi also accused the police personnel of slapping and dragging women present outside the jail.""Police's conduct was part of a broader and troubling pattern of indiscriminate force used against peacefully protesting citizens over three years, reflecting a troubling impunity,"" she said.""Police's conduct was wholly criminal, illegal, morally reprehensible, and in direct contradiction to the foundational duties of any law enforcement agency in a democratic society,"" she added.This comes as the government has put a ban on meeting Imran inside jail for over a month. The former Pakistan PM has been in jail since August 2023 in multiple cases.Earlier, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was not allowed to meet Khan. Afridi made seven consecutive attempts to see him in jail, but he was denied by the jail authorities, whom Khan claims were controlled by an army officer.","Imran khan's three sisters were ""brutally"" assaulted by the police for seeking a meeting with their brother.
