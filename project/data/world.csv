NSA starts probe into GPS spoofing at IGI airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nsa-starts-probe-into-gps-spoofing-at-igi-airport/articleshow/125237557.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The office of National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval has launched a probe into the unprecedented GPS spoofing IGI Airport has been facing for the past few weeks. NSA is learnt to be coordinating with multiple aviation and defence agencies on this issue as spoofing has been usually common in conflict zones.Due to this phenomenon, planes coming to land often get wrong location or heading signals and false terrain warnings about 60 nautical miles from the airport.This is the first time that the Delhi airport has been facing this issue. The 'automatic terminal information service' for IGIA has been regularly issuing alerts about spoofing and the airlines have been accordingly informing their pilots.While security agencies are tackling the source of this interference, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai on Monday cleared the promulgation of category-1 (CAT-I) instrument landing system (ILS) at IGIA's warhorse runway 10/28's 10 on the Dwarka side. Now, Airports Authority of India is likely to issue a notice to airmen by Tuesday.DGCA expedited this process from the original date of Nov 27 due to the spoofing. This will help an aircraft land from the Dwarka side on the main runway (10/28) when easterlies are blowing even if GPS spoofing is taking place.Without ILS, aircraft can land using 'required navigation performance', but it requires GPS and spoofing had affected flight movement on the main runway a few times in the recent past.The inability to land on runway 10 end had led to congestion at India's busiest airport, which now handles about 1,550 daily flights and some flights had to divert to alternate airports like Jaipur.Delhi International Airport Ltd has warned that ""some flight schedules may be impacted"" on Tuesday as ""mandatory flight calibration of ILS will take place between 11.30am and 1.30pm as part of continuous safety practices"". Flights will be ""regulated during this period"". Accordingly, DIAL has advised passengers to ""coordinate with airlines to get updated flight information status"".All the runways at IGIA are scheduled for calibration every six months. On Tuesday, sources say, the ILS of runway 29 left (29L), which is closest to the Gurgaon side and used for arrivals, is due for calibration.",Nsa ajit doval has launched a probe into the unprecedented gps spoofing igi airport has been facing for the past few weeks.

EU Divided Ahead Of COP30 In Brazil; Chaos Over Climate Targets; Green Dream Falters?

NEW DELHI: The 30th session of the annual UN climate conference (COP30) kicked off on Monday in Belem, Brazil, with a focus on climate finance to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries by 2035. Discussions on the inaugural day, however, were centred around setting key agenda points, involving five critical issues, for negotiations.The presidencies of this year’s host Brazil and last year’s host Azerbaijan had last week released the ‘Baku to Belém Roadmap’, detailing how to deliver $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries to help them implement promised climate actions. Though not a formal conference document, the Roadmap set the tone for brainstorming the issue during the upcoming negotiations.With countries gearing up to discuss contentious issues, including climate finance, UN climate change executive secretary Simon Stiell, while opening the COP30, said, ""Your job here is not to fight one another – your job is to fight this climate crisis, together.""Besides the critical issues of ways and means of mobilising climate finance and the countries’ response to the latest round of climate action pledges (Nationally Determined Contributions) to limit the warming to 1.5 degree Celsius, the setting of agenda on the first day revolved around three more issues, including a request to discuss unilateral trade measures such as the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the EU-backed proposal on emissions reporting.The CBAM, which is to be implemented from next year, will impose border tax on carbon intensive goods, like iron & steel, aluminium and cement, that enter the 27 European Union nations. It'll put a tariff burden on such products of developing countries, including India, and impact their trade.As part of the other agenda, host Brazil has proposed setting up the Integrated Forum on Climate Change and Trade (IFCCT) to integrate climate and trade policies. It aims to create a unified platform under the WTO to discuss how such integration takes place. Negotiators of over 195 member-countries are expected to finalise the agenda through consensus by Wednesday.India is currently represented by a team of officials from different ministries, including environment, finance and renewable energy.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav will participate in the negotiations during the second week of the conference.","The 30th session of the annual un climate conference (cop30) kicked off on monday in belem, brazil.

"Strict checks in place, terrorists shift to local bomb-making tech using common materials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/strict-checks-in-place-terrorists-shift-to-local-bomb-making-tech-using-common-materials/articleshow/125235734.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The recent operations by the J&K Police and the Gujarat ATS have highlighted an insidious form of radicalisation - the so-called ""white-collar terror ecosystem"". However, what's more concerning is the recovery of common, dual-use materials - such as ricin from castor seeds and ammonium nitrate used in fertilisers - in terror plots.Sources said that this pointed to a critical shift in operational strategy, likely to have been necessitated by the stringent security checks at the borders and on traditional transit routes. This logistical chokehold is prompting terror commanders to have their recruits return to age-old, domestic bomb-making techniques using easily accessible, commercially available materials.Regarding the arrest of doctors, sources said that terror commanders were using Indian recruits who are radicalised but can dodge suspicion and detection by being in a respectable profession, affording Pakistan deniability in the process.The return to low-tech, high-impact techniques presents a fresh challenge for security agencies. According to intelligence officials, this modus operandi is preferred by terrorist groups since the ingredients are legal and sold, virtually over the counter, for legitimate commercial purposes and acquiring them does not immediately raise suspicion, making the planning phase extremely difficult to detect.For example, terrorists are using normal watches as timers in IEDs, in a throwback to the days when Indian Mujahideen used parts of Ajanta brand of wall clocks as timers for bombs they set off in a series of terror attacks at important cities.""This tactic is preferred by terrorist organisations, as ""improvised"" itself means using non-military, accessible components. Even groups in Iraq and Afghanistan (including al-Qaeda and IS) which extensively used IEDs, often used homemade explosives which were triggered by common electronic items like cell phones,"" said a retired intelligence officer. Even the LTTE in Sri Lanka was known for developing sophisticated IEDs and using fertiliser-based explosives in various attacks.The use of Homemade Explosives and readily available components for Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) grants terrorist groups significant leeway for carrying out ISI's plans to engineer high-impact attacks without having to worry about arranging the large amounts needed for explosives like RDX. ""Strategically, this approach is designed to inflict mass disruption and fear by causing violence through everyday items, thereby eroding public safety and generating propaganda that undermines govt stability,"" said another officer.","The recent operations by the j&k police and the gujarat ats have highlighted an insidious form of radicalisation.

"Gisele Bündchen implied that prioritizing Tom Brady for years took a personal toll: “When you love someone, you don’t put them in jail”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-implied-that-prioritizing-tom-brady-for-years-took-a-personal-toll-when-you-love-someone-you-dont-put-them-in-jail/articleshow/125033119.cms,"Supermodel Gisele Bündchen, in a candid interview, shared insights into her marriage with Tom Brady, describing their split as a 'death and rebirth.' She detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success. Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter.

The shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining what a chapter ends and a new one begins.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?",Supermodel gisele bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former nfl quarterback tom brady.

Ben Shapiro accuses Candace Owens of serious claims about Erika Kirk





New leaked text messages between Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens have shocked many online. The screenshots, posted by AF Post on X, show that before his death, Kirk believed Ben Shapiro was trying to “kill” both his and Owens’ careers as they got more famous. In the messages, Candace Owens sent Charlie Kirk an article titled “LEAK: Ben Shapiro’s YAF Launches Smear Campaign Against Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens – DANGEROUS.”Charlie Kirk replied with a laugh, then said Owens had become “bigger than Ben,” and that Shapiro wanted her to “punch down to him.” In another text, Kirk told Owens, “He views you as my slave. 100%. ‘Control her’ is what he was really saying when he called.” The texts do not show any date or time, so it’s unclear when the conversation took place. The messages were shared by AF Post, but their authenticity hasn’t been confirmed by any official source.While these leaked texts spread online, Ben Shapiro spoke about Candace Owens on The Megyn Kelly Show. During his talk, Shapiro said Owens had done “vile” things and that Kelly should have called her out. He then said, “If this were on the Left, and somebody was accusing Charlie Kirk’s wife of having murdered him, I assume you’d be talking about it.”When Kelly asked if Candace Owens had really accused Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow, of killing her husband, Ben Shapiro replied, “She’s accusing TPUSA insiders and other members of the right wing, including Seth Dillon, of being involved in the murder of Charlie Kirk.”Owens quickly reacted on X, posting Ben Shapiro’s clip and calling him a liar. She wrote that he was “lying through his teeth” and called him “completely deranged.” Candace Owens said Ben Shapiro was trying to pressure Kelly into speaking badly about her using false claims.After Ben Shapiro’s comments, Erika Kirk appeared on Fox News with Jesse Watters and spoke about the related rumors swirling around. She said people should “pray and think” before posting things online about her late husband because it could hurt their kids in the future.Also Read: YouTuber Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro After He Claims She Accused Erika Kirk Of Killing Charlie Kirk Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was shot dead on September 10, 2025.

Donald Trump and Taylor Swift end up linked again after the Commanders crowd boos him

The Taylor Swift reaction follows Donald Trump into every NFL moment he attends

Donald Trump’s old Taylor Swift post is back in the spotlight after he was loudly booed during the Washington Commanders and Detroit Lions game on Nov. 9. The moment spread online almost instantly because the history between Donald Trump and Taylor Swift has become its own cultural storyline inside and outside the NFL.The resurfaced Truth Social post hit social media within minutes of the crowd’s reaction. The timing brought Trump’s long list of comments about Taylor Swift back into circulation at the exact moment he faced the same treatment she experienced at Super Bowl LIX.Donald Trump appeared at Northwest Stadium with House Speaker Mike Johnson, becoming the first sitting president in nearly fifty years to attend a regular-season NFL game. When he showed up on the videoboard during the first half, the crowd reacted with clear boos and some scattered applause. A similar response followed during a halftime military oath ceremony.The online reaction moved fast. X account @dontblamealex posted the clip of the boos alongside an old Truth Social message Trump wrote about Taylor Swift in February. The caption referenced Swift’s lyric “Karma is a relaxing thought,” and the clip passed a lot of views as it continued to spread.Trump’s original post came from Super Bowl LIX, where Swift was shown on the stadium screen and met with loud boos from Eagles fans. Trump wrote, “The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!”NBC News and the Associated Press reported at the time that the boos came from Eagles fans who were responding to their rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs. Trump framed it as a political moment, which kept the story alive long after the Super Bowl ended.Swift reportedly laughed at the reaction in New Orleans. The public tension between Donald Trump and Taylor Swift dates back to her endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election cycle. Trump previously wrote, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,” which remains one of his most widely circulated posts.The resurfaced post created a fresh wave of conversation around Donald Trump, Taylor Swift, and the way their names keep colliding with NFL storylines. Trump has alternated between attacking Taylor Swift online and praising her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. In August, he congratulated the couple on their engagement and said, “Well, I wish them a lot of luck. I think he’s a great player, he’s a great guy. I think that she’s a terrific person, so I wish them a lot of luck.”The White House then brought Taylor Swift into the center of attention again when its official TikTok account used her track “The Life of Ophelia” in a new video. The clip paired her lyrics with Trump’s mug shot and other footage related to his political career. Fans called out the video across TikTok, including one comment that said, “His obsession with her needs to be studied it’s wild really.”There is more history behind all of this. Trump previously posted AI-generated images that falsely suggested Swift endorsed him during the 2024 race. Those images were debunked immediately, and Swift has never supported him politically.Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has kept his responses measured when asked about Trump’s presence at major games. Ahead of Super Bowl LIX, Kelce told reporters on Feb. 5, “That’s awesome. It’s a great honor. I think you know, no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there, it’s the best country in the world, and that’s pretty cool. ”The resurfaced post now adds another layer to the long, tense timeline between Donald Trump and Taylor Swift. Every time either one appears at an NFL event, the conversation connects them again. With Trump back in public stadiums and Swift still tied to the league through Kelce, this cycle is not slowing down any time soon.","Donald trump’s old taylor swift post resurfaces after fans boo him at the commanders and lions game.

Why was Mariam Cisse, the Malian TikTok star, publicly executed in Tonka?





Mariam Cisse was a young TikTok star from Tonka, a small town in northern Mali. She was loved online for her fun and simple videos showing daily life in her community. But things took a dark turn last week when she was kidnapped while live on TikTok. According to AFP and Free Press Journal, armed men accused her of helping the Malian army by sharing details about their movements.They took her away, and the next day, in a horrifying scene, she was brought back and shot dead in Tonka’s Independence Square, in front of her family and hundreds of people. Mariam Cisse had over 95,000 followers on TikTok. Her videos often showed her smiling, dancing, or wearing Malian army outfits to show support for soldiers fighting jihadists.On Thursday, Mariam Cisse was live-streaming from a fair in Tonka when armed men suddenly arrived. Free Press Journal reported that the men accused her of “informing the army of jihadist movements.”Her brother told AFP that they forced her onto a motorbike and took her away. He said, “They accused her of helping the army. The next day, they brought her back and shot her in Independence Square. I was in the crowd.”Locals told Seneweb that she was first taken outside Tonka and then returned the next day for a public killing meant to scare others from supporting the army.Witnesses said the militants wanted to “teach a lesson” to anyone who posted online in favor of the government.Mariam Cisse became well-known in Mali through her short TikTok clips. She shared small bits of her daily life, cooking, jokes, dancing, and local traditions. But her videos also sometimes showed her in military clothes, smiling and supporting Malian soldiers.

The fine line between innovation and spectacle





In a region where rain is rare and water more precious than oil, the United Arab Emirates once had its sights set on an audacious engineering marvel: towing a gigantic Antarctic iceberg to its sun-baked coast to quench thirst, summon clouds, and maybe even reshape climate patterns. But as of 2025, the only glacier ice that has made it to Dubai is not floating off the coast but chilling highball glasses in rooftop bars, courtesy of a boutique Greenland startup.Launched in 2017 by the National Advisor Bureau Limited, a private Abu Dhabi-based company, the UAE Iceberg Project sought to tow a massive tabular iceberg, measuring roughly 2 kilometers long by 500 meters wide, from Antarctica to Fujairah, a coastal emirate on the Gulf of Oman.The logic, according to Abdulla Alshehi, the firm’s managing director and the project’s chief architect, was straightforward: an average iceberg holds over 20 billion gallons of fresh water, enough to supply 1 million people for five years. “This is the purest water in the world,” he told Gulf News in 2017. And the UAE, consuming 15% of the world’s desalinated water and facing depleting groundwater within 15 years, was in no position to ignore unconventional ideas.The iceberg, selected via satellite near Heard Island in the Southern Ocean, would undertake a 12,000-kilometer (≈6,480 nautical miles), 10-month journey across the Southern, Indian, and Arabian Seas to reach the coast of Fujairah in the UAE. Towed by large ocean-going vessels, it would travel northward through the Indian Ocean before entering the Gulf of Oman.Upon arrival, it would be stationed roughly 3 kilometers off Fujairah’s coast. Harvesting would begin immediately, with the aim of extracting potable water within two to three months before significant melting occurs. Computer simulations commissioned by the company projected that up to 30% of the iceberg’s mass could be lost during the journey, a challenge the team hopes to mitigate by timing its arrival during the UAE’s winter season, when sea temperatures are lower and melting would slow.To prevent breakup during the long journey, Alshehi’s firm developed a patent-pending metal belt, a kind of reinforced corset designed to hold the iceberg intact against wave stress and temperature gradients. In 2020, the UK Intellectual Property Office granted Alshehi a patent for his invention, called the ""Iceberg Reservoirs"" system. The patent was promoted as a credibility boost to attract investment and reinforce the project's technical feasibility.A pilot project, costed between $60–80 million, was announced for 2019. A smaller iceberg was to be towed to Cape Town or Perth as proof of concept. The full UAE project carried a price tag of $100–150 million.Despite a splashy website launch (www.icebergs.world), promises of scientific panels, and a vision of global humanitarian water relief, no trial was ever confirmed to have taken place. As of 2025, there’s been no operational progress, no updated logistics, and no official cancellation, just prolonged silence.What made the proposal especially memorable was its near-mystical secondary goal: climate engineering. Alshehi claimed that the presence of a colossal iceberg floating off the UAE coast could induce localized weather changes.“Cold air gushing from an iceberg close to the Arabian Sea would cause a trough and rainstorms,” he told local media. The iceberg, he argued, could “create a vortex” that would attract clouds from across the region, generating year-round rain for the desert interior. This, he claimed, could help reverse desertification and transform arid landscapes into lush, green areas, with benefits for agriculture, biodiversity, and the broader ecosystem.Meteorologists weren’t sold. While some acknowledged localized effects, like minor cloud formation due to temperature differentials, experts like Linda Lam from Weather.com said sustained, regional rainstorms were unlikely due to the complex nature of atmospheric dynamics.The UAE’s acute water issues form the bedrock of the project’s rationale. The country experiences a paltry 120 millimeters of rainfall annually, and according to a 2015 Associated Press report, its groundwater could be fully depleted within 15 years. Meanwhile, the Gulf states have among the highest water usage rates in the world: around 500 liters per person per day.Desalination, though critical, is energy-intensive, costly, and environmentally damaging. Alshehi warned of desalination plants pumping concentrated brine back into the Gulf, increasing salinity and harming marine life. His iceberg initiative, he claimed, would be not only cheaper in the long run but eco-friendlier, despite concerns about dragging a 100,000-year-old ice mass across the globe.He asserted that environmental impact assessments had been conducted, and results suggested minimal disruption to ecosystems,though no independent third-party review was ever published.While Alshehi’s Antarctic ambitions appear stalled in bureaucratic limbo, a smaller, scrappier company in Greenland has quietly realized a modest version of his vision,not as a humanitarian water source, but as luxury indulgence.Founded in 2022 by Greenlandic entrepreneurs, Arctic Ice ships ice harvested from Greenland’s fjords to high-end bars and restaurants in Dubai. Their first commercial shipment, around 22 metric tonnes, arrived recently, offering the “cleanest H₂O on Earth” to be shaved into ice cubes for cocktails, ice baths, and facial massages in Dubai’s spas.The process is artisanal: Using a crane-equipped boat, workers collect naturally calved icebergs from the Nuup Kangerlua fjord near Nuuk. Only the clearest, bubble-free ice, locally known as “black ice,” is selected. These are believed to be over 100,000 years old, having never touched soil or contaminants.Each chunk is cut with sanitized chainsaws, stored in food-grade insulated crates, and sampled for lab analysis to screen for ancient microorganisms or harmful bacteria. The ice is shipped via refrigerated containers aboard cargo ships already returning empty from Greenland, minimizing additional emissions. The second leg, from Denmark to Dubai, completes the frozen supply chain.Despite the company’s carbon-neutral commitment, backlash has been fierce. Critics online lambast the concept as “climate dystopia,” arguing that glacial ice should not be commodified, especially given the accelerating melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Co-founder Malik V. Rasmussen says some messages have verged on death threats.Still, Arctic Ice insists it is creating economic opportunity for a financially dependent Greenland, where 55% of the budget is subsidized by Denmark. “We make all our money from fish and tourism,” Rasmussen said. “I’ve always wanted to find something else we can profit from.”Both projects,the giant iceberg tow from Antarctica and the boutique glacier cubes from Greenland, highlight a pressing tension: how far will humanity go to secure water, and at what cost?Alshehi’s vision is bold but fraught with logistical and ethical challenges. Icebergs aren’t endlessly renewable, and towing them across hemispheres feels more sci-fi than sustainable.Arctic Ice’s venture, meanwhile, has found a controversial niche,combining novelty, luxury, and symbolism. In a time of climate anxiety, it offers an icy illusion of control, frozen fragments of a melting world, crafted into cocktail spheres.Whether climate solution or spectacle, these ideas raise key questions: Who owns natural ice? Can it be harvested responsibly? And as water scarcity grows, how do we balance local needs with global care?For now, the UAE’s giant iceberg remains a dream deferred, and Dubai’s cocktails are as cold as ever, just sourced from a little farther north, and in smaller, sparkling doses.","The uae iceberg project planned to tow a massive antarctic iceberg 6,480 nautical miles to fujairah.

What is a Presidential Challenge Coin?

More coverage on the NFL:

Margo Martin, Special Assistant to the President and Communications Advisor, shared a touching video capturing a young Jayden Daniels fan’s unforgettable moment with President Donald Trump . As Trump exited Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, a crowd of supporters gathered around him. Spotting a boy in a Jayden Daniels jersey, number 5 gleaming on his back, Trump called him over and presented him with a Presidential Challenge Coin. The boy, dressed in grey cargo pants and a Commanders cap, approached the President with wide eyes and awe. He shook Trump’s hand and said, “Thank you, Mr. President. I’m honored.” It was a memory sure to last a lifetime. When FOX News’ Nick Sortor posted the video on X, one fan quickly remarked, “Say what you want, but Trump knows how to connect with people in a way that feels genuine.”As the young fan received a challenge coin from the US President, the crowd’s reactions poured in, each more heartfelt than the last. One fan delighted in the boy’s playful display, noting how he flexed his muscles with pride on his way back. Another marveled at the boy’s courage, praising his confident handshake and eye contact with President Trump, and commending his parents for raising such a respectful young man.Others reflected on the significance of the moment, suggesting that while the coin itself might fade from memory, the feeling of being truly seen would last a lifetime. Fans agreed that gestures like these can leave a powerful, lasting impression on young people, regardless of politics, and that this boy would carry the memory with him forever.Watching the heartwarming moment when a young fan received a challenge coin from the US President, fans quickly shared their reactions. One noticed how the boy flexed his muscles after getting the coin, saying, “That boy flexed on his way back good boy there.” Another admired the boy’s courage, saying, “WOW! What an amazing young man. He stuck his hand out, made eye contact while he spoke to President Trump, and shook his hand. Well done, Mom and Dad.” A third fan added, “Kudos to the parents for raising a respectful young man!”A fourth reflected on the memory, “Every man has a moment in life when he is no longer just a child. A moment of recognition. A moment when someone respected by millions looks directly at him This boy will not remember the coin. He will remember that he was seen.” A fifth praised the kid, saying, “Seems like a very respectful kid. I would’ve been star struck and stood there like a child and asked a series of questions with intertwined compliments until the secret service shoved me away. ” Another said this gesture would stay with the boy forever, “Such gestures can definitely leave a lasting impression, especially on young people. To experience such a meaningful moment firsthand is something they’ll remember. Regardless of political views, personal gestures like this often have a powerful impact.”A US Presidential Challenge Coin is a small medallion presented by the President as a personal sign of appreciation, recognition, and honor for an individual’s service or achievements. The tradition has its roots in military history and was officially adopted by the White House during the Bill Clinton administration. President Donald Trump gave a Presidential Challenge Coin to a young fan on Sunday at the Washington Commanders game against the Detroit Lions. Trump is the first sitting U.S. President to attend a regular-season NFL game since 1978. At halftime, he swore in military recruits amid boos from parts of the 60,000-strong crowd and cheers from supporters. He also received a custom jersey from team owner Josh Harris. The event was part of the NFL’s Salute to Service, where veterans were honored.","Video shows president donald trump personally giving presidential challenge coin to young nfl fan at sunday's commanders vs. lions game.

Internet's venting session



Several X users said the optics were “detached from reality.” One wrote: “Travelling by private jet to a conference about climate change is a level of detachment from reality that’s impossible to grasp.” Others slammed the climate conference COP30 itself, pointing out the number of VIP flights heading to Brazil: “Hundreds of private jets from around the world are descending on Belém to talk about climate change and ways to restrict your free movement. If this makes sense to you, you’re part of the problem.” Another user wrote: “Private jet to come lecture on carbon emissions. Thirteen kilometres of the Amazon destroyed for this entitled lazy man to come lecture and take pics on the beach.” Others mocked the idea he was “preparing his speech,” joking that he was probably reading it for the first time after aides wrote it. Some comments also tied the criticism to recent tensions around the monarchy, noting that William’s trip comes as the royal family continues facing public scrutiny over Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and his past links with Jeffrey Epstein.





Prince William’s visit to Brazil for his Earthshot Prize has stirred a row, with social media accusing him of hypocrisy over his carbon footprint.The Prince of Wales travelled roughly 8,800 kilometres to Rio de Janeiro for this year’s Earthshot events, which are being held just days before the COP30 climate conference begins in Belém.The Earthshot Prize awards £1 million to each of five innovative climate solutions, with ceremonies held on different continents. This year’s stop in Rio was meant to showcase global climate leadership and tie into the messaging around COP30. William arrived in the city last week and was handed the ceremonial keys to Rio.According to Newsweek, William's flew commercially, with support from Earthshot and the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. But the details of the travel didn’t stop backlash. The posts attacked the Prince closely, with a long-running debate around Prince Harry’s use of private jets.","The prince of wales is in rio de janeiro for the earthshot prize.

Sergio Gor Calls Meeting With PM Modi 'Incredible', Says ‘Trump Considers Him Great Friend’





US president Donald Trump will be swearing in ambassador-designate to New Delhi Sergio Gor in the Oval Office on Monday amid growing disquiet among foreign policy boffins about his erratic policies they say have damaged ties with a range of allies including India.The White House schedule lists Gor’s swearing in for 3 pm EST (1.30 am IST) after Trump hosts Syrian president Ahmed al‑Sharaa, a former al Qaeda leader formally listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist till recently, signaling a major US policy shift in the region.Removed from the terrorism watchlist, Sharaa arrived in Washington DC over the weekend and was spotted playing basketball with security personnel even as other US allies are jumping through hoops to appease the US president’s fixation with tariffs and trade imbalances, among other piques.Presidential involvement in ambassador swear-ins is rare and exceptional, not the norm. The standard practice is for the vice president to administer the oath of office to newly confirmed ambassadors, typically at the vice president's ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building or occasionally at the State Department.But Trump administering oath of office to Gor is seen as more as a reflection of the envoy’s closeness to the president than the importance he attaches to India, a country he has repeatedly twitted and taunted in recent times with both his policies, notably on tariffs, and his enthusiastic outreach to Pakistan and China, and his abrasive remarks.Gor has already visited New Delhi on a recce as ambassador-designate and will head back to try and steady, if not salvage what many experts say is a trainwreck caused by Trump’s haphazard policies that often talks up his personal ties with Prime Minister Modi while inflicting serious damage to ties with India with punitive measures. Trade and foreign policy analysts like Raymond Vickery and David Price have excoriated the president for a transactional approach they say has eroded trust, harming ties that took more than half a century to rebuild after the 1970s fiasco.“Pakistan has a tariff of 19% and India has a 50% tariff. Where is the friendship between Modi and Trump that was extolled? It is a slap in the face for Modi because the Indian opposition is asking him where’s the friendship,” former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said at a Chicago thinktank event last week. While the two countries could arrive at a trade agreement soon, Rajan warned that the US risked losing India’s trust because “these things stay long in people’s mind,"" despite all the talk of military alignment between the two countries. The partnership was most recently reiterated in talks between the defence establishments of the two countries and the signing of a ten-year defense framework agreement by defence minister Rajnath Singh and US defense secretary Pete Hegseth.However, Trump’s repeated reference to a G-2 formulation with regards to China, a country US analysts say he has virtually surrendered to on the trade issue, and his disdain for the G-20, whose annual meeting in South Africa later this month he is avoiding, has alarmed foreign policy experts who say his moves make no sense. The US president also appears to have put the Quad, a grouping of US, India, Japan, and Australia, on the backburner, abandoning a leadership summit India was to have hosted in November.In a commentary headlined Trump’s incoherent foreign policy defies explanation, Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relation, said the US president’s pronouncements are so often unexpected and disconnected from reality that they leave foreign policy scholars, and foreign leaders, bewildered. He pointed to Trump’s recent outbursts against South Africa, Venezuela, and Nigeria among other countries to maintain that his decisions are based on a whim, often driven by disinformation, and the purpose could simply be “to keep the world off balance and to keep the spotlight on him. ”","Us president donald trump will be swearing in ambassador-designate to new delhi sergio gor in the oval office on monday.

Amid continuous glare on his professional and personal life, FBI director Kash Patel has now been accused of being unpredictable, unreliable, and unprofessional while dealing with other intelligence allies like MI5, the New York Times reported, citing several incidents. Patel has recently been in the news for his overuse of FBI jet for personal visits that involved his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins, who faces vicious trolling as people call her an 'Israeli spy' who 'honeytrapped' Kash.Kash Patel visited London along with Alexis for work, the report said, detailing several awkward points that took place there. It was a secret event codenamed 'Gold Sycamore"" held in the Sussex countryside. All dignitaries were scheduled to land at Stansted Airport outside London, but Patel wanted to fly to an airport closer to hotel. The request was denied.Patel wanted his security detail to be armed but the UK Police, because of its strict gun-control laws, did not allow Patel's security to be armed.The NYT report cited a former US official to report that the Patel surprised many attendees of a meeting in London where he arrived wearing a trucker hat and a green hooded sweatshirt which was not unexpected of him, as he often breaks FBI tradition by not wearing a suit.MI5 chief Ken McCallum reportedly asked Patel to keep the job of an FBI agent based in London with a tech-based role as MI5 needs FBI's help for high-tech surveillance tools. Patel told McCallum that he would not axe the post but the post had already been axed by that time. It is not clear whether Patel did ot know it because the report claimed that Patel was briefed specifically about it before he left for London.The report mentioned another frivolous move by Patel when he and Alexis joined the other security and intelligence officials for a dinner at Windsor Palace with King Charles III.

Amid the ongoing Christian-Hinduism controversy, Nalin Haley , the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family. In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion. Vice President JD Vance recently said he would like to see his wife Usha Vance converted to Christianity.Though JD clarified that Usha Vance has no intention of converting, the episode showed how MAGA is Christian nationalists at core and unapologetic about it.Haley said he chose his political path too in a similar fashion.

Billionaire Peter Thiel on how Zohran Mamdani's win is a warning for both Republicans and Democrats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-peter-thiel-on-how-zohran-mamdanis-win-is-a-warning-for-both-republicans-and-democrats/articleshow/125199151.cms,"HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor





Billionaire investor and PayPal founder Peter Thiel has called the election victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as New York City’s new mayor a sign of deep voter frustration — and a wake-up call for both major political parties in the United States. In comments made to The Free Press recently, Thiel said the results reflect growing disillusionment among younger Americans who feel capitalism is no longer working for them. He warned that ignoring issues like housing affordability and student debt could push more voters toward candidates with radical or left-wing economic ideas.“When 70% of Millennials say they are pro-socialist, we need to do better than simply dismiss them by saying that they are stupid or entitled or brainwashed; we should try and understand why,” Thiel wrote in an email to tech leaders including Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Andreessen five years ago — an email that resurfaced online after Mamdani’s win.Thiel said that strict zoning laws and construction limits have benefited older generations who saw their property values rise, but hurt younger people locked out of home ownership.“If you proletarianize the young people, you shouldn’t be surprised if they eventually become communist,” he said.He added that many millennials and Gen Z voters aren’t necessarily ideological socialists but rather disillusioned with the economic system.“It’s more just: ‘Capitalism doesn’t work for me. Or, this thing called capitalism is just an excuse for people ripping you off,’” Thiel said.Political experts say Mamdani’s win underscores how rising living costs are reshaping voter priorities. Pollster Frank Luntz told The Free Press that affordability — not just inflation — has become the defining issue for many Americans, regardless of political party.Thiel echoed that view, saying people are now looking for bold ideas, not small policy fixes. “Incremental attempts haven’t worked,” he said, suggesting that both parties need to take the affordability crisis more seriously.Peter Thiel also reflected on America’s aging population, saying that if socialism does gain ground, it may look different from past revolutions.“If the U.S. becomes socialist, it will be more of an old people’s socialism than a young people’s socialism, where it’s more about free healthcare or something like that,” he said. “The word ‘revolution’ sounds pretty high testosterone and youthful. And today, if it’s a revolution, it’s 70-something grandmothers.”",Billionaire investor and paypal founder peter thiel has called the election victory of democratic socialist zohran mamdani as new york city’s new mayor a sign of deep voter frustration.
