However, the US state department's sudden interest in the rebel group, particularly its subsidiary Majeed Brigade, has raised eyebrows and sparked curiosity about possible motivations.The development comes close on the heels of US President Donald Trump announcing his plans to develop 'massive oil reserves' with Pakistan. The announcement attracted a response from Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch, who said that reserves of oil, natural gas, copper, lithium, uranium and rare earths were not located in actual Pakistan and belonged to ""Republic of Balochistan"". Baloch wrote an open letter to Trump warning him that he was misled about ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan by army chief Asim Munir.The visits to Pakistan by Gentry Beach, a close college friend of President Trump's son Donald Trump Jr, have also piqued curiosity, with the latter seeing a potential to cut deals worth billions of dollars in explorations of rare earth minerals, oil and gas, and real estate. A recent deal that Pakistan negotiated with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture in which the Trump family has a 60% stake, has also fuelled speculation.Though it had its roots founded in the 70s, the Majeed Brigade was a little-known entity until a decade ago. The brigade comprises fidayeen (suicide bombers) who have been fighting the Pakistan-China collaboration opposed to its freedom struggle. ""It was in the 1970s that Abdul Majeed Baloch carried out a failed assassination bid on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former Pakistan PM who dismissed the National Awami Party's govt in Balochistan,"" recalled a source.However, it was in 2010-11 that the brigade was formally constituted in the memory of Abdul Majeed. Since then, the brigade has carried out numerous suicide attacks against Pakistani security forces and Chinese nationals working for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects in Balochistan and Sindh. The attacks have intensified since 2018. Their most lethal hit was on the Jaffar Express, in which BLA claimed it eliminated 214 Pak military personnel.",The balochistan liberation army (bla) surprisingly evaded being labelled as a foreign terrorist organisation (fto) until now.

So, Is It Bye-Bye America?

Three Things To Note For India

Just a year ago, it would perhaps have taken a big leap of faith for PM Narendra Modi to travel to China. The two countries’ relationship was still on ventilator. The border was relatively quiet, but disengagement of troops at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh was still incomplete.Now, as Modi gets ready to visit Tianjin later this month, it seems the most unambivalent thing to do, grounded in a realistic understanding of global uncertainties and the need to reinforce its multialignment.It helps, of course, that the agreement Modi reached with President Xi Jinping on the margins of the Brics summit in Oct — that disputes and differences would not be allowed to disturb border peace — has remained unimpaired. While India’s official announcement is awaited, Modi’s visit is all but certain; so is Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s to India next week for talks with NSA Ajit Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar Granted, Modi’s visit is for a multilateral event: the summit meeting of the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation), a 10-member security-oriented Eurasian grouping dominated by China and Russia, seen as a potential counterweight to Nato. Modi’s last visit to China, in 2018, was also for the SCO summit.Given the state of its ties with China and Pakistan, India is a bit of an outlier in the group, as it doesn’t join others in endorsing initiatives like the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative).In 2023, it also backed out of an economic roadmap as it seemed more aligned with Chinese interests. More recently, India also refused to sign on to a joint statement condemning Israel’s attack on Iran.However, India acknowledges SCO’s role in combating terrorism, particularly in Afghanistan, promoting connectivity that doesn’t undermine sovereignty and territorial integrity, and facilitating its own ties with Central Asia. Modi has used the SCO Heads of State Council meeting, the highest decision-making body of the organisation, to draw attention to cross-border terrorism, without naming Pakistan.SCO has also had an important role to play in bringing India and China together. Russia may not have actively mediated between India and China, but it has nudged both sides to use the forum to engage with each other after 2020’s Galwan clash.The Moscow Consensus, within three months of Galwan — on the margins of the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in the Russian capital — to ease tensions is a case in point. President Xi Jinping in 2023 also participated in the SCO summit Modi hosted virtually under India’s presidency.However, Modi has also skipped SCO summit meetings. He missed one in Kazakhstan last year. If Modi is travelling to China, it’s because he understands the salience Xi has attached to the Tianjin summit under China’s presidency, prioritising it over Brics this year, and the need to normalise a relationship that he believes is important not just for India and China, but the entire world. Support from China will also be crucial for India’s Brics presidency next year.Trump’s foreign policy has wrongfooted India but, to be fair to the Indian govt, India and China started to rebuild ties long before the US president sent the world careening towards an apocalyptic trade war. In fact, the agreement to end the military standoff in eastern Ladakh happened even before the US presidential elections.By visiting China, Modi is signalling that India is ready to have a sound working relationship with Beijing — as long as border peace and tranquillity is not disturbed. When NSA Doval visited China last Dec, both sides agreed to maintain peace on the ground so that “issues on the border do not hold back the normal development of bilateral relations”.India has not allowed China’s military cooperation with Pakistan — even after Operation Sindoor — to ruin the Sino-Indian thaw, and Beijing was muted in its criticism of India’s first joint patrolling of the South China Sea with the Philippines, suggesting a readiness from both sides to take a long view of the relationship. Modi’s bilateral meeting with Xi, which might see important announcements (such as the resumption of direct flights), is an opportunity for both sides to rebuild trust for a mutually beneficial partnership in areas like trade, investment and emerging technologies, in which China is a global leader.India will expect China to reciprocate by addressing some of its trade restrictions related to manpower and equipment that impact Indian manufacturing, and deliver on the promise to import more to reduce the $100 billion trade deficit. India will also be mindful of China’s efforts to undercut its influence in the neighbourhood and the larger Indo-Pacific. China will expect, as ambassador Xu Feihong toldrecently, a transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for its companies.The dragon-elephant tango may have just started but, in these circumstances, it will remain accident-prone. The way the relationship has peaked and troughed from the initial Modi years to the Doklam crisis, and again from the excitement over the informal summits to the Galwan despair, serves as an important lesson. The answer probably lies in Modi’s recent remark, quickly endorsed by Beijing, that competition should not be allowed to turn into conflict.Not really. Modi has, in the past, attended several SCO summits where he has met Xi — and all it has signified is India’s strategic autonomy. His upcoming visit to China is drawing more attention because of the state of India’s ties with the US.India and the US seemed set to embark on a new phase in the relationship, based on robust and next-generation defence and technology collaborations, along with stronger energy ties, when Trump dropped his tariff bomb, doubling the levy on India for its oil imports from Russia.But it will probably take more than one individual, even if he’s the US president, to do any structural damage to a relationship successive American presidents have called one of the most defining partnerships of the 21st century.Amid calls for India to take on the Trump administration, the govt itself has chosen to avoid confrontation. Trump is known to take maximalist positions ahead of trade agreements, and India is still willing to negotiate. India’s statement that the relationship has weathered such challenges in the past has been received well by the US State Department. The visit to China registers India’s position against Western unilateralism, but India is not giving up on America yet. A possible return of peace in Ukraine can also wipe out half of India’s tariff woes.There are three things India will guard against, though. The first is whether Trump, chasing a watershed trade deal with China, will remain as committed to the Indo-Pacific as he was during his previous term, when he revived Quad. The tariff issue has cast a shadow on the upcoming Quad summit India has to host in early Nov. If Trump doesn’t come, there will be questions raised about the US’s long-standing policy of dealing with India as a country that can ensure a sustainable balance of power in the region. India’s efforts to restore ties with China help it hedge against this eventuality.Second is the strong counterterrorism cooperation that will likely be diluted by Trump’s remarkable turnaround on Pakistan — from accusing it of hoodwinking US presidents on the issue of terrorism to treating it as a lodestar in the fight against the menace. Re-hyphenating India with Pakistan can potentially cause irreparable damage to relations with India.Third is the impending H-1B overhaul, and the likely impact on Indian professionals in the IT and healthcare sectors. This is sure to ignite another diplomatic firestorm, damaging people-to-people contacts and what India sees as a mutually beneficial economic and technology partnership.All three are issues that will test India’s resolve and push the limits of Indian diplomacy.","Pm narendra modi is set to visit tianjin later this month for the sco summit.

Orca ATTACK VIDEO: After Jessica Radcliffe, Kayaker’s Unexpected Sea Encounter Goes Viral

Actual orca attacks, genuine tragedies







A video that is now going viral on social media shows a marine trainer named Jessica Radcliffe allegedly being attacked and killed by an orca, sparking widespread concerns. The footage seems to capture a violent incident at a marine park during a live show.Fact-checking investigations have since confirmed that such an event never took place, and there are no official records, news reports, or credible sources confirming the existence of Jessica Radcliffe or the alleged attack.Experts quoted by IB Times say that the clip itself is AI-generated, highlighting how quickly misinformation can spread and the challenges faced while debunking false information once it gains momentum.The clip’s central claim is that Radcliffe was attacked by an Orca during a live show. However, fact-checkers from sources like Vocal Media found no trace of a person named Jessica Radcliffe in marine park employment records, credible news reports, or public databases.Official marine safety records showed no evidence of such an incident, reports IB Times.There are several versions of the video circulating on social media that are made in a way to amplify emotional response and improve traction.The hoax seems to draw on elements from actual incidents involving orcas and their trainers, reports IB Times.A 40-year-old trainer, Dawn Brancheau, died in 2010 after a killer whale, Tilikum, pulled her into the pool at SeaWorld, Orlando, reports CBS News.In a similar incident, Spanish trainer Alexis Martinez was also killed at a marine park located on Tenerife.What makes the video feel believable is the fact that real-life incidents involving orcas and their trainers have occurred. One of the most well-known cases is the death of senior SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was killed by an orca named Tilikum during a live performance in Orlando. This tragic event later became the focus of the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which ignited widespread controversy over the ethics of keeping orcas in captivity.",A video that is now going viral on social media shows a marine trainer named jessica radcliffe allegedly being attacked and killed by an orca.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit the United States in September for the United Nations General Assembly meeting, which is to take place in New York City.According to the provisional list of speakers for the high-level debate of the 80th session of the General Assembly, India’s “Head of Government (HG)” will address the session on the morning of September 26, reported news agency PTI.The Heads of Government of Israel, China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are also scheduled to address the UNGA general debate on the same day. PM Modi 's visit to New York, if it takes place, will come at a time when the US has bumped up tariffs on New Delhi to 50 per cent for purchasing Russian crude oil, which US President Donald Trump claimed has ""fueled"" Moscow's war with Ukraine.On August 6, Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on most imports from India for buying Russian oil. Coming on top of the 25 per cent tariff he already announced, the additional tariff is set to bring the taxes on goods and products India exports to the US to 50 per cent if fully implemented.rump not only doubled down on tariffs but also announced a penalty on India for purchasing Russian military equipment.The executive order signed by Trump, citing threats to US national security because of India's purchase of oil from Russia, goes into effect on August 27, providing a three-week window of opportunity to negotiate an agreement.India responded strongly to Trump's move to impose an additional 25 per cent tariff. The ministry of external affairs in a statement called the US move unfortunate and reiterated its stand that India would continue to protect its national interests.In a strongly worded statement, the MEA said, ""..it is extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest.""However, amid the tariff row, a US trade delegation is expected to visit India before August 25.Meanwhile, Trump will be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska."" ""Further details to follow. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he added.Putin’s trip to Alaska will be his first to the US in a decade. The last time Russia’s leader was in the country for a meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2015 with then-President Barack Obama.The announcement came just hours after Trump told reporters he planned to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine with Putin. The President expressed cautious optimism, saying he believes “we have a shot” at brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.The 80th session of the UNGA will open on September 9.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has welcomed an international court's ruling interpreting design criteria for new run-of-river hydropower projects on the Western Rivers (Chenab, Jhelum and Indus), to be built by India, saying it vindicates its position on the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which India put in abeyance after the Pahalgam attack.India, however, has never recognised the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which reportedly ruled that India must ""let flow"" the waters of the Western Rivers for Pakistan's unrestricted use. India has instead focused on the neutral expert mechanism.""The specified exceptions for generation of hydro-electric plants must conform strictly to the requirements laid down in the treaty, rather than to what India might consider an 'ideal' or 'best practices' approach,"" Pakistan's foreign office said Monday.While India's official response is expected Wednesday, sources recalled it had earlier notified modification of IWT amid prolonged disputes over Kishanganga and Ratle projects in J&K. India never accepted World Bank's decision to simultaneously activate both neutral expert mechanism and, at Pakistan's insistence, Court of Arbitration on the same issues - the reason it sought reconsideration of the treaty's dispute resolution process.In Oct 2022, World Bank appointed both a neutral expert and a Court of Arbitration despite acknowledging India's concerns that concurrent proceedings posed practical and legal challenges.Following Monday's ruling, Pakistan reiterated its commitment to implementing IWT and urged India to resume functioning of the same.

DGCA warns Air India on pilot duty violations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-warns-air-india-on-pilot-duty-violations/articleshow/123290601.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has warned Air India against misusing exemptions given for pilot flight duty rules under special circumstances. After Pakistan had closed its airspace to Indian carriers on April 24, 2025, the regulator had granted an exemption from flight duty time limitation (FDTL) norms so that Air India could continue its affected flights between the West and India.However under the pretext of this exemption allowing it to keep pilots flying longer, Air India reduced the number of cockpit crew from the unaffected Bengaluru-London flight - which didn't enter Pakistan airspace - from three to two on two flights. A livid regulator pulled up AI for what a senior official described as ""oversmartness"". This FDTL exemption ended June 12, the day AI 171 crashed.Nine days after the Ahmedabad crash, the DGCA had issued AI a show-cause for operating two Bengaluru-London flights on May 16 and 17 by making pilots fly for longer than the 10 hours allowed as per the FDTL given to AI at that point of time.On Aug 11, the DGCA told AI that its ""response to (that) show-cause notice has been duly examined and found to be unsatisfactory in addressing the regulatory lapses and deficiencies noted"".It also noted that the airline's ""accountable manager (CEO Campbell Wilson) failed to ensure compliance with the rules"". ""Accordingly, the accountable manager of AI is hereby warned and advised to exercise utmost diligence and responsibility in ensuring strict compliance with the applicable civil aviation requirements (DGCA rules),"" the DGCA warning letter said.For its part, an AI spokesperson said: ""AI is in receipt of the DGCA letter with regard to rostering issues on two long-haul flights reported in mid-May that arose due to a different interpretation of a permission that was granted to mitigate the border-related airspace closure. This was corrected immediately after the right interpretation was conveyed to us.

NEW DELHI: In his bellicose speech where he threatened to nuke India, Pakistan army chief Asim Munir put a target on Reliance Industries Ltd's refinery - world's largest single-site refining complex - at Jamnagar in Gujarat in case of any future military conflict with New Delhi, indicating for the first time the intent to hit India's economic assets, especially oil installations.Speaking at a formal dinner at Tampa, Florida, in the US, Munir referred to a social media post with a Quranic verse along with the picture of RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani to say he authorised it during the recent conflict with India ""to show them what we will do the next time"", media reports quoting those present at the closed-door event said.While this set off chatter about Munir threatening the richest Indian, with a net worth of over $115 billion heading the oil-to-telecom-to-retail conglomerate, narration in the verse from Surah Al-Fil (The Elephant), the 105th chapter of the Quran, can be interpreted as an aerial attack in modern warfare.According to open source information, the verse refers to the 'Year of the Elephant, approximately (570 CE), when Abraha, the ruler of Yemen, led an army with elephants to destroy the Kaaba. Allah then sent flocks of birds carrying stones of baked clay, which struck and destroyed Abraha's army.India continuously evaluates military and other threats to its sensitive economic installations, especially those located in border states or considered within range of Pakistan air attacks.In the past, there have been separate reports from intelligence agencies about threats to such installations, particularly the RIL refinery, from Pakistan-based terror groups.Munir chose Ambani to make his threat because the RIL chief symbolises India's economic power and potential. Though there are other oil installations and assets that may be considered vulnerable, the sheer size of the Jamnagar complex makes it the showstopper in India's refining sector with an annual capacity of processing 33 million tonnes of crude, or 12% of India's total refining capacity. It is a major exporter of refined petroleum products.",Pakistan army chief asim munir put a target on reliance industries ltd's refinery in case of any future military conflict with new delhi.

A mother's instinct kicks in as symptoms spark a race against time

Inside the emergency room where doctors worked swiftly to stabilise baby Capri

Family turmoil, NFL commitments, and the one update fans needed to hear

Global fanbase rallies around the family as messages of support pour in

A late-night dash to the emergency room turned into a wave of relief for Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill’s family when his eight-month-old daughter, Capri, was admitted with sudden alarming symptoms. The little girl, shared with Hill’s estranged wife Keeta Vaccaro, had grown unusually warm, lethargic, and “not herself.” Quick-thinking calls and faster medical hands helped her bounce back, with doctors now calling her recovery a ‘positive turn’.Keeta Vaccaro shared the moment every parent dreads — the instant one knows something isn’t right. In her Instagram update, she described noticing Capri’s heavy eyes and warm skin before rushing to phone pediatrician Dr. Jared Friedman. Within minutes, hospital doors swung open and nurses had her baby hooked up for tests. “Last night was scary,” she admitted, her words carrying the weight of those anxious hours.Hospital photos showed Capri, wrapped in a light orange gown, clutching her blanket like a shield. Keeta thanked Dr. Friedman for calming her in the chaos, recalling his text: “We got this. We are a Team!” Blood work and viral panels were done swiftly, each step explained gently so a worried mother could breathe.By sunrise, Capri’s temperature had settled, and she was responding to treatment with more alertness and strength.The scare comes just months after Keeta filed for divorce in April, with Capri’s November 2024 birth marking a bright chapter in an otherwise turbulent year. Hill, sidelined from a Dolphins practice by an undisclosed injury, has not confirmed if he was at the ER. Still, Capri’s life has been well documented on Keeta’s feed — from six-month milestones to Sunday church visits — proof that love can remain the anchor when life turns rough.As Keeta’s post spread, thousands of followers jumped in to comfort her. “Glad she is ok!” one wrote, while another shared, “Oh no!!! I’m glad she is feeling better!” A third simply said, “Thank God she’s ok.” For many parents, it was a story that hit home — that late-night terror, the helpless waiting, the relief of seeing your child smile again.From a panic-filled midnight to a hopeful morning, Capri’s quick recovery has become the only headline that matters for the Hills. And for those who have followed Keeta’s journey, the sight of her daughter resting peacefully is more than news — it’s a shared moment of gratitude. In times like this, the power of family love and the kindness of a supportive community feel more real than ever. Across the globe, fans continue to send prayers and warm wishes, reminding the young family they're not alone in this fight.Although Tyreek Hill and Keeta Vaccaro are separated and navigating a difficult divorce, their shared love for Capri remains the unbreakable bond that keeps them connected as family above all else. In every whispered prayer and hopeful glance toward the future, that love shines through- reminding us all that even in hardship, family endures.And for Keeta, that night will forever be proof that a mother's strength rises highest when her child needed her most. For Tyreek, it was a quiet remainder that fatherhood's truest measure came in moments of presence and care. Capri's smile the next morning was perhaps the clearest sign yet that brighter days were on their way- and that both her parents, despite everything, would always stand guard over her heart. In that shared love, they found a fragile but unbreakable hope that would guide them through whatever lay ahead.Together, they learned that love, even in its quietest forms, holds the power to heal wounds, mend fears, and light the darkest paths with unwavering faith. And in that simple truth, they discovered a strength deeper than any hardship-a love fierce enough to carry them through every storm. Their bond stood strong, a light through every storm and though their paths eventually diverged, its glow remains in the corners of their hearts.Also Read: Disney’s ESPN strikes landmark deal to buy NFL Network — league grabs 10% stake in blockbuster swap","Nfl star tyreek hill's baby capri rushed to er.

Flight attendants at Air Canada have voted overwhelmingly to strike this weekend, prompting the airline to issue a lockout notice and warn of major travel disruptions beginning Thursday.The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which represents the attendants nationwide, issued a strike notice, prompting Air Canada to respond with a 72-hour lockout notice effective August 16. According to the union, 99.7 per cent of its members supported the strike. It further added that operations will be suspended from Saturday until a labor agreement is reached.“For the past nine months, we have put forward solid, data-driven proposals on wages and unpaid work, all rooted in fairness and industry standards,” said Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada Component of CUPE. “Air Canada’s response to our proposals makes one thing clear: they are not interested in resolving these critical issues.”The airline said eight months of negotiations and an offer to go to arbitration failed to produce a deal. On August 11, it proposed a 38 per cent pay increase over four years, along with additional benefits and protections, but the union rejected the offer.Air Canada will begin winding down operations ahead of the lockout, with cancellations starting on August 14, increasing on August 15 and a full shutdown on August 16.The carrier operates about 430 daily flights between Canada and the US, serving more than 50 American airports and transports around 130,000 passengers each day, as reported by CNN.The union is demanding full pay for all hours worked, cost-of-living adjustments and boarding pay. These issue are currently under negotiation at US airlines, where attendants often are not compensated for boarding time.Canadian minister of jobs and families Patty Hajdu said in a statement that she has met with both parties and that federal mediators will remain engaged until a resolution is found. “I am closely monitoring the situation and encourage both parties to stay at the table until a deal is found,” her statement read.","Flight attendants at air canada have voted overwhelmingly to strike this weekend, prompting the airline to issue a lockout notice.

Quarter-Million dollar trail alleged by influencer

Private chats, secret accounts & resignations





Days after his viral Coldplay concert controversy forced him to resign, former Astronomer CEO Andy Byron is back in the spotlight over allegations that he spent over $250,000 (approx Rs 2.2 crore) on OnlyFans subscriptions, private content, and video calls with multiple creators, including popular influencer Sophie Rain, according to media outlet The Blast.Camilla Araujo, a Brazilian model and co-founder of the OnlyFans creator mansion Bop House, told the outlet that Byron's spending spree wasn’t limited to one creator.“I saw the receipts. We’re talking a quarter million in sub fees, custom content and video calls — not just with Sophie, with multiple girls,” she said.She also claimed several of the creators Byron interacted with were affiliated with her influencer house. Araujo reportedly reached out to Byron’s wife, Megan Kerrigan, offering her emotional support and urging solidarity. “I told her she’s not alone... I even invited her to come down to Miami to clear her mind,” she said.The fresh allegations follow the leak of private messages, reportedly shared by Byron’s wife - showing him using a secret Instagram (“finsta”) account to arrange explicit video calls with 23-year-old Sophie Rain. One message allegedly read:“All good.Most guys I talk to are married,” to which Rain responded, “Okay, call me in 5 mins [winky face].”Rain declined to confirm Byron as a client but said, “As a Christian, I don’t condone this kind of behaviour... I’m here for his wife if she needs someone to talk to.”Byron, 50, resigned after a viral video captured him cuddling HR chief Kristin Cabot, 52, during Coldplay’s “jumbotron” segment at a July 16 concert. Both were married to other people at the time.Coldplay frontman Chris Martin had commented, “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy,” prompting online backlash.Astronomer later confirmed both Byron and Cabot had stepped down, stating,“Our leaders are expected to set the standard... that standard was not met.”","Former astronomer ceo andy byron is back in the spotlight over allegations that he spent over $250,000 (approx rs 2.2 crore) on onlyfans subscriptions, private content, and video calls with multiple creators, including popular influencer sophie rain.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123190353,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-619584,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
