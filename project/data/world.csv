Congress also targeted PM Narendra Modi and BJP-RSS, alleging them of fomenting hatred and religious division and attacking the Constitution, and termed the law as part of the communal strategy of the governing party.Rahul also warned of an ""economic devastation"" in the wake of tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump . ""Modi did not utter a word and is missing till now... where is he hiding?"" he asked.Congress president Kharge said, ""Instead of preparing for future challenges, BJP is stoking 500-year-old issues to stoke communalism.

""Their ideology is against the Constitution, they want to end democracy, control all the institutions and give entire wealth to Adani and Ambani ,"" Rahul said. Kharge said, ""Modi will sell the country"".Interestingly, Rahul said only Congress has the ideology to fight and stop BJP and RSS, which other parties cannot, and argued that parties that don't have clarity or ideology cannot stand up to RSS-BJP - in what was an echo of his speech at the Udaipur 'chintan shivir' which riled allies.","Rahul gandhi warns of an ""economic devastation"" in the wake of tariffs imposed by us president donald trump.

EAM Jaishankar: India-China ties are now 'much better than before',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eam-jaishankar-india-china-ties-are-now-much-better-than-before/articleshow/120144629.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar said Wednesday India-China ties now are ""much better than before"" and moving in the right direction, but added there's still work to be done to normalise the relationship.The minister said that there's now a recognition of the fact that the situation that prevailed between 2020 and 2024 wasn't in the interest of the bilateral relationship.""It's obviously better than the last time I was here. I think the disengagement, particularly the Depsang-Demchok was important,"" he said speaking at a media event, adding that issues on the border remained to some extent because of the force build-up over a period of years.The Depsang-Demchok agreement last year in October completed the process of troop disengagement at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh, bringing to an end the military standoff that erupted in 2020. The border situation has since, as PM Modi said in a recent podcast, seen a return to normalcy even though the two sides have work to do for further de-escalation.""I think we are moving in the right direction,"" said the minister. ""But there were many other things which also happened during this period, some of it was a collateral of the situation; some of it was actually a carryover from the Covid era. For example, our direct flights stopped during Covid, they were not resumed. The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra stopped during Covid. It did not again resume. I think there is work to be done.

"After Yunus cosies up to China, India terminates trans-shipment facility for Bangladesh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-terminates-cargo-trans-shipment-to-bangladesh-in-sharp-rebuke-to-muhammad-yunus-landlocked-remark-china-and-northeast/articleshow/120126015.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has withdrawn a key trans-shipment facility granted to Bangladesh , days after the chief adviser of Bangladesh’s interim government, Muhammad Yunus , described India’s Northeast as a “landlocked” region reliant on Dhaka for access to the ocean — remarks that triggered strong diplomatic backlash.The decision, announced via a circular issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on April 8, effectively ends a 2020 arrangement that had allowed Bangladesh to route its export cargo to third countries through Indian Land Customs Stations and onward to ports and airports.“It has been decided to rescind... circular...dated June 29, 2020, as amended with immediate effect. Cargo already entered into India may be allowed to exit the Indian territory as per the procedure,” the circular mentioned.The facility had enabled smoother trade for Bangladesh to Bhutan, Nepal, and Myanmar. But Indian exporters, particularly in the apparel sector, had long objected to the arrangement. Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) Chairman Sudhir Sekhri earlier said that 20–30 Bangladeshi trucks arrived daily in Delhi, clogging cargo terminals and spiking freight costs.“Now we will have more air capacity for our cargo,” said FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai. “In the past, exporters have complained about lesser space due to the trans-shipment facility given to Bangladesh.”The move comes as global trade tensions rise, with the US recently announcing new tariffs on both India and Bangladesh.Trade experts say the cancellation will hit Bangladesh’s export logistics hard. “The previous mechanism had offered a streamlined route through India, cutting transit time and cost,” said Ajay Srivastava , founder of Global Trade Research Initiative, as quoted by PTI. “Now, without it, Bangladeshi exporters may face delays, higher costs, and uncertainty.”The geopolitical undertone became unavoidable after Yunus’ comments in Beijing, where he pitched Bangladesh as “the only guardian of the ocean” for Northeast India and invited China to deepen its economic presence in the region.“The eastern part of India, the Seven Sisters, are a landlocked region. They have no way to reach out to the ocean. This could be an extension of the Chinese economy,” Yunus had said.External affairs minister S Jaishankar swiftly countered the narrative, emphasizing India’s strategic maritime and regional links. “We have the longest coastline in the Bay of Bengal… Our North-Eastern region is emerging as a connectivity hub for BIMSTEC,” he said.With both countries being WTO members, Srivastava cautioned that India’s move may raise concerns over transit rights under WTO rules, especially for other landlocked nations like Nepal and Bhutan.","The decision effectively ends a 2020 arrangement that had allowed bangladesh to route its export cargo to third countries through indian land customs stations.

Tahawwur Rana extradited: What happens after 26/11 terror accused lands in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tahawwur-rana-extradited-what-happens-after-26/11-terror-accused-lands-in-india/articleshow/120135440.cms,"What happens when Rana lands in India?

Why Rana’s extradition matters

NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Hussain Rana , a key accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, will finally reach India after being extradited from the United States after over a decade of legal wrangling. A multi-agency Indian team is en route with Rana, and he is expected to land in India by Thursday afternoon, according to media reports citing sources.The 64-year-old Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman is accused of helping David Coleman Headley , his childhood friend and co-conspirator, carry out reconnaissance of targets later attacked by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists in 2008. The siege left 166 dead, including six American nationals, and lasted for nearly 60 hours.Upon arrival, Rana is likely to be produced before a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court at Patiala House in Delhi. The NIA is expected to seek custodial interrogation to confront him with evidence, including emails, travel records, and testimonies already collected.Officials believe Rana’s questioning could provide fresh leads on the involvement of Pakistani state actors in the attack. He may be lodged in a high-security cell in Tihar Jail, where security has already been tightened.India had earlier given assurances to US authorities regarding Rana’s safety, legal rights, and prison conditions—a key factor in securing his extradition.According to the NIA charge sheet filed in 2011, Rana was deeply involved in planning the 26/11 attacks. He allegedly helped Headley gain a visa to India and established a Mumbai office — 'Immigrant Law Centre' — as a cover for reconnaissance activities.The agency claims Rana not only knew of Headley’s terror affiliations but actively supported him. He accompanied his wife on a tour through multiple Indian cities — Hapur, Delhi, Agra, Kochi, Ahmedabad, and Mumbai — between November 13 and 21, 2008. During these visits, Headley made dozens of calls to Rana.Their collaboration extended to planning attacks on Chabad Houses and the National Defence College. Rana was also in touch with Major Iqbal , a suspected ISI officer and co-conspirator.Rana was arrested by the FBI in Chicago in 2009 for supporting a failed LeT plot in Copenhagen. Though acquitted of direct charges in the 26/11 attacks by a US court, he was convicted for other terror-related offences and sentenced to 14 years in prison.India has pursued his extradition since, filing a request and securing a Red Notice from Interpol. Rana resisted the process through multiple legal appeals, including two emergency stay applications this year—one each to US Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Chief Justice John Roberts. Both were denied.On April 7, the US Supreme Court formally rejected his last-ditch plea, stating simply: “Application denied by the Court.”The NIA hopes Rana’s interrogation will uncover more evidence about the network of conspirators, including LeT operatives Hafiz Saeed , Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Sajid Mir, and HuJI leaders like Illyas Kashmiri—some of whom are linked to Pakistan’s ISI.The NIA special court has issued non-bailable warrants against absconding accused and submitted letters rogatory to Pakistan, though no response has been received so far.The NIA had earlier retrieved trial records from a Mumbai court, consolidating the multi-city legal effort into one court to streamline prosecution.Rana’s arrival in India marks a major breakthrough in the 26/11 case, which had seen only partial justice with the 2012 hanging of Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving gunman from the attacks.With Rana in custody, India may be able to expose the operational and institutional links between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistani military-intelligence networks—potentially reopening diplomatic and legal pressure on Islamabad.As India prepares for what could be one of the most consequential terror trials in its history, the return of Tahawwur Rana has reignited hope that long-delayed justice may finally be served.","Tahawwur hussain rana, a key accused in the 26/11 mumbai terror attacks, will finally reach india after being extradited from the united states.

"26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana contacted David Coleman Headley 231 times in India, says dossier",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-mastermind-tahawwur-rana-contacted-david-coleman-headley-231-times-in-india-says-dossier/articleshow/120140513.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Rana , one of the main plotters of the 2008 Mumbai attack, had contacted David Coleman Headley 231 times during his visits to India ahead of the 26/11 carnage, according to the Indian dossier on him. Rana conducted eight reconnaissance missions and the highest number of calls (66) were made during the final visit before the attack.According to the dossier, Rana and Headley, along with other operatives, had mapped other targets in India, including National Defence College and India Gate in Delhi and multiple Jewish centres, as part of their plan to carry out spectacular terror attacks. NIA's chargesheet on him details Rana, along with Headley, Hafeez Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Ilyas Kashmiri, Sajid Mir and Major Iqbal, among others, had conspired to orchestrate the attack.Investigation by both India and US confirmed that Rana's Chicago-based immigration firm - First World Immigration Services, was used as a front to facilitate Headley's entry into India. Headley and Rana had a thorough discussion about their future plans when they met in US. ""As Rana was a deserter from the army, Headley offered to provide assistance through his connection with Major Iqbal,"" reads the dossier.Backed by the ISI, Rana exploited every option available to him to thwart his extradition. He even claimed pleas of double jeopardy/double prosecution which essentially holds that a person cannot be prosecuted twice for same offence. The US court, however, rejected his contention that American judiciary had already tried and acquitted him of charges for which India wanted him. The US court said the crimes he had been charged with in India were different from those for which he was prosecuted in the US. ""For example, India's forgery charges are based in part on conduct that was not charged in the US,"" the court observed.Rana's 2013 conviction in US, where he was sentenced to 14 years in prison, was for supporting Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba and the terror plot in Denmark. Rana was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to a plot from Oct 2008 to Oct 2009 to commit murder in Denmark, including a plan to behead employees of Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten, a Danish newspaper which published a cartoon of the Prophet , and throw their heads on streets of Copenhagen, as well as providing material support, from late 2005 to Oct 2009, to Lashkar-e-Taiba.The website of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons has updated the status against Rana's name saying he wasn't in their custody as of Tuesday. Rana's register number (22829-424) read: ""Not in BOP custody as of 04/08/2025.""A team of officials drawn from Indian agencies in the US was tasked with facilitating his return. Sources said the chief investigating officer, DIG (NIA) Jaya Roy, signed off on the 'surrender warrant' Tuesday, following which swift arrangements were made to fly him to Delhi. The team left Wednesday around 6.30am, aiming to complete the journey with a brief pit stop. Incidentally, NIA is headed by Sadanand Date , a Maharashtra cadre IPS officer who, along with other colleagues, had rushed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus area on the fateful evening of Nov 26, 2008 after the terrorists struck at targets selected by, among others, Rana's partner in the massacre David Coleman Headley.Rana's interrogators, a source said, will aim to get him to divulge details about Pakistani state actors involved in the 26/11 plot, details of ISI network, as well as LeT's local collaborators and sources of funding. There also seems to be recognition that breaking down a hardened terrorist, especially one motivated by jihad, may not be easy.""He has already been probed extensively, and cracking him will not be an easy task. He would know where to mislead us and create smokescreens. This will be time-consuming,"" said a source in the know.Rana (64) is learned to have already got his contacts to engage his defence counsel. Due to security reasons, Rana may not be taken to court and his remand proceedings may be held in camera, sources said.","Tahawwur rana, one of the main plotters of the 2008 mumbai attack, had contacted david coleman headley 231 times during his visits to india ahead of the 26/11 carnage.

India ends transshipment facility for Bangladesh exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-ends-transshipment-facility-for-bangladesh-exports/articleshow/120141297.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has disallowed transshipment of cargo from Bangladesh to third countries, dealing a blow to Dhaka exporting apparel through air freighters, largely from Delhi.Global brands such as Zara, which use the route to meet their international need, will have to rework their sourcing strategy. The customs circular, issued Tuesday, said cargo that had already entered India would be allowed to be shipped out. Confirming the development that comes amid the strife in India-Bangladesh ties, MEA said the transshipment used to cause congestion at Indian airports and ports, but added the order won't hit Dhaka's exports to Nepal and Bhutan passing through India. tnnThe trans-shipment facility extended to Bangladesh had over a period of time resulted in significant congestion at our airports and ports. Logistical delays and higher costs were hindering our own exports and creating backlogs. The facility, therefore, has been withdrawn, w.e.f. April 8, 2025. To clarify, these measures do not impact Bangladesh exports to Nepal or Bhutan transiting through Indian territory,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal , adding India needs to create space for its own exports.While exporters had petitioned govt last year, the customs notification came days after Muhammad Yunus made controversial remarks in China, saying India's northeastern states, which share a nearly 1,600-km border with Bangladesh, were ""landlocked"", prompting a strong rebuttal from PM Modi ""India has always supported the Bangladesh cause. India allows one-way zero tariff access to Bangladesh goods (all except alcohol and cigarettes) to the vast Indian market for the last two decades. However, Bangladesh plans for creating a strategic base near Chicken's Neck area with China's help may have prompted this action. Bangladesh has invited Chinese investment to revitalise the air base at Lalmunirhat near India's Siliguri Corridor ,"" said trade research body GTRI.Industry here said this will help Indian players. ""It was the Apparel Export Promotion Council's long-standing demand for stopping trans-shipment of Bangladeshi cargo, meant for shipments to third countries, through Indian ports, which has now been accepted. This will help in rationalisation of freight rates resulting in less transportation cost to the Indian exporters besides decongesting the airports leading to the shorter transit time to ship the goods,"" said the industry body's secretary general Mithileshwar Thakur .The MEA spokesperson also reiterated India's demand that Bangladesh probe cases of violence against minorities, saying this was an issue that PM Modi strongly raised with chief advisor Muhammad Yunus during their recent meeting in Bangkok. ""This is not an issue that Bangladesh can wish away by calling it media exaggeration,"" said Jaiswal. Yunus had said in the meeting that most of the cases of atrocities committed on minorities were fake news.","Global brands such as zara, which use the route to meet their international need, will have to rework their sourcing strategy.

NEW DELHI: BJD president and former Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday came out in strong defence of his close aide VK Pandian, calling for unity within the party after signs of internal rift emerged over the controversial Waqf (Amendment) Bill , 2025.The bill, now a law following Presidential assent, saw the BJD divided in the Rajya Sabha with MPs casting split votes, an unusual move for a party known for its discipline. While MP Sasmit Patra supported the bill, another MP, Muzibulla Khan , opposed it. One member, Debashish Samantaray, remained absent. The confusion has prompted criticism from the BJP and concerns within the BJD ranks.Naveen Patnaik also came down heavily on his party colleagues for holding large meetings in hotels amid growing internal rift following party members' split voting on the Bill in Rajya Sabha five days ago. While he didn’t name anyone directly, the remarks were widely seen as a response to speculation around growing discontent in the party, particularly over Pandian’s influence.Rejecting all such talk, senior BJD leader Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak told ANI, “There is no infighting at all. All MPs, MLAs and workers are united under the leadership of Naveen Patnaik. We are and will always remain a secular party.”Backing him, BJD veteran Bhupinder Singh warned against any attempt to undermine the party's unity. “There is no groupism... An outsider cannot lead the party. Naveen Patnaik is the only leader,” Singh said, in an indirect reference to Pandian’s critics within the organisation.BJD’s Shashi Bhushan Behera echoed the sentiment, saying the meeting in Bhubaneswar was a routine affair. “The public stands with Naveen Patnaik. He is aware of everything. All leaders are with him.”But outside the party, the BJP remained unconvinced. Rajya Sabha MP Sujeet Kumar questioned the BJD’s flip-flop on the bill. “They are totally confused. One MP supported, another opposed, and one didn’t even show up. It’s a drama. Let them explain this to the public,” he said.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill was passed last week by the Rajya Sabha with 128 votes in favour and 95 against, after the Lok Sabha cleared it with 288 votes for and 232 against. The legislation has now received assent from President Droupadi Murmu","Naveen patnaik came out in strong defence of his close aide vk pandian.

NEW DELHI: London high court on Tuesday rejected Indian government's application to appeal in the UK Supreme Court against the discharge of Sanjay Bhandari , a defence consultant wanted on charges of tax evasion and money laundering. The judgement also said that Bhandari, in Tihar jail , would be at risk ""of extortion and violence"" from ""other prisoners and prison officials""""In our judgment, having regard to all the evidence and information provided on this ground, including the fresh evidence, we conclude that in Tihar prison, the appellant (Bhandari) would be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by threatened or actual violence, from other prisoners and/or prison officials,"" their judgment said.The application, part of a two-step process to escalate the case to the UK Supreme Court, was the government's first move—but with this stage denied, officials have yet to confirm whether they will seek direct permission from the Supreme Court.""The court received an application from the government of India seeking certification of points of law of general importance and grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court,"" justice Timothy Holroyde said.""Having considered the written submissions, the court is satisfied that no oral hearing is necessary, and no further submissions required. The two points on which leave to appeal was sought is refused. The reasons being that neither of the points of law of general importance were involved in the court's decision,"" he added.The court granted Bhandari's appeal against extradition on human rights grounds, ruling that sending him to India would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) due to concerns over the conditions of his proposed custody in Tihar Jail. Additionally, the court upheld a second ground under Article 6 of the ECHR, citing concerns about the burden and standard of proof in Indian criminal trials, which could undermine his right to a fair trial.Bhandari was ordered to be discharged in February after a ruling by Westminster Magistrates' Court in November 2022, which led to the withdrawal of then UK home secretary Suella Braverman’s extradition order.He faced two separate extradition requests from India—one certified in June 2020 for alleged money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, and another in June 2021 for allegedly attempting to evade tax under the Black Money Act, 2015.",London high court on tuesday rejected indian government's application to appeal in the uk supreme court against the discharge of sanjay bhandari.

While the Rajasthan leader was given the opportunity to place the party’s resolution before the massive gathering with a speech, the Kerala MP and diplomat-turned-politician Tharoor got the prime place of seconding the resolution. MP and AICC general secretary Randeep Surjewala conducted the long session.Speaking after the presidential speech of Mallikarjun Kharge , Pilot presented a summary of the resolution, detailing “what is nationalism for Congress”, delineating the difference between the inclusive ethos of Congress and divisive ideology of RSS-BJP. He also spoke about the attack on the Constitution and the need to defend it.Tharoor lauded the Congress’s good Lok Sabha poll results but expressed disappointment of defeat in the recent assembly elections. Urging that the party win back the votes it has lost after 2009, he said it can be done only through constructive criticism and not by unrelenting negativity. He said Congress has an illustrious history but the “young voters who are a majority today, do not give much importance to history, and want to know what we will do for them today and what kind of tomorrow we can give them.

"Tahawwur Rana Extradition: Delhi, Mumbai jails being readied for 26/11 mastermind",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/extradition-delhi-mumbai-jails-being-readied-for-26/11-mastermind-tahawwur-rana/articleshow/120105633.cms,"Poll What do you think is the most important factor in preventing future terrorist attacks? International cooperation and diplomacy Strong intelligence and surveillance

NEW DELHI: With 26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana slated to land in India on Wednesday, two jails, one in Delhi and another in Mumbai, were asked to covertly make special arrangements in line with US judiciary recommendations about extradited subjects. He is initially likely to be in custody of NIA for the first few weeks. The exercise was supervised by national security adviser A K Doval, along with officials from the home ministry.Rana, a Pakistani-Canadian and active member of LeT, had arranged passports for fellow jihadi, Pakistani-American David Coleman Headley , aka Dawood Gilani, to travel to India to select targets for the terror attack that was being hatched by Lashkar in collaboration with ISI, Pakistan's spy agency. Rana gloated over the deaths in Mumbai on Nov 26, 2008 and said that the jihadis responsible for it should be given Pakistan's highest posthumous military honours.So far only Ajmal Kasab, the sole LeT terrorist involved in 26/11 rampage who was nabbed alive, had been prosecuted.In Feb, US President Donald Trump had confirmed Rana's extradition to India saying he was pleased to announce that Rana is ""going back to India to face justice"".The extradition was the result of sustained efforts by the Modi govt since 2019. That year in Dec, India had submitted a diplomatic note to the US to extradite Rana. On June 10, 2020, India filed a complaint seeking the provisional arrest of Rana to pave the way for his extradition.A confidant of ISI's Major Iqbal who conceptualised the Mumbai attacks, Rana and David Coleman Headley had established the groundwork for the Mumbai attacks, according to documents submitted in US court by both countries.Rana had personally arrived in Mumbai via Dubai before the attacks to ensure arrangements were precisely executed, say investigators. ""He had checked into hotel Renaissance in Powai during his visit to India between Nov 11 and Nov 21 in 2008. The attacks occurred five days after he departed,"" states a police document.According to a justice department document, Rana and Headley were apprehended in 2009 by FBI whilst plotting an assault against a Danish newspaper as well as providing material support, from 2005 to 2009, to Lashkar.Headley had testified in a US court that in the early summer of 2006, he and two Lashkar members discussed establishing an immigration office in Mumbai as a facade for his surveillance activities. Headley had travelled to Chicago and informed Rana, his longstanding friend since their schooldays in Pakistan, of his assignment to scout potential targets in India.Such was their understanding that in the late summer of 2009, Rana and Headley agreed that funds that had been provided to Rana could be used to fund Headley's work in Denmark, and the evidence showed that Rana pretended to be Headley in sending an email to the Danish newspaper.For Mumbai attacks, Headley obtained approval from Rana, who owned First World Immigration Services in Chicago and elsewhere, to establish a First World office in Mumbai as a cover for his activities. Headley had travelled to India five times between 2007 and 2008 and conducted reconnaissance for the Mumbai attacks - using a five-year visa that Rana had assisted him in obtaining.""Rana directed an individual associated with First World to prepare documents supporting Headley's cover story, and advised Headley how to obtain a visa for travel to India,"" states the justice department document. Mumbai Police had also discovered email communications between Headley and Rana discussing Major Iqbal.","26/11 mastermind tahawwur rana slated to land in india on wednesday.

FBI Director Kash Patel has been quietly removed as acting director of the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) and replaced by US Army secretary Daniel Driscoll , in a leadership shuffle that was not publicly disclosed by the justice department, news agency Reuters reported.Patel, who was controversially holding two top posts in the Justice Department, both FBI director and acting ATF chief, was sworn in to lead the ATF on February 24, just three days after assuming leadership at the FBI.However, his time at ATF appears to have ended in late February, though his name and photo remained on the agency’s website as of Wednesday afternoon and were still featured in an official ATF press release dated April 7, according to Reuters.A justice department official confirmed Patel’s removal but insisted it was not related to job performance. “Director Patel was briefly designated ATF Director while awaiting Senate confirmations, a standard, short-term move,” White House spokesman Harrison Fields was quoted as saying by Reuters.“Director Patel is now excelling in his role at the FBI and delivering outstanding results”, Fields added.The decision to install Army secretary Daniel Driscoll as acting ATF director caught many off guard. Driscoll, who remains in his current military post, now oversees the ATF while also managing a $187 billion Army budget and more than 450,000 soldiers around the world.As per news agency AP, the dual role is unusual, given the longstanding US policy to maintain a strict divide between military operations and domestic law enforcement.Driscoll, 38, previously served as an adviser to Vice President JD Vance and ran unsuccessfully in a North Carolina congressional primary in 2020. His appointment came without public announcement, and even senior ATF leaders were informed only this week, according to AP.Patel’s sudden appointment in February as ATF chief shocked career employees. When he arrived at ATF headquarters, he urged staff to focus on targeting violent gang members but has rarely been seen since, current and former officials were cited as saying by Reuters.The abrupt leadership changes have fueled concerns about instability within the agency, which plays a key role in investigating gun crimes, arson, bombings and regulating the firearms industry.“To see them in the situation they’re in now is just really heartbreaking,” said Peter Forcelli , a former ATF assistant director was quoted by Reuters. “The fact they’re getting kicked around like a soccer ball is to me just incredibly disrespectful”, Forcelli added.The leadership reshuffle comes amid broader discussions inside the justice department about potentially merging the ATF with the Drug Enforcement Administration to cut costs and consolidate enforcement resources, a move that could reshape federal firearms and narcotics investigations nationwide.Meanwhile, attorney general Pam Bondi has launched a new task force focused on enforcing the Second Amendment, which will include the ATF and Civil Rights Division.Bondi and US President Donald Trump have moved to roll back gun regulations implemented during the Biden administration. Earlier this week, the ATF repealed its “zero tolerance” policy on revoking licenses of gun dealers who commit serious violations, a shift that had been previously championed by Patel in a press release.The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the leading gun industry trade group, praised Driscoll’s appointment on Wednesday, saying it “signals a resolve to bring reform to ATF and protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens”.","Fbi director kash patel has been quietly removed as acting director of the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives ( atf ) he was replaced by us army secretary daniel driscoll in a leadership shuffle that was not publicly disclosed by the justice department.

TOI explainer: The math behind Donald Trump’s 104% tariffs on China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/toi-explainer-the-math-behind-donald-trumps-104-tariffs-on-china/articleshow/120114000.cms,"US President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs on dozens of economies came in force Wednesday.

But how exactly did the number get so high?

Explaining the math behind the 104% tariff

To understand Trump’s 104% tariff on China, it’s important to know it’s not one flat tax applied all at once—it’s cumulative. As per a Wall Street Journal report, here is how the Trump administration arrived at 104% tariff on China:

February: 10% tariff imposed on Chinese goods over fentanyl-related concerns

March: Another 10% added, bringing the total to 20%

Last week: Trump adds 34% as part of his “reciprocal” tariff regime → total now 54%

This week: China threatens retaliation → Trump responds with 50% more → final total: 104%

Global stock markets are tumbling, with the S&P 500 losing $5.8 trillion in value

Americans brace for higher prices; 3 in 4 expect everyday goods to cost more

Some goods already in transit are exempt until May 27

China has vowed to ""fight to the end""—and more retaliation is likely

US President Donald Trump 's ""reciprocal"" tariffs on dozens of countries kicked in Wednesday, slapping Chinese goods with a steep 104% duty and intensifying his global trade war—even as his administration moves toward talks with several nations.The sweeping tariffs have disrupted a global trading system that held steady for decades, stoked recession fears, and sent stock markets around the world into a sharp decline.Trump's tariff moves have rattled global markets, sent the S&P 500 toward bear territory, and triggered panic among businesses and consumers already bracing for rising costs.The 104% figure isn’t from a single sweeping order, but from a sequence of layered duties. Trump started with a 10% tariff on Chinese goods in February over the country’s role in the fentanyl trade, followed by another 10% in March. Then, just last week, he added 34% more as part of a broader “reciprocal” tariff campaign. China’s promise to strike back prompted Trump to tack on an additional 50%, bringing the total to 104%. “These are tailored, highly tailored deals,” he said. But they’re also compounding, and that’s where the math gets intense.It’s also important to note: these duties stack on top of existing tariffs from Trump’s first term and some increases under Biden. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates the average tariff rate on Chinese goods at 20.8% before Trump’s second term began. So the effective average tariff rate on Chinese imports now hovers near 125% when you factor in past trade measures, the WSJ report added.This isn't just a headline number—it's a layered financial burden that hits importers, ripples through supply chains, and ultimately raises prices for US consumers. That’s why nearly 75% of Americans expect everyday goods to get more expensive in the months ahead, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. As Trump pushes this hardline strategy, the math isn’t just political—it’s economic pain, multiplied(With inputs from agencies)","Us president donald trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs on dozens of countries kicked in wednesday, slapping chinese goods with a steep 104% duty.

Second Lady Usha Vance, who was the recently the eye of the storm over her Greenland visit, has spoken out about the attacks that she and Vice President JD Vance receive -- and a majority of it stems from her Indian roots. “Do I think it’s great when people talk about ‘ normalizing Indian hate ’ or something like that?

""Normalize Indian hate,"" one of his posts read. These racist posts got him fired from DOGE, but JD Vance was in favor of rehiring him, which drew ire from Indian-origin Democratic Rep Ro Khanna, who reminded JD Vance of that his kids share Indian origin because of Usha's roots.""Are you going to tell him (Marko Elez) to apologize for saying 'Normalize Indian hate' before this rehire?

The move provided a much-needed boost to investor sentiment, reversing the market volatility caused by escalating trade tensions earlier in the week.US stock markets closed with substantial gains across all three primary indices after President Trump announced a postponement of significant new tariffs shortly following their implementation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded a notable increase of 7.9 percent, reaching 40,608.45, whilst the broader S&P 500 Index advanced by 9.5 percent to 5,456.90.Trump’s decision to temporarily ease the ongoing tariff war sparked a surge in major indices. As of 1:36 PM GMT-4, the Dow Jones jumped by over 2,300 points, rising 6.18%, while the Nasdaq soared 8.75%, and the S&P 500 climbed 7.07%. Gold prices also gained, rising 3.22%, reflecting optimism across markets.Trump’s announcement, shared via a post on Truth Social, stating ""Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.""Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.

Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!""Meanwhile, Global markets experienced significant declines on Wednesday as tensions between the US and China escalated. China retaliated to US tariffs by imposing new levies of 84% on US goods, leading US equity futures to drop by 1.7%. European stocks followed suit, plummeting more than 4%, according to Bloomberg.The market selloff intensified as the yield on 30-year US Treasuries surged above 5% for the first time since November 2023. This signalled growing concerns about the status of US bonds as a safe haven. The bond market turmoil spread globally, with UK borrowing costs reaching their highest level since 1998 and Japanese 40-year bond yields hitting a record peak. The US dollar weakened for a second consecutive day, Bloomberg reported.“We’re well into an escalation phase in the trade war, and investors have nothing to hold onto at the moment,” said Alexandre Baradez, chief market analyst at IG Markets. “What’s clear now is that the US bond market is no longer a safe haven and is piling pressure on stock markets,” he added, as noted by Bloomberg.Shares of major pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and Bristol-Myers Squibb fell by approximately 3% after President Trump indicated that the US would soon announce ""a major tariff on pharmaceuticals,"" according to Bloomberg.The worsening trade conflict, with tariffs on China rising to 104%, triggered alarm bells among investors, including Bill Ackman. Economists at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs raised the probability of a US recession, a scenario that could complicate the Federal Reserve’s ability to respond to potential inflation driven by the new tariffs.Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, warned of a “once-in-a-lifetime” breakdown in global monetary, political, and geopolitical systems. Alexandre Hezez, CIO at Group Richelieu, also expressed concerns that high volatility could trigger market accidents.In the bond markets, the 10-year US Treasury yield rose by five basis points to 4.35%, while the dollar index fell. Investors sought refuge in safer assets, including the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, as the euro climbed above $1.10, according to Bloomberg.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated on Wednesday that after decades of growth on Wall Street, it is now time for smaller institutions to thrive, as President Donald Trump’s new tariffs added to market instability.""Wall Street has become wealthier than ever, and it will continue to prosper,"" Bessent said during his speech at the American Bankers Association's Washington Summit.""But for the next four years, the Trump agenda will focus on Main Street—smaller businesses, investors, and institutions,"" he added.US equity futures saw a sharp decline, with the S&P 500 futures dropping 1%, Nasdaq 100 futures slipping 0.8%, and Dow futures falling 1.3%. The Stoxx Europe 600 index also faced heavy losses, plummeting 3.8%.
