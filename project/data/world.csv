PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he looks forward to speak with his ""very good friend"" Prime Minister Modi in the coming weeks and confirmed that his administration will continue negotiations with India to resolve trade barriers between the two countries.Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations. I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks.""""I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he added.The remarks come after Trump had earlier softened his tone on India-US relations, calling the ties ""very special,"" affirming his friendship with PM Modi on Friday.Earlier, speaking at the White House Trump had said that, ""I always will. I'll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He's a great Prime Minister. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment.""""But India and the United States have a very special relationship.There is nothing to worry about.

Balen's message for Nepali youth





With Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stepping down amid the deadly student-led “GenZ protests,” attention has shifted to Kathmandu’s young mayor, Balendra Shah, as online campaigns promote him as the Himalayan nation’s next leader.Popularly known as “Balen,” the 35-year-old is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022. He won as an independent candidate, becoming the first to hold the post without party backing.An engineer by training, Balen holds a degree in civil engineering and has an India connection - he pursued structural engineering at Visvesvaraya Technological University in Karnataka. Before entering politics, he was active in Nepal’s underground hip-hop scene, using his music to highlight corruption and inequality.In June 2023, he drew national attention by banning the screening of Indian films in Kathmandu over a dialogue in the movie Adipurush.In a Facebook post, Shah on Tuesday appealed to protesters to exercise restraint, noting that their demand for the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and other ministers has already been met.He cautioned against further damage to public and private property, saying, “The loss of the country’s wealth is, in reality, a loss of our own property. It is now essential that we all act with restraint.”Shah’s appeal comes as nationwide “GenZ” protests intensify, with young demonstrators demanding accountability over corruption, restrictions on freedoms and police violence. A security forces crackdown has left at least 19 dead and more than 500 injured in clashes around the Federal Parliament and other parts of Kathmandu over the past two days.","Balen shah, 35, is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as kathmandu’s 15th mayor since may 2022.

Fear of crimes, further instability stalks Nepal







Less than 24 hours after police gunfire left 19 people dead outside its parliament, Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli resigned Tuesday as protests against corruption and censorship spiralled into the most violent unrest the Himalayan nation has seen in years. The Nepal army declared that it would assume responsibility for law and order from 10pm.By Tuesday afternoon, protesters stormed the federal parliament building inside the Singha Durbar complex, shattering windows and setting fires in multiple chambers. Flames rose as young demonstrators danced and chanted. ""This building never worked for us,"" said Mira Thapa, a 20-year-old student waving a Nepali flag. ""Burning it down means we can build something new.""The fury spread to the homes of senior politicians. Foreign minister Arzu Rana Deuba, wife of former PM Sher Bahadur Deuba, was dragged from her residence and beaten by a mob. ""They kept shouting that we had stolen their future,"" she later told aides. Deuba was also assaulted. Deputy PM and finance minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel was chased through the streets by protesters who kicked and struck him. Former PM Jhalanath Khanal's wife, Rajyalaxmi Chitrakar, was killed after protesters torched their home.Party officials confirmed her death late Tuesday, calling it a barbaric act that reflected the dangerous turn of the movement.Officials at the Civil Service Hospital in Kathmandu confirmed by evening that the toll had risen to 22, with more than 300 injured in clashes and stampedes across the city.In a statement, the army warned that ""taking undue advantage of the adverse situation, some groups have been causing excessive damage to ordinary citizens and public property, as well as engaging in looting and arson. To prevent such activities, the army, along with all other security agencies, will assume primary responsibility of maintaining law and order for safety of Nepal and Nepalis.""The bloodshed came three days after govt abruptly revoked a blanket ban on 26 social media platforms, a measure that had triggered the Gen Z-led protests. The ban, introduced days earlier under Oli's administration, was reversed after a night of emergency cabinet meetings, ministerial resignations and mounting international pressure. Home minister Ramesh Lekhak resigned ""on moral grounds,"" acknowledging that the move had left nearly 20 dead. ""I cannot continue in office when young people are dying in the streets because of a wrong decision,"" he told colleagues.Oli, by contrast, insisted he had never supported the ban. ""I was not in favour of blocking social media,"" he told reporters. Even as the cabinet scrambled to retreat, the clampdown on the streets deepened. Police acknowledged using rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters outside parliament, while the home ministry confirmed that the army had been placed on standby. Curfews were extended across Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, and flights at Tribhuvan International Airport in the capital Kathmandu were suspended.Symbolic targets were also attacked. Protesters stormed and set fire to the Hilton Hotel in Kathmandu. The luxury property, which opened only last year and is linked to political patrons, was one of the most high-profile casualties of the unrest. Elsewhere, crowds torched the headquarters of governing and opposition parties, vandalised the Kantipur Media Group building, and set sections of Supreme Court compound on fire. For many protesters, such attacks were deliberate acts ""against symbols of privilege and impunity"".Chaos also engulfed Nepal's prisons. In Mahottari district, protesters and inmates breached the walls of Jaleshwar Jail, freeing more than 500 prisoners. In Lalitpur, the Nakhu jail was set ablaze and emptied, with opposition figure Rabi Lamichhane among those released. Police said he was handed over to his family after crowds massed outside demanding his safety. ""The prison could no longer guarantee security,"" one officer said. ""When the fire started, the priority was survival."" Officials admitted they had lost control of multiple facilities, raising fears of a surge in crime and further instability.Helicopters evacuated ministers from their homes in Bhaisepati as smoke rose over govt quarters.","Nepal pm k p sharma oli resigns as protests against corruption and censorship spiralled into the most violent unrest the himalayan nation has seen in years.

The vote tally seemed to indicate that at least 15 opposition members voted for the NDA nominee, despite Congress claiming all 315 opposition MPs stood united in the vice-presidential polls.Interestingly, the shortfall in the opposition's count - 15 - was the same as the number of votes declared ""invalid"". Sources said it was not possible to assert with surety if the invalid votes were all from the opposition, or some MPs had cross-voted.The poll recorded a 98.2% turnout with 767 MPs voting. There were 752 valid votes and 15 deemed invalid. One postal ballot was cancelled as the MP declined to vote.""I declare CP Radhakrishnan has been elected to the post of Vice-President of India, and the results will be communicated to the Election Commission,"" the RS secretary-general announced.Radhakrishnan's margin turned the focus on opposition's possible failure to stick together, that too, at a time when it is on the warpath with allegations of ""vote theft"".The opposition fell 15 votes short of its estimated tally in the VP election, with candidate B Sudershan Reddy securing 300 votes, while the expected tally was 315 based on support of like-minded INDIA-plus parties.Congress put up a brave face, with opposition's counting agents Shaktisinh Gohil and Manickam Tagore saying that Reddy secured 40% of the votes cast as against the opposition tally of 26% in the 2022 VP election. But it came just after Jairam Ramesh announced at the end of voting, ""The opposition has stood united. All of its 315 MPs have turned up for voting. This is an unprecedented 100% turnout.""The full turnout of 315 votes made it difficult for the anti-BJP bloc to pinpoint the MPs who may not have voted for Reddy, with the post-result calculations complicated by the fact that exactly 15 votes were found invalid too.Gohil drew a link between 15 invalid ballots and the 15 votes by which the opposition fell short. Sources said it was not possible to assert with su-rety if the invalid votes were all opposition MPs, or some had cross-voted. However, doubts were trained on MPs from a couple of regional parties that have a hostile govt in their home state. Sources said MPs of a party no longer in INDIA bloc cast many invalid votes, likely on purpose.""The fact that all 315 members turned up to vote and the voteshare grew from 26% in 2022 to 40% in 2025 means the opposition bloc is growing and is united. This unity needs to stay intact in interest of the country,"" Gohil said.Tagore slammed Chandrababu Naidu's TDP, Jaganmohan Reddy's YSRCP and BRS for not voting for Reddy, hinting at the Telugu connection. ""They chose expediency over ideology,"" he said.Ramesh called BJP's victory ""arithmetical"" and tantamount to ""both a moral and political defeat"".

Case built on dual criminality

India’s assurances

NEW DELHI: The extradition trial of fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi, wanted in India for the Rs 13,000 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud, is set to begin in a Belgian court next Monday, officials confirmed.Belgian federal prosecutors will lead the hearings with support from the CBI and India’s Ministry of External Affairs. Choksi, who has held Belgian residency since 2023 citing medical reasons, relocated there from Antigua and Barbuda, where he had obtained citizenship in 2017. His wife is a Belgian national.India formally requested his extradition in January 2024, after tracing him to Belgium. Choksi was arrested in April and remains in custody after multiple courts denied him bail. This marks the first extradition case under the India-Belgium treaty signed in 2020.The CBI has submitted extensive documentation, including FIRs, chargesheets and evidence summaries, arguing that offences under the IPC, criminal conspiracy, cheating, falsification of accounts, and the Prevention of Corruption Act are equally punishable in Belgium. Officials said this satisfies the principle of “dual criminality,” a cornerstone of extradition law.India has also invoked international conventions such as the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the UN Convention against Corruption. Two open-ended arrest warrants from Mumbai courts (2018 and 2021) have been shared with Belgian authorities.Anticipating human rights concerns, India has assured Belgian courts of proper conditions at Mumbai’s Arthur Road Prison, where Choksi would be lodged. Authorities detailed facilities available to rule out custodial torture or inhumane treatment.Choksi, who fled India on January 4, 2018, just days before the PNB fraud came to light, has contested attempts to revoke his Antiguan citizenship. Officials, however, maintain that he remains an Indian citizen since he never completed the formal renunciation process.","Mehul choksi is wanted in india for the rs 13,000 crore punjab national bank (pnb) fraud.

Announcing the result, Rajya Sabha Secretary General and Returning Officer P C Mody said 767 MPs had cast their votes out of the total valid electors of 781. He said 752 ballots were valid and 15 were invalid, bringing down the required majority of first preference votes to 377.That Radhakrishnan would win the VP race was perhaps never in doubt given the numbers advantage that he had over Reddy. But there was still a lot of interest in the final results. The fact that VP polls are held without any party whip thereby leaving a window open for cross voting had instilled some hope in the opposition camp. If not an outright win, they could at least bank on ""conscience vote"" to attract some NDA MPs to their side and embarrass the ruling camp. The Telugu card was a thought out strategy to achieve this objective.Unfortunately, as the final results show, the strategy boomeranged.Instead of NDA MPs ditching their camp, it appears the INDIA bloc members responded to their ""conscience"". The vote tally suggests some cross-voting in favour of Radhakrishnan.The BJP, which had silently ensured that all leaders associated with the ruling alliance voted in favour of NDA candidate, was quick to take digs at opposition's pre-voting claims of unity within their ranks.Union minister Kiren Rijiju claimed ""Many opposition parties have also voted for our NDA candidate. This is also a very good sign."" In fact, BJP claims that at least 15 opposition members voted for the NDA nominee.Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh had earlier asserted that all 315 INDIA bloc MPs were in attendance for the vote.""The Opposition has stood united. ALL of its 315 MPs have turned up for voting. This is an unprecedented 100% turnout,"" he said on X.Since this was a secret ballot, so who all cast conscience vote may perhaps be not known. But the opposition did admit that it suffered a dent, though not a significant one.""There has been a 14% increase in votes secured by this candidate (Opposition candidate B Sudershan Reddy) as compared to the last candidate. This candidate received 40% of the total votes, compared to 26% secured by the previous candidate. So the Opposition is only gaining; there will be a change...They (NDA) could not cause a significant dent ... ,"" Congress MP Imran Masood said.However, with Reddy managing only 300, the deficit of 15 votes raised questions. BJP leader Amit Malviya was quick to take pot shots at this claim. Soon after the results were out, he responded to Jairam's post and wrote:""All 315 voted… but for whom is the real question! 🤔 Despite all the noise and bravado, the INDI Alliance candidate managed only 300 votes, 15 short of what they had confidently claimed. So much for tall claims and unity!""However, Jairam Ramesh put up a brave defence and claimed opposition performance had improved compared to last elections.""Opposition performance has undeniably been most respectable. Its joint candidate Justice (retd) B Sudershan Reddy secured 40% of the vote. In 2022, the Opposition had received 26% of the vote in the vice presidential elections,"" Ramesh said.""The BJP's arithmetical victory is really both a moral and political defeat. The ideological battle continues undiminished,"" the Congress leader added.These claims notwithstanding, the fact remains that the opposition once again put up a poor show. Yes, 15 votes were declared invalid. But this does not explain the dip in INDIA bloc's overall numbers. Moreover, there is still no clarity on how the AAP members, who had promised support to Reddy, have voted.So, while the results are not a surprise, the more than expected victory margin of C P Radhakrishnan is surely is a matter of concern for the opposition. Clearly, they still are far away from their claims of unity.(With inputs from agencies)",Nda candidate c p radhakrishnan was on tuesday elected as the 15th vice-president of india bagging 452 votes against the opposition candidate b sudershan reddy's 300.

Utah Valley University locked down







Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative political activist and a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was shot dead while speaking at Utah Valley University on Thursday.Kirk was addressing students under a tent decorated with slogans reading “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong” when a single gunshot was fired, striking him in the neck.Disturbing video footage from the scene shows him clutching his wound as students screamed and fled the area.Trump confirmed Kirk’s death shortly after the incident and announced that American flags would be flown at half-mast until Sunday as a mark of respect.Authorities have not yet released details on the shooter or the motive behind the attack.FBI Director Kash Patel said that the suspect, who was detained, has been released after interrogation.He had announced the arrest of a person from the scene, praising law enforcement’s quick action. “The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody,” Patel had written on X.Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said officials believe only one “person involved” in the shooting death of Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus. “No information suggests a second person,” he stated Wednesday.However, investigators are still seeking anyone with more details. A person of interest is currently in custody and being interviewed, according to the governor.President Trump, who counted Kirk as a key political ally, paid tribute to him both on Truth Social and in an interview with the New York Post.“No one understood or had the heart of the youth in the United States better than Charlie,” Trump wrote online. “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me.”Trump ordered American flags flown at half-mast until Sunday evening after the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk. On Truth Social, @Trump shared that the ""Legendary"" debater had been killed, expressing condolences to his wife Erika and young family. He has been closely monitoring the situation as it develops and acknowledged Kirk's impactful legacy.Trump described Kirk as “a very, very good friend” and “a tremendous person,” urging supporters: “We must all pray for Charlie Kirk.”Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, who was present at the event, said Kirk had just taken a question from the audience when the shot rang out.“As soon as I saw Charlie go back, you realise that it was a shot,” Chaffetz told Fox News. “It wasn’t as if there was a whole bunch of gunfire. It was one shot.”He added that security at the event appeared light, with only a small police presence.Videos posted to social media show panic erupting as the shot was fired. Students screamed, ducked for cover, and rushed across a nearby fountain to escape the courtyard.Some in the crowd attempted to rush to Kirk’s aid as security hustled him away. A woman in a red “MAGA” hat was seen in tears, while others were filmed praying near the scene.Images circulating online showed an older white man being led away by police, with one officer reportedly heard saying, “He said he shot him, but I don’t know.”However, law enforcement later clarified that this individual was not the suspect. Confusion remains over whether the gunman fled the campus or is still in hiding.Politicians from across the spectrum denounced the shooting. Vice President JD Vance wrote: “Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour.” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said disputes should be resolved “through debate, not violence.”Democratic leaders also expressed support. California Governor Gavin Newsom called the attack “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible,” while former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: “Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.”UVU, Utah’s largest public university with nearly 47,000 students, was closed after the attack. Administrators confirmed the campus would remain under tight security while the search for the shooter continued.The event had already been controversial: a petition calling on the university to bar Kirk from speaking attracted nearly 1,000 signatures. Officials defended the appearance as an exercise in free speech and debate.","Charlie kirk, a 31-year-old conservative political activist and a close ally of us president donald trump, was shot dead while speaking at utah valley university on thursday.
