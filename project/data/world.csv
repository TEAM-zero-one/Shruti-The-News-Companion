"How Gujarat's Patel became Pakistan's Hussain: Deported from US, man reveals passport secret",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-gujarats-patel-became-pakistans-hussain-deported-from-us-man-reveals-passport-secret/articleshow/118667518.cms,"US has intensified crackdown on illegal immigrants following Trump’s new term. Patel, whose real passport had expired in 2016, was arrested on arrival in Delhi for misuse of passport and cheating by impersonation

AHMEDABAD: AC Patel from Gujarat had become Mohammad Najir Hussain of Pakistan - but only for a moment. And in that moment, he had belonged nowhere at all.Patel's passport bore Hussain's name and nationality, but American authorities saw through the deception. The man who claimed to be Hussain was unmasked. Patel arrived at Delhi airport on February 12 via flight AA-292 after US authorities sent him back to India.American agencies have intensified their crackdown on undocumented Indians following Donald Trump's new term since January, targeting immigrants living illegally in US and deporting them home. In the past month alone, three flights packed with Indian deportees - including 74 Gujaratis - have landed in India after being expelled by US authorities.Patel's real troubles had only just begun. Delhi police arrested him on arrival. He faces multiple serious charges, including cheating by impersonation, and misuse of passport. What stunned Indian immigration officials was the Pakistani passport. Not just any forged document, but an actual lost passport that belonged to Hussain.Cornered, Patel confessed. He had paid an agent in Dubai to forge his identity, swapping his Gujarat roots for a Pakistani character, just to secure a spot on a flight to US.Patel's real passport had expired in 2016 and instead of renewing it, he relied on human traffickers who provided him with fraudulent documents and facilitated his illegal journey via Dubai.""Human smugglers pick passports that are strong for getting a US visa or randomly assign some UAE citizen's passport to sneak into US,"" a source said.","Us has intensified crackdown on illegal immigrants following trump’s new term.

DEHRADUN: There was no time to run. One moment, the workers were asleep inside their container homes, the bitter cold pressing in from all sides, the hum of the mountains steady and unbroken. Then came a roar - deep, monstrous, growing louder by the second. The earth beneath them shuddered. The walls groaned. And before anyone could move, the avalanche was there, like a sudden apparition in a horror movie.Ganesh Kumar, a road construction worker from Pithoragarh, barely had time to open his eyes before the container was ripped from its place it was pegged and sent tumbling into the snow. ""It happened so fast, we had no time to think,"" he said from his hospital bed in Jyotirmath. ""One moment, we were asleep. The next, the entire container was flung ahead, rolling over and over. It must have been 50, maybe 60 metres. We had no control. We were just... thrown... like puppets.""Then came the deafening silence. The world outside was gone, above a thick pile of snow. Inside the crumpled container, the men lay tangled, gasping for breath, bodies stiff with cold. ""Darkness, silence, and the unbearable cold wrapped around us like a shroud,"" one of them recalled. ""The snow was everywhere - pushing against us, pressing into our chests. We tried shouting, but the sound just died around us. It felt like the snow was swallowing our voices.""The hours crawled by, stretching endlessly. The cold bit deep, turning their limbs numb. Some of them tried clawing at the walls, but there was no way out. The air felt thinner. Some stopped talking. ""It felt like we were already gone,"" one survivor said.Then, a noise - faint at first. Footsteps. Voices, muffled through the snow. Hope surged through their bodies like a shock. ""At first, I thought I was imagining it,"" another worker said. ""Then the sound got closer, and suddenly, the snow started shifting."" Hands broke through the ice, pulling them from the wreckage, dragging them into the open air. ""They were our saviours - farishtey (angels),"" another survivor said, his voice still trembling at the memory of the Army and ITBP personnel cutting through the snow to reach them.

NEW DELHI: India's aim to emerge as a developed country by 2047 is a "" realisable ambition"", said Arvind Panagariya , chairman of the 16th Finance Commission , while also stressing that the country's per capita income would need to grow at 7.3% in dollar terms to achieve the threshold of $14,000 over the next 24 years.""Certainly if we do the right things in the years to come, our prospects of getting to the Viksit Bharat ambition of the PM is very much realisable dream and realisable ambition,"" he said on Saturday in his address at the 49th Civil Accounts Day.He said the country's per-capita income, in 2023-24 dollar terms, is about $ 2,570, which is very low compared to countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, China, United States and other European nations. ""What that means is that India has the advantage that it is feasible even with existing technology, reasonable capital accumulation and skill acquisition to push the per capita income. India because of its current low per capita income has an enormous room for catch up and that catch up gives it the opportunity to grow significantly faster,"" said Panagariya.The Columbia University professor said India has gone on to gradually improve its governance system and a lot of economic reforms that had to be done have been done. He said more reforms need to be done and those will happen and this will enable India to sustain high growth rates.""Today, our per capita income in dollars is about $ 2,500. To get to $ 14,000 in 24 years or by 2047-48, what growth rate do I need for per capita income?.. my per capita income from 2023-24 onward has to grow annually at 7.3%,"" he said, adding that the $14,000 was the threshold set by the World Bank for defining developed countries.Panagariya, who has served as the first chairman of govt think tank Niti Aayog, cited United Nations data which has estimated that population in the country would grow 0.6% by 2050. He said that this would mean that to achieve a 7.3% growth in per capita income, India's GDP will have to grow at 7.9% during the next 24 years.""Our growth rate (in real dollar terms) for the last 21 years was at 7.8%...

You are despicable.”For the unversed, back in 2020, an audit in the state of Mississippi found that the Department of Human Services spent $1.1 million on Brett Favre’s company for two appearances that he did not make. Brett Favre was asked to repay $828,000 and by 2021, the former NFL player had only repaid $600,000.When the FBI questioned Brett Favre, his lawyer spoke about the NFL player having no knowledge that the money he received was for economically challenged families.

Coalition talks took months and three attempts

Austria's liberal NEOS party on Sunday approved a deal that paves the way for a three-way coalition government led by the center-right under Christian Stocker who is set to become chancellor next week.Members of NEOS, the smallest partner in the alliance, agreed to work with Stocker's conservative Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), who have already approved the deal.Austria has faced months of political uncertainty, following parliamentary elections in September, which saw the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) come first, but later fail to form a government after tense negotiations.Roughly 2,000 NEOS party members voted for the plan during a hybrid meeting in Vienna with more than 94% in favor of the 200-page coalition agreement.Under party rules, two-thirds of members had to approve the plan.If NEOS had failed to back the proposal, the ÖVP and SPÖ would have just a one-seat majority in the lower house of parliament, known as the National Council.NEOS has never been in national government before.Ahead of the vote, NEOS leader Beate Meinl-Reisinger called on members to ""make history"" and support what she sees as a move supporting liberal democracy.""Thank you! Work begins tomorrow!"" she told members after the vote, referring to the swearing-in of the new coalition, which can now take place on Monday.NEOS is due to head the Foreign and Education Ministries in the new government.The party's priorities include cutting state spending and red tape, along with pension reform.The new government plans tighter migration rules, austerity measures to tackle the budget deficit and a cap on rent increases.FPÖ leader Herbert Kickl last week called the tie-up a coalition of ""losers"" and called for a snap election.Austria has endured the longest wait since World War Two to form a new government — more than five months.Despite the FPÖ winning an unprecedented victory, with around 29% support, Austria's president first gave the conservative ÖVP the mandate to form a government amid unwillingness from other parties to grant the far-right party the chancellorship.After the ÖVP's first attempt failed in January, FPÖ leader Herbert Kickl was given the mandate to form a coalition.However, talks with the conservatives broke down several weeks later.Pressure from Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen led the ÖVP, SPÖ and Neos to try again and the trio reached a coalition deal on Thursday.Neighbor Germany faces a similar battle to agree on a new coalition following parliamentary elections last Sunday.After coming out top, center-right leader Friedrich Merz is due to begin talks with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats next week over the formation of a coalition.Coalition talks often take weeks or months to finalize, which can lead to political paralysis.Merz has said he wants to have a ruling coalition in place within two months, due to the economic issues currently facing Germany as well as the uncertainty caused by US President Donald Trump's reelection.German political parties have refused to work with the far-right.

Aid agencies cry foul

Israel agrees to ceasefire extension, Hamas pushes for phase two

First phase of ceasefire ended 15 months of fighting

Israel stopped the entry of essential aid into the Gaza Strip on Sunday, following a decision by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, drawing a strong rebuke from the United Nations, regional powers Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and humanitarian organizations.The move is in response to what Netanyahu's office called ""Hamas' refusal"" to accept an outline for the resumption of truce talks presented by US President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.The first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance, expired on Saturday.The two sides disagree about the next steps in the truce. Israel wants more hostages to be released under an extension of the first phase. But Hamas is pushing for the start of the second phase that would pave the way for a permanent end to the war.Hamas said Israel was trying to disrupt the ceasefire and described the halt of aid to Gaza as a ""war crime.""Netanyahu's office warned of ""further consequences"" if Hamas continues its refusal of what Israel says is a US proposal for the ceasefire extension.Egypt, which helped broker the ceasefire, accused Israel of a ""flagrant violation"" of the truce agreement. The Egyptian foreign ministry said Israel was using starvation as ""a weapon against the Palestinian people.""Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry dubbed Israel's decision ""blackmail"" and ""collective punishment"" in a statement cited by the official Saudi Press Agency, also urging the international community to ""stop these serious Israeli violations.""The Hamas attack on October 7, 2023 is considered by some observers to have been an attempt to disrupt Saudi Arabia's plan to begin friendly relations with Israel.Israel's eastern neighbor Jordan also condemned the blocking of aid.UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher called Israel's decision ""alarming,"" noting that access must remain under international humanitarian law.Medical charity MSF accused Israel of using aid as a bargaining chip, labeling the move ""unacceptable"" and ""outrageous.""UNICEF spokesperson Rosalia Bollen told DW that blocking aid would be ""devastating"" for Gaza residents.Bollen said although the scaling up of essential supplies, since the first phase of the truce took effect, had ""brought immediate relief and has likely saved many lives, it's by far insufficient.""Earlier on Sunday, Netanyahu's office had announced it had agreed to extend the ceasefire, just hours after it expired. It was due to be extended for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover.Ramadan started this weekend and continues through March 30. The Jewish festival of Passover begins on the evening of April 12 and ends on the evening of April 20.Witkoff proposed extending the current ceasefire after realizing more time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire, according to the statement from Netanyahu's office.Hamas told the AFP news agency on Sunday that it insists on the implementation of a second ceasefire phase.""The only way to achieve stability in the region and the return of the prisoners is to complete the implementation of the agreement... starting with the implementation of the second phase,"" Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi said in a statement given to AFP.Under the original agreement, the second phase was intended to see the start of negotiations over the release of the remaining hostages, the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and a final end to the war.Under the terms of the January ceasefire deal, fighting should not resume while negotiations are underway on phase two. Israel's new statement, however, says it can return to fighting ""if it believes that the negotiations are ineffective.""The ceasefire agreement reached in January halted 15 months of fighting, allowing the exchange of 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais.In exchange, around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israel were also released. The first phase was meant to lead to subsequent talks to build on the ceasefire deal.Talks about a permanent ceasefire have been ongoing but have not led to an agreement. Netanyahu's office said Israel would immediately conduct negotiations on Witkoff's plan if Hamas agreed to it. Israel and several other countries designate Hamas a terrorist organization.""According to the agreement, Israel can return to fighting after the 42nd day if it feels that the negotiations are ineffective,"" Netanyahu's office also said, accusing Hamas of violating the deal.Both sides have been trading accusations of violating the deal.","Hamas says israel is trying to disrupt the ceasefire and described the halt of aid to gaza as a ""war crime"" egypt, which helped broker the ceasefire, accused israel of a ""flagrant violation"" of the truce agreement.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he's ready to have a "" constructive dialogue "" with his US counterpart Donald Trump to ""solve real problems"" as his last meeting at the Oval Office blew up after a verbal spat over ongoing war with Russia.Trump and Vice President JD Vance flayed Zelenskyy for being dismissive about ceasefire with Moscow , saying the Kyiv had no way of winning the war against the Kremlin.Days after the botched meeting at the White House , Zelenskyy recognised Kyiv's dependence on Washington, however, he avoided apologising.""I am convinced that the situation will pass and more important things are ahead,"" Zelenskyy told Bloomberg during a European leaders summit held in London.If Trump invites him ""for a constructive dialogue, to solve real problems, for serious issues and real, decisive actions and answers — I will arrive,"" he said.""I’m ready for any format of constructive relations with the US,"" Zelenskiyy said.The Ukrainian President further defended his right to stand up for the ""dignity of his country and its people, and urged allies to show understanding for the suffering endured by Ukraine since Russia’s invasion three years ago.Zelenskyy also expressed strong appreciation for the support Ukraine has received during the London summit on Sunday, which focused on Ukraine's future and its relationship with Europe.The urgency of the summit in London's ornate Lancaster House was heightened after Trump chastised Zelenskyy, appalling the West and delighting Moscow, which saw it as ""a miracle of restraint"" that Trump and Vance didn't hit Zelenskyy.Zelenskyy and an ensemble of European leaders were in attendance, at a moment of intense anxiety in the conflict. According to CNN, Starmer told reporters he was working with France and a small number of other nations to craft a plan to stop the fighting, which would then be presented to the US.","Ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said he's ready to have a "" constructive dialogue "" with his us counterpart donald trump.

WASHINGTON: The Trump administration faced the first direct legal challenge to its policy of sending migrants to the US military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for continued immigration detention with a lawsuit filed Saturday by a coalition of human rights and immigrant advocacy organisations .""Plaintiffs seek this court's intervention to put a stop to these cruel, unnecessary and illegal transfers to and detention at Guantanamo,"" the newly filed complaint said. The plaintiffs, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, are for now seeking a judicial stay to block the transfer of 10 migrants whom the coalition signed up to represent. But it appears to lay the groundwork to seek a potential broader order against the transfer policy, which has raised many novel legal issues.The 10 migrants named in the lawsuit have final removal orders, it said, and come from countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Venezuela. The lawsuit asserts that none are gang members, and some have been specifically threatened with transfer to Guantanamo. ""In attempting to justify the transfers, the govt has claimed that the individuals it sent to Guantanamo are members of gangs and dangerous criminals - the 'worst of the worst,'"" the complaint said, citing a remark in Jan by defense secretary Pete Hegseth. It continued: ""That characterisation is patently false. It is also legally irrelevant because the govt lacks statutory authority to send any immigration detainees from the US to Guantanamo."" The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","The trump administration faces the first direct legal challenge to its policy of sending migrants to the us military base at guantanamo bay, cuba.

MOSCOW: Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov Sunday praised President Trump's ""common sense"" aim to end the war in Ukraine, but accused European powers which have rallied around Kyiv of seeking to prolong the conflict. Lavrov said the US still wanted to be the world's most powerful country and that Washington and Moscow would never see eye to eye on everything, but they had agreed to be pragmatic when interests coincided.Lavrov said the model of US-China relationship was the one that should be built between Russia and the US to do a lot of ""mutually beneficial things"" without allowing disagreements to collapse into war.

Some held placards saying ‘Putin Kaput’ or calling for a ban on all international trade with Russia.

LONDON: British PM Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Europe was at a crossroads in history and must do the heavy lifting to defend itself as world leaders met in London to discuss ways of working together to stop Russia's war in Ukraine. His call for European allies to increase their arms spending to shore up their own defences and Ukraine's was not a sign that he thought the US had become an unreliable ally, he said. No two countries are closely aligned than the UK and the US, Starmer said. ""One thing our history tells us is that if there is conflict in Europe, it will wash up on our shores,"" he said.The summit comes two days after US support for Ukraine appeared in greater jeopardy after President Trump lashed out at Ukrainian President Zelensky and said he wasn't grateful enough for US support. Starmer hosted more than 19 world leaders, mostly from across Europe, and also Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. ""Even while Russia talks about peace, they are continuing their relentless aggression,"" Starmer said at the opening of the meeting. Starmer, flanked by Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron, said the three of them had agreed to work on a plan to stop the fighting, and take that to the US, which has discussed brokering a peace deal. ""We need to agree what steps come out of this meeting to deliver peace through strength for the benefit of all,"" he said. ""So, let's get started.""European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned on Sunday that ""we urgently have to rearm Europe"". Before the meeting, Von der Leyen said she would present a ""comprehensive plan"" at the EU summit, adding that ""we have to have a surge in defence"" and ""step up massively"". ""It's now of utmost importance we increase spending ... it's important we prepare for the worst,"" she added. Addressing Trump, she said: ""We're ready together with you to defend democracy, to defend the principle that there's a rule of law, that you cannot invade your neighbour and bully your neighbour, or you cannot change borders with force. It's in our common interest that we prevent future wars.""Italian PM Meloni met with Zelensky on the sidelines of the London meeting on Sunday, reaffirming Italy's support for Ukraine. Her office said she expressed support, together with European and Western partners and the US, ""to build a just and lasting peace, which ensures a future of sovereignty, security and freedom for Ukraine"".

TEHRAN: Iran's parliament on Sunday impeached the country's finance minister and voted to remove him from office amid growing concerns over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement.Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf announced that 182 out of 273 lawmakers voted to dismiss Abdolnasser Hemmati , just six months after President Masoud Pezeshkian 's government took office.Pezeshkian, who defended Hemmati, emphasized that the government is locked in a tough battle with the West. He called for greater unity and cooperation from Parliament to face these challenges.The decision comes amid rising tensions over Iran's nuclear program and worsening relations with the West. Iran's economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, especially after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. In 2015, the rial was worth 32,000 to the dollar, but by the time Pezeshkian took office in July, it had plummeted to 584,000 to the dollar. Recently, it dropped even further, with exchange shops in Tehran trading 930,000 rials for each dollar.During the impeachment proceedings, Mohammad Qasim Osmani, a lawmaker supporting Hemmati, argued that rising inflation and exchange rates were not the fault of the current government or Parliament. He pointed to the budget deficit left by the previous administration, which he said contributed to the economic instability. Osmani also cited recent geopolitical events as factors that undermined public confidence, causing many people to convert their savings into foreign currency, which in turn further devalued the rial.Hemmati acknowledged the tough economic climate during his five months in office, including a 10% reduction in inflation. However, he acknowledged that inflation remained high, standing at 35%. He assured lawmakers that his team was working hard to address the issue, but warned that the process would take time.This latest development is another chapter in Iran's ongoing political and economic struggles as the country continues to navigate a complex relationship with the international community.","Iran's parliament on sunday impeached the country's finance minister and voted to remove him from office.

Trump's crypto play: A game changer or just a market jolt?

Unanswered questions: How will the crypto reserve work?

US President Donald Trump shook up the cryptocurrency world on Sunday, announcing that XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) would be included in a newly formed US Crypto Strategic Reserve . The move sent all three assets surging between 10% and 35% in market trading, reported Reuters.Trump revealed the decision in a social media post, tying it to his January executive order on digital assets. “I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World,” he declared, adding that his directive instructed the Presidential Working Group to move forward with the reserve plan.The announcement marks a sharp policy shift from the Biden administration, which had cracked down on the crypto industry over concerns about fraud and money laundering. Trump's 2024 campaign, in contrast, won significant backing from crypto executives, and his latest move signals that he intends to deliver on his pro-crypto promises.While the news initially sparked a rally, broader cryptocurrency markets have struggled in recent weeks, with many digital assets erasing their post-election gains. Analysts believe a more sustained market boost will require either interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve or a clearer regulatory framework from the Trump administration.Despite the excitement, details about the crypto reserve remain unclear. Some experts speculate it could be funded through the US Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, which is traditionally used to manage foreign currencies. Others suggest it might involve cryptocurrencies seized in law enforcement actions.Legal scholars are divided on whether the reserve could be established without congressional approval. Meanwhile, Trump’s inner circle is pressing ahead—his family has even launched its own cryptocurrency, and the first-ever White House Crypto Summit is set for Friday.With the administration doubling down on its pro-crypto stance, all eyes are now on Washington to see whether Trump’s bold move is the start of a new financial era or just another short-lived market shake-up.","Us president donald trump announced sunday that xrp (ripple), sol (solana), and ada (cardano) would be included in a newly formed us crypto strategic reserve.

WASHINGTON: Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, prompting the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to scramble F-16 fighter jets, according to the Daily Mail.The fighter jets deployed flares and escorted the planes out of the restricted airspace, the report said. It remains unclear why the aircraft entered Palm Beach airspace, though similar incidents have occurred in recent weeks.According to Palm Beach Post, three airspace violations took place during Trump’s visit to Mar-a-Lago in February. Two violations occurred on February 15, while another took place on Presidents Day, February 17. There were also reports of F-16s responding to airspace breaches over Wellington, an inland community, and another civilian aircraft flying into Palm Beach on February 18.NORAD, in its response, stated that the flares used during such incidents are “employed with the highest regard for safety, burn out quickly and completely, and pose no danger to people on the ground.”Meanwhile, Irish Star reported that Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago after the fighter jets had dealt with the airspace violations.In a separate development, Trump claimed that boxes of classified documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago residence during a 2022 FBI investigation had been returned to him. According to AFP, Trump suggested that these documents, which were at the center of an inquiry into his handling of government records, could be displayed in his future presidential library.“The department just returned the boxes that Deranged Jack Smith made such a big deal about,” Trump posted on Truth Social, referring to Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the case.“They are being brought down to Florida and will someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library,” he added.The Justice Department has not confirmed Trump’s claim regarding the return of the documents.","Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above us president donald trump's mar-a-lago resort in florida.

Elon Musk Cold Open - SNL

"" Saturday Night Live "" (SNL) took a satirical swing at US President Donald Trump’s recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a skit featuring James Austin Johnson as Trump, Bowen Yang as Vice President JD Vance, and Mikey Day as Zelenskyy.The show, which returned with its first new episode since the ""SNL50"" special, also featured an unexpected appearance by Mike Myers as Elon Musk, marking his first regular episode cameo since 2015.The sketch mocked the reported tensions between Trump and Zelenskyy, portraying their White House press conference as a chaotic exchange. The scene opened with a voice-over introducing the event: “Yesterday, President Trump hosted Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the White House, and it went really, really well. Everyone who watched felt at ease and thought the world is now a safer place.”Johnson’s Trump quipped, “It is I, president and CEO of Gaza Hotel and Casino, Donald Trump, and I’d like to welcome President Zelenskyy here to this incredible trap. It’s going to be a big, beautiful trap, and we’re going to attack him very soon for no reason, right?”Bowen Yang’s Vance jumped in, berating Zelenskyy for not expressing enough gratitude: “I could jump in here, because that’s how we planned this. What happened to ‘thank you’? Remember ‘thank you’? You haven’t said ‘thank you’ to us once the past 15 seconds I’ve been yelling at you! You didn’t say it now, but you didn’t say it now. When you walked in here, you didn’t say thank you.”The sketch then introduced Myers as Elon Musk, who arrived wearing jeans and a T-shirt, prompting Trump to shift his stance on dress code. “We love your outfit. Very official and respectful,” Johnson’s Trump said, contradicting his earlier criticism of Zelenskyy’s casual attire.Myers’ Musk joked, “Thanks, Donald, what are you doing in my office? You know, I’m the president now, right? I’m kidding. I’m kidding. Maybe not?” The skit continued with Musk discussing mass firings and government cutbacks, referencing a controversial restructuring plan.The segment also touched on the recent release of the ""Epstein Files,"" with Trump’s character saying, “And to cap off an amazing week, we’re going to finally release the Epstein Files. Yes, America is going to see all the names, from A to S. No T.”The parody followed reports of a heated real-life encounter between Trump, Vance, and Zelenskyy at the White House, during which Trump and Vance allegedly repeated Russian talking points and pressed Ukraine to make concessions. The actual meeting reportedly devolved into a tense argument over U.S. aid to Ukraine.Shane Gillis hosted this week's episode, marking his second time leading SNL since his initial controversy-laden departure from the show in 2019. Musical guest Tate McRae also made her second appearance on the show. Looking ahead, pop icon Lady Gaga is set to double as host and musical guest next week.This marked the first new episode since ""SNL50: The Anniversary Special,"" which aired on February 16 and drew 14.8 million live viewers, significantly surpassing the show’s season average of 4.9 million. The show’s return continued the momentum generated by its milestone celebration.","Saturday night live took a satirical swing at us president donald trump’s recent meeting with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy in a skit.
