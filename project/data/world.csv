Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.Valluvar, in his timeless brevity, rarely defines wealth virtue, education or honour. His genius lies in resisting rigid definitions, knowing that time may also dissolve what it defines. Yet when it comes to conduct, he commands.This couplet, recited in every Tamil classroom, does not describe(propriety), but insists on it. A man without conduct, he says, does not merely lose face—he tumbles into a disgrace so deep; no praise or privilege can pull him out.Centuries later, in the dazzling chaos of a Coldplay concert, we saw how quick a fall can be.Andy Byron, CEO of Astronomer, and Kristin Cabot, the company’s HR head, were caught on a kiss cam—sixteen seconds of intimacy, followed by awkward attempts to dodge the spotlight. Kristin turns her face away, Andy ducks awkwardly.But the world had already seen them.Chris Martin of Coldplay, unaware of the stakes, quipped, “Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy.” By the time the music ended, the footage had gone viral—not because it showed two anonymous lovers, but because both were married.The fallout was swift. Andy resigned and Kristin was placed on indefinite leave. Andy’s wife dropped his surname. Two families unravelled. The company reeled. One hug—perhaps careless—brought down reputations, disrupted careers, and scorched the moral standing of those expected to uphold company values.Too often, heroes fall, not because the world watches, but because they stop watching themselves. Power creates a dangerous illusion—that authority grants exemption from the very rules one promotes. Fame seduces. Influence dulls the inner compass. The higher the pedestal, the greater the fall—especially when leaders forget that respect is earned not by speeches, but by silent choices.Leadership without integrity is mere performance. In an age of billion-dollar companies and fast-moving technology,. Especially those made in the quiet moments where no audience claps.Byron’s story now joins the long list of fallen icons. Not because he erred, but because he mistook position for permission.I am reminded of the Tamil film, one of K Balachander’s finest. In the film, JKB, a married man and a celebrated singer, has an affair with Sindhu, his admirer. After much turmoil and soul-searching, his family agrees to a second marriage. But Sindhu walks away. Her reason — she does not want to become the precedent for moral compromise. If a great artist like JKB bends the code of public probity, she fears others will use him as a license to do the same.She chooses obscurity over validation.The film’s climax, like Valluvar’s couplet, is a mediation on the burden of those in the public eye. Fame, power, and influence are not shields—they are mirrors that magnify every flaw.When conduct fails, greatness does not fall with drama—it crumbles in disgrace. And no amount of apology, wealth, or digital spin can rebuild what the soul has forsaken.From the sands of two millennia, Valluvar’s voice still rises:It is not brilliance, success, or charm that makes a person noble.It is—the unseen thread of morality that holds everything together.Once that thread breaks, everything else unravels. Even ‘all the king’s horses and all the king’s men’cannot put it back together again.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

PM: India & Maldives will soon finalise an investment treaty

The turnaround in India-Maldives ties in the past 10 months - following the acrimonious removal of Indian military personnel from the strategically located country - seemed complete as India announced a fresh $565 million line of credit (LoC) for the Indian Ocean neighbour and signed an agreement to reduce its annual debt repayment burden by 40%.As President Mohamed Muizzu hosted PM Modi for the latter's first visit to the country under his presidency, receiving Modi at the airport, both sides affirmed their commitment to a bilateral investment pact and a free trade agreement, for which the terms of reference were finalised. Seven MoUs and agreements were signed.Muizzu had invited Modi as the guest of honour for the Maldivian independence day celebrations. India had extended an $800 million LoC in 2019 under the previous pro-India Maldivian Democratic Party govt but on this occasion the LoC is in Indian currency (Rs 4,850 crore).The president said after his meeting with Narendra Modi it will be used for priority projects in defence, healthcare, education and housing. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Muizzu reiterated the Maldives's condemnation of the Pahalgam attack.Muizzu has been seen as a pro-China leader in the past because of his association with the India Out campaign while in the opposition, and his insistence on driving out Indian military from the archipelago after taking over as president in Nov 2023. Muizzu travelled to India in Oct last year for an official visit, during which he said Maldives would do nothing to hurt India's security interests and would prioritise the relationship. The leaders then launched a Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership to resuscitate the relationship.Modi said India is proud of the fact that it's Maldives's most reliable partner and that for India, it's always friendship first. ""To give a new impetus to our development partnership, we have decided to provide a line of credit of $565 million, or approximately Rs 5,000 crore, to Maldives. It will be used for projects related to infrastructure development in line with the priorities of the people of Maldives,"" said Modi, calling the relationship older than history and as deep as oceans. One of the agreements signed is expected to bring down Male's annual LoC debt repayment from $51 million to $29 million.Modi said that both countries will soon finalise a bilateral investment treaty and their target now is ""from paperwork to prosperity"", adding a local currency settlement system under discussion will facilitate trade. There was focus on defence and security cooperation as the new defence ministry building built with Indian assistance was inaugurated.Asked whether there was any discussion about China, Misri said in a press briefing that India continued to work very closely with the Maldives on any issue that might ""impinge on not just our security but our common security in this region that we share"". Modi will participate in the independence day celebrations on Saturday and meet political functionaries.

How the ties soured?



NEW DELHI: ""For us it is always friendship first,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu on stage, the same president who came to power after advocating an ""India Out"" campaign in 2023.The Maldives has had a history of pro-China tilt, with former President Mohamed Nasheed admitting that the country has swung from an “India-first” policy to a pro-China orientation. PM Modi and President Muizzu held talks on Friday to mend bilateral ties, which had been strained following the 2023 ""India Out"" campaign and a diplomatic dispute triggered by derogatory remarks made against PM Modi by Maldivian officials the following year.The two leaders also discussed cooperation in trade, defence and infrastructure. India also announced handing-over of 72 vehicles and other equipment to the Maldivian defence ministry.In his address, PM Modi said, ""This year, India and Maldives are also celebrating 60 years of their diplomatic relations. But the roots of our relations are older than history and as deep as the sea. The commemorative stamps released today display traditional boats of both nations.This reflects that we are not just neighbours but also co-passenegrs.""New Delhi's consistent diplomatic outreach and economic support to the Maldives played a crucial role in restoring ties. PM Modi's visit to the island nation comes as a part of this effort.PM Modi's visit for Maldives came bearing several economic benefits for the country including a free trade agreement, a credit of 565 million dollars, 72 heavy vehicles to its defence ministry, 3,300 social housing units among others:India and Maldives have seen a tumultuous relationship, especially after the ""India Out"" campaign and diplomatic dispute over derogatory remarks against PM Modi.Muizzu, widely seen as pro-China, rose to power in the island nation in November 2023 after leading an ""India Out"" campaign. However, he had later denied any such agenda, asserting that the island nation had a “serious problem” with the presence of foreign military on its soil.In the initial months of his presidency, Muizzu's policies led to a sharp deterioration in bilateral ties. Just hours after taking oath, he called for the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the Maldives. In response, India replaced them with civilian staff.The Indian personnel had been stationed there to operate and maintain two helicopters and an aircraft used primarily for humanitarian assistance and rescue missions.The ties hit rock bottom, when in 2024, several deputy ministers in the Maldives’ youth ministry posted derogatory comments about PM Modi on social media. The officials were then suspended after strong diplomatic response from New Delhi. The controversy had stemmed from PM Modi’s post on X following his visit to Lakshadweep, which the ministers interpreted as an attempt to promote the Union territory as a rival tourist destination to the Maldives.","India and maldives have seen a tumultuous relationship, especially after the ""india out"" campaign and diplomatic dispute over derogatory remarks against pm modi.

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi mocked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and dismissed his public image terming it a ""showmanship"" with no real ""substance"".Rahul's remarks came after he posed a rhetorical question to the audience: ""You know what the real problem is in politics?"" prompting someone to respond with Prime Minister Modi 's name.

A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) has been issued for the region, restricting civilian air traffic between Jaisalmer and Jodhpur to ensure uninterrupted military operations.Fighter jets, including the Rafale, Sukhoi-30MKI, Mirage 2000, and Jaguar, are carrying out day and night sorties, engaging aerial targets and simulating precision ground strikes. Residents in the region have reported hearing the roar of fighter jets, particularly during nighttime drills.Sources have said the exercise is being coordinated from key airbases at Jodhpur and Uttarlai (Barmer), with sorties extensively covering the Pokhran Field Firing Range in Jaisalmer. The restricted airspace under NOTAM also allows the IAF to deploy drones, missiles, and other aerial platforms without interference from civilian flights, enabling realistic and high-risk training scenarios.India’s Operation Sindoor, launched just past midnight on May 7, marked its most assertive military response yet to cross-border terrorism.Triggered by the Pahalgam massacre - where tourists were targeted in a brutal execution-style killing - the Indian military executed coordinated strikes deep inside Pakistan, hitting high-value terrorist infrastructure.The response was swift, multi-domain, and precise.

It is essential for the military to learn both 'shastra' (warfare/weapons) and 'shaastra' (knowledge), he said.Though Air Marshal Tiwari did not specify the weapons that were used during the May 7-10 hostilities, IAF deployed Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 fighters to launch BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles for the calibrated pinpoint strikes on the Pakistani airbases and radar sites, a few of them close to nuclear facilities as well as command and control structuresThe IAF vice chief also said manned systems like fighters ""still have a huge advantage"" over unmanned systems like drones, in terms of the ""compellence"" and ""coercive diplomacy"" to be imposed on an adversary, and will continue to do so for some time.""We are giving too much importance to unmanned systems. While they have a place and relevance in modern warfare, but the kind of weight of attack, the intelligence required, the kind of damage they can cause...You have to see whether they balance with what manned aerial systems bring to the table,"" he said.Different speakers at the ""Capstone"" seminar organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies and College of Air Warfare stressed the need for India to ""prioritise"" the development of aerospace power, which was ""not escalatory"" but ""a strategic and effective tool for escalation control"" as was witnessed during Operation Sindoor. ""Operation Sindoor underlined the speed, reach and flexibility of airpower. We established escalation dominance over Pakistan,"" said a speaker.Others pointed out that India had drawn a new red line for Pakistan by stressing it will not be dissuaded by the western adversary's nuclear blackmail and continue to give cross-border kinetic responses to terror attacks in the future as well.","Less than 50 air-launched weapons fired by india at airbases and radar sites in pakistan compelled the western adversary to come to the negotiating table and sue for peace. Chief of defence staff general anil chauhan said the armed forces need to maintain ""very high"" operational readiness round-the-clock.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122914155,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-979230,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'Wrong Bodies' Of Ahmedabad Air India Crash Victims Sent to Families: India Dismisses UK Media Claim

Chandrasekaran said to have told govt about safety steps taken by AI

NEW DELHI: Brainstorming is on at the highest levels of the Tata Group and the aviation ministry to put Air India back on track after the spate of bad news, led by the June 12 AI 171 crash and regulatory actions in the past few months.Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha on Friday after three days of detailed discussions between the airline management (headed by CEO Campbell Wilson) and officials (headed by the secretary) led to concrete suggestions.""We have discussed all issues threadbare, including those related to maintenance, leadership and communications. Something positive will come out of this. India needs strong carriers and govt will support airlines wherever needed. The results will hopefully be visible in coming days once the suggestions are implemented,"" said people in the know.One such meeting went on till well after 10 pm earlier this week.Sources say Chandrasekaran informed govt about steps being taken by the airline after the AI 171 crash and some recent incidents to bolster safety.""Basically, govt was informed how AI plans to win back flyers' confidence,"" they said.It is learnt that the areas identified during the recent meetings for immediate attention include airworthiness, engineering and maintenance. A lack of spares, for instance, often forces aircraft to fly under the ""minimum equipment list"" (MEL) for a long time. MEL is a list that conditionally allows aircraft to be used with some equipment inoperative, with the condition that the same does not impact safety and that it would be replaced within a certain timeframe.The main issue, say multiple people involved in the exercise, is of culture. ""Vistara was merged into AI last Nov. Ideally, it should have been the other way round. But that is done. Both airlines have a very different culture and AI is now facing post-merger issues. During the meetings, solutions were suggested. The main issue is not operations but about engineering and maintenance,"" they said.For some time, having the better-run Singapore Airlines (SIA) - which holds a 25.1% stake in AI, with the rest with the Tatas - play a more visible handholding may be considered. It's not about the image of AI alone, which has taken a beating, but also of the Maharaja's new promoters: Tatas and SIA.The focus has to be on ensuring 100% safety, not on growing rapidly. AI has cut flights after the Ahmedabad crash. ""The culture has to change to safety first, not just for AI but for all airlines. 'Sacrifice growth, but ensure safety' has to be the firm message across the board,"" they said.The example being cited is of Boeing, which went on a rollercoaster ride in recent years, from being a ""marvellous organisation once celebrated for engineering excellence"" to an airline cutting corners for commercial reasons when it tried to counter competitor Airbus' best-seller A320NEO planes with a hurriedly made B737 MAX. After two MAX crashes in quick succession, Boeing is now trying hard to win back customer airlines' and flyers' faith by again making safe planes.",Tata sons chairman n chandrasekaran met union aviation minister ram mohan naidu and aviation secretary samir kumar sinha on friday.

All parties agree Varma ouster should be a joint call, says Rijiju

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha will take up an all-party motion to remove Justice Yashwant Varma of Allahabad HC over the cash-in-house controversy. The opposition-sponsored notice for a similar motion in the Rajya Sabha hasn't been admitted. RS secretariat, after a mandatory scrutiny, didn't find it to be in ""complete compliance with the procedure"", sources said.Former Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar's move to allow the notice is believed to have caused unhappiness within the government. Now that it has been clarified that it was not admitted, it clears the way for LS Speaker Om Birla to choose three members of the probe panel, comprising CJI or an SC judge, an HC chief justice and a jurist, to probe the allegations of corruption against Varma. The RS chairperson would've had an equal say in the matter if RS secretariat ruled otherwise.The decision about Lok Sabha taking up the matter, announced by parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju, was followed by 152 members drawn from all political parties signing the motion.The issue is said to be at the core of former RS chairman and ex-Veep Jagdeep Dhankhar's abrupt resignation on Monday. Dhankhar had accepted the motion signed by 63 opposition members against Justice Yashwant Varma despite the decision at all-party meeting on Sunday that process for the removal of the judge should begin in the LS.Dhankhar's action of accepting opposition's notice is said to have set in motion a chain of events, murmurs of a ""secret deal"" and, crucially, a move by BJP-led coalition to signal their loss of trust in the Chairman, leading to his surprise exist on ""health grounds"".Rijiju reiterated Friday that there was a unanimous decision of all political parties to move for the removal of Varma, asserting that the Lok Sabha will take up the motion.The minister said all political parties had agreed that the removal of Justice Varma should be a joint call, adding that the proceedings will be taken up in the Lok Sabha and then moved to the Rajya Sabha, in line with the Judges (Inquiry) Act. ""We shouldn't remain in any doubt; proceedings will begin in the Lok Sabha,"" he said.Section 3, sub-section (2) of the Act says, ""If notices of motions for removal of a Judge are given on the same day in both Houses of Parliament, no committee shall be constituted unless the motion has been admitted in both Houses, and where such motion has been admitted in both Houses, the committee shall be constituted jointly by the speaker and the chairman.""","Opposition motion in rs to oust justice varma was submitted, not admitted.

PM Modi is expected to speak in both the Houses.

Samajwadi Party, its chief Akhilesh Yadav and MP Rajiv Rai will take part in the debate.Opposition parties have agreed to the agenda of taking up a special discussion on the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor on Monday in Lok Sabha and the next day in Rajya Sabha, brightening the prospect of normalcy returning to Parliament after the virtual washout of first-week proceedings.Rijiju blamed opposition for washout of the first week of monsoon session, accusing it of not allowing Parliament to function despite govt agreeing to its demand for a discussion on these issues right from the session's start.Asked about opposition's demand that Parliament discuss the special intensive revision of electoral rolls in Bihar, he said all issues cannot be taken up at once and govt will take a call on other matters gradually.With the electoral rolls revision exercise being seen in govt circles as Election Commission carrying out its mandate, the possibility of a discussion on the contentious issue is slim, sources said.Opposition has alleged that the drive is aimed at helping BJP-led alliance, which is in power in poll-bound Bihar as well.

What are Alien Registration Documents ?

Alien Registration Number (A-Number)

This is a unique 7–9 digit number assigned to non-citizens by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This is used to track immigration records, applications, and status. This commonly starts with an “A”.

Green Card

Officially known as Form I-551, this is issued to lawful permanent residents. The Donald Trump administration has broken the conception that Green Card holders can't be arrested and their citizenship can't be revoked. A Green Card includes a photo, the A-number, category of admission and expiry date. This is proof of the right to live and work in the US permanently.

Employment Authorization Document



Arrival-departure record







The Customs and Border Police issued an important reminder the all green card holders that they have to carry at all times with them the proof of their alien registration as mandated by the law. ""Failing to do so can lead to a misdemeanor and fines if you are stopped by federal law enforcement,"" the reminder issued Wednesday said.This is not a new law and non-citizens are required to carry proof of their legal status in the US always but the Trump administration's reminder shows that the crackdown on green card holders, lawful permanent residents, will continue and just because they are legally residing in the country, it does not mean they will not be punished. The State Department earlier made it clear that permanent residents can also be deported if they are found flouting laws.Form I-7666 is also known as a work permit which is issued to non-citizens who are temporarily authorized to work. This contains the A number, photo and validity dates.I-94 documents a non-citizen's entry and authorized stay. This document includes the A-number for certain visa holders. This is issued at ports of entry or online for air travelers.Under US immigration law, most non-citizens over age 14 who stay in the U.S. for more than 30 days must carry their alien registration documentation at all times.","Cbp issued a reminder to green card holders asking them to always carry the document with them.
