'State sponsor of terrorism': Ex-diplomat slams Pakistan; says Islamabad glorifying terrorists on I-Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/state-sponsor-of-terrorism-ex-diplomat-slams-pakistan-says-islamabad-glorifying-terrorists-on-i-day/articleshow/123341718.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Former diplomat Veena Sikri has strongly criticised Pakistan for honouring terrorists during its Independence Day events, calling it yet another example of Islamabad’s deep-rooted support for terror groups.Speaking to news agency ANI, Sikri described Pakistan as a “terror monger” state and warned that India must remain alert.“We have always said that Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism. It is a matter of great concern to India. And our Prime Minister has now declared the new normal that every act of terror will be considered an act of war. So this is a big warning to Pakistan,” Sikri was quoted as saying by ANI.She cautioned that Islamabad must not allow its army or groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba to operate, stressing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words amount to a “huge warning” against any further misadventure.""So I hope they will heed that warning. What they did on their own Independence Day on 14th August just proves the point. They have always been supporting terrorism. They have always been supporting terrorist groups, giving them money,"" she said.Sikri also alleged that Pakistan was using International Monetary Fund (IMF) funds to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during India’s Operation Sindoor . “They are now offered to build all their buildings which were destroyed during the Operation Sindoor with government money.So all the money going from the IMF is going for this purpose. It is terrible, and the world should take note of that,” she said.In his Independence Day address, Prime Minister Modi hailed the success of Operation Sindoor and saluted the armed forces for striking terror camps in Pakistan. He recalled the Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir where “husbands were killed in front of their wives and fathers were killed in front of their children after asking their religion,” saying the operation was India’s answer to such brutality. “Our brave jawans punished the enemy beyond its imagination,” PM Modi said from the Red Fort.The Prime Minister also underlined that Operation Sindoor had inflicted “heavy losses” on Pakistan and marked a new phase in India’s fight against cross-border terrorism. Rejecting Islamabad’s “nuclear blackmail,” he reaffirmed that India would retaliate decisively against any future attacks.PM Modi further criticised the Indus Water Treaty , calling it “unjust and one-sided,” and declared that “blood and water cannot flow together,” promising India’s farmers full rights over the country’s river waters.",Former diplomat veena sikri has strongly criticised pakistan for honouring terrorists during its independence day events.

NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister's Office is likely to shift from South Block to the newly built Executive Enclave-I - a few hundred metres away - next month, sources said. Soon, the Cabinet Secretariat will also shift from Rashtrapati Bhavan to this new office complex, which is also likely to get a new name.Ministries of home affairs and personnel have almost been shifted to Kartavya Bhawan-3, which PM Narendra Modi inaugurated earlier this month. TOI has learnt that PMO may move in the second half of Sept.Officials said going by the trend of govt naming all Central Vista projects, such as Ka-rtavya Path (earlier Raj Path) and Kartavya Bhawan, signifying a change in its approach, Executive Enclave-I may also get a name, something linked to 'service' (sewa).In his address to PMO officials after taking oath for the third consecutive time as PM, Modi had said, ""PMO should become an institution of service and the people's PMO"" and that it should serve as a catalytic agent, generating new energy to provide light to the entire system.Shifting of offices from North Block and South Block to new buildings is crucial as the govt is keen to expedite the conversion of these two iconic buildings into a public museum called 'Yuge Yugeen Bharat Sangrahalaya'.The Prime Minister had recently said that this will allow every citizen to witness and experience India's rich civilisational journey.The British-era North Block and South Block buildings have been the power centre for nearly 80 years, housing offices of the Prime Minister, and ministries of defence, home, external affairs and finance.A govt source, who was earlier involved in the master planning of the Central Vista revamp project, told TOI that one of the main rationale behind shifting these top offices, which make national policies, from these two buildings was to remove traces of colonial mindset.","The prime minister's office is likely to shift from south block to the newly built executive enclave-i next month.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Saturday demanded an official discussion paper on GST 2.0 soon for a wider debate on it and said the reform should be towards a ""Good and Simple Tax"" in letter, spirit, and compliance, and not the ""Growth Suppressing Tax"" it has become.Its assertion came a day after the PM announced that GST rates will be lowered by Diwali, bringing down prices of everyday use items.Noting that a transformed GST 2.0 was a key pledge in the Congress manifesto for the 2024 LS elections, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said the PM seems to have finally woken up to the fact that economic growth will simply not accelerate unless this transformation takes place and increases private consumption and private investment.""Over the last seven years, the spirit of GST has been vitiated by an increased number of rates and the granting of multiple exemptions. The structure also seems to have facilitated evasion. There must be a drastic reduction in the number of rates,"" he said in a statement.Ramesh said simplification of the rate structure is essential, but must be done in a manner that minimises revenue uncertainty to states and also eliminates the classification disputes that have become so common. ""The GST compensation cess expires on March 31, 2026. This must be extended to offset any revenue uncertainty from the rationalisation of the rate structure,"" he said.","Congress demands an official discussion paper on gst 2.0 soon for a wider debate.

After a closely watched closed-door meeting in Alaska that lasted over 3 hours, US president Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin made their first public remarks — demonstrating both optimism and restraint about the future of bilateral relations and the conflict in Ukraine.The joint press conference, however, lasted only a few minutes.No deal was announced, and neither leader took questions.President Putin opened the joint news conference—an unusual move, as American presidents typically speak first when hosting foreign leaders.He took the opportunity to reflect on the deteriorating state of US-Russia relations, describing them as “fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War.” Emphasising the need to shift from confrontation to dialogue, Putin declared, “Sooner or later, we have to amend the situation.” He called the meeting “long overdue,” underscoring the shared history of Russia and the US, especially poignant in the Alaskan setting.A centerpiece of their private discussions, according to Putin, was the situation in Ukraine. He expressed hope that “the Ukrainians and Europeans choose to not throw a wrench in” the peace process.Putin also thanked Trump for his “well-wishing tone,” noting the need for both sides to focus on tangible results. “Trump clearly cares about the prosperity of his nation. But understands Russia has its own interests,” Putin stated, positioning the dialogue as one of mutual respect and realism.President Trump began his statement on an upbeat note, describing the meeting as “very productive” and noting a considerable number of agreements reached.However, Trump acknowledged that several major issues remain unresolved. “A couple big ones where we haven’t quite gotten there, but we’ve made some headway,” he said.Reiterating his well-known negotiation mantra, Trump stated, “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.”He announced his intention to call NATO leaders and other key figures to update them on the meeting’s progress. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, he said, would also be briefed. “It’s ultimately up to them. They’re going to have to agree with what Marco and Steve and some of the great people from the Trump administration who’ve come here,” Trump added, hinting at the broader coalition of voices involved in the process.While the meeting in Anchorage did not yield a definitive agreement, both leaders emphasised progress and the importance of continued dialogue.Trump’s decision to consult further with NATO and Ukrainian leadership signals that the path to resolution—especially regarding Ukraine—will require multilateral cooperation and careful negotiation.At the conclusion of the high-stakes Alaska summit between, Putin delivered a pointed parting remark, saying in English, ""Next time in Moscow"". This statement signals Putin's willingness to continue diplomatic engagements with Trump, potentially inviting the next meeting to be held on Russian soil.The Alaska talks, which lasted several hours, were seen by Putin as a diplomatic victory, allowing him to show resilience against Western isolation efforts following the Ukraine conflict.For Trump, the summit represented a moment to seek progress toward ending the war in Ukraine, with hopes of arranging further negotiations that might include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.As President Trump and President Putin depart Anchorage, the world watches for signs that optimism and engagement will translate into lasting progress. The message from both sides was clear: the door to peace is open, but it will take hard work—and consensus—to walk through.","Us president donald trump and russian president vladimir putin made their first public remarks.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday [Friday in the US] faced an unexpected media encounter in Alaska, where reporters bombarded him with questions as he arrived for talks with US President Donald Trump on the Ukraine conflict.During the welcome ceremony, foreign journalists called out questions on issues ranging from civilian casualties to prospects for a ceasefire in the three-year-old war.One question -- “When will you stop killing civilians?” -- drew a gesture from Putin suggesting he could not hear. Another asked why Trump should trust his words. There was no clear response to whether he would agree to a ceasefire.Such open exchanges are rare at events attended by the Russian leader, where the travelling press pool is generally limited to state-approved reporters.Later, the two leaders sat side by side at a US base, flanked by their delegations against a blue backdrop reading ""Pursuing Peace"".While Putin appeared taken aback by a volley of simultaneous questions, Trump looked on.The reporters at the summit again called out queries, but this time, Trump offered only a ""Thank you very much"" before the press was escorted out.The Alaska meeting marks a rare in-person discussion between the US and Russian presidents amid ongoing hostilities in Ukraine, with both leaders under close scrutiny at home and abroad.Ahead of the summit, which could influence the war in Ukraine and relations between Washington and Moscow, Trump said that if the talks with Putin go badly, he ""would walk.""""I think it’s going to work out very well, and if it doesn’t, I’m going to head back home real fast,"" Trump said while talking to American news broadcaster Fox News.""If it doesn’t, you walk?"" Fox anchor Bret Baier asked. ""I would walk, yeah,"" Trump replied.The meeting gives Trump an opportunity to present himself as a negotiator who can help end the conflict in Ukraine, something he had assured he could do quickly after being elected to the White House.",Russian president vladimir putin faced an unexpected media encounter in alaska.

It further slammed the Congress party's ""hypocrisy"" for claiming credit for the reforms saying it ""was not even present in the Parliament when landmark GST law was passed in 2017"".Congress leaders have contended that the Centre was only now moving on a reform they had been advocating for years. Citing Rahul Gandhi’s 2018 posts and videos calling for GST changes and a cap at 18%, the party argued that PM Modi’s announcement merely confirmed its long-standing criticism of the existing structure. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Independence Day address promised a Diwali gift for the citizens in the form of GST reforms and lower tax burden.""This Diwali, I am going to make it a double Diwali for you... Over the past eight years, we have undertaken a major reform in GST... We are bringing next-generation GST reforms. This will reduce the tax burden across the country,” he said.Following this, the Centre rolled out a draft blueprint for GST 2.0, proposing two primary slabs, 5% for essential items and 18% for most other goods, in an effort to simplify the system and ease compliance for both citizens and businesses.The overhaul plan, set to be reviewed by a group of state finance ministers on Thursday, suggested scrapping the existing 12% and 28% rates, phasing out the compensation cess before the March deadline, and imposing a 40% levy on sin goods.The current GST framework has five main slabs, nil, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, with additional rates of 0.25% and 3% applied to precious metals. At present, roughly 21% of all goods fall under the 5% bracket.","Gst 2.0 is set to be a ""game changer"" subsequently leading to a single tax rate.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day promise of cheaper daily-use items through a simplified two-slab GST structure, pitched as “next-generation reforms” and a Diwali gift for the nation, has triggered a sharp political tussle, with Congress claiming the idea as its own, pointing to its 2024 manifesto and Rahul Gandhi’s 2018 posts demanding the very same changes.Eight years after the launch of the Goods and Services Tax , dubbed as the ""Gabbar Singh Tax"" by Rahul Gandhi, the Centre, incidentally on 50th anniversary of Sholay, circulated the blueprint for GST 2.0.It proposed two main slabs, 5% for common-use items and 18% for most other goods, in a bid to make life simpler and less taxing for citizens and businesses. The revamp plan, to be discussed by a group of state finance ministers on Thursday, seeks to eliminate the existing 12% and 28% brackets, end the compensation cess ahead of the March 2026 deadline, and impose a higher 40% levy on sin goods.Congress leaders argued that the Centre was belatedly acting on a reform they had long championed. Pointing to Rahul Gandhi’s 2018 tweets and videos urging for GST reforms and limiting the rate to 18%, the party said PM Modi’s announcement only validated its long-standing critique of the current system.""For at least the past one and a half years, the Congress Party has been demanding a fundamental change in GST 2.0, and the government needs to take immediate action on this,"" the party noted.Party general secretary Jairam Ramesh said the party had been demanding “GST 2.0” for well over a year and a half, and had even included it as a key pledge in its 2024 Lok Sabha manifesto.""Over the last seven years, the spirit of GST has been vitiated by an increased number of rates and the granting of multiple exemptions.

Key extracts from partition modules

“The Partition of India and the creation of Pakistan were by no means inevitable. Jinnah demanded it; the Congress accepted it; Mountbatten formalised and implemented it.”

“None of the Indian leaders had experience in running national or even provincial administration, the army, police, etc. Hence, they had no idea of the massive problems that would naturally arise... Otherwise, such haste would not have been made.”

“Either a divided India or a destroyed India,” — Jinnah’s warning that the module says forced Congress leaders Nehru and Patel to concede.

“I never thought it would happen. I had never expected to see Pakistan in my lifetime.” — Jinnah’s later admission, as cited.

“Shortsightedness in rulers can become a national catastrophe. Giving concessions to violence to gain peace results in whetting the appetite of violence-prone groups.

India appreciates 'progress' at Trump-Putin Alaska meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-appreciates-progress-at-trump-putin-alaska-meet/articleshow/123341062.cms,"Trump and Putin

NEW DELHI: Even though the Trump-Putin Alaska summit concluded without an agreement to end the Russia-Ukraine war, India appreciated the ""progress"" made in the meeting between the US and Russian presidents, saying in an official statement their leadership in the pursuit of peace is ""highly commendable"".The Indian govt is hoping that Trump's claims about great progress being made in Alaska, and the talk about a comprehensive peace agreement even in the absence of a ceasefire, will ease the US pressure on India to review its energy ties with Russia.India welcomes the summit meeting in Alaska between US President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, said the Indian govt. ""India appreciates the progress made in the summit. The way forward can only be through dialogue and diplomacy. The world wants to see an early end to the conflict in Ukraine,"" it added.Facing an additional 25% tariff/secondary sanctions from the US for its energy imports from Russia, India would have liked to see a quick end to the war in Ukraine as it would have rendered these sanctions untenable. The Trump administration imposed the additional tariffs, which will come into effect on Aug 27, accusing the Indian govt of funding Russia's war on Ukraine.Just before the meeting, Trump said Russia had lost India as its ""oil client"" suggesting the US could do a rethink on the secondary sanctions issue. After the meeting, asked whether he still planned to penalise countries like China for trade with Russia, Trump said because of what happened in the summit with Putin, he didn't have to think about it. ""Now, I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks or something, but we don't have to think about that right now. I think, you know, the meeting went very well,"" said Trump, raising hopes that secondary sanctions on India too may not be implemented.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent raised the stakes for India, ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, by saying the sanctions on India could go up if the Alaska meeting did not go well. India sees these sanctions as unreasonable and unjustified as other countries importing from Russia have been spared such action.An agency report from New York said Trump had signalled he won't impose additional tariffs on India as he had said that Russia just lost an ""oil client"" in India.""Well, he (Putin) lost an oil client, so to speak, which is India, which was doing about 40% of the oil. China, as you know, is doing a lot...And, if I did what's called a secondary sanction, or a secondary tariff, it would be very devastating from their standpoint. If I have to do it, I'll do it. Maybe I won't have to do it,"" Trump had told Fox News.","India welcomes the summit meeting in alaska between us president donald trump and president vladimir putin of russia, said the indian govt.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony.","Russell wilson's wife and grammy-winning singer ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from benin.
