Navy intensifies muscle-flexing against Pakistan even as small arms fire continues across LoC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-attack-aftermath-navy-intensifies-muscle-flexing-against-pakistan-even-as-small-arms-fire-continues-across-loc/articleshow/120803512.cms,"NEW DELHI: Navy has further intensified its muscle-flexing against Pakistan by issuing another warning for ships to stay away from specified coordinates in the northern Arabian Sea due to its firing drills, as the exchange of small arms fire continues unabated between the rival armies along the Line of Control in J&K.The ""NavArea' warning for the specified zone off Gujarat till May 3, incidentally, is just around 80-85 nautical miles from where the Pakistan Navy is undertaking its own drills in the Arabian Sea. ""We have made it clear that if any warship or ship enters that zone, she will do so at its own peril,"" an officer said.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi took stock of his force's operational readiness during a visit to the Western Navy Command in Mumbai Thursday. The review came even as Navy has deployed several warships in the Arabian Sea, which conducted multiple firings of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and other weapon systems last week.China, which has the world's largest Navy with over 370 warships and submarines, is assiduously helping Pakistan build a strong maritime force. Pakistan has already inducted four latest Type 054A/P multi-role frigates and other platforms from China. It's slated to soon get eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines, with air-independent propulsion, in a major capability jump for India's western adversary.Amid the heightened tensions with Pakistan, IAF is undertaking long-range day and night fighter sorties, while also keeping its air defence network with a variety of surface-to-air missile systems in full alert mode.While IAF has increased the number of ORPs (operational readiness platforms) at its air bases, especially in the western sector, the force is also slated to practice operations of supersonic fighter jets like Rafales, Jaguars and Mirage-2000s, transport aircraft and helicopters on an emergency landing facility (ELF) on the Ganga Expressway in UP on Friday.This will be the fourth such ELT on expressways in UP, and the first to support day and night landings. Such ELT airstrips being established in different parts of the country, with reinforced cement concrete construction on national highways or expressways, can provide operational flexibility during conflicts.If an adversary bombs air bases, for instance, such ELTs can be used for unhindered air operations using mobile air traffic and radar control, refueling and armament-loading facilities, say officers. Pakistan and several other countries like Germany, Sweden, South Korea, Taiwan, Finland, Switzerland, Poland and Singapore also have dedicated stretches on their highways and expressways for aircraft to land and take off in emergencies or war-like events.The ceasefire along the 778-km LoC and 198-km international boundary in J&K has frayed since the Pahalgam attack, with Army Thursday saying Pakistan army posts had opened unprovoked small arms fire across LoC in Kupwara, Uri and Akhnoor sectors.","Navy has issued another warning for ships to stay away from specified coordinates in the northern arabian sea due to its firing drills.

ISLAMABAD: An official 2am warning in Pakistan about an impending Indian military offensive “within 24 to 36 hours” set the stage for an information blitzkrieg throughout Wednesday, including claims by state-run media that air force jets scrambled to force four IAF Rafale fighter jets to “retreat in panic” from near the LoC.Some reports said two Indian surveillance quadcopters hovering over the LoC in Bhimber and Kotli sectors were shot down. Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif vowed a “decisive response” to any aggression from across the border.Hours before PTV News reported that several IAF Rafales and Su-30MKIs were “spotted and chased” during reconnaissance along the LoC, information minister Attaullah Tarar put out a statement citing “credible intelligence” that India could strike at Pakistan any time.“India’s refusal to allow neutral probes (into the terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam) reveals its intent,” Tarar said, accusing Delhi of “escalating tensions”.Islamabad denies its involvement in the attack, while India blames Pakistan-backed terrorists of targeting tourists after identifying them as Hindus. Delhi has also demanded an independent investigation.Jailed former PM Imran Khan sent out a message through his party Tehreek-e-Insaf’s X account, “India must avoid reckless actions in this nuclear flashpoint .

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi in a rather unusual tone on Thursday said that if the BJP government is serious about acting against Pakistan, it should go beyond its usual rhetoric of “ghar mein ghus ke marenge” and instead “ghar mein ghus kar baith jana,” referring to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Speaking to reporters in Telangana, Owaisi said, “BJP says 'ghar me ghus ke maarenge'. If you (central government) are taking action this time (against Pakistan), 'toh ghar mein ghus kar baith jana'.

Developed under a public-private partnership by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), the Rs 8,867-crore project is expected to significantly enhance India's cargo-handling capacity and reduce dependence on foreign ports like Colombo.Ahead of the inauguration, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a post on X that the port represents the largest investment ever made by any Indian state in a port project, with two-thirds of the cost borne by the Kerala government. He described the commissioning as a ""historic moment"" and a ""new chapter"" in India’s maritime development.Vizhinjam’s strategic location—just 10 nautical miles from a key international shipping route—and naturally deep waters make it ideal for accommodating large container vessels. Until now, 75% of India’s transshipment traffic was handled abroad, leading to foreign exchange losses. Vizhinjam aims to change that by reclaiming a substantial share of this traffic.The port boasts India’s first semi-automated operations, featuring AI-enabled vessel traffic management developed with IIT Madras, fully automated yard cranes, and remotely operated ship-to-shore cranes. Its breakwater—one of the deepest in the country—extends nearly three kilometres and stands 28 metres tall.Trial operations began in July 2024, and full commercial operations started in December. Over 272 large vessels have docked at the port during this phase, handling over 550,000 containers.Vizhinjam has already made significant gains, including becoming part of the Jade Service operated by MSC, the world’s largest shipping company. The port now shares routes with global hubs like Shanghai, Singapore, and Busan. Cargo ships on this route will sail from Singapore to Vizhinjam before heading to ports in Spain and Italy.With the first phase of development complete, the second phase—costing Rs 10,000 crore and fully funded by Adani Ports—is expected to be completed by 2028, taking annual capacity to 3 million TEUs.Plans are also underway to turn Vizhinjam into a multi-modal logistics hub, with direct highway connectivity via NH-66, Kerala’s first cloverleaf interchange, and an upcoming railway link to the national network.The Vizhinjam International Seaport, now operational, is being hailed as a major step forward in India's bid to become a global maritime power.","Pm modi will officially commission the vizhinjam international seaport on friday.

NEW DELHI: The Trump administration fully supports India's fight against terrorism and its right to defend itself, US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth told defence minister Rajnath Singh Thursday evening.Singh, on his part, said Pakistan has a history of supporting, training and funding terror organisations during his phone conversation with Hegseth, who had called to express his deepest sympathies for the tragic loss of civilian lives in Pahalgam.""Pakistan has been exposed as a rogue state, fuelling global terrorism, and destabilising the region.""The world can no longer turn a blind eye to terrorism,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said Thursday, even as India is keeping all military options open amid heightened tensions with its western neighbour post the April 22 Pahalgam attack .During the 20-minute telephonic conversation with the US secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, Singh also stressed the need for the global community to explicitly and unequivocally condemn and call out such heinous acts of terrorism.“The US secretary of defense reiterated full support of the United States govt in India’s fight against terrorism. He said that the US stands in solidarity with India and supports India’s right to defend itself,” a defence ministry official said.","World can no longer turn a blind eye to terror: rajnath singh.

NEW DELHI: The US stepped in to prevent any military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terror attack as it asked both countries to work for peace. India has been weighing punitive measures against Pakistan for its cross-border adventurism, but in a phone conversation with counterpart S Jaishankar , secretary of state Marco Rubio ""encouraged"" India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.There was no readout from the Indian side but Jaishankar posted on X that the perpetrators, backers and planners of the attack must be brought to justice.Rubio spoke to Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif before his talks with Jaishankar and urged officials' cooperation in investigating ""this unconscionable attack"". The state department's Hindi account on X said in a post Thursday that under President Trump, those who support terrorism would have to face consequences.The US state department’s readouts of Marco Rubio’s conversations with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and India’s S Jaishankar seemed carefully worded, even as the US secretary of state urged both countries to work together for peace.“The secretary expressed his sorrow for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam and reaffirmed the US’s commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism,” the US readout on the Jaishankar conversation said.In case of Pakistan, it urged Islamabad to work with India for peace and Rubio asked Sharif to “re-establish direct communications”, but avoided the same in the Rubio-Jaishankar readout. The secretary spoke to Sharif about the need to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack, something that Pakistan has not done except at the UN Security Council where it joined others as a non-permanent member to condemn the attack but not before working to dilute the statement with help from China.According to the state department, Rubio and Sharif reaffirmed their “continued commitment” to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence. Rubio had last month too in a conversation with Pakistani foreign minister Ishaq Dar underscored the importance of continued cooperation on counter-terrorism between the US and Pakistan, while thanking Islamabad for the arrest and transfer to the US of ISIS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah.The two countries also plan to hold a counter-terrorism dialogue in June.Rubio was said to be encouraging other foreign ministers too to work with India and Pakistan to defuse tensions and his conversation with Jaishankar followed statements by powerful Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar which have strong ties with both countries, asking them to exercise restraint.Trump had strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and expressed full support to India to bring the perpetrators to justice. However, he later also said he was close to both India and Pakistan and that they would themselves “get it figured out one way or the other”.","The us stepped in to prevent any military conflict between india and pakistan over the pahalgam terror attack.

Police said he is wanted in a case registered in Budgam under UAPA sections 10, 13, and 39, which relate to membership of unlawful associations, involvement in unlawful activities, and support to a banned terrorist organisation, respectively.Police said Fai is “concealing himself in the US”, and has “persistently evaded arrest, obstructing the legal process and avoiding accountability under the law”.On July 19, 2011 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation had arrested Fai, along with a Pakistani American, Zaheer Ahmad. They were charged with falsifying, concealing and covering up material facts as they lobbied with US govt without disclosing that they were being funded by Pakistan govt, including its spy agency ISI.On Dec 7, 2011, a statement by the US department of justice said Fai had “pleaded guilty to conspiracy and tax violations in connection with a decades-long scheme to conceal the transfer of at least $3.5 million from the govt of Pakistan to fund his lobbying efforts in America related to Kashmir”. The statement further said: “Fai served as the director of the Kashmiri American Council (KAC), a non-governmental organisation in Washington, D.C., that held itself out to be run by Kashmiris, financed by Americans and dedicated to raising the level of knowledge in the United States about the struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination. But according to court documents, KAC was secretly funded by officials employed by the govt of Pakistan, including the ISI directorate.”In March 2012, a US court sentenced him to two years in prison for a “conspiracy to defraud the US”. However, in Nov 2013 he was released by the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland, as the court reduced his sentence to 16 months.","Ghulam nabi fai, secretary general of washington d.c.-based world kashmir awareness forum, was declared a proclaimed offender (po) under the unlawful activities (prevention) act (uapa), 1967.

The UK has a unique role to play. I propose that a special emissary is appointed right now to go to the region to speak to both countries on behalf of our prime minister to ensure not just de-escalation but that vital, discreet dialogue is sustained, maintained and strengthened between the UK and both countries to ensure that escalation does not happen. What happens in that part of the world will not stay in that part of the world,” he warned.Face-offs between Indian-origin and Pakistani-origin protesters have already led to arrests and damage to diplomatic buildings.Conservative peer Lord Callanan raised the “extremely concerning video” that shows a Pakistani diplomat making a throat-slitting gesture towards Indian demonstrators outside the Pakistan high commission. “This sort of threatening action is completely unacceptable on the streets of London, particularly from what appears to be an accredited diplomat. What actions are the govt going to take against this individual,” he asked.Tory peer Baroness Verma added: “It would be useful for the UK to send a very clear signal that inciting violence by gestures is not acceptable.”Collins said: “We urge all to de-escalate the situation. We will communicate that at all levels, diplomatically and with local community leaders.
