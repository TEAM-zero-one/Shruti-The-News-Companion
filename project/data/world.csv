Protests erupt and tensions rise





Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the Bangladesh protest and ousting of Sheikh Hasina, died on Thursday in Singapore (local time), according to a press release from Singapore's ministry of foreign affairs. He had been after fighting for his life for six days following a shooting in Dhaka.Sharif Osman Hadi, a spokesperson for Inqilab Monchoan, was shot earlier this month. He was initially taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and later shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition deteriorated. Last Saturday, Hadi was airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment, but he succumbed to his injuries on Thursday night.Sharif Osman Hadi was a key leader of the July Uprising that played a central role in toppling the previous Awami League government. He served as the spokesperson of Inqilab Mancha, a political platform that emerged from the protest movement, and was being considered a candidate for the upcoming general elections.Hadi was shot in the head on December 12 while campaigning in central Dhaka. Investigators said an assailant on a motorcycle opened fire at him as he travelled in a battery-powered rickshaw to conduct electioneering, reported Dhaka Tribune.He was first taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where doctors carried out emergency brain surgery, describing his condition as “extremely critical.”He was later shifted to Evercare Hospital and airlifted to Singapore on December 15 for advanced treatment. Doctors said the bullet had caused severe damage to the brain stem. After battling for life for six days, Hadi succumbed to his injuries at a Singapore hospital, PTI reported.With regards to the shooting, he was targeted while travelling in a battery-run auto-rickshaw in Dhaka’s Paltan area.Hadi’s death triggered widespread protests in Dhaka, with hundreds of students and supporters gathering at Shahbagh intersection chanting slogans in his name, as per PTI.Student groups and political outfits linked to last year’s protest movement accused the authorities of failing to ensure security and demanded swift arrests of those responsible.Protests later escalated, with reports of vandalism at media offices in the capital and attacks on properties linked to political figures in different parts of the country. The interim government appealed for calm, urging citizens to allow law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations professionally.Yunus described Hadi’s killing as an “irreparable loss” to Bangladesh’s democratic landscape and called for unity, restraint and patience. “No one will be able to halt this nation’s democratic progress through fear, terror or bloodshed,” he said, adding that advancing democracy would be the true tribute to Sharif Osman Hadi, reported ANI.","Sharif osman hadi, a key figure in the bangladesh protest and ousting of sheikh hasina, died on thursday in singapore.

Why the unrest matters for India?





Bangladesh witnessed widespread unrest overnight on Thursday after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader and vocal critic of ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, triggering violent protests in parts of Dhaka and attacks on major media houses.Hadi, 32, died at a hospital in Singapore on Thursday, where he had been undergoing advanced treatment after being shot by masked assailants on a motorbike on December 12. He was attacked while riding in a rickshaw and was later airlifted abroad for medical care.The shooting had taken place just a day after Bangladeshi authorities announced a date for the country’s first elections since the 2024 uprising, elections that Hadi was planning to contest as an independent candidate.As news of Hadi's death spread late Thursday and early Friday, hundreds of his supporters poured onto the streets of Dhaka demanding justice and the arrest of those responsible for the killing.At least three incidents of arson were reported in the capital, including fires at buildings housing Bangladesh’s leading newspapers: The Daily Star and Prothom Alo, a spokesperson for the Fire Brigade and Civil Defence force told AFP.Groups of protesters stormed the offices of both newspapers, vandalising the premises before setting parts of the buildings on fire. Journalists and staff were trapped inside as smoke filled the offices.Zyma Islam, a reporter for The Daily Star, described the ordeal as she remained trapped inside the burning building. ""I can’t breathe anymore. There’s too much smoke. I am inside. You are killing me,"" she wrote on Facebook.The fire at The Daily Star office was brought under control at around 1.40 am, officials said, but 27 employees were still inside at the time.""We took refuge at the rear of the building and could hear them chanting slogans,"" Daily Star reporter Ahmed Deepto told AFP, referring to the protesters.A journalist told bdnews24 that staff had received a phone call warning them that a crowd was moving towards the newspaper’s premises. When newsroom employees tried to move downstairs, they found that the mob had already vandalised the lower floors before setting them on fire. Night-shift staff reportedly fled to the terrace to save their lives.At least 25 journalists were rescued over four hours following the attack at the Kawran Bazar office, bdnews24 reported. Firefighters rescued people using ladders, while army contingents were later deployed around the buildings.""Hundreds of people have gathered here and carried out the attack,"" a police officer told BBC Bangla. Troops were later deployed to secure the area. Witnesses said protesters first vandalised the Prothom Alo office before setting fire to The Daily Star building.It remained unclear why the two outlets, both known for their passive support for interim leader Muhammad Yunus, were targeted.In a televised address, Yunus announced special prayers at mosques on Friday and declared a day of mourning on Saturday. ""Hadi's demise is an irreparable loss for the nation,"" Yunus said, urging protesters to remain calm.The violence spilled beyond media houses.Hundreds of protesters surrounded the residence of India’s deputy ambassador in Dhaka, prompting police to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, according to local media reports.Protesters also blocked a key highway leading out of the capital, attacked the residence of a former minister in Chittagong, and vandalised Chhayanaut, a cultural institution in Dhaka.Large crowds gathered at Shahbagh intersection near Dhaka University, chanting slogans such as "" Who are you, who am I – Hadi, Hadi.""According to AFP, student groups including Jatiya Chhatra Shakti and the National Citizen Party (NCP) joined the demonstrations.NCP leaders alleged that Hadi’s attackers had fled to India and called for the closure of the Indian High Commission until they were returned.""The interim government, until India returns assassins of Hadi Bhai, the Indian High Commission to Bangladesh will remain closed. Now or Never. We are in a war!,"" said NCP leader Sarjis Alm, AFP reported.Amid the turmoil, a parliamentary standing committee on external affairs warned that India faces its most serious strategic challenge in Bangladesh since the 1971 Liberation War.The committee, chaired by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, said the evolving political and security situation, marked by rising Islamist influence, weakening political institutions, and growing involvement of China and Pakistan, poses a long-term challenge to regional stability.""India faces its greatest strategic challenge in Bangladesh since the Liberation war of 1971,"" the report said, adding that while the threat is not immediately existential, it signals a generational shift in Bangladesh’s political order and a ""potential strategic realignment away from India.","Hadi death triggers overnight riots in bangladesh with arson and anti-india fury, media targeted.

(With contributions from various sources)

Parliament on Thursday passed the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, a landmark law that opens the country's tightly controlled civil nuclear sector to private and foreign investment for the first time since Independence.The Rajya Sabha approved the bill by voice vote, defeating opposition demands to refer it to a standing committee. The Lok Sabha passed it a day earlier. Once the President gives assent, the bill becomes law.""It marks a transformational moment for our technology landscape,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi , linking the bill to India’s clean energy ambitions and global leadership in AI and green manufacturing.PM Modi added in his post on X: ""My gratitude to MPs who have supported its passage. From safely powering AI to enabling green manufacturing, it delivers a decisive boost to a clean-energy future for the country and the world. It also opens numerous opportunities for the private sector and our youth. This is the ideal time to invest, innovate and build in India!""The SHANTI Bill aims to supercharge India’s clean energy transition. It also enables India to scale from 8.9 GW of nuclear capacity to 100 GW by 2047, requiring investments worth Rs 19.3 trillion ($214 billion), as Bloomberg reported.“This (nuclear energy) will be the most reliable, steady 24x7 source of energy, unlike some other renewable sources,” said Jitendra Singh, minister of state for Atomic Energy, defending the bill in Parliament.At a time when power demand is exploding-driven by industrial growth, data centers, and urban expansion-the bill aims to ensure a firm, carbon-free power source, unlike solar or wind, which are intermittent.This isn’t just about inviting private capital. The bill overhauls the entire nuclear governance architecture, combining safety, licensing, regulation, liability, and dispute resolution into one statute.Indian private firms are now permitted to construct, possess, and manage civil nuclear facilities. Foreign entities can also get involved through partnerships or joint ventures.The Atomic Energy Act of 1962 and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act of 2010 are both being repealed, making way for a single, updated regulatory structure.Operators' liability is capped (for instance, Rs 3,000 crore for large reactors), and the government can establish a Nuclear Liability Fund to cover any claims that exceed this limit. Suppliers are generally protected from liability, unless their contracts specify otherwise.The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) is now a statutory body, gaining legal independence as a safety regulator. This grants it the power to inspect, halt, or even shut down operations.A dual authorization system is being implemented. Nuclear plants will require both an operating license and a safety authorization. Every single action, from building to waste management, will need official approval.""The standard operating procedure explicitly states: 'safety first, then production,'"" Singh noted, emphasizing that India's safety protocols remain firmly grounded in the Nehru-era approach.Plants will now need two clearances-a licence to operate and a safety authorisation. Every activity-from construction to waste storage-requires approval.“The SOP in place clearly mentions: ‘safety first, second production’,” said Singh, asserting that India’s safety standards are still rooted in the Nehru-era framework.The bill is not just about clean energy-it’s about unlocking stalled mega-projects and repositioning India geopolitically.India’s 2010 liability law scared off global suppliers. Companies like GE, Westinghouse, and EDF shelved projects worth billions because of Section 17(b) of the CLND Act, which allowed victims to sue suppliers in case of a nuclear accident.That’s now gone.SHANTI removes this statutory risk, aligning India with global conventions like the Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC) and signalling to Washington, Paris, and Tokyo that India is open for business.Meanwhile, opposition MPs raised concerns in the Rajya Sabha, questioning the Centre’s decision to allow private players into the nuclear sector, warning it could affect the country’s sovereignty.“We are seeing profits being privatized, and risks being socialized,” warned Manoj Kumar Jha of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, referring to taxpayer-backed safety nets for private players.“The bill dismantles the liability framework established after the Bhopal gas tragedy,” said IUML’s Haris Beeran, adding, “Posterity will judge us very badly”.“The government comes up with an acronym first and then a policy,” said Congress’ Jairam Ramesh, accusing the BJP of rewriting history and ignoring contributions made before 2014.“It’s a milestone. We are now a first-line nation, not followers,” Jitendra Singh told Rajya Sabha, adding India’s global role in energy and climate has changed significantly.Participating in the debate, Trinamool Congress MP Sagarika Ghose described the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill as not just flawed but ""fundamentally dangerous.""""This Bill brings neither Shanti nor security... we are not debating whether India should pursue nuclear energy, India has always pursued nuclear energy responsibly for decades..."" she said.""But as a country, are we now prepared to abdicate our sovereign responsibility, gamble with public safety and place one of the most sensitive sectors of the nation at the mercy of crony capitalism and government-friendly oligarchs as well as foreign pressure?""""This Bill is not reform, it is recklessness. This Bill is not for the public, it's for profit,"" she added.DMK MP P Wilson said the Bill is a ""nuclear bomb which threatens the country's peace and security"". He also demanded that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee of Parliament.AAP MP Sandeep Pathak questioned BJP-led Centre and pointed out that the saffron party had opposed India-US civil nuclear deal due to foreign involvement.""Do you accept the opposition at that time was political not ideological? If it was ideological, do you accept that you have changed your ideology?"" he said.""Is it for money? Or do you think they will bring technology? We are importing a foreign model without importing their regulatory spine,"" he added.India is betting on nuclear while the world is rediscovering it as a climate-friendly baseload power source.Global nuclear capacity could potentially exceed 860 GW by 2050, a projection fueled by AI, data centers, and the push for clean technology, as highlighted by Morgan Stanley Research in August.Nations such as China, South Korea, and Japan are actively increasing their nuclear power capabilities. The US and EU are also showing interest in small modular reactors (SMRs), a trend the SHANTI Bill supports.India's plans are in step with this global shift:The Department of Atomic Energy reports that India's nuclear energy budget has seen a significant increase, nearly tripling from Rs 13,879 crore in 2014 to Rs 37,483 crore in 2025.The safety-liability issue remains a point of contention.Critics argue that SHANTI weakens accountability standards.No strict criminal liability for suppliers.Operators face capped compensation.Victims have limited recourse.G Sundarrajan, an anti-nuclear activist, told the AP that the bill ""takes away essential safeguards,"" making it ""nearly impossible"" for radiation victims to seek legal redress.""This also provides little recourse for any Indian citizen to claim damages from nuclear companies,"" he added.Union minister Singh, however, countered those concerns, stating, ""Wide consultations were held... with industry leaders, scientific experts, startups, and ministries.""""We took more than a year, and the bill was framed with safety and global benchmarks in mind.""SHANTI's strategic vision hinges on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). These compact, factory-assembled reactors, each under 300 MW, are designed to power industrial hubs or remote areas.Consider these possibilities:The legislation's framework permits private ownership, licensing, and safety approvals for these installations, providing a competitive advantage in clean energy for heavy industries.According to Bloomberg, L&T is already exploring SMR technology.The geopolitical implications are significant.The SHANTI Bill extends beyond energy; it's also a tool of foreign policy.By adhering to global standards for liability and safety, India is:Reviving the Westinghouse project in Andhra Pradesh, which had previously stalled.Reengaging in agreements with EDF, GE, and Rosatom.Strengthening strategic relationships with the United States, France, and Japan.This also positions India as a climate-conscious global leader, particularly in the lead-up to G20 follow-up meetings and COP summits.How quickly are licenses granted? What are the specific safety requirements? Who will be the first to apply – Tata? Adani?Who's going to take on the nuclear risk? And are the premiums even realistic?How does the funding work? What's the process for payouts?Will it actually enforce the rules, or will it cave to political influence?Places like Kudankulam have seen protests. Could land acquisition and health concerns spark fresh conflicts?","Parliament on thursday passed the sustainable harnessing and advancement of nuclear energy for transforming india (shanti) bill, 2025. The bill opens the country's tightly controlled civil nuclear sector to private and foreign investment for the first time since independence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126080027,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-651630,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

"In Obama's 2025 playlist, a 13th-C Marathi prayer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-obamas-2025-playlist-a-13th-c-marathi-prayer/articleshow/126085756.cms,"Ganavya’s rendition features on her 2025 album ‘Nilam’

Pilgrimage to YouTube: 'Pasayadan' enters global consciousness



From Pandharpur's pilgrimage trails to a former US president's 2025 playlist, a 13th-century Marathi prayer for universal brotherhood has leapt across time and tide to find a place in Barack Obama's annual music recommendations.Between international pop, hip-hop, and Afrobeats, Obama's playlist also features 'Pasayadan', a contemplative modern rendition by New York-born and Tamil Nadu-raised vocalist Ganavya, available on YouTube.Composed by Sant Dnyaneshwar, 'Pasayadan' is traditionally sung at the conclusion of the wari, the annual Varkari pilgrimage.Unlike many devotional compositions that emphasise personal salvation, the abhang casts its net wide, praying for the well-being of all beings, say cultural experts. Drawing from jazz, ambient textures, and South Asian classical traditions, Ganavya's rendition features on her 2025 album 'Nilam', co-produced by Nils Frahm at Berlin's Funkhaus studio. Viewed widely after Obama's nod, the track's YouTube music video, directed by Vali Chandrasekaran and featuring dancer David Adrian Freeland Jr, mirrors its contemplative spirit.In her 'Nilam' press statement and interviews around the release, Ganavya explained that 'Pasayadan' ""is an abhang from the pilgrimage tradition...one of the last prayers we'd sing... where the young saint prays for the sun to rise in all cold hearts..."" Describing it as a meditation on wisdom, compassion, and mutual sanctuary amid suffering, she had added that 'Nilam's' central theme is 'doing what we need to do to keep carrying on'.Marathi literary experts say the early lines of the abhang establish its moral vision: 'Je khalanchi vyankati sando, taya satkarmi rati vadho' - a plea for cruelty to dissolve and wisdom to grow. Its most enduring line, 'Bhootan paraspere pado, maitra jivanche', expresses a wish that all beings be bound in friendship. Another verse, 'Duritanche timir javo, vishva swadharma surye paaho', calls for darkness of suffering & ignorance to be dispelled and for world to be illumined by ethical light.For Marathi scholar Aparna Bedekar, who has a doctorate on sant sahitya, 'Pasayadan' represents the philosophical culmination of the Dnyaneshwari, the foundational text of the Bhagwat tradition. ""Pasayadan has emerged as its supreme prayer,"" she says. ""Through this prayer, the Varkari pilgrimage in Maharashtra came to embrace people across 18 communities, dissolving distinctions of caste, sect, modes of worship, and social hierarchy. "" Saints such as Gora Kumbhar, Sena Nhavi, Savata Mali, Narhari Sonar - and even Kanho Patra, a courtesan - became part of the pilgrimage, she notes, finding spiritual upliftment within its fold.Written in the spoken Marathi of the people, abhangs travelled not through texts alone but through memory, footfall, and voice. Satish Joglekar, author of 'Window to Ancient India', describes 'Pasayadan' as a prayer that transcends 'dharma, creed, and time', surpassing even the Upanishadic idea of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' because it urges individuals to actively become a refuge for others.The message resonates in the present day. ""The world is going through war and strife, so it is deeply relevant,"" says Prasad Kambli, director of acclaimed play 'Sangeet Dev Bababhali', which features abhangs by 17th-century poet-saint Sant Tukaram. 'Pasayadan' is about universal brotherhood. For Dnyaneshwar, this was the crux of Bhagavad Gita. What was articulated eight centuries ago is being heard again today in a different form, he adds.According to Siddha Yoga Path website, 'Pasayadan' is offered as a gift of divine grace meant for 'upliftment and benefit of all people', reflecting Dnyaneshwar's wish that compassion and joy reach every human life. The abhang, meaning 'unbroken', lies at the heart of Varkari tradition, which rejected ritual hierarchy and Sanskrit exclusivity in favour of lived ethics and communal devotion, say cultural experts.In modern times, the prayer entered public consciousness through Hridaynath Mangeshkar's composition, Now, Ganavya's version propels it into global spotlight.","'pasayadan' is a 13th-century marathi prayer for universal brotherhood.

‘It is really painful’: Justin Herbert’s beau Madison Beer gets blunt about mental health and bullying,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/it-is-really-painful-justin-herberts-beau-madison-beer-gets-blunt-about-mental-health-and-bullying/articleshow/126078576.cms,"Madison Beer mental health becomes the focus after Justin Herbert’s girlfriend speaks out on online hate and why it still hurts.

Madison Beer explains why online hate hits harder on bad mental health days

Madison Beer balances vulnerability, new music, and public life with Justin Herbert

Madison Beer is not sugarcoating it anymore. Justin Herbert’s girlfriend used an Instagram Q&A this week to speak plainly about how online hate affects her mental health, and her words landed hard with fans who are used to seeing polished photos instead of personal fallout.The singer did not frame it as a one-off bad day or a celebrity complaint. She described a recurring struggle, one that changes depending on her emotional state and one that still cuts deep, even after years in the public eye.Beer addressed the topic after a follower asked how she deals with bullying online. She said her response depends on how grounded she feels that day and whether life outside social media feels stable.“If I'm feeling good in my personal life, having a good day etc, it's much easier for me to brush it off and focus on what's really in front of me these days, which is growth I'm really proud of,” Beer wrote. “But we all know the truth is most days aren't perfect like that. I struggle with my mental health a lot, so it is really painful to go online and read so much negativity about yourself, for anyone. But especially when you are already struggling.She also pushed back on the idea that public figures should simply accept cruelty as part of the job. Beer asked people to think about the weight of what they post and reminded followers that everyone is dealing with something unseen.“It shouldn't matter if someone is struggling or not / wish people were kinder. It's so easy to think but just do really wish people would take the weight of their words, that we've all just human beings living life for the first time and not every opinion u have needs to be shared. Everyone is dealing with something and I don't personally wanna take part in just attacking or ripping others apart just because I could.”Beer added that grounding herself in her own identity and leaning on people who know her personally helps, even though the judgment never fully disappears.The Q&A came just one day after Beer posted photos teasing her upcoming album, Locket, which is set to release on Jan. 16. She captioned the post, “My album comes out in one month,” signaling a major professional moment running parallel to a very personal admission.Beer has previously spoken about feeling supported in her relationship with Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert. On the “Call Her Daddy podcast” on Dec. 10, she described the stability she feels behind the scenes.“I feel like taken care of in a way that I can break down and like I have someone to lean on,” Beer said. “And I think that’s important.”The couple publicly confirmed their relationship on Oct. 5 with a sideline kiss during the Chargers’ game against the Washington Commanders. Since then, Beer has appeared at games and shared glimpses into Herbert’s life away from football, including a recent visit to his family’s animal farm in Oregon.The timing matters. Beer is preparing to release deeply personal music while also navigating the scrutiny that comes with dating a franchise quarterback. Her comments suggest that public visibility does not dull the impact of online cruelty. If anything, it amplifies it.For fans who consume celebrity lives in clips and captions, Beer’s message cuts through that distance. The hate does not stay on the screen. It follows people offline.","Justin herbert’s girlfriend used an instagram q&a this week to speak plainly about how online hate affects her mental health.

Newly released documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein have put a spotlight on previously unseen photos of the late convicted sex offender with a host of high-profile figures, including legendary popstar Michael Jackson , musician Mick Jagger , and former US President Bill Clinton.The images were made public by the US Justice Department on Friday as part of a long-awaited government disclosure.The US Department of Justice published thousands of heavily redacted pages under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump in November.Jeffrey Epstein’s released files and contact lists include the name of Michael Jackson, and court documents show the pop star was at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion at least once, according to a deposition. There is no evidence that Jackson was involved in Epstein’s crimes, and inclusion in the records reflects social overlap, not guilt.The Epstein files include Mick Jagger’s name in contact lists and social records tied to Epstein’s network, placing the Rolling Stones frontman among many celebrities whose details appeared in the documents. There is no public evidence linking Jagger to criminal activity or involvement in Epstein’s offences.Newly released Epstein documents contain photos and records showing former President Bill Clinton in social settings with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, including images of Clinton in a pool and at events with others. Clinton has denied knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, and no charges have been brought against him.The earlier disclosures included pictures of other well-known public figures, such as billionaire Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen, philosopher Noam Chomsky, Sergey Brin and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. These photos were released by Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee, which secured tens of thousands of images from Epstein’s estate.",Newly released documents tied to jeffrey epstein have put a spotlight on previously unseen photos of the late convicted sex offender with a host of high-profile figures.

The US Justice Department has begun releasing a large batch of previously unseen files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following lengthy efforts to make government records about the case public.The release comes under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump in November. It required unclassified documents in the department’s possession to be made public by December 19, 2025.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News on Friday that the Justice Department would publish “several hundred thousand” pages of documents on the deadline, but he said that the full set will not be released at once and additional batches are expected over the coming weeks.Blanche said the department needed extra time to protect victim identities and ensure that names and identifying details are appropriately redacted.The newly released documents include a wide range of investigative material generated over nearly two decades of federal scrutiny into Epstein’s conduct and network. These materials may comprise photographs, internal law enforcement communications, evidence inventories, and other records related to multiple aspects of the Epstein investigation, according to CBS news.In addition to Friday's Justice Department release, lawmakers and committees have previously made thousands of pages of materials public through subpoenas and voluntary disclosures. In September, the House Oversight Committee released tens of thousands of pages of files ranging from court records and flight logs to videos of Epstein’s jail cell before his death. The earlier revelations included previously available material as well as a new context for Epstein’s relationships with powerful figures. No formal accusations have been made against political leaders whose names appear in the records.The Epstein Files Transparency Act also requires the government to publish a list of all politically exposed persons and government officials named in the records, along with explanations for any redactions and withheld portions, within 15 days of the documents’ release.Despite the milestone release, the Justice Department is facing criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who say the department is violating the law by not releasing all of the files by the legal deadline, which was 30 days fromt he president's signing.","The us justice department has begun releasing a large batch of previously unseen files related to convicted sex offender jeffrey epstein.

Nicole Lunders and Greg Biffle’s relationship, divorce, and life as Emma Elizabeth’s mother

Nicole Lunders is known as the ex-wife of NASCAR driver Gregory Jack Biffle and the mother of their daughter, Emma Elizabeth Biffle. In recent days, Nicole has been in the public eye again after reports confirmed that Emma Elizabeth died in a tragic plane crash in North Carolina. Officials are still investigating what caused the crash, and many questions remain unanswered.The plane went down near Statesville Regional Airport in December 2025. Local authorities confirmed that everyone on board died after the aircraft caught fire while attempting to land. The names of the victims were not released right away. Later, family friends told Associated Press and ABC News that Emma Elizabeth was among those killed. Reports also said the flight was connected to Greg Biffle’s family. As the investigation continues, attention has turned to Nicole Lunders, not for her past marriage, but because she has lost her only child in a sudden and heartbreaking way.Nicole Lunders and Gregory Jack Biffle were together for many years before getting married in 2007. During Greg’s rise in NASCAR, Nicole stayed mostly out of the spotlight. She was often seen supporting him at races but kept her personal life private.The couple welcomed Emma Elizabeth during their marriage. Even after Nicole and Greg separated in 2015 and finalized their divorce in 2016, both remained closely involved in raising their daughter. Friends have often said Emma was the center of both parents’ lives.After the divorce, Nicole focused on being a full-time mother. She avoided public attention and did not stay active on social media. Emma, however, was sometimes seen with her father at racing events and special ceremonies. In September 2025, Emma attended an event where Greg Biffle was honored at the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame, showing they shared a strong bond.That is why the plane crash has shocked so many people. Authorities, including the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, are still working to find out what went wrong. Officials have asked the public for patience as the investigation moves forward.For Nicole Lunders, the focus now is not public attention, but grief. She is being remembered as a devoted mother facing an unimaginable loss, as the racing world and fans continue to mourn young Emma Elizabeth.Also Read: Greg Biffle Net Worth In 2025: NASCAR Star, Career, Family, Income And Death In Plane Crash","Nicole lunders is the ex-wife of nascar driver gregory jack biffle and the mother of their daughter, emma elizabeth.

NEW DELHI: A Hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district on Thursday night following allegations of blasphemy, BBC Bangla reported, amid continuing unrest in the country and growing concerns over attacks on minorities and media institutions.The incident took place in the Dubalia Para area of Square Master Bari in Bhaluka upazila. Police identified the victim as Dipu Chandra Das, who worked at a local garment factory and lived in the area as a tenant.“A group of agitated people caught him and beat him up around 9 pm on Thursday for insulting the Prophet. Then they set his body on fire,” Ripon Mia, duty officer of Bhaluka police station, told BBC Bangla. He said the attackers tied the body to a tree before setting it ablaze.Police reached the spot after receiving information and brought the situation under control. The body was recovered and sent to the morgue of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital for autopsy. No case has been filed so far. “We are searching for his relatives. If they come and file a case, action will be taken according to the law,” Mia said.The interim government condemned the incident in a statement on X, which is also the first response to the ongoing unrest in the country.""We wholeheartedly condemn lynching of a Hindu man in Mymensingh. There is no space for such violence in new Bangladesh. The perpetrators of this heinous crimine will not be spared,"" the statement read.The killing comes amid a broader wave of violence across Bangladesh following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a 32-year-old student leader and key figure in last year’s uprising. Hadi, who was shot by masked gunmen earlier this month, died in hospital on Thursday, triggering large-scale protests in Dhaka.Also read: Yunus govt reacts to lynching of Hindu man; urges for peace Several buildings in the capital, including those housing leading newspapers Prothom Alo and the Daily Star, were vandalised and set on fire. Journalists were trapped inside smoke-filled newsrooms as firefighters carried out rescue operations. “I can't breathe anymore. There's too much smoke. I am inside. You are killing me,” Daily Star reporter Zyma Islam wrote on Facebook.Firefighters brought the blaze at the Daily Star building under control around 1.40 am, rescuing 27 employees. “For the first time in the newspaper's history, the publication had to be halted,” consulting editor Kamal Ahmed told AFP. Prothom Alo executive editor Sajjad Sharif said the attack was “an attack on freedom of the press, expression, dissent and diversity of opinion”.The violence has drawn international concern. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed and urged Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety of journalists and hold those responsible accountable.In New Delhi, a parliamentary standing committee on external affairs said the situation in Bangladesh was “complex and evolving” and flagged continued attacks on minorities, media groups and intellectuals. “The political events of August 2024 have created significant instability and uncertainty with incidents of violence, attacks and intimidation of minorities, tribal communities, media groups, intellectuals, journalists, academicians, etc. , becoming the norm,” the panel said in a report presented in Parliament.The ministry of external affairs told the committee that India remains concerned about extremism and attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, even as it continues engagement with the interim government and seeks to insulate bilateral ties from recent political developments.Police in Bangladesh have launched a manhunt for Hadi’s attackers and announced a reward for information leading to their arrest, as authorities struggle to contain unrest that has raised fresh questions about law and order and minority safety in the country.","A hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in bangladesh’s mymensingh district.

Brandon Lowe headline piece in Rays, Astros, and Pirates trade talks

“If completed, outfielder Jacob Melton and right-hander Anderson Brito would head to the Rays.”

Brandon Lowe could be on the move soon. The Tampa Bay Rays are in active talks on a possible three-team trade with the Houston Astros and the Pittsburgh Pirates, according to reports on Wednesday from The Athletic. The deal is still being discussed, but it could change all three rosters before the MLB offseason moves forward.The talks involve power, pitching, and young talent. If completed, the trade would send Brandon Lowe out of Tampa Bay after several strong seasons. It would also give Houston pitching help and allow Pittsburgh to add a much-needed bat to its lineup.According to The Athletic reporters Chandler Rome and Ken Rosenthal, the current framework sends Brandon Lowe from the Tampa Bay Rays to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Lowe is 31 years old and has been one of Tampa Bay’s top hitters when healthy.In the 2025 season, Brandon Lowe hit .256 with 31 home runs and 83 RBIs. He remained one of the best power-hitting second basemen in baseball.Since 2019, only Marcus Semien and Jose Altuve have more home runs at the position.

Houston is looking to add pitching depth after dealing with injuries and workload issues.Tampa Bay would receive Astros outfield prospect Jacob Melton and right-handed pitcher Anderson Brito.

The suspect in the deadly shooting at Brown University, who killed himself, was found by police through an anonymous tip about Reddit post.Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old former Brown graduate student and Portuguese national, was found dead inside a storage unit in Salem and was also believed to have killed a renowned physics professor this week near Boston.Providence Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez said the suspect, whose last known address was in Miami, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and acted alone, “as far as we know.”How Reddit post helped police?The five-day investigation got its breakthrough after investigators received an anonymous tip on December 16 about a Reddit post that suggested police look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates spotted around Brown’s campus.With that information, along with other witness accounts and corroborating evidence, police were later able to confirm that the vehicle, a rental from a Boston-based Alamo, belonged to the suspect, according to an affidavit filed by the Providence Police Department.""I'm being dead serious. The police need to look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental. That was the car he was driving. It was parked in front of the little shack behind the Rhode Island Historical Society on the Cooke St side.I know because he used his key fob to open the car, approached it and then something prompted him to back away. When he backed away he relocked the car. I found that odd so when he circled the block I approached the car that is when I saw the Florida plates. He was parked in the section between the gate of the RIHS and the corner of Cooke and George St,"" the reddit post read.That post’s information “blew this case wide open,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said at a late Thursday news conference.Police said Neves Valente killed two students and wounded nine others December 13 at Brown before escaping campus.On Dec. 15, Nuno F.G. Loureiro, a 47-year-old physics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was killed at his home outside Boston and died the following day in the hospital.The FBI initially said there was no known link between the cases. But investigators said Neves Valente is responsible for both instances of gun violence. Police believe he attended the same Portuguese university as Loureiro, the slain professor, between 1995 and 2000.“Even though the suspect was found dead tonight, our work is not done.”In a separate news conference later Thursday night, Leah Foley, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said rental car and hotel records connected Neves Valente to both shootings. The same car was also seen in the neighborhoods around the Brown campus before the shooting.“We got ‘em,” Ted Docks, the special agent in charge of the FBI in Boston, said Thursday night in Providence. “Even though the suspect was found dead tonight, our work is not done. There are many questions that need to be answered.”Here’s the latest on how the investigation has unfolded.What was the break in the case?Manhunt for Brown University shooter continues in SalemFor days, authorities faced mounting scrutiny for the lack of any major breaks in the Brown shooting case.As each day passed with limited new information to share with the public about the shooter, police urged Providence community members to search for and share any potential images of or interactions with the gunman. Security images from the neighborhood, some blurry and some enhanced, showed a masked man in dark clothing walking near the site of the shooting at various times.On Wednesday, police released photos of a second individual, saying the unknown person was “in proximity to the person of interest.”Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said this man, identified as “John” in the affidavit, came forward within an hour of the images being released.John, who identified himself as the Reddit poster to police, had observed the suspect several times before the Brown shooting.He first encountered the suspect in a ground-floor bathroom of the Barus and Holley building about two hours before shots rang out in the classroom. John described the suspect’s clothing as “inappropriate and inadequate for the weather,” the affidavit said, adding that he had locked eyes with the suspect.A screengrab from a video released by the Providence Police shows the person of interest in connection with the December 1...The person of interest in connection with the Dec. 13 shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in a screengrab from video released by the Providence Police. Photo provided by Providence Police via ReutersAfter the suspect left the building, John said he was then engaged in “a game of cat and mouse” with the man. John told police he followed the suspect to a Nissan with a Florida plate, but he didn’t go into the car and instead walked around the block. The suspect would switch directions “every time they saw each other,” the affidavit said.The two ended up exchanging words.“Your car is back there, why are you circling the block?” John recalled he asked the suspect, according to the affidavit.“Why are you harassing me?” the suspect repeatedly said.A custodian interviewed by police earlier in the week also said he encountered a suspicious person that matched the description of the suspected shooter. He recalled the dates Nov. 28 and Dec. 1, according to the affidavit. In one instance, the custodian, like John, said he observed this person in a ground-level bathroom of the building where the shooting occurred.How did the suspect end up in New Hampshire?After the suspect fled Rhode Island for Massachusetts, authorities believe he replaced the license plate on his rental car with a Maine plate to cover his tracks.Foley said security footage captured Neves Valente entering an apartment building near Loureiro’s residence in Brookline, Massachusetts, on Dec. 15 — the same day the professor was shot. The suspect was then seen about an hour later entering the storage facility across the border in Salem, Foley added, where Neves Valente’s body was ultimately found.Neronha said there are several lingering questions around the suspect’s motives: Why now? Why Brown? Why these students? Why this classroom?“That is really unknown to us,” he said.What autopsy report reveal?The suspect died from a gunshot wound to the head in an apparent suicide, an autopsy performed by New Hampshire’s chief medical examiner on Friday found, Attorney General John M. Formella of New Hampshire said in a statement.His body was discovered in a storage facility in Salem, N.H., late Thursday.He appears to have died on Tuesday, the day after he shot the MIT professor, according to the autopsy. Neves Valente is accused of opening fire at Brown University, where he once attended as a physics graduate student, killing two students and injuring nine others.Two days later, he shot and killed Nuno F.G. Loureiro, an MIT professor whom he had studied with in Portugal.","Claudio manuel neves valente, a 48-year-old former brown graduate student and portuguese national, was found dead inside a storage unit in salem. The suspect, whose last known address was in miami, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and acted alone, police say.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126086934,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-29278,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Trump Kennedy Center: Kerry Kennedy vows to remove president’s name; Maria Shriver calls it ‘not dignified’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-kennedy-center-kerry-kennedy-vows-to-remove-presidents-name-maria-shriver-calls-it-not-dignified/articleshow/126086946.cms,"‘Are You Kidding Me…’: Fuming Jeffries Calls Out Trump 'Sycophants' On Kennedy Center Renaming





US President Donald Trump’s name was affixed to the front of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Friday morning, irking some people, especially the Kennedy family.Kerry Kennedy, daughter of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, said she would “grab a pickax” to remove President Trump’s name from the Kennedy Center after letters spelling Trump’s name were added.“Three years and one month from today, I’m going to grab a pickax and pull those letters off that building, but I’m going to need help holding the ladder,” Kerry Kennedy posted on the social platform X. “Are you in? Applying for my carpenter’s card today, so it’ll be a union job!!!”The Kennedy Center board voted to include Trump’s name on the building on Thursday, and the exterior now reads “The Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”Kerry Kennedy criticised the name change as it related to her uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, saying he “proudly stood for justice, peace, equality, dignity, diversity, and compassion for those who suffer.”“President Trump stands in opposition to these values, and his name should not be placed alongside President Kennedy’s,” she wrote in a post on X.Other Kennedy family members also opposed the renaming. Maria Shriver, former President Kennedy’s niece and former first lady of California, described the change as “not dignified” and “not funny.”“It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy’s name is acceptable,” Shriver wrote on X. “It is not. Next thing perhaps he will want to rename JFK Airport, rename the Lincoln Memorial, the Trump Lincoln Memorial. The Trump Jefferson Memorial. The Trump Smithsonian. The list goes on.”Robert F. Kennedy’s grandson, former Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), questioned the legality of the new name, noting that the centre “is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law.”“It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,” he wrote on X.The centre’s interim President Richard Grenell rejected doubts over the legality of the name change, arguing on X that the board’s vote “doesn’t impact the Memorial to Kennedy set up by Congress.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Roma Daravi, the vice president of public relations at the Kennedy Center, confirmed the name change.Trump, who serves as the centre’s board chair and handpicked its members earlier this year, praised the vote, calling the board “the most distinguished people in the country” and telling reporters the centre was “in such bad shape, physically, financially, and in every other way, and now it’s very solid, very strong.”The President had teased the centre’s new name while emceeing the Kennedy Center Honors earlier this month. “The Trump Kennedy Center,” he said to the audience before adding with a grin, “Oops.”","Us president donald trump’s name was affixed to the front of the john f. kennedy center for the performing arts in washington on friday morning.
