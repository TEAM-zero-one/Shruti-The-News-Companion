'Vote Chori Is The Biggest Anti-National Act': Rahul Gandhi Slams BJP In Lok Sabha

Senior party leaders to attend the rally





‘Lacking a neutral umpire,’ says K C Venugopal





Amit Shah vs Rahul Gandhi





NEW DELHI: The Congress will hold a major rally at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital on Sunday, stepping up its campaign over alleged “vote chori” and the SIR issue, party leaders said. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and former party chief Rahul Gandhi are expected to address the rally.Ahead of the rally, senior leaders will assemble at the party’s Indira Bhawan headquarters and proceed together to Ramlila Maidan in a bus.The rally comes days after a fiery debate in the Lok Sabha, during which the government and the Opposition clashed over the special intensive revision of electoral rolls and ""vote chori"" allegations.Senior leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, K C Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh and Sachin Pilot, are also set to participate, while former Congress president Sonia Gandhi is also likely to be present.""Our party has organised the 'Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhod' rally at Ramlila Maidan. The Congress party has taken a step towards a decisive battle, and a large number of people will attend this rally,"" Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel was quoted as saying by ANI.Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy is also expected to attend the rally.According to a party spokesperson, 1,027 Congress leaders and activists set out from Jammu on Saturday to attend the rally. The group raised slogans of “vote chore, gaddi chhore” and “Delhi chalo” while en route, as cited by PTI.Jharkhand Congress president Keshav Mahto Kamlesh said the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee has undertaken extensive preparations for the rally. Describing the programme as historic, Kamlesh added that party leaders, workers and representatives from across Jharkhand have already arrived in Delhi in large numbers.Congress MP K C Venugopal on Saturday criticised the Election Commission of India, saying the country was “lacking a neutral umpire” to conduct elections. He also referred to earlier press conferences addressed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, which highlighted alleged electoral malpractices.""We are lacking a neutral umpire in this country for conducting elections. This is actually very dangerous to democracy. That is why we are going completely for a campaign and movement. The five-crore signature has to be submitted to the President of India. We are seeking an appointment... In Parliament, we also discussed this vote chori issue. Our LoP has given straightforward suggestions. Not only criticising, but we are also providing clear suggestions. ..There are a lot of complaints about the machines, the EVMs. Lakhs of people will participate in that... This is an internal party program,"" Venugopal was quoted as saying by ANI.Venugopal said the Congress has gathered over five crore signatures nationwide to highlight alleged vote theft, calling it a core democratic issue. He alleged the presence of ""bogus"" and duplicate votes, claimed that Rahul Gandhi’s press conferences exposed irregularities favouring the BJP, and said the Election Commission ignored the party’s complaint while instead targeting the Congress.Tensions flared in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday as Union home minister Amit Shah and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi sparred over allegations of “vote chori.” Gandhi repeatedly challenged Shah to debate the issues raised during recent press conferences, including claims of irregularities in electoral rolls.Moreover, Rahul launched a sharp attack on the government and the Election Commission, raising three questions that he said demonstrated how the BJP was “directing and using” the EC to undermine India’s democracy.Rahul also put forward a series of proposals, including providing machine-readable voter lists to all political parties a month before elections, scrapping the provision that allows CCTV footage to be destroyed after 45 days, granting access to EVMs, and amending laws that, he alleged, allow election commissioners to “get away with whatever they want to do.”Responding sharply, Shah said Parliament would not function according to Rahull’s wishes and asserted that he would address the questions in his own sequence. He defended the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of voter lists, describing it as a necessary exercise to “sanitise” the electoral rolls.Accusing the Opposition of double standards, Shah said the Election Commission was praised after electoral victories but criticised after defeats. The exchange ended with Opposition MPs staging a walkout during Shah’s reply, forcing an adjournment of the House.","The congress will hold a major rally at ramlila maidan in the national capital on sunday.

India Slams Pakistan At UN For Airstrikes And ‘Trade Terrorism’ That Deepen Afghanistan’s Crisis

GUWAHATI: A retired junior warrant officer of the IAF has been arrested in Assam’s Tezpur on charges of spying for Pakistan, police said on Saturday. Kulendra Sharma has been booked under BNS for waging war against India, criminal conspiracy, endangering the country’s sovereignty, unity and integrity, and destroying evidence.Sonitpur district DSP (border) Haricharan Bhumij said Sharma’s phones and laptops were seized. “From our sources and the gadgets, we discovered he shared sensitive defence-related documents and information with the Pakistani intelligence agency. Identity of those with whom he shared information is being verified,” he said.Four persons were also arrested in Arunachal Pradesh on espionage charges in the state over the last few weeks. Three of them are from Kupwara district in Kashmir, while the identity of the fourth has not yet been disclosed by police.DSP Bhumij said Sharma’s electronic devices revealed that he shared crucial information related to national security “and received instructions from the other side on WhatsApp”. The seized mobiles and laptops will be sent to the forensic lab for further analysis. Police, after receiving confidential information about Sharma’s Pakistani connections, picked him up from his house in Patiachuburi locality of Tezpur.Sharma retired from IAF in 2002, and worked as a technical assistant in the department of electronics and communication engineering at Tezpur University before leaving his job three years ago.Tezpur is the headquarters of the Army’s IV Corps and has vast parts of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, including the Tawang frontier, under its operational jurisdiction. At Salonibari, just on the outskirts of Tezpur, IAF’s Sukhoi base is located.In Arunachal, Hilal Ahm-ed (26), a J&K resident, was apprehended from Aalo in West Siang district, while an unidentified individual was arrested at Miao in Changlang. Hilal, who arrived in Aalo from Papum Pare district on Nov 25 to sell clothes at a trade fair, was sending sensitive information to his handlers, police said. On Nov 22, Itanagar police arrested Nazir Ahmad Malik and Sabir Ahmed Mir, also from J&K and in touch with Pakistani handlers.","Kulendra sharma has been booked under bns for waging war against india, criminal conspiracy, endangering the country’s sovereignty, unity and integrity.

Why India’s New Right To Disconnect Bill Could Transform Work Culture, Protect Millions From Burnout

Key provisions of the bill

Global pioneers in disconnection rights

France leads with early legislation

Portugal enforces strict boundaries

Italy adapts to flexible work

Australia joins the movement

US lacks legal protections amid rising proposals

India's parliament has seen the introduction of a new bill that grants employees the power to ignore work communications outside official hours. The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life. Employees gain the legal right to switch off from calls, emails, and messages without fear of repercussions from employers.Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule introduced this private member's bill in the Lok Sabha. As a non-ministerial proposal, it focuses on creating an Employees' Welfare Authority to oversee implementation and address violations.The legislation mandates that companies establish clear policies on after-hours contact. Workers can decline responses to non-emergency communications, promoting healthier work-life balance. The proposed authority would investigate complaints, impose fines on non-compliant firms, and educate both sides on rights and responsibilities. Supriya Sule's bill applies to private sector employees, ensuring they disconnect without disciplinary action.Several nations adopted similar measures years before India's proposal.These laws emerged amid rising concerns over burnout and digital overload in modern workplaces. Governments recognised the need to protect workers from incessant demands.France became a trailblazer in 2017 by enacting the Right to Disconnect as part of the El Khomri Labour Law, requiring companies—especially larger ones—to negotiate with unions to ensure employees are not pressured to be online after hours, helping combat digital burnout and protect work-life balance. The law requires firms with over 50 employees to negotiate agreements on out-of-hours communications. Workers disconnect from devices, and employers respect rest periods. This stemmed from labour code reforms addressing 35-hour workweeks and overtime boundaries.Portugal introduced robust protections in 2021 (Law no. 83/2021). Employers face bans on contacting staff outside shifts, with fines up to €9,690 for violations. The law covers remote workers, mandating compensation for home office expenses. It prohibits monitoring tools that invade privacy during off-hours.Italy embedded the right in 2017 smart working laws (Law 81/2017). Companies must outline disconnection periods in contracts for remote employees. Unions negotiate terms, ensuring no penalties for unavailability. This applies to public and private sectors, focusing on work-life harmony.Australia implemented its version in 2024. Employees ignore unreasonable after-hours contacts, with tribunals resolving disputes. Small businesses get exemptions initially, but larger firms comply fully. The law builds on fair work acts, shielding staff from overreach.The United States trails far behind, with no federal, state, or local right to disconnect laws enacted as of December 2025. California led the charge in February 2024 with Assembly Bill 2751, mandating policies for ignoring employer communications during non-working hours, defined by job descriptions or agreements. The measure stalled in committee amid pushback from businesses citing global operations and flexibility needs, though it could resurface. New Jersey followed with a similar 2024 bill for firms with 10-plus staff, but it too faltered. Earlier attempts in New York City and Washington met defeat, leaving workers reliant on voluntary policies.This void amplifies US work culture's intensity. Over 80% of employees report job-related stress, with more than half saying it spills into home life, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Salaried roles often exceed 40 hours without overtime pay, fostering a ""hustle"" mentality where unplugging invites guilt. Tech firms like Google offer perks such as flexible schedules and mental health days, but these vary widely, and many sectors demand round-the-clock responsiveness.","The right to disconnect bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life.

On the afternoon of December 13, 2001, India witnessed a deadly assault on its democracy. A group of Pakistan-trained terrorists drove into the Parliament complex in a stolen white ambassador car and opened fire, leading to a gun battle that lasted nearly half an hour.For millions who watched the chaos unfolding live on television, the threat of terrorism suddenly felt far more real than ever before. For the first time, what had remained confined to the 'pushed its way to the very periphery ofIt was a day that forced India to confront a question it had not asked so urgently until then. How vulnerable was the soul of Indian democracy?The terrorists, armed with automatic rifles, grenades and explosives, moved with a precision that caught security personnel off guard. They had arrived in an ambassador fitted with a counterfeit home ministry sticker and Parliament labels, a deception that helped them pass through the initial barricades.The suspicious movement of the beacon-fitted white car was first spotted by CRPF's woman constable Kamlesh Kumari and Watch and Ward staff JP Yadav when it entered from the main gate on Parliament Street and started speeding.Both JP Yadav and Kamlesh Kumari ran from gate number 11 to stop it, only to fall to the bullets of theKumari was awarded the Ashok Chakra by the President for her valiant effort. The Ashok Chakra is India’s highest peacetime gallantry award given for exemplary courage and self-sacrifice away from the battlefield.After abandoning the car at gate 11, the terrorists ran towards gate number one, where head constable YB Thapa and constable Sukhvinder Singh, taking guard behind a pillar and a wall, fired at one of the terrorists, a(suicide bomber), who blew himself up.Within minutes, the Parliament complex, typically defined by routine movement during the winter session, was transformed into a war-like zone. Gunfire crackled across the grounds. Smoke drifted through the corridors. Officers scrambled for cover as calls for reinforcements echoed across the compound.Realising they had triggered a full-blown response, the attackers scaled a wall near Gate 11, shed their civilian clothes and revealed olive-green fatigues. Each carried a Kalashnikov assault rifle, ammunition and several grenades.Security forces reacted quickly. Personnel from the CRPF, Delhi Police and Parliament Security cordoned off the area and engaged the gunmen. A fierce gunfight erupted as the terrorists attempted to breach deeper into the complex.The confrontation lasted a little under thirty minutes but left an impact far beyond its duration. One terrorist detonated his suicide vest after being shot by security forces. The others were neutralised before they could enter the main building, where hundreds of Members of Parliament (MPs) were gathered.By the end of the encounter, nine people had died, including six security personnel and gardener Desh Raj, who was caught in the sudden barrage of bullets, along with the five terrorists.Eighteen others were injured, among them twelve security personnel and a television cameraman who had been covering the events of the day.The bravery of the security teams prevented what could have escalated into an unprecedented constitutional crisis. Yet the proximity of the attack to the nation’s elected representatives exposed a terrifying reality.India's most protected address had been penetrated with alarming ease!Investigations identified the attackers as Pakistani nationals linked to Hafiz Saeed’s Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Masood Azhar’s Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), two groups that Indian intelligence agencies and global counter-terror networks had already flagged as rising threats in the region.The five terrorists were Hamza, Haider, Rana, Raja and Mohammad, who were trained at the direction of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).The attack was the outcome of a pact between JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar and Zakir-ur-Rehman of LeT, the then Delhi Police commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma had said soon after the incident.Indian agencies found strong evidence suggesting that the assault was conceived as a symbolic attack meant to cripple India’s sovereignty. The attackers reportedly intended to storm the main building and take lawmakers hostage or kill them, an outcome that would have pushed the subcontinent into an extreme and unpredictable crisis.The Delhi Police Special Cell took charge of the investigation. Within days, they traced the conspiracy to a network of handlers, facilitators and contacts in Delhi and Kashmir.Mohammed Afzal Guru emerged as the key figure who had arranged logistics for the attackers. He secured the car used in the attack, provided a safe house and coordinated communication between the terrorists and their handlers.His cousin, Shaukat Hussain Guru, along with Shaukat’s wife, Afsan Guru, were arrested for aiding elements of the plot. Delhi University lecturer SAR Geelani was also taken into custody but was later acquitted on appeal.Investigators recovered coded documents, explosives and communication devices from hideouts connected to the group. They also uncovered detailed reconnaissance notes that showed the terrorists had surveyed the Parliament complex days before the attack.Afzal Guru was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death for his role as the main conspirator. After years of legal proceedings and political debate, he was executed in 2013.The Parliament attack led to Operation Parakram, one of the largest military mobilisations on the India-Pakistan border since the 1971 war. Nearly half a million troops were deployed along the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border. The two nuclear-armed neighbours stood eyeball to eyeball for almost ten months.India identified Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) as the force supporting the terror infrastructure behind the attack. Islamabad, however, denied the charges but faced intense global pressure to take action.General Pervez Musharraf , then Pakistan’s President, condemned terrorism publicly and, in a hogwash attempt, announced a ban on Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and other extremist organisations. Musharraf also promised reforms in madrassa regulation, which was, again, a load of baloney.The Parliament attack forced India to rethink its internal security architecture. Parliament received a massive overhaul in surveillance, access control and perimeter security. Agencies adopted more coordinated protocols, and several new counter-terror mechanisms were institutionalised.The attack also exposed weaknesses in intelligence sharing. A series of post-incident reviews led to reforms in how intelligence agencies exchanged information and monitored cross-border terror networks.India’s counter-terror approach became more centralised, structured and technologically driven in the years that followed.Parliament became one of the most heavily guarded zones in the country, with multi-layered access control, biometric passes, expanded CCTV coverage, permanent Quick Reaction Teams and strengthened perimeter checks.Similar upgrades were carried out across other high-security government buildings, including the Seva Teerth (PMO) and Rashtrapati Bhavan.Intelligence-sharing mechanisms between the Intelligence Bureau, R&AW, Delhi Police and state agencies were streamlined to allow real-time information flow.Counter-terror units such as the Special Cell and the National Security Guard saw significant expansion in manpower, training and equipment, with greater emphasis on urban combat readiness, surveillance technology and coordinated response drills.Security forces received modernised weapons, protective gear and communication systems, while airports underwent rigorous audits and enhanced screening protocols to plug vulnerabilities exposed by past terror operations.The passage of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) in 2002 strengthened the legal framework for tackling terror networks and handling terror-related evidence. VIP protection protocols were revised, with tighter security during Parliament sessions and dedicated commando teams for ministers.In 2002, a designated POTA court convicted Afzal Guru of conspiracy and waging war against the nation, holding that the attack could not have been executed without his support, even though he was not part of the armed assault inside Parliament. He was sentenced to death. The same court convicted his cousin, Shaukat Hussain Guru, but acquitted Afsan Guru and SAR Geelani due to the lack of evidence.The Delhi high court upheld Afzal Guru’s death sentence in 2003. In 2005, the Supreme Court confirmed the conviction and sentence, ruling that the chain of circumstantial evidence proved his role in the conspiracy and that the case met the “rarest of rare” standard.Afzal Guru filed a mercy petition with the President APJ Abdul Kalam in 2006. After prolonged delay, the petition was rejected in February 2013. He was executed by hanging at Tihar Jail on February 9, 2013, ending one of India’s most closely scrutinised terror-related legal cases.The execution immediately triggered political reactions across the spectrum over the prolonged delay in carrying out the sentence. While the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government maintained that the hanging followed due legal process, the then home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said all legal and constitutional procedures had been exhausted.Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi also stated that the law had taken its course and urged against politicising the execution.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) welcomed the execution but criticised the government for not acting sooner despite the Supreme Court’s 2005 verdict. Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley described the hanging as “delayed justice,” while then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi said it was “better late than never,” questioning why the sentence had remained pending for years.The Parliament attack is not just an event in the archives of India’s national security history. It is a reference point that continues to influence how India perceives, prepares for and responds to terror threats.Every major terror alert, every security drill at critical installations, and every diplomatic exchange with Pakistan carries, somewhere beneath the surface, the weight of December 13, 2001.It remains a reminder of how close India came to a catastrophe that could have altered the country’s constitutional and democratic fabric. It also stands as a testament to the security personnel who prevented that outcome, often at the cost of their own lives.For a generation born after 2001, the Parliament attack may seem like a distant chapter in history. But the recent terror strike in Delhi, after more than a decade, abruptly rekindled that memory, revealing how deeply such attacks have shaped India’s sense of vulnerability, its security framework and its public consciousness.On the evening of November 10, horror pierced through the heart of the Capital. Delhiites followed the development with nerves stretched thin and bated breath as fear surged through the collective memory. Fear that revived chilling reminders of the years when a palpable dread lived rent-free in the subconscious of every citizen, particularly those in metros.The terror incident in the heart of thereopened old wounds from the past, with the attack on Parliament, which is around 6.5 km away from the Red Fort, being the first thought to resurface for many.","24 years of 2001 parliament attack.

What is the core objective?



NEW DELHI: Congress on Saturday launched a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, claiming it was ""not very surprising"" that India has been left out of a new US-led high-tech supply chain initiative, ""Pax Silica,"" citing it a ""sharp downturn in Trump–Modi ties. ""These remarks came after some reports stated that the United States has excluded India from Pax Silica, a nine-nation initiative aimed at reducing Chinese dominance in critical high-tech and semiconductor supply chains.""According to some news reports, the US has excluded India from a nine-nation initiative it has launched to reduce Chinese control on high-tech supply chains.

NEW DELHI: Former Union minister Ashwani Kumar on Friday said there cannot be an effective opposition in the country without the Congress, but added that the party has “somewhere lost ground” and must revive itself as a “national obligation”.Speaking at the launch of his book Guardians of the Republic, Kumar said the Congress still has a crucial role in Indian democracy but needs to introspect. “Congress is a great party, and there cannot be an effective opposition in the country without it.

Rahul Gandhi Demands Unified National Response As Parliament Debates India’s Air Pollution Crisis

NEW DELHI: The air quality in Delhi sharply deteriorated to the ‘severe’ category on Saturday as a toxic greyish haze blanketed the city. The 24-hour average overall AQI released at 4pm was 431, as opposed to 349 a day earlier. However, the AQI subsequently slipped into the ‘severe plus’ category for the first time this year, reaching 452 at 8pm.This prompted CAQM to impose stringent measures under GRAP, first under stage 3 and then stage 4 as the air worsened, on the same day. No respite from hazardous air quality is expected on Sunday. Experts said the AQI spiked due to high emission loads and unfavourable meteorological conditions. The farm fire season is over, while an increase in moisture due to the formation of fog, calm winds, and inversion trapped the pollutants.Among the measures invoked are a ban on construction and demolition, no entry of non-essential trucks, hybrid mode for schools, and a ban on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles.The Delhi govt has directed that all govt and private offices operate at 50% strength, with the rest working from home. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed that the AQI rose rapidly on Saturday. It was 397 at 9am, in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category, but reached the severe range at 10am at 401.According to the India Meteorological Department, the lowest visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station, was observed at 400 metres at 8am. It improved to 500 metres at 9.30am.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said, “As the atmospheric conditions are turning unfavourable with low wind speed and poor dispersion of pollutants, high emissions from local sources are getting trapped, spiking the peak levels.”CAQM said a feeble western disturbance is approaching north-west India, and the prevailing meteorological condition has marked a reduction in wind speed, at times becoming calm, a shift in wind direction from westerly to easterly, and an increase in moisture content in the lower atmosphere. “Such conditions during the winter season are conducive to the formation of smog,” it said.","The 24-hour average overall aqi released at 4pm was 431, as opposed to 349 a day earlier.

In such a scenario, establishing accurate, timely, and credible communication between the government and the public is the foremost responsibility of public relations. He noted that in a state like Uttarakhand, which is prone to natural disasters and is strategically sensitive, communication is not merely a formality but the foundation of trust.He further stated that in areas such as disaster management, good governance, and religious and tourism management, future PR systems must be fast, technologically skssm, and sensitive to public sentiments, so that the relationship between the government and the people is based not on directives, but on partnership and trust, the release added.Expressing confidence, the Chief Minister said that public relations can play the role of an effective command center during crises, while also contributing significantly to shaping a positive narrative for the nation.

No Pak film made on Lyari because those behind violence still in power,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-pak-film-made-on-lyari-because-those-behind-violence-still-in-power/articleshow/125952289.cms,".

1. You have done more than a decade of fieldwork in

Lyari

, written multiple articles and even made a documentary. How did you first get drawn into Lyari as a research site?

2. Lyari’s tumultuous gang history has rarely featured in mainstream Pakistani cinema. Why have

filmmakers

stayed away?

3. There are stories of how

Rehman Dakait

ordered his associates to play football with the severed heads of rival gang members. Does the film’s portrayal of Dakait as the terrifying overlord of the area capture reality?

4. What aspects of Lyari life does your documentary ‘Shadowlands’ highlight—stories that rarely find space next to gang sensationalism?

5. Has the area got a makeover? It’s produced quite a few hip hop stars in the last few years, including female rappers.

6. ‘Dhurandhar’ has divided viewers both in India and Pakistan. It has even been banned in the Gulf.

7. You have studied feminist movements in both India and Pakistan, and in Lyari you did set out to show that feminism is not a dull, bleak affair and can be fun. Tell us about that.

8. You have written about how more women are participating in the fight for Baloch rights. To what extent has social media enabled this shift?

Interestingly, it was my PhD research, which I conducted in the area of Zakir Nagar in Delhi in the early 2000s, that drew me to Lyari. When I first visited Lyari in 2012, I realised that many of the issues I had explored in Zakir Nagar — such as the experiences of marginalisation and stigmatisation of Muslims in Delhi — were echoed by the residents there. Both Zakir Nagar and Lyari were considered dens of crime and terrorism by mainstream media, but the reality was far more complex.While the discrimination in Zakir Nagar was related largely to religious identity, the marginalisation in Lyari was connected more with ethnicity and class. I was drawn to the stories narrated by the residents of this area and by the diversity, vibrancy and rich history of this neighbourhood — an area proudly called ‘Karachi ki maan’ (the pride of Karachi) — by those who call it home.Perhaps the main reason Lyari’s conflict has not been the subject of a feature film or drama series in Pakistan is that those largely responsible for the violence are still in power —namely, the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and the military establishment, both of whom used Lyari for their own political purposes. The PPP countered the city’s most powerful political party at the time, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), by allying with criminal gangs in Lyari, thus strengthening their power.Furthermore, approximately 50% of Lyari’s 1.5 million residents are Baloch, and the area has long been an important site for Baloch political organising. Many residents believe that the military has an interest in supporting the gangs to counter Baloch nationalism in the area.‘Dhurandhar’ seems to be almost completely based on fantasy. The only thing the film gets right is the fact that Rehman Dakait existed and that he was powerful. However, Rehman is not remembered as a terrifying monster by residents of the area. While he was certainly feared and known to have a great capacity for violence, he was also respected by many in the community and was seen as a kind of Robin Hood figure who supported members of his community through charitable initiatives and social work.When he died, the country’s greatest philanthropist, Abdul Sattar Edhi, even attended his funeral. By the time the infamous football incident took place in 2013, Rehman had long been dead. This brutal act was ordered by Uzair Baloch along with another famous gangster, Baba Ladla.Karachi has gone through many cycles of violence over the past decades. In general, those in power allow the violence to continue as long as it suits their interests. When it starts to go out of their control, an ‘operation’ is launched to return the monopoly of violence back to the state. This is what happened in Lyari as well in 2013. While the dominant narrative after the ‘Karachi Operation’ was that peace had returned to Lyari and Karachi as a whole, few spoke of the thousands of people whose lives had been upended by the violence.‘Shadowlands’ tells the story of two people who lost members of their families during the conflict, either in encounter killings or in inter-gang violence. It shows how the scars of violence continue to colour the lives of residents after the conflict officially subsided and how the seeds of conflict — drugs, poverty, unemployment, and state neglect — remain in the area.One problem with ‘Dhurandhar’ is that it flattens the diversity and vibrancy of the area. Lyari has always been a hub for art and culture. It has also been influenced by global trends, particularly those tied to the African diaspora because it is home to many people who trace their origins to the African continent. I imagine hip hop and rap music resonated with the youth of Lyari because of cultural, political and social similarities shared with other urban areas globally where local forms of the genre have also emerged. In this sense, I would not say Lyari has had a makeover, but the relative peace following the years of gang war has certainly opened a space for art and culture to flourish in the area once again.Although I am not sure exactly what led to the ban, this reflects the growing resentment of Pakistanis (including those in the diaspora) to the caricatured and inaccurate depiction of their country in Bollywood films. Rehman Dakait’s entry song is actually in Arabic, which is not one of Pakistan’s indigenous languages, even if many learn it for religious purposes. It would make much more sense to have a song in Urdu or even Balochi. Arabic only feeds into the orientalist imagination of Pakistan as an ‘Islamic’ and, hence, ‘Arabised’ nation. Such exotic representations reinforce perceptions of Pakistanis as ‘other’.My work on feminism and fun in Lyari was an attempt to demonstrate how the women of Lyari (and women in Pakistan and Muslim women more generally) are not passive victims of violence. Rather, women and girls in Lyari push the boundaries of gender norms in their pursuit of fun and leisure, through quiet, everyday acts of resistance. They might not call this ‘feminism’, but that is not important. What is important is that they are challenging gender boundaries in multiple ways, which are also worth studying.I have researched how Baloch women involved with the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) have been struggling for an end to state violence in Balochistan and for the rights of the Baloch people. They have emerged as leaders of their movement, and this has been partially facilitated by social media. Photos of women leaders such as Mahrang Baloch, who is currently in jail, and videos of their speeches, protests, and rallies are shared widely on various social media platforms. This has inspired other women and girls to join and has allowed the movement to expand and gain support within the province, nationally, and on a global scale.",Karachi has gone through many cycles of violence over the past decades. Many residents believe that the military has an interest in supporting the gangs to counter baloch nationalism in the area. The only thing the film gets right is the fact that rehman dakait existed and that he was powerful.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125952286,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1024050,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in India. In some cases, families have been separated, with some members in the US and those in India facing an endless delay to fly back.The uproar is loud; the anguish is palpable across social-media posts and WhatsApp groups. Jobs may no longer exist, schools stand disrupted, children have been torn from their parents…As TOI reported in its edition of December 10, US consulates have cancelled interview slots scheduled for mid- to late-Dec 2025. Many appointments have been pushed to March next year, and some even as far back as June 2026. This sweeping disruption followed a new US Department of State (DoS) policy requiring mandatory social-media screening for all H-1B and H-4 applicants from Dec 15. The additional vetting has sharply reduced the number of interviews that can be conducted each day, triggering mass cancellations.The US Embassy in India posted on X: “If you have received an email advising that your visa appointment has been rescheduled, Mission India looks forward to assisting you on your new appointment date. Arriving on your previously scheduled appointment date will result in your being denied.”The responses reflect the crisis families are facing. One user pleaded: “Please consider those who travelled to India before the appointment changes. We are stuck here, facing serious challenges related to employment and our US-citizen kids' education. We humbly request earlier consular appointments.”Another wrote: ""Booked my H-1B visa slot in Sept after weeks of trying. My Dec 18 appointment was suddenly moved to Mar 30, 2026. We must return to the US in early Jan and my US-citizen kids need to go back to school. Requesting urgent help.""Rajiv S. Khanna, lmanaging attorney at Immigration.com, describes the situation as “brutal chaos”. He notes that while applicants may reschedule online if they cannot attend the new date, they get only one such opportunity — and fee receipts older than a year are treated as expired.Immigration attorney Ellen Freeman warns that many H-1B workers will now lose their jobs. “We have to plead with employers to let them work from India or take prolonged leave of absence for as many as five months. In this economic environment and with deliverables pressure, many employers will not be able to wait.”She points out to the real-world fallout: “People left their apartment leases, utility bills, car payments in the US. These prolonged delays will have a devastating effect on our communities and economy. There are human stories behind each visa cancellation…”Rahul Reddy, founding partner at Reddy, Neumann, Brown, cautions against holiday travel for anyone who needs visa stamping. In his blog, he warns that travellers risk being stranded abroad for four to six months. “Employers cannot keep an H-1B role vacant for half a year. Many cannot legally allow remote work from outside the US due to export-control, payroll and tax restrictions. This means one thing: if an H-1B worker travels now, they may return not to their job but to unemployment. H-4 spouses and children will face the same delays, leading to extended separations and tremendous stress.”Calling the policy shift “poorly planned” and “poorly implemented”, he adds: “You cannot claim to support legal immigration while blindsiding H-1B families with six-month delays. Labelling this as ‘operational necessity’ does not change the truth: this process reflects a lack of preparation, transparency, and foresight. Enhanced vetting is fine but rolling it out in a way that effectively shuts down consular processing is reckless. Routine visa renewals should not turn into half-year exiles.”","Hundreds of indians on h-1b visas, along with their h-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in india.

He has not returned to work since coming home.The immigration struggle is sharpest for Mohammadmiya Mohammadasif Shethwala from Vadodara, who lost his wife Sadikabanu - the primary visa holder - and their daughter Fatima, who was born in the UK. Mohammadmiya works with a logistics firm in Britain, but he must secure qualifying employment by Jan 26 to remain legally.His friend Yusuf said: ""He came back for the last rites, but life in Vadodara was too painful.

'Warm And Engaging': PM Modi Holds Phone Call With Trump Amid Trade Talks, US-India Ties Discussed

PM-Trump call signals greater India-US willingness to engage

NEW DELHI: Amidst ongoing efforts by India and the US to finalise a bilateral trade deal, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation while also discussing regional and global issues.The conversation came within a week of Modi's summit with Russian President Putin and in the middle of renewed efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war on the back of Trump's peace plan.The two sides are looking to arrive at a common understanding on issues amid indications that US is still seeking access for its farm products like corn and soybean, among other issues. The two sides have been in talks for a bilateral trade pact since March.""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" Modi posted on X.PM Modi is learnt to have reiterated India's position that it will support all international efforts for peace.""Modi and Trump reviewed the steady progress in India-US bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments,"" said an Indian readout. This was the first conversation between the two since they had a call days after Diwali.Thursday's telephonic conversation signals a greater willingness on both sides to engage as there has been progress in most areas, barring trade, for which Trump has imposed 50% import duty on Indian products, comprising 25% reciprocal tariff and another 25% secondary tariffs for purchasing Russian oil and defence equipment.The move has hit several Indian exports, including textiles, leather, gems and jewellery and shrimps. While negotiators from the two sides have been engaging in a dialogue to resolve the issue, the Trump administration is yet to ease the tariffs, despite an acknowledgment by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that the offer on the table is the best received so far.The conversation follows recent efforts by both sides to revive bilateral engagements after the trade-related impasse. US also joined India and other Quad nations in condemning the Red Fort terror incident in a Quad counter-terrorism dialogue. Both sides also separately held their own terrorism dialogue.India and US held foreign office consultations this week with a focus on key bilateral issues, including trade and investment, defence, the TRUST initiative for cooperation in critical technologies, energy, including civil nuclear collaboration, and critical minerals.According to US, the meeting was an opportunity to translate President Trump and PM Modi's vision from their Feb meeting this year into ""concrete progress that enhances US security, jobs and competitiveness, while supporting India's long-term goals"".""The Under Secretary emphasised US' aim to deepen cooperation in defense, energy, technology, space, and trusted supply chains and the value of US-India cooperation that fuels US innovation while supporting India's rise as a global technology leader,"" a US embassy spokesperson said.While the US statement did not mention the Indo-Pacific, an Indian readout said that the discussions also covered regional and global developments of mutual interest, with both sides underscoring their shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.","Pm narendra modi and president donald trump spoke on thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation.

Kyle Tucker and Tarik Skubal emerge as bold Los Angeles Dodgers targets

Kyle Tucker is back at the center of MLB offseason talk, and this time the Los Angeles Dodgers are thinking very big. On Friday, December 13, multiple MLB insiders reported that the Dodgers are exploring bold trade ideas that could bring both Kyle Tucker and Tarik Skubal to Los Angeles in the same offseason. The talks picked up after the Dodgers recently added Pete Alonso and Edwin Díaz earlier this week.Tarik Skubal and Bo Bichette are also part of the growing buzz. While the Dodgers look at ways to add more star power, the Boston Red Sox are closely watching Bo Bichette as they try to fix infield gaps before spring training begins in February.Kyle Tucker, who currently plays for the Houston Astros, has become one of the most talked-about names in trade rumors this week.On Friday, ESPN’s Alden Gonzalez said on a Dodgers-focused show that Los Angeles has the talent and money to make something big happen.“They might even do both,” Alden Gonzalez said. “They can go after Kyle Tucker with a short deal that pays a lot each year, or they can use their pitching depth to get Tarik Skubal.”Tarik Skubal is under contract with the Detroit Tigers and is entering the final year of his deal in 2026.The Tigers are expected to discuss an extension this winter in Detroit, but league executives believe a trade could happen if talks stall.Skubal has been one of baseball’s best left-handed starters over the past two seasons and finished near the top of Cy Young voting, according to MLB.com If Los Angeles adds Tarik Skubal, the move would strengthen a rotation that already features several All-Star arms.Any deal would likely involve young pitchers and prospects, something the Dodgers have built plenty of in recent drafts.Bo Bichette is also shaping the market. One of the most expensive infield alternatives on offer will be the former Toronto Blue Jays shortstop.On Friday, MassLive reporter Chris Cotillo reported that the Boston Red Sox are among the teams monitoring Bo Bichette closely.Boston is looking for help after recent infield changes and injuries last season at Fenway Park. Bo Bichette is known for steady offense and strong contact hitting.According to Baseball Reference, he owns a career batting average close to .290 and has multiple All-Star selections.Bo Bichette missed time last season with a knee injury but returned before the postseason and remained productive.Along with Bichette, the Red Sox are also discussing internal options and veteran depth pieces such as Jorge Polanco as they plan their roster for Opening Day in late March.With winter meetings ongoing across the league, these talks are expected to stay active heading into January.Also Read: Kyle Tucker Leaves Big Impression At Blue Jays Tampa PDC As John Schneider Reveals What Stood Out",Mlb trade rumors: dodgers eye bold kyle tucker and tarik skubal deal.

What is Paige Shiver’s Net Worth? Her 55% salary hike and link to the Sherrone Moore scandal fuel nationwide speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-is-paige-shivers-net-worth-her-55-salary-hike-and-link-to-the-sherrone-moore-scandal-fuel-nationwide-speculation/articleshow/125903484.cms,"University of Michigan football is in turmoil as executive assistant Paige Shiver faces intense public scrutiny. Her name is linked to former coach Sherrone Moore's firing and police detainment due to alleged inappropriate relationship rumors. Shiver's recent significant salary increase and social media silence have fueled speculation amid the ongoing investigation.

Paige Shiver’s rising salary, estimated net worth, and why the timing has fueled public curiosity

The University of Michigan football program is facing its most turbulent moment in years, and at the center of the storm is executive assistant Paige Shiver, an employee who until recently maintained a low public profile. Interest around Shiver has surged after her name became entangled in online speculation connected to the firing and police detainment of former head coach Sherrone Moore.While no university official has identified the staff member involved in the alleged inappropriate relationship, searches such as “Sherrone Moore assistant” and “who did Sherrone Moore have a relationship with” have driven Shiver into the national spotlight. Paige's sudden social media silence and a significant salary increase have added new layers to a story that continues to unfold.Public payroll filings show that Paige Shiver’s salary held steady at $58,025 for two years before climbing to $90,000 for the 2024–25 fiscal cycle, a 55.11% jump that many observers viewed as unusually steep for an executive assistant role. Based on Paige's salary history, limited public records, and the absence of additional disclosed income streams, Shiver’s estimated net worth likely falls in the $150,000 to $200,000 range.As online rumors intensified, Shiver reportedly “switched her Instagram account to private,” a move that social media users interpreted as a sign of the pressure surrounding her. Yet there is no confirmed link between the pay hike and the university’s investigation, and officials have not named her in any formal capacity. Still, the scrutiny grew louder as Sherrone Moore’s professional downfall accelerated.Sherrone Moore, who became a rising coaching star after stepping in during Jim Harbaugh’s suspension and later leading Michigan to major wins, was abruptly dismissed after allegations surfaced of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.“Ex-Michigan coach Sherrone Moore was detained by police in Saline, Mich. this evening and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township for investigation into potential charges,” according to ESPN’s Pete Thamel via Dan Wetzel..With Biff Poggi appointed interim head coach and speculation swirling around the future of the Wolverines’ program, Paige Shiver’s name remains tied to one of the most chaotic weeks in Michigan football history, even as the facts remain unsettled and the investigation ongoing.Also Read: Why Sherrone Moore ended up in police custody amid Michigan firing him for alleged ‘inappropriate relationship’ scandal",Paige shiver is an executive assistant at the university of michigan football program.

"Epstein cache surfaces: House panel unveils 19 fresh photos; Trump, Clinton, Bill Gates appear in new images",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-cache-surfaces-house-panel-unveils-19-fresh-photos-trump-clinton-bill-gates-appear-in-new-images/articleshow/125937405.cms,"'I Know Nothing, Many Were…’: Trump Reacts To New Epstein Estate Leaked Photos





NEW DELHI: House Oversight Committee Democrats on Friday released a set of photographs obtained from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, revealing images of several high-profile figures who had interacted with the disgraced financier over the years, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Steve Bannon, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and others.The photos, 19 in total, were part of a larger cache of more than 95,000 images the estate turned over to congressional investigators. While many of the individuals shown had previously been linked to Epstein, the newly released images offered additional glimpses into their associations. None of the photographs depicted sexual misconduct or involved underage girls, and it remained unclear when or where they were taken.Among the images was a bowl of novelty condoms featuring a caricature of Trump labelled “Trump condom 4.50,” with each packet printed with the phrase “I’m HUUUUGE!” Another showed Trump with a group of women whose faces were redacted. Additional photos included Epstein and Steve Bannon posing in a mirror, Bill Clinton alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Bill Gates with the former Prince Andrew, and images of former Harvard President Larry Summers and attorney Alan Dershowitz.The Republican-led committee had obtained the images as part of its ongoing probe into Epstein’s network and influence. Lawyers for the estate told the panel in a letter that the materials spanned photos and videos taken at any property owned or used by Epstein between 1990 and 2019. They added that only minimal redactions had been applied for nudity. Democrats said the production included “over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein” as well as thousands of images of women and Epstein properties.Rep Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, said, “It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends. These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW. ”Republicans pushed back, accusing Democrats of selectively releasing images to create a misleading narrative about Trump. A committee spokesperson said, “We received over 95,000 photos and Democrats released just a handful. Democrats’ hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we have received shows any wrongdoing. It is shameful Rep Garcia and Democrats continue to put politics above justice for the survivors. ”CNN has reached out to representatives for Trump, Clinton, Bannon, Gates, Summers, Dershowitz, Richard Branson and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing related to Epstein, and his spokesperson has said he severed ties well before Epstein’s 2019 arrest. Gates’ representatives have also repeatedly denied that Epstein ever worked for him, and Gates has previously called his interactions with Epstein “a huge mistake. ”Trump and his aides have portrayed the renewed focus on his past connection to Epstein as politically motivated. In earlier emails released by the committee, Epstein claimed that Trump “spent hours” with accuser Virginia Giuffre and “knew about the girls,” assertions Trump has dismissed as false, with White House officials calling the claims a “hoax.”The fallout from associations with Epstein has extended far beyond politics. Larry Summers stepped back from teaching at Harvard and left the OpenAI board, saying he was “deeply ashamed” of maintaining ties with Epstein. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor relinquished the use of his royal titles after public scrutiny intensified, though he has denied misconduct allegations.The latest disclosures add to the growing trove of documents, emails and images shaping the committee’s widening inquiry into the late financier’s network of influence, which continues to cast a shadow over figures across politics, academia, technology and global business.","'i know nothing, many were…’: trump reacts to new epstein estate leaked photos.
