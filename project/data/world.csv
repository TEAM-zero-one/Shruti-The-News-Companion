NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday criticised Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi for his remarks on India’s manufacturing sector during his visit to Germany, accusing him of “insulting India from foreign soil” at a time when Parliament is in session.BJP MP Sambit Patra said the LoP carries a “huge responsibility” and needs to behave in a “responsible manner”, especially while travelling abroad.""LoP has a huge responsibility. The LoP has to behave in a really responsible manner, especially when the LoP is on foreign soil. Parliament is in session here, several Bills are being discussed in the House and Rahul Gandhi is in Germany to address the Indian diaspora.” Patra said.Referring to Rahul Gandhi’s visit to the BMW factory in Munich, Patra alleged that the Congress leader praised German manufacturing while portraying India in a bad light.“Today, we saw Rahul Gandhi visiting BMW factory in Munich and there, he appreciated their manufacturing and said that he is sad that manufacturing is poor in India,” Patra said.The Puri MP rejected Rahul’s claims of Indian manufacturing being in a fragile state and declining, citing data.“Insofar as manufacturing is concerned, IIP (index of industrial production) is on a positive growth trend. In 2025 manufacturing in the country has grown at a record 5.4 per cent. Also right now our GDP is growing at 8.2 per cent, we’re among the fastest growing GDPs in the world, in which around 17 per cent contribution is of manufacturing,” he further added, “Rahul and responsibility can never move together. Whenever he visits abroad, he insults Parliament and India. ”Earlier in the day Congress on X posted a video of Rahul Gandhi visiting the automobile major BMW’s headquarters in Munich. The post added that he inspected several cars and motorcycles at the plant.“He was pleased to see TVS’s 450cc motorcycle, developed in partnership with BMW—a proud moment to witness Indian engineering on display,” the post read.In the same post, Rahul reiterated his criticism of the Centre's manufacturing policy. Congress quoted him saying, “Manufacturing is the backbone of strong economies. Sadly, in India, manufacturing is declining. For us to accelerate growth, we need to produce more - build meaningful manufacturing ecosystems, and create high-quality jobs at scale.”In a video shared by the party, Gandhi said, “India needs to start producing. Production is the key for the success of any country. And our manufacturing is declining which actually should be going up.”Rahul Gandhi is currently in Germany as part of an outreach programme and is scheduled to address the Indian diaspora in Berlin on December 17.",The bharatiya janata party (bjp) criticised lok sabha leader of opposition rahul gandhi for his remarks on india’s manufacturing sector during his visit to germany.

From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday gave its nod to the the nuclear energy bill called the ""Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill (SHANTI), 2025"". The bill was passed as opposition staged a walkout, during the ongoing Winter Session.The amended bill was tabled in the lower house, with introduction by MoS for department of atomic energy Jitendra Singh in the House on Monday, signifying a policy shift in the atomic sector operations. The bill allows entry of private players into the industry, something that was reserved for government enterprises till now. Singh said that it provides for “a pragmatic civil liability regime for nuclear damage and to confer statutory status to Atomic Energy Regulatory Board. ""The proposed legislation further aims to facilitate significant growth in nuclear energy and its applications across multiple sectors. This aligns with country's target to establish 100GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. The law introduces fresh regulatory provisions encompassing updated safety protocols, a specialised nuclear tribunal for resolving disputes, and modifications to the nuclear liability framework to limit risks and encourage investments.The proposed legislation permits private enterprises and their collaborative ventures to seek authorisation for establishing and running nuclear facilities, as well as transporting nuclear fuel. However, crucial operations including uranium enrichment, spent fuel handling and heavy water manufacturing shall continue to be exclusively managed by the Central government. The Centre will maintain oversight of radioactive materials and radiation-producing apparatus to ensure proper safety standards.","The bill was passed as opposition staged a walkout, during the ongoing winter session.

'Insulting the army has become the hallmark of the Congress'

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Wednesday refused to apologise for his remarks on Operation Sindoor , saying the Constitution gives him the right to ask questions.“Why will I apologise? It is out of the question. The Constitution gives me the right to ask questions,” Chavan said when asked whether he would apologise for his remarks.This comes a day after Chavan stirred controversy by claiming that India was “completely defeated” on the first day of Operation Sindoor, while questioning the conduct of the military operation.Speaking to reporters in Pune, Chavan alleged that India suffered setbacks on the first day of the operation.“On the first day (of Operation Sindoor), we were completely defeated. In the half-hour aerial engagement that took place on the 7th, we were fully defeated, whether people accept it or not. Indian aircraft were shot down. The Air Force was completely grounded, and not a single aircraft flew. If any aircraft had taken off from Gwalior, Bathinda or Sirsa, there was a high probability of being shot down by Pakistan, which is why the Air Force was fully grounded,” Chavan said.The Congress leader further alleged that Operation Sindoor involved only aerial and missile warfare and saw no ground movement by the armed forces.""Recently, we saw during Operation Sindoor, there was not even a one-kilometre movement of the military... Whatever happened over two or three days was only an aerial war and missile warfare. In the future too, wars will be fought in the same way. In such a situation, do we really need to maintain an army of 12 lakh soldiers, or can we make they do some other work?"" Chavan said.Reacting strongly, BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla accused the Congress of repeatedly disrespecting the Indian Armed Forces and undermining national security operations.Poonawalla said the statements made by the former Maharashtra chief minister were “shocking” and targeted the Air Force and the armed forces.""Insulting the army has become the hallmark of the Congress party... This is not just Prithviraj Chavan's statement; Rahul Gandhi has also made similar statements,"" Poonawalla said.All these statements reflect Rahul Gandhi's mindset, which is why Rahul Gandhi or the Congress party does not take any action against such leaders... These statements reveal their anti-army mentality,"" he added.Union minister Giriraj Singh also launched a broadside against Chavan and said that no one has the right to ""insult the valour of the Armed Forces.""""No one has the right to insult the valour of the Armed Forces. Those who do so can never think of the nation’s interest....It has become Congress’s habit to insult the Armed Forces,” Giriraj Singh said.Operation Sindoor was launched by India on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The operation was carried out in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 civilians were killed.","Ex-maharashtra cm prithviraj chavan's 'op sindoor' remark sparks row, bjp hits back.

Bangladesh Leader’s Seven Sisters Remark Triggers Diplomatic Row, India Summons Envoy Issues Warning

Expect you to ensure safety of our posts, missions, India tells B’desh interim govt

New Delhi/Dhaka: India summoned Bangladesh high commissioner Riaz Hamidullah on Wednesday to express strong concerns at the deteriorating security environment in Bangladesh. In a statement, MEA said its attention was drawn, in particular, to activities of some extremist elements who have announced plans to create a security situation around the Indian mission in Dhaka, report Sachin Parashar & Ahsan Tasnim.In Dhaka, hundreds of protesters, under the banner of ""July Oikya (July Unity)"", began a march towards the Indian High Commission on Wednesday afternoon, raising anti-India slogans and pressing several demands, including prevention of ""anti-Bangladesh conspiracies"" and the return of former PM Sheikh Hasina.Former PM Sheikh Hasina had fled Bangladesh last year following the “July Uprising” against her govt.Hamidullah was also told that India expects the interim govt to ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations.Officials in Dhaka said the protest march was stopped and security around the high commission strengthened.Earlier in the day, the Indian Visa Application Centre in Dhaka suspended its operations from the afternoon due to the prevailing security situation.Indian govt also completely rejected as false the narrative sought to be created by extremist elements regarding certain recent events in Bangladesh. “It is unfortunate that the interim govt has neither conducted a thorough investigation nor shared meaningful evidence with India regarding the incidents,” said the ministry.India reiterated it has close and friendly relations with the people of Bangladesh rooted in the liberation struggle, and strengthened through various developmental and people-to-people initiatives.“We are in favour of peace and stability in Bangladesh and have consistently called for free, fair, inclusive and credible polls, conducted in a peaceful atmosphere,” it said.Bangladesh foreign adviser Touhid Hossain, however, said summoning the high commissioner was a “normal diplomatic practice”. The Indian high commissioner had been summoned a few days earlier, he told reporters. “It is better to accept the reality that from the beginning of the interim govt till today, there has been tension with India”, but the govt is trying to build a good working relationship with India, he said.He also said Bangladesh does not want advice from India on how its elections should be conducted. The govt is committed to holding free and fair election, Hossain said, adding, “We know we will hold a fair election, and we will do so.” Referring to Hasina’s tenure, he said India did not issue similar calls for fair elections over past 15 years.","India summons bangladesh high commissioner riaz hamidullah to express strong concerns at the deteriorating security environment in bangladesh.

The rest is likely to be set up by public and private sector companies.While the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) is setting up four reactors with a capacity of 4 GW in cooperation with the Russia, he said NPCIL plans to set up another 17.6 GW of capacity with foreign cooperation as part of its roadmap to reach about 54 GW by 2047. The National Thermal Power Corporation has also entered into a joint venture with NPCIL named Anushakti Vidhyut Nigam Limited to take up nuclear power generation and associated activities, and has approved the Mahi Banswara project (four units of 700 MW).At present, there are 24 nuclear power plants in commercial operation with a total capacity of 8,780 MW, while eight nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 6,600 MW are at various stages of construction and commissioning, and 10 reactors (7,000 MW) are under pre-project activities, Singh said.",India is expected to have at least five indigenously designed and developed small modular reactors (smrs) under the nuclear energy mission by 2033.

NEW DELHI: : Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the nuclear energy bill that seeks to open the civil nuclear sector to private players, even as opposition members strongly opposed it in its present form over safety and liability concerns while seeking its further scrutiny. The govt, however, defended the proposed legislation, saying it retains ""strong safety and liability safeguards"".The bill was passed by voice vote amid a walkout by most of the opposition members with Union minister Jitendra Singh during his reply assuring the House that the proposed legislation seeks to ""modernise India’s nuclear framework in line with contemporary technological, economic and energy realities, while retaining and strengthening core safety, security and regulatory safeguards that have been in place since the Atomic Energy Act of 1962"". He emphasised that private participation is needed to meet India's 2047 clean energy goals.Removal of the clause related to liability of suppliers of nuclear equipment was the main concern of most of the opposition members as they argued that the omission of such liability would prove to be harmful for India in case of a nuclear disaster.Singh, however, said the bill - Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill - does not dilute compensation to victims and the operator liability has been rationalised through graded caps linked to reactor size to encourage newer technologies such as small modular reactors, while ensuring that full compensation is available to affected persons through a multi-layered mechanism.He maintained that supplier liability was removed after detailed consideration of global practices and advances in reactor safety, while negligence and penal provisions remain enforceable under the law.Referring to the opposition members' concerns, the minister clarified that private entities will not have control over sensitive materials, and that spent fuel management will continue to be handled by the govt, as has been the practice for decades.Noting India's efforts to move towards non-fossil fuel energy sources, Singh said the scaling up of nuclear energy is essential to meet rising demand from sectors such as data processing, healthcare and industry, alongside renewables. The bill, he said, enables responsible private and joint venture participation to bridge resource constraints, shorten gestation periods and support the national goal of 100 GW nuclear capacity by 2047, without compromising national security or public interest.Though most of the opposition members from the Congress and other parties walked out of the House when the minister moved the bill for passing, TMC MPs remained inside with party veteran Saugata Roy moving certain amendments, which were eventually negated by voice vote.During the discussion, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor described the bill as a “dangerous leap into privatised nuclear expansion” with inadequate safeguards. “We cannot allow the pursuit of capital to override the non-negotiable requirements of public safety, environmental protection and victim justice,” the MP from Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram said.Another Congress MP Gaddam Vamsi Krishna accused the Centre of shirking accountability and endangering national security by handing over critical responsibilities to private players. He termed as ironic the name “SHANTI” for a bill that he said has “very dangerous” implications for national safety.“Who will be liable when an accident or incident happens in the nuclear space,” he asked, even as he questioned privatisation of the nuclear sector by underlining that countries like France, Russia, China and South Korea maintain state-owned nuclear sectors.","Lok sabha on wednesday passed the nuclear energy bill that seeks to open the civil nuclear sector to private players.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday arrived in Muscat, Oman for a two-day visit, kickstarting his third and final leg of his three-nation tour to the Middle East and Africa.He was received at the airport by Oman’s deputy PM for defence affairs Sayyid Shihab bin Tariq Al Said, and was accorded a guard of honour. The visit is at the invitation of Sultan Haitham bin Tarik of Oman and marks PM’s second trip to the Gulf nation as well as 70 years of diplomatic relations between both countries.Upon landing in Oman, the PM said in a post on X, “Landed in Muscat, Oman. This is a land of enduring friendship and deep historical connections with India. This visit offers an opportunity to explore new avenues of collaboration and add fresh momentum to our partnership.”PM was welcomed by the members of Indian diaspora as he arrived at the hotel of his stay.During the visit PM Modi will hold talks with the country's top leadership and is expected to sign a comprehensive trade agreement aimed at deepening bilateral ties.New Delhi has indicated that it is “very optimistic” about finalising the comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) during the visit. The proposed free trade agreement was approved by the Union cabinet last Friday.Negotiations for the CEPA formally began in November 2023 and were concluded this year. “We are all very optimistic about it. The teams from both sides have been working very hard for its early finalisation,” MEA secretary Arun Chatterjee said earlier.“We have immense faith that this agreement, if signed during this visit, will significantly deepen the economic ties between India and Oman. And it will open up a new chapter in the history of India-Oman trade and commercial relationship,” he added.During the visit, PM Modi is scheduled to hold discussions with Sultan Tarik on strengthening the strategic partnership, with a focus on trade, investment and economic cooperation. He is also expected to address the Indian diaspora in Oman.“This visit will be an opportunity for both sides to comprehensively review the bilateral partnership, including in the areas of trade, investment, energy, defence, security, technology, agriculture and culture, as well as exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest,” MEA said in a statement.","Prime minister narendra modi arrived in muscat, oman for a two-day visit.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said portraits of soldiers from the British era at Rashtrapati Bhavan have been replaced with those of India’s own heroes. The change comes with the inauguration of the Param Vir Gallery, which honours Param Vir Chakra awardees and marks a move away from colonial-era symbols.In a post on X, the Prime Minister shared photographs from the gallery and highlighted the tribute to the nation’s defenders.“O Supreme Warriors of India. Salutations to you, O Radiant Heroes! This nation is grateful for the sacrifices. For the honors of Mother India!,” his post read.Explaining the significance of the gallery, he said: “In the Param Vir Gallery of Rashtrapati Bhavan, these portraits of the country's indomitable heroes are a heartfelt tribute to our nation’s defenders. Those heroes who protected the motherland with their supreme sacrifices, who gave their lives for the unity and integrity of India... the nation has expressed its gratitude to them in yet another form.”PM Modi highlighted that the dedication of the gallery was made in the presence of the families of two Param Vir Chakra awardees and other gallantry award recipients, which, he said, made the occasion “even more special”.In another post, the Prime Minister said the change reflects India’s effort to move away from a colonial mindset.“For a long period, portraits of soldiers from the British era were displayed in the gallery of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Now, in their place, portraits of the country's Param Vir Chakra awardees have been installed,” he said, adding that the Param Vir Gallery is “an excellent example of the campaign to move away from the mentality of slavery and connect India with a new consciousness”.He also recalled that the government had earlier named several islands in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands after Param Vir Chakra winners as part of the same initiative.Highlighting the gallery’s message for future generations, PM Modi said it would serve as a source of inspiration for the youth.“These images and this gallery serve as a vibrant site for our young generation to connect with India's tradition of valor. This gallery will inspire the youth that self-confidence and determination are essential for the nation's purpose,” he wrote.Expressing hope for its long-term impact, the Prime Minister added that he hoped the Param Vir Gallery would become “a vibrant pilgrimage site for the spirit of developed India.”","Portraits of soldiers from the british era at rashtrapati bhavan have been replaced with those of india’s own heroes.

India Strengthens Maritime Dominance As Second MH-60R Squadron Joins Indian Navy At INS Hansa

Indian Navy's second MH-60R squadron INAS 335 at INS Hansa

Why does it matter?

NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy on Wednesday commissioned its second squadron of MH-60R (Romeo) multi-role helicopters, INAS 335 ‘Ospreys’, at Goa's INS Hansa naval air base, marking a key step in strengthening India’s submarine warfare and maritime surveillance capabilities on the western seaboard.The squadron was commissioned in the presence of Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Dinesh Tripathi, with the induction ceremony marked by a traditional water cannon salute. The event concluded with a march past of the newly inducted helicopters, often described as the Navy’s “flying destroyers”.Addressing the gathering, Admiral Tripathi shed light on the changing nature of threats in India’s maritime neighbourhood.“The maritime environment around us, today, is more complex and contested than ever before. Shifting geopolitics, fast-moving technologies, and an expanding spectrum of threats - from grey-zone activities to supply chain disruptions at sea - are shaping this new reality,” he said.He said the Navy’s modernisation drive is closely linked to India’s broader strategic goals. It is within this challenging and dynamic strategic context that India is undertaking its maritime voyage towards becoming Viksit Bharat by 2047, he added.“Strengthening maritime security and deterrence, therefore, are fundamental to safeguarding our sea lines of communications, and growing national maritime interests,” the Navy chief said.Highlighting the operational significance of the induction, Admiral Tripathi said the deployment of the MH-60R helicopters on the western coast as the first operational squadron marked a major milestone for naval aviation. “The induction of the versatile, multi-role MH60R helicopter on the Western Seaboard, as the first operational squadron, marks an important milestone for our Navy,” he said.The Navy chief also drew attention to the historical resonance of the occasion. “The commissioning today also comes at a moment of great significance - 2025 marked 75 years since the Government of India approved the formation of a Fleet Air Arm, a decision that gave wings to Naval Aviation, thereby transforming our Navy into a potent multi-dimensional force, and giving us a decisive edge at sea,” he said.He noted that the date also coincided with a key chapter in India’s military history. “It is a matter of even greater significance that, precisely 64 years ago, on the night of 17/18 Dec 1961, Operation Vijay commenced, wherein ships of the Indian Navy sailed into Goa, to liberate it from the Portuguese,” Admiral Tripathi said.Recalling the role of naval aviation during that operation, he added, “There too, Naval Aviation played a part, with the erstwhile Vikrant and its integral air wing stationed just beyond the horizon, securing the approaches to Goa.”The Navy chief outlined how the MH-60R induction fits into a broader push to enhance maritime domain awareness and strike capability. He said the Navy is moving ahead with the acquisition of 15 MQ-9B Sea Guardian remotely piloted aircraft, which will bolster persistent surveillance across India’s maritime areas of interest.“In addition to building its shore-based aviation capabilities, the Indian Navy has maintained an unwavering focus on the enhancement of the integral shipborne aviation capabilities - both fixed and rotary wing,” he said.Admiral Tripathi said recent procurements were aimed at building a balanced and future-ready force. “It is in this context that the recent signing of the contract for 26 Rafale-M carrier-borne aircraft assumes particular significance, strengthening our long-range maritime strike and land-attack capabilities, as well as Fleet Air Defence,” he said.He added that rotary-wing platforms play a critical supporting role at sea. “Complementing the deck-based fighters, rotary-wing platforms, that include the shipborne Uncrewed Aviation Systems, extend the Fleet's ability to undertake persistent surface and air surveillance, standoff anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, logistics support, and search-and-rescue at sea,” he said.With the commissioning of INAS 335, the Navy’s operational footprint in the Arabian Sea is set to deepen, reinforcing India’s maritime deterrence posture at a time of intensifying strategic competition in the region.","Indian navy commissioned its second mh 60r helicopter squadron, inas 335 (ospreys) at ins hansa, in vasco on wednesday.

Are Sherrone Moore and his wife Kelli headed for divorce? Paige Shiver whispers return amid legal chaos and public sighting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/are-sherrone-moore-and-his-wife-kelli-headed-for-divorce-paige-shiver-whispers-return-amid-legal-chaos-and-public-sighting/articleshow/126032339.cms,"Sherrone Moore’s arrest and firing have sparked speculation about the future of his marriage to wife Kelli, despite the couple being seen together outside his lawyer’s office. Allegations of an inappropriate relationship, resurfacing Paige Shiver rumors, and disturbing court claims have intensified public scrutiny, raising questions about whether their decade-long marriage can survive the legal and emotional fallout.

Public unity amid private turmoil and escalating allegations

The fallout from Sherrone Moore’s stunning firing and arrest has triggered intense speculation not just about his legal future, but also about the state of his marriage. The former Michigan head coach was recently spotted walking with his wife, Kelli Moore, and their youngest child outside his attorney’s office, marking their first public appearance together since the scandal exploded.While the sighting suggested a united front, questions continue to swirl about whether the pressure from the allegations, arrest, and Paige Shiver related rumors could permanently fracture their decade-long marriage. For many observers, the moment felt less like reassurance and more like a pause in a rapidly escalating personal crisis unfolding in full public view.Sherrone Moore and Kelli Moore have been married since 2015 and share three daughters, with Moore previously describing his wife as his “life partner” in now-deleted social media posts. That carefully curated image collapsed after the University of Michigan announced his termination, stating: “U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately.”The school added that “credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,” a claim that has fueled online speculation, including renewed attention around Paige Shiver.The situation intensified when Kelli reportedly called 911 out of concern that Moore was feeling “suicidal” following his firing. Prosecutors later alleged Moore threatened to take his own life during a confrontation at his accuser’s apartment, telling her, “I’m going to kill myself. I’m going to make you watch. My blood is on your hands. You ruined my life.”Moore now faces felony and misdemeanor charges, is barred from contacting the alleged victim, and must wear a GPS tether. While no divorce filing has been made public, the combination of criminal charges, emotional distress, and lingering Paige Shiver rumors has placed unprecedented strain on the Moore household.Whether the couple’s recent appearance signals resilience or simply damage control remains an open and deeply personal question.Also Read: Were Paige Shiver and Sherrone Moore’s wife Kelli Moore friends?

"Paige Shiver scandal: Why Michigan kept her employed as Sherrone Moore was fired, and what university policy really says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/paige-shiver-scandal-why-michigan-kept-her-employed-as-sherrone-moore-was-fired-and-what-university-policy-really-says/articleshow/126038516.cms,"Michigan’s decision to fire Sherrone Moore but retain Paige Shiver stems from university policy that places disclosure responsibility on supervisors, not subordinates. The rules prohibit supervisors from pursuing relationships with those they oversee and require immediate disclosure. Insiders say the relationship was a “poorly kept secret,” but policy violations applied only to Moore.

How Michigan’s relationship policy shifted responsibility onto Sherrone Moore, not Paige Shiver

The firing of Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore sent shockwaves through college football, but it also raised a second, more complicated question: why was the staff member at the center of the scandal not dismissed as well? As scrutiny intensified following Moore’s December 10 removal, attention quickly shifted to Paige Shiver, who remains employed by the university.To many observers, the outcome felt inconsistent. However, Michigan’s decision is rooted less in optics and more in institutional policy. Understanding why Shiver kept her job requires a closer look at how universities define power, responsibility, and disclosure in workplace relationships and why accountability does not always fall equally on both parties.Michigan officials confirmed on December 15 that Shiver continues to work at the university, a decision that aligns with Policy No. 201.97 governing supervisor-employee relationships. The policy is explicit about where responsibility lies: supervisors are prohibited from initiating or attempting to initiate intimate relationships with those they oversee and are required to disclose any such relationships immediately.The language is unambiguous. “Recognizing that Intimate Relationships exist or may develop in the workplace that are not initiated by a Supervisor and are free from coercion and abuse of power, immediate disclosure of the relationship by the Supervisor is required,” the policy states.It further adds, “Failure of the Supervisor to disclose an Intimate Relationship is a serious offense and cause for discipline, up to and including dismissal from employment. Although encouraged, Supervisees have no obligation to disclose.”In Moore’s case, the alleged violations were twofold: entering into a relationship with someone under his authority and failing to report it to university officials. Under the policy, those failures rest squarely on the supervisor, not the subordinate.Complicating matters further are reports suggesting the relationship was widely known within the athletic department. Insider Tony Garcia described the situation as “a poorly kept secret,” saying, “I’ve spoken to a number of people in and around the athletic department… and it’s sort of been characterized as a a poorly kept secret.” Garcia added that whispers had circulated for months before the scandal became public.While those claims raise uncomfortable questions about internal oversight and institutional awareness, they do not override written policy. For now, Michigan’s stance reflects a broader principle in higher education governance: discipline follows authority. Whether that approach satisfies public perception is another debate entirely, but on paper, the university is following its own rules.Also Read: Are Sherrone Moore and his wife Kelli headed for divorce?

Gisele Bündchen and Joaquim Valente are spending the holidays nowhere near a fireplace, and that feels perfectly on brand for them. While much of the world leans into winter routines, the couple chose movement, sunlight, and open water near their Surfside, Florida home. Their recent jet ski outing was not staged or showy. It felt relaxed, intimate, and deeply familiar, like two people fully at ease with the life they are building together.The scene captured something quieter than celebrity spectacle. Life jackets secured, sunglasses on, they stayed close as they cut through calm blue water. Bündchen looked strong and confident, the result of years of discipline and the jiu jitsu training she has openly embraced alongside Valente. This was not a photo about fashion or fame. It was about rhythm, balance, and shared momentum at a time when their personal world has expanded in meaningful ways.For Gisele Bündchen and Valente, the jet skis were less about thrill and more about connection. Since welcoming their first child together in February, the couple has kept their family life intentionally private. Their son’s name and face remain out of the spotlight, a decision that reflects Bündchen’s growing focus on grounding moments over public noise.Time on the water fits that pattern. It offers space to breathe, reset, and simply be present.Bündchen’s comfort in the ocean is no surprise. Just days before, she wrapped up a demanding photoshoot that highlighted her athletic frame in a one piece swimsuit. Yet even then, the energy felt less performative and more reflective of who she is now. A woman who values strength, health, and freedom over spectacle. Jet skiing, something she has done for years, seems to mirror that mindset better than any posed shot ever could.Her past chapter with Tom Brady remains part of her story, especially as they share two children together. Brady, meanwhile, made news of his own this week by addressing speculation about a possible NFL return. Speaking with Colin Cowherd, the 48 year old was candid about why that door is closed.""I certainly could... I would say the answer for me would be yes,"" Tom Brady answered. ""I'm not allowed to anymore, because I'm an owner, a minority owner of the Raiders. So I can't un-retire. But I'm very excited to watch Philip play.""Since becoming a limited partner of the Las Vegas Raiders in October 2024, league rules make a comeback impossible. That clarity mirrors what Gisele Bündchen appears to have found herself. Different paths, steady footing, and a life shaped more by intention than expectation.Also Read: Who is Fernando Mendoza?

Candace Owens and Erika Kirk clash over claims surrounding Charlie Kirk’s death





Candace Owens is standing firm after a long, private meeting with Erika Kirk, following public claims and theories about Charlie Kirk ’s death that have caused anger and deep splits inside conservative circles. Candace Owens met with Erika Kirk and senior Turning Point USA staff for more than four hours. The goal was clear. Erika wanted Owens to stop spreading claims that suggest Charlie Kirk’s death involved outside actors and a possible cover-up.But after the meeting, Owens made it clear she would not take back her words. She said the discussion did not change her thinking. Erika Kirk, however, said the meeting was “productive” and stressed that the case, as she understands it, is now fully with law enforcement. The disagreement has played out publicly through podcasts, social media posts, and cable news, drawing massive online attention and sharp reactions from well-known conservative voices.Candace Owens has repeatedly said she believes more than one person may be involved in what she calls Charlie Kirk’s death. She has hinted at foreign involvement and suggested that people close to Kirk may have “betrayed” him.Erika Kirk has strongly pushed back. She has said these claims are not true and has urged people to trust investigators.Speaking on CBS, Erika directly denied one of Candace Owens’ claims, saying, “If you want to check out my flight log, you are more than welcome. It is very boring.” She added that Owens had cited dates when she was actually in the hospital.According to CNN, one theory shared by Owens claimed that foreign aircraft were following Erika Kirk for years. Owens later said on her podcast, “I understand why these aircraft have brought such fear, and that is because there is overwhelming proof that these aircraft are continuously coming and going from Israel.”Candace Owens’ comments have divided conservatives. Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and comedian Dave Smith have shown some support for her questioning.

DEHRADUN: Major General Lakhwinder Singh (retd), 77, hung up his boots in 2006 after nearly four decades of service in the Army. Commissioned in Dec 1967, he fought the 1971 Indo-Pak war as a 23-year-old captain attached to Field Regiment in the Dera Baba Nanak sector of Punjab. As the country prepares to celebrate Vijaya Diwas on Tuesday, he recalls an episode involving a Pakistani soldier that he says remains etched in his memory.Maj Gen Singh, who is also credited with the innovative use of artillery during the Kargil War that turned the tide in India's favour, shared the anecdote with TOI over the phone from his Delhi home.""I fought the adversary in the Dera Baba Nanak sector opposite Kartarpur Sahib on the western border. A few days after the war ended on Dec 16 with the declaration of a ceasefire, I was asked to lead a small contingent to exchange sweets and pleasantries with Pakistani counterparts to mark Eid,"" he said.""After reaching a common spot near the border, we exchanged greetings and sweets. After a few minutes, one of them asked about the officer handling artillery on our side, which was me. No one from our side revealed my name, but asked why they wanted to know.They said it was because artillery had caused heavy damage to them,"" Maj Gen Singh added.He recalled that soon after, a Pakistani soldier looked towards him and said, ""Agar India ke officers aur Pakistan ke jawan mil jaayen to duniya mein koi humein shikast nahi de sakta (If Indian officers and Pakistani soldiers come together, no one in the world could defeat us)."" ""I simply smiled and thanked him,"" he said.Maj Gen Singh described the moment as a testament to the ingrained ethos of Indian Army officers to lead from the front, unlike most of their Pakistani counterparts.""Having said that, it is not that Indian soldiers are not brave — they are extremely courageous. But the statement surprised us. We heard something similar again more than two decades later during the Kargil War, which suggested that stories about Indian Army officers were passed down generations on the other side,"" he said.""In the 1971 war, we largely encountered Pakistani JCOs and NCOs fighting at the front, which further reinforced that soldier's remark,"" he added.Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retd), who served alongside Maj Gen Singh during the Kargil War, echoed the Pakistani soldier's observation.""It is well known that Pakistani officers rarely lead their men from the front, unlike Indian Army officers. Indian officers are trained to lead from the front, not issue orders from behind,"" he said.""That is why the proportion of Indian Army officers making the supreme sacrifice during conflicts is higher. They are prepared to kill and to die for their men without a second thought,"" Lt Gen Bhandari added.The septuagenarian veteran also recalled another incident from the 1971 war in the Dera Baba Nanak sector, describing it as ""something divine"".""It was Dec 6, 1971. I, along with soldiers including those from 1/3 Gorkha, was tasked with attacking an enclave held by the Pakistani Army. The operation began in darkness, with heavy firing from our side,"" he said.""While advancing, we encountered a Pakistani pillbox, which we fired upon for three to four minutes — a significant duration in combat. We were certain that anyone inside would have been killed. Just then, a Pakistani soldier emerged from the pillbox and ran towards safety. We froze and could not bring ourselves to pull the trigger. It felt like the Almighty had willed that he live,"" Maj Gen Singh said.","Major general lakhwinder singh (retd), 77, hung up his boots in 2006 after nearly four decades of service in the army.
