Gold has been dipping after a recent surge amidst tensions in the Middle East. With the US declaring a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, the safe haven demand for gold has somewhat gone down. What’s the outlook for gold and silver prices in the near future and what gold and silver rate levels should investors look at? Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group shares his views:Gold is currently holding a crucial support level around ₹95,800. This zone is significant, as a strong reversal from here could potentially trigger a recovery in prices, targeting the ₹98,500 mark. This level also coincides with a previously unfilled gap, making it a key technical target for traders watching for a bounce.Despite a recent 4% correction in gold prices, the broader trend remains positive. The pullback is being viewed as a healthy retracement within a larger bullish structure, and market sentiment continues to favor the upside, especially amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and global demand for safe-haven assets.A sustained move above ₹98,500 would be a strong bullish signal, clearing the way for a possible retest of the psychological ₹100,000 mark. Momentum traders may closely watch for confirmation above this resistance level to enter fresh long positions. On the downside, if ₹95,800 fails to hold, it could invite further selling pressure, but for now, the support remains intact. Overall, the bias remains positive, with technical indicators pointing to a potential recovery, provided key levels are respected. Investors are advised to stay alert for price action cues around the ₹95,800–₹98,500 range.MCX Silver has recently witnessed a sharp decline of around 5% from its recent highs, triggering short-term concerns among traders. However, despite this pullback, the broader trend for silver remains firmly positive. The recent correction appears to be a temporary pause within an ongoing bullish trajectory, rather than a reversal of the larger trend.The ₹102,500 level is emerging as a crucial support zone, and price action near this area will be key in determining the next move. This level has historically provided a base for reversals, and a strong bounce from here could reignite bullish momentum. Technical indicators suggest that as long as this support holds, the upside potential remains intact.On the higher side, silver prices have the potential to reclaim the ₹109,000 level, which represents a significant resistance zone and a near-term target for buyers. A sustained move above this resistance could pave the way for further gains in the medium term.Overall, while short-term volatility may persist, the underlying strength in silver remains. Traders and investors should closely monitor the ₹102,500 support for signs of reversal, as it could offer a favorable risk-reward entry point for the next leg higher.","Gold has been dipping after a recent surge amidst tensions in the middle east.

The United States deployed its B-2 Spirit bombers in Sunday's strikes on three key nuclear facilities in Iran. The aircraft, sometimes also referred to as the “Stealth” bomber, has an Indian connection - a naturalized US citizen from India was involved in the development of the plane's propulsion system.The engineer, Mumbai-born Noshir Gowadia, was later sentenced to over 30 years in prison for sharing classified military information with China, with which Beijing developed a cruise missile exhaust system to make Chinese cruise missiles resistant to detection.According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Gowadia, now 81, was first arrested in October 2005 on a criminal complaint which alleged that he ""wilfully communicated"" national defense-related information to a person ""not entitled to receive it.""As per information produced during the trial, Gowadia worked with Northrop Grumman Corporation - the makers of B2 bombers - for almost 20 years, from approximately 1968 to 1986. During this time, he contributed to the development of the unique propulsion system and low observable capabilities of the B-2; he also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the United States government until 1997, when his security clearance was revoked.Evidence displayed at the trial showed that Gowadia visited China six times between June 2003 and July 2005 to provide defense services in the form of design, test support and test data analysis of technologies for the purpose of helping Beijing build a cruise missile system by developing a stealthy exhaust nozzle.At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the Chinese.Gowadia was found guilty in August 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu.

SCO Summit: India nixes Pakistan-China bid to push their line on terror,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sco-summit-india-nixes-pakistan-china-bid-to-push-their-line-on-terror/articleshow/122100074.cms,"NEW DELHI: Finding Pakistan teaming up with China to push its line on terrorism at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation defence ministers' meet at Qingdao, India Thursday refused to sign the proposed joint statement as it would've diluted its consistent stand on the scourge endangering regional peace and stability.Given the SCO norm stipulating consensus, the statement couldn't be adopted despite overnight talks, as defence minister Rajnath Singh made it clear that perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts, including cross-border terrorism, must be held accountable.Also read: ‘Proposal objected by one particular country,’ MEA on why Rajnath Singh refused to sign SCO statement There can be no double standards on this, Singh said, speaking at the 10-nation SCO meet with his Pakistani and Chinese counterparts Khawaja Asif and Admiral Dong Jun, among others, in attendance.Singh rejected the statement after finding that Pakistan, with help of current SCO chair China, opposed mention of the Pahalgam massacre and instead wanted ""terrorist activities"" in Balochistan and the situation in J&K to figure in it, sources told TOI.Pakistan was especially keen to include Jaffar Express hijacking in its restive Balochistan province in March in the joint document. Pakistan frequently accuses India of fomenting the ongoing insurgency for greater autonomy and independence in Balochistan.India, on its part, has consistently rejected all such ""baseless"" allegations.""The Indian delegation led by Rajnath Singh had serious objections to the draft joint statement and its language, which reeked of double standards in dealing with a serious issue like terrorism,"" a source said. External affairs ministry spokesperson said, ""India wanted its concerns on terrorism reflected in the document, which was not acceptable to one particular country (Pakistan) and, thus, the statement was not adopted. ""Both India and Pakistan in 2017 became full members of SCO, which also includes Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran and Belarus.Speaking at the meet, Singh said peace and prosperity cannot co-exist with terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the hands of non-state actors and terror groups. ""Dealing with these challenges requires decisive action and we must unite in our fight against these evils for our collective safety and security,"" Singh said.In a clear reference to Pakistan, he said, ""Some countries use crossborder terrorism as an instrument of policy and provide shelter to terrorists. There should be no place for such double standards. SCO should not hesitate to criticise such nations.""The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of UN designated terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) based in Pakistan, carried out the heinous attack in Pahalgam on April 22, in which 26 civilians were shot dead after being profiled on the basis of religious identity. ""The pattern of Pahalgam terror attack matches with LeT's previous terror attacks in India. In exercising its right to defend against terrorism and pre-empt as well as deter further crossborder terrorist attacks, India on May 7 successfully launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle cross-border terrorist infrastructure,"" Singh said.India's zero tolerance for terrorism was manifested through its actions, he said. ""This includes our right to defend ourselves against terrorism. We have shown that epicentres of terrorism are no longer safe... India reaffirms its resolve to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,"" he added.","Rajnath singh made it clear that perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts, including cross-border terrorism, must be held accountable.

With your love and blessings, I have safely reached the International Space Station. It may look easy to stand here, but it's not that easy. My head feels heavy and there’s a little discomfort, but these are very small things, and in a few days we’ll get used to them,” Shukla said.“For the next 14 days, we will stay here, conduct many scientific experiments, and stay in touch with you. This phase also marks the first step in our own space journey. I spoke to you a little while ago from the Dragon spacecraft, and I will keep speaking from here as well. Let’s make this journey exciting and participate with great enthusiasm. I’m carrying the Indian tricolour on my shoulder, and I believe the next 14 days will be thrilling.Jai Hind, Jai Bharat,” he added.Shukla also thanked the ISS crew for their warm welcome, saying all his expectations had been surpassed.“It has been a wonderful ride - I was looking forward to coming to space. The minute I entered the ISS and met this crew, you made me feel so welcome, as if you literally opened your house doors for us. Whatever expectations I had have been surpassed - by the view, of course, but also by you. Thank you so much,” he said.“I’m very confident the next 14 days will be amazing as we advance science and research together,” he added.The newly launched spacecraft, the fifth in SpaceX’s Dragon series and named Grace, completed docking with the ISS while orbiting above the North Atlantic Ocean.“At 6:31 am EDT (4:01 pm IST) on Thursday, the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft docked to the International Space Station for the fourth private astronaut mission to the orbiting laboratory, Axiom Mission 4,” NASA said in a statement.After the initial soft-docking, a secure connection known as hard-mating was achieved when 12 sets of hooks locked the spacecraft and station together, enabling communication and power links. Hatch-opening procedures took about two hours before the astronauts could enter the ISS.Shubhanshu Shukla is now the second Indian to travel to space, after Rakesh Sharma’s 1984 mission. Joining him on Axiom-4 are Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, Poland’s second astronaut since 1978, and Tibor Kapu, Hungary’s second space traveller in 45 years.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Thursday said that India chose not to sign the joint statement at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Defence Ministers’ meeting in Qingdao, China, as it did not adequately reflect India's concerns on terrorism.Defence minister Rajnath Singh had earlier taken a firm stance, refusing to sign the statement citing the omission of the heinous Pahalgam terror attack while it made direct references to militant activities in Balochistan.Speaking at a press briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that “India wanted concerns on terrorism reflected,” but the proposal was “not acceptable to one particular country,” which prevented the consensus necessary for finalising the document.""We had our defence minister participating in the defence minister's meeting of SCO... I understand that they could not adopt a joint statement. I also understand that certain member countries could not reach consensus on certain issues and hence the document could not be finalised,” ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters.Jaiswal added that the defence minister had reiterated India’s long-standing and uncompromising stance on terrorism, calling for united efforts by all member states to address the threat comprehensively.""The defence minister in his address, called upon these 11 countries to come together to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations... He also reiterated the need to uphold that the perpetrators, organisers, financers, sponsors of reprehensible acts of terrorism, including cross-border terrorism, need to be held accountable and brought to justice,"" he said.According to officials, India was particularly dissatisfied that the Pahalgam attack — believed to be carried out by the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba — was not acknowledged in the draft joint communiqué.At the summit, Rajnath Singh had urged SCO members to act decisively against terrorism, emphasising the need to reject double standards.“Any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of motivation, whenever, wherever and whom-so-ever committed. SCO members must condemn this evil unequivocally. We reiterate the need to hold the perpetrators, organizers, financiers, and sponsors, reprehensible acts of terrorism, including cross-border terrorism, accountable and bring them to justice,” Singh said in his address.The SCO summit brought together defence leaders from 10 member states including China, Russia, Pakistan, and India. Due to the divergence in positions on terrorism and related issues, the bloc ultimately decided not to adopt a joint statement.","India chose not to sign the joint statement at the shanghai cooperation organisation (sco) defence ministers’ meeting in qingdao, china.

Under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, India was slated to get all the five squadrons by end-2023.Each S-400 squadron has two missile batteries with 128 missiles each, with interception ranges of 120, 200, 250 and 380-km, as well as long-range acquisition and engagement radars and all-terrain transporter-erector vehicles.The IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan.“As per Russia, the fourth squadron will now come next year, and the fifth in 2027,” a source said.During the intense cross-border hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10, Pakistan had claimed it successfully bombed the Adampur air-base and destroyed a S-400 battery deployed there.But PM Narendra Modi visited the air-base on May 13, and posed with an all-terrain transporter-erector-launcher vehicle of the S-400 system in the background to reject the claim.The S-400 batteries, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, constitute the outermost layer of India’s integrated air defence system and is fully plugged into the IAF’s integrated air command and control system (IACCS).The DRDO, on its part, is also developing an air defence system with a 350-km interception range under the ambitious Project Kusha. With the defence ministry in Sept 2023 approving the “acceptance of necessity” for the procurement of five of its squadrons for the IAF at a cost of Rs 21,700 crore, India plans to operationally deploy this system by 2028-2029, as was first reported by TOI.","The delivery of the fourth and fifth squadrons of the s-400 air defence systems has been hugely delayed due to the ongoing russia-ukraine war.

Poll Should the international community take a stronger stance against TTP activities? Yes, to curb terrorism effectively No, current measures are sufficient

NEW DELHI: In a big setback for the ISI and Pakistan army, a Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tuesday. The slain Major, Moiz Abbas, from the 6 CDO battalion (SSG), had claimed he had captured IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman in 2019.Abbas was honorarily promoted to the rank of Major for his act. While Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir attended his funeral prayers on Wednesday, President Asif Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif offered condolences and praised him for fighting against the operatives of ‘Fitna-Al-Khwarij’, a term used by Pakistan for referring to TTP fighters.On Feb 27, 2019, Varthaman, then a Wing Commander, had downed an enemy jet (F-16) during an aerial combat with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrikes a day before. His own jet was subsequently hit, prompting an ejection and landing on enemy soil. He was held captive for three days and released by Pakistan on March 1. He was later conferred with the Vir Chakra, India's thirdhighest war-time gallantry medal, and promoted to the rank of Group Captain.Abbas (37) was an SSG commando from Chakwal. He was seen in an interview to the Pakistani media describing Varthaman’s capture and rescue from angry civilians.Confirming Abbas’s death, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that Abbas led his troops from the front. “He fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of the soil, Lance Naik Jibran Ullah, during the intense fire exchange,” it said. The ISPR also claimed that 11 TTP fighters were killed and called them “India-sponsored terrorists”, their usual ploy to avoid naming Afghanistan or Taliban.Sources said the TTP fighters targeted Pakistan army personnel in two separate ambushes in Kurram and Sararogha in south Waziristan. While eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 10 injured in Kurram, at least six soldiers were killed in South Waziristan. TTP operatives also destroyed army vehicles and seized weapons before leaving.In a statement issued on its Telegram account, TTP said videos of both attacks would be released soon. ISPR, however, said, “During the operation, our troops effectively engaged the Khwarij location and 11 Indian-sponsored Khwarij were killed and seven got injured by the security forces.”","A major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by tehreek-e-taliban pakistan (ttp) fighters in waziristan.

In the pilot seat of 'Dragon', the Axiom-4 space capsule that would take a four-member crew to the International Space Station on Thursday, was India's Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla ""Namaskar, mere pyaare desh vasiyon,"" Shukla radioed to Earth minutes after entering space. ""What a ride! We are orbiting Earth at a velocity of 7.5km per second (27,000 kmph)."" Later, PM Modi congratulated the mission and posted that Shukla ""is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the ISS"".Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984. Shukla's message from space - ""this isn't the beginning of my journey to ISS, but beginning of India's human space flight programme"" - reflects India's ambition to have its own space station by 2035 and crewed missions to Moon and beyond.After multiple postponements, Ax-4 mission lifted off Wednesday carrying commander Peggy Whitson (US), 65, mission pilot Shukla, 39, and mission specialists Sławosz Uznanski (Poland), 41, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), 34, on a 14-day mission to ISS.Earlier, the symbolic ""crew handover"" took place. The four astronauts waved to their families before heading to the launchpad in a Tesla. Strapped into the Dragon capsule, the crew underwent final checks as the countdown proceeded. Post lift-off, the capsule separated from the second stage nine minutes, 38 seconds later, beginning its journey to ISS. The capsule, now named 'Grace', is expected to dock with ISS at 4.30pm IST on Thursday.Dragon capsule ""Grace"" separated from Falcon 9 nine minutes after launch and is now orbiting Earth at 27,000kmph. Nose cone deployed. Navigation instruments and docking sensors exposed as the spacecraft begins its precision chase of International Space Station.Grace circles Earth once every 90 minutes. The journey isn't a straight line and docking isn't immediate. Over the next 24 to 28 hours, the capsule will execute a series of thruster burns - each timed to the second - to raise & fine-tune its orbit, aligning perfectly with the station's trajectory.A slight delay could shift the narrow rendezvous window. Onboard systems track position in real-time using GPS, radar, and sensors, continuously updating Grace's path against that of the ISS.F inal approach begins Thursday. Dragon will stop at predetermined waypoints, starting 400m out and moving in stages. At each halt, ground controllers and onboard software assess whether conditions are right to proceed.At 20 metres, laser sensors and cameras take over. Grace creeps forward at just a few centimetres a second, lining up precisely with Harmony module's docking port.Soft capture comes first - magnetic guides gently pull the capsule into place. Then hard capture follows, as mechanical latches lock and seal the connection. Hatch opening is not immediate. Engineers on Earth conduct pressure and leak checks before approving crew transfer.Aboard are four Axiom-4 astronauts and a fifth member - Joy, a soft, white baby swan toy serving as the mission's zero-gravity indicator. Joy carries personal meaning: chosen with Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's six-year-old son, Kiash - fondly called Sid - in mind.""Our first ideas all included animals,"" said mission specialist Tibor Kapu. ""We have one kid with the crew, Shux's kid Sid, who basically just loves animals. We wanted dinosaurs and lions, but we couldn't find the right one.

What does the swan signify?



NEW DELHI: The Axiom-4 crew members, who successfully floated into International Space Station on Thursday, were joined by a fifth member on their mission. It wasn't a human or a pet, but a toy. A toy swan called Joy.But it's not just a toy. It has its roots in traditions of the scientific world. The practice of taking a toy into space to signal the onset of weightlessness started with Yuri Gagarin, the first person in space, and has since evolved into a longstanding tradition in space missions.Joy is a zero gravity indicator aboard the Axiom-4 mission. It was chosen by the astronauts as a tribute to astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla ’s son Kiash, who has a deep affection for animals.""We are here, not just the four of us, we also have with us our Zero-G indicator - Joy - that started to float with us just when we were injected into orbit. Joy is floating all over the capsule, sometimes we have to find him/ her here with us,"" Polish astronaut Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski said.Joy, the baby swan, represents the collective ambition of the Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ), the European Space Agency (ESA), and Hungary's HUNOR space program to reach beyond Earth, Axiom Space said in a statement.""In this way, Joy represents cultural unity as three nations realize the return to human spaceflight, together as one crew,"" it said.""By choosing a swan as the zero-g indicator, the Ax-4 crew celebrates the diversity of their cultures, united in the shared human experience of space exploration,"" Axiom Space said.Talking about the symbolism behind the swan, Shukla said, ""This means a lot more than just a ZeroG indicator. I think we all have symbolism, in Poland and Hungary and India as well.""In India, the swan is seen as a symbol of wisdom and purity, reflecting the quest for truth. In Poland, it represents qualities like purity, loyalty, and resilience. Meanwhile, in Hungary, the swan embodies loyalty, elegance, and the natural beauty of the world.",Joy is a zero gravity indicator aboard the axiom-4 mission.

Ax-4 will give Shukla an opportunity to experience life in an orbital station.During the 14-day ISS mission, Shukla will carry out seven India-led experiments, including research on seeds, algae and human physiology in microgravity, besides five experiments with Nasa. He will also get familiar with various crew systems aboard the ISS, gaining critical knowledge of how the station operates 400km above Earth.Once back, Shukla will share his learning with other Gaganyaan astronaut-designates. While the final crew for Gaganyaan is yet to be selected - two or three may be chosen - Shukla, armed with experience, is seen as a frontrunner.Space minister Jitendra Singh said Shukla's experiments will help advance space nutrition and self-sustaining life support systems for long-duration missions.One study involves understanding how space radiation affects edible microalgae - a promising food source for astronauts.Another experiment examines cyanobacteria like Spirulina and Synechococcus in microgravity, assessing their growth using nitrogen sources, including urea from human waste, to support recycling-based life systems. The experiments will use indigenously-developed biotech kits designed for microgravity. The effort will nurture a space biology ecosystem in India.Shukla will also interact with PM Modi, students, and industry leaders during the mission, showcasing India's growing capabilities in space.","The axiom-4 mission holds major significance for india's 'gaganyaan' programme.

We had a constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on issues about bilateral relations,"" Singh said in a social media post on Friday.Singh's visit to Qingdao coincided with the resumption of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra in Tibet. It is taking place after a gap of nearly five years. The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra was suspended initially in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequently because of the military standoff between the two sides on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.""Expressed my happiness on the restarting of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra after a gap of nearly six years,"" he said.""It is incumbent on both sides to maintain this positive momentum and avoid adding new complexities in the bilateral relationship,"" he added.Singh's visit to China came amid efforts by both New Delhi and Beijing to reset their ties following an understanding last October to end the military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The defence minister also presented a Madhubani painting from Bihar to his Chinese counterpart.This traditional art form, also known as Mithila painting, originates in Bihar’s Mithila region. It is characterised by intricate line drawings filled with bright colours, patterns, and tribal motifs. These paintings are popular for their vivid earthy tones and distinctive designs.On June 23, National Security Advisor Ajit Dovfal held a meeting with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Beijing and reviewed recent developments in India-China relations and underscored the need to promote the overall development of the bilateral ties, including by fostering greater people-to-people ties.During the meeting, NSA Doval emphasised the need to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations to maintain peace and stability in the region.

He caught the launch. He was excited to watch what appeared like a Sun against a black backdrop,” Kamna recalled.The mission, a milestone for private spaceflight and a landmark for India’s human spaceflight journey, saw “Grace” — the Dragon capsule carrying Shukla and three international crewmates — dock successfully with the ISS.Kamna, who by then had reached Atlanta where her brother lives, was elated. “This is India’s time in space. Shux, me, and our entire family are looking forward to Gaganyaan , and the future of India’s human spaceflight programme,” she said.Though the family had their share of nerves when the mission was postponed multiple times, Kamna said there was “never any doubt that everything would be taken care of”.Now that Shukla is aboard the ISS, the family is scheduled to have two private video calls with him during his stay. “Those have been pre-arranged. But he can also call us whenever he’s free and it’s feasible,” Kamna said.As Shukla conducts cutting-edge Indian scientific experiments in orbit it is not just his mission, but a national moment. And behind the calm professionalism of an IAF pilot-turned-astronaut is a family that has been quietly sharing the journey every step of the way.In an exclusive interview to TOI earlier, Kamna had described Shux as the bravest person she knows and said she was confident that he’ll perform his duty as he always has.Ahead of launch Shukla had said: “No one travels to space alone… we do so on the shoulders of so many more. I feel grateful to each and every one of you. Thank you…” He had specially thanked his wife Kamna for being the wonderful partner that she was, and said: “Without you none of this was possible but more importantly none of this would matter.”",Group captain shubhanshu shukla launched aboard the axiom-4 (ax-4) mission to the international space station (iss) the mission is a milestone for private spaceflight and a landmark for india’s human spaceflight journey.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122102187,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-42018,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Then, after selection, we moved to Star City, just outside Moscow, for our training. The training went on for 18 months and culminated in the Indo-Soviet spaceflight in 1984. It was an eight-day mission, and we carried out experiments which were designed by Indian scientists,"" he said.Sharma recalled that the entire training and communication with crew members and mission control while they were in orbit was in Russian. “We had to learn the language before we started training, and that was not easy because of the paucity of time. So, we took about two months to learn the language,” he said.He highlighted that in space, sunrises and sunsets happen at an interval of 45 minutes as “we moved around Earth in just 90 minutes”, and saw day and night several times in a day.In the podcast released on Wednesday night, the spaceman said that while space travel technology has changed, “as humans, we haven't changed much”. “The mental impact will always be there because humans will be able to get a different perspective. It does kind of alter the worldview... (shows) the vast place in the universe.” Sharma had famously said “Sare Jehan Se Acha...” when then PM Indira Gandhi asked him how India looked from space.Asked about the future of Indian space travel, he said, “We will be going farther and farther from planet Earth... Space tourism will happen but space exploration will go side by side and we will keep marching ahead”.On India’s uniqueness, Sharma said: “We shared our Vedas with everybody. Our heritage says ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The world is one family)’. We still value it in the modern world as during Covid epidemic, we shared (vaccines) with everybody...”.When asked how he found the world and India from space, Sharma exclaimed, “Oh dear! Beautiful. In our country, we got everything: we got a long coastline, the ghats section, plains, tropical forests, mountains, Himalayas. It's a beautiful sight, different colours, different textures”.After his return from the mission, Sharma went back to the IAF from where he retired as wing commander. “After a few years, I moved to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited as their chief test pilot,” he said, and recalled his association with the evolution of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) ‘Tejas’ fighter jet. “Later I joined the IT industry. Life has been rewarding for me.”","India's first spaceman rakesh sharma says space travel alters the mindset of humans.

But I want to say that the people of the opposition together said they are with the Army that is fighting (during Operation Sindoor)...

The Congress MP has said that his article on Operation Sindoor's global outreach was not a sign of him ""leaping to join"" Prime Minister Modi's party but a statement of national unity, interest and standing up for India.Hours after Congress chief Kharge's barbs directed at him, Tharoor responded with yet another cryptic message for the Congress leadership.The Thiruvananthapuram MP's post on X had an image of a bird with the caption -- ""Don't ask permission to fly.

What is the Communist Control Act? Could Mamdani be deported?







Republicans raised a call to revoke Zohran Mamdani's citizenship and deport him before he becomes New York mayor citing the fact that Mamdani became a US citizen only seven years ago. The 33-year-old Democrat Socialist is the Democratic nominee for New York's mayoral election in November -- after former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded the primary election.The New York Young Republican Club called for deporting Mamdani as it said: “The radical Zohran Mamdani cannot be allowed to destroy our beloved city of New York.""The club called on White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, known for his hawkish stand on immigration, to invoke the Red Scare-era Communist Control Act to strip Mamdani's citizenship.Stephen Miller already expressed his disgust at Mamdani's win and said it was the ""clearest warning of what happens to a society when it fails to control migration"". “The entire Democrat party is lining up behind the diehard socialist who wants to end all immigration enforcement and abolish the prison system entirely,” he added.The Communist Control Act was signed into law by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1954 during the Cold War.The legislation outlawed, in theory, the Communist Party in the United States and prohibited communists from attaining certain positions. But it was rarely enforced.Zohran Mamdani was born in Uganda in 1991 and moved to New York along with his parents at the age of seven in 1988. His father Mahmood Mamdani is an Ugandan-American with his ancestry in India, his mother Mira Nair is an Indian-American. Zohran Mamdani became a naturalized US citizen in 2018.President Donald Trump called Mamdani 100 per cent communist lunatic. Trump also commented on his looks and voice and called everything terrible. “It’s finally happened, the Democrats have crossed the line. Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous. He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he’s not very smart, he’s got AOC+3, Dummies ALL, backing him, and even our Great Palestinian Senator, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, is groveling over him. Yes, this is a big moment in the History of our Country!” Trump said on Truth Social.","The new york young republican club calls for zohran mamdani's deportation.
