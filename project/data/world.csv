Govt committed to protecting freedom of religion for everyone in India, says MEA

NEW DELHI: Following remarks by Union minister Kiren Rijiju backing the Dalai Lama's announcement about his succession, including the statement that China will have no role in it, India on Friday said it had taken no position on what was an issue concerning faith and religion.Interestingly, the Chinese foreign ministry, after cautioning India at a media briefing, according to agency reports from Beijing, against interfering in Tibetan affairs at the expense of Sino-India ties, omitted its comments objecting to Rijiju's remarks from the official transcript of the briefing.""Govt of India does not take any position or speak on matters concerning beliefs and practices of faith and religion,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, responding to media queries.The MEA spokesperson added that Indian govt has always upheld freedom of religion for all in India and would continue to do so.India's ties with China have shown signs of improvement in the past nine months, since they resolved the almost-five-year-long border stand-off in eastern Ladakh, leading to resumption of high-level bilateral visits. Amid global uncertainties, both sides seem keen to maintain a steady working relationship.Defence minister Rajnath Singh visited China last month for a meeting of the SCO defence ministers. NSA Ajit Doval has twice visited China since PM Modi's meeting with President Xi Jinping in Oct last year on the margins of the Brics summit in Russia. As special representative for boundary talks, Wang himself is likely to visit India this month for talks with Doval. India, however, is yet to confirm Modi's participation in the SCO summit in China in Sept.Unlike the US, which officially maintains that China has no role to play in the Dalai Lama's succession, India has never taken any position on the issue. China maintains that the successor to the 14th Dalai Lama can only be appointed through the ""traditional"" process that includes approval by the central govt. In rare remarks by an Indian minister, Rijiju had backed the spiritual leader's assertion that no one else other than his trust would help choose his successor. The minister clarified on Friday that he wasn't speaking on behalf of the Indian govt but as a devotee himself, expressing the perspective of the Dalai Lama's followers.""All over the world, the people who follow Buddhism and who believe in the sacred, supreme Dalai Lama-ji... it is everyone's wish that the Dalai Lama-ji himself will decide. There is no need for govt of India or for me to say anything. I am speaking as a follower. I am not saying anything on... the Chinese govt's statement,"" the minister said.","India on friday said it had taken no position on what was an issue concerning faith and religion.

No compromise on interests of farm & dairy sectors: Goyal

NEW DELHI: India will enter into a trade agreement with the US only if its interests are protected and it is able to sustain a tariff advantage over its competitors, while prioritising the interests of farmers, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said Friday.""India has never discussed any trade agreement or even a tranche under any time pressure or under any duress. We have to take care of our national interest, we have to ensure it's a fair deal which gives us a sustained preferential advantage over our competitors... But we are not working towards any specific deadlines, we are working towards national interest,"" he told TOI in an interview, referring to the July 9 deadline set by US President Trump for trade agreements.US President Donald Trump had imposed reciprocal tariffs on nearly 100 countries but agreed to a 90-day pause that is to end Tuesday. India was slapped with 26% reciprocal tariffs. There is uncertainty over whether India and US can agree to an early tranche or a mini deal before that even as a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement is negotiated by Fall (Sept-Oct) after a meeting between Trump and PM Modi.For India, lowering tariffs on farm products, such as maize and soybean, as well as dairy products is a concern.While commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal did not get into the specifics, he said India will not compromise the interests of farm and dairy sectors. ""Farmers' interest is always paramount for Modi govt. In any negotiation we have done, you have seen UK, Australia, Mauritius, EFTA and UAE agreements, India's farmers have been protected. "" Govt has refrained from offering concessions in major agricultural products, but for US, it is the main focus.While some govt officials said US demands were not very clear, for India, Goyal said Indian expectations for duty concessions in labour-intensive sectors were the focus of the trade deal. India was hoping for duty concessions in leather, footwear, textiles and some auto parts in return for reducing levies on automobiles and American whiskey.Besides, India wants to be insulated from future tariff adjustments, including sectoral actions, while getting the benefit of lower duties compared to countries such as China and Vietnam. There are only a handful of countries, including UK, China and Vietnam, that have so far agreed to trade deals with US.",Piyush goyal says india will not compromise on interests of farm & dairy sectors.

I accept this honour on behalf of 140 crore Indians as a shared pride.”During his address, PM Modi spoke of the enduring bond between the nations, forged over 180 years ago when the first Indian immigrants arrived in Trinidad.“The Indian beats blended beautifully with the Caribbean rhythm... From politics to poetry, cricket to commerce – they contribute to every field,” he said.He also praised the country’s representation of women in Parliament, saying, “I'm delighted to see so many women members in this house. Respect for women is deeply rooted in Indian culture. One of our important holy texts, the Skanda Purana, says that one daughter brings as much happiness as ten sons. From space to sports, startups to science, education to enterprise, aviation to armed forces – they are leading India to a new future in various domains. ”President Christine Kangaloo, who presented PM Modi with the honour at a ceremony at the President’s House, called his kindness and generosity “legendary,” particularly recalling India’s vaccine donation during the COVID-19 crisis. “That act of kindness only further strengthened the longstanding relationship between the governments and people of both our countries,” she said.PM Modi was welcomed with traditional performances and enthusiastic cheers from the Indian diaspora upon arrival.

NEW DELHI: India faced three adversaries on just one border during Operation Sindoor , with Pakistan being actively supported by China and Turkiye, a top Army officer said on Friday, adding that Beijing was even providing Islamabad with ""live"" satellite inputs on Indian military movements and deployments.""We had one border and two adversaries, actually three. Pakistan was in the front. China was providing all possible support,"" Army deputy chief (capability development & sustenance) Lt Gen Rahul R Singh said at a seminar on 'New Age Military Technologies' organised by Ficci. ""This is no surprise because 81% of military hardware that Pakistan is getting is all Chinese. China, of course, (followed) the good old dictum, kill with a borrowed knife. .. So, he (sic) would rather use the neighbour to cause pain than get involved in the mudslinging match on the northern borders,"" he added.The deep Pakistan-China military collusiveness was reinforced during the cross-border hostilities from May 7 to 10, with Islamabad using a wide array of Chinese weapons and sensor-shooter networks, ranging from J-10 fighters firing the PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to HQ-9 air defence missile batteries, as reported by TOI earlier.Lt Gen Singh, on his part, said China was able to test its weapons against those used by India during the conflict. ""So, it's like a live lab available to them. It is something that we have to be very cognizant about,"" he said.""Turkiye also played an important role in providing the type of support it did,"" he added. Pakistan, for instance, extensively used Turkish-origin Byker Yiha III kamikaze drones and Asisguard Songar drones during the conflict.The senior officer said crucial lessons among the multiple ones to be learned from Operation Sindoor include the need for an effective C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), a more robust air defence network and civil-military fusion.The candid remarks come after Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan, speaking in Singapore on May 31, downplayed China's role in the conflict. While Pakistan may have leveraged Chinese commercial satellite imagery, there is ""no proof of real-time targeting support"" provided by Beijing, the CDS had said.Pointing to China using its extensive satellite network to monitor Indian military movements, Lt Gen Singh said, ""When the DGMO-level talks were on, Pakistan actually was mentioning that we know that your such and such vector is primed and ready for action, and we would request you to perhaps pull it back.

The planning and selection of targets was based on a lot of data that was collected using technology and human intelligence.

On one side, there is China and on the other, Pakistan. Today, Nepal is also distancing itself from us. Everybody is moving away from us.”The Congress chief said that despite visiting 42 countries, PM Modi has not visited Manipur, where ethnic violence has led to loss of life. “He has travelled to 42 countries in the world, but so far he has not visited Manipur, where people are dying,” Kharge said.He accused PM Modi of neglecting domestic issues in favour of international appearances. “Modi ji, where are you? He is visiting eight countries, but he’s not looking towards his country's people. He is not looking at the farmers of this country,” he added.Kharge also alleged that the government under PM Modi has harmed the Indian economy over the last 11 years and undermined the Constitution.“He has ruined the country’s economy and destroyed the Constitution,” he said.He further mocked the prime minister, saying, “If someone gives Modi a cap or a medal he will wear it and go around,” urging that the focus should instead be on the welfare of farmers and the common people.Additionally, in a sharp attack on the RSS and BJP, Kharge referred to recent comments attributed to an RSS functionary suggesting the removal of the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ from the Constitution.“I challenge them – be it him, their BJP, PM Modi or Amit Shah – no one can remove those words,” Kharge said.During his address in Hindi, he said: “I heard that an RSS leader from Shimoga said that the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ should be removed from the Constitution. I challenge all of them – BJP, PM Modi, Amit Shah – no one can do it.”Reading from the BJP’s own organisational constitution, Kharge pointed out that the party’s own document states allegiance to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy.“If you hate secularism and socialism so much, why have you written it in your party’s Constitution?” he asked. “Your own party constitution says the BJP shall bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India and to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy. Then why are you trying to remove these values now?”Kharge also cited past Indo-Pak conflicts while criticising the current government's posture.He said: “You talk big about Pakistan. We helped them in the past. Then why did you back away? You say you ended the war between India and Pakistan. You say you calmed things down. Then why are you silent now, Prime Minister? Speak up. There is no need for Trump in India. We are strong, and we are ready to fight – just as Indira Gandhi once split Pakistan and created Bangladesh.”He urged PM Modi to stop misleading the people and to act decisively if the country’s interests are at stake.“If you had to act, you were in power, you could have.

Calling it a “matter of immense pride,” Modi thanked the government and people of Ghana and dedicated the honour to the youth of both nations.“I humbly accept this award on behalf of 1.4 billion Indians. I dedicate this to the aspirations of our youth, our rich cultural diversity, and the historic ties between India and Ghana,” he said.PM Modi’s visit — the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Ghana in over three decades — marks a significant moment in India-Africa relations.

Poll Which acquisition project do you think is most crucial for national security? Mine Countermeasure Vessels QRSAM Air Defence Systems

QRSAMs designed to intercept hostile fighters

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Thursday gave preliminary nod to three major acquisition projects and seven smaller ones, collectively worth over Rs 1 lakh crore, ranging from specialised spy aircraft and advanced minesweepers to quick-reaction air defence missiles and underwater autonomous vessels.The biggest project to get “acceptance of necessity (AoN)”, which is just the first step in the long-winded procurement process, was for the indigenous construction of 12 mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for around Rs 44,000 crore, which will take almost a decade, sources told TOI.These specialised warships, each with a displacement of 900-1,000 tonne, will be capable of detecting, tracking and destroying underwater mines laid by enemy forces to choke harbours and ports, disrupt shipping and maritime trade.They are crucial amid the expanding maritime collusiveness between China and Pakistan. At present, the Navy makes do with just “clip-on mine countermeasure suites” mounted on some ships to plug the major capability gap.The second big project was the Rs 36,000 crore procurement of the new quick reaction surface to air missile (QRSAM) systems developed by DRDO , with three regiments for the Army and three squadrons for the IAF.Overall, the Army Air Defence (AAD) has projected a requirement of 11 such regiments.These highly-mobile QRSAMs, designed to intercept hostile fighters, helicopters and drones at ranges up to 30 km, will add to the country’s existing multi-layered air defence network that played a crucial role under Operation Sindoor in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities.The third major project was for three ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance) planes, designed to identify and help target high-value enemy targets on the ground with greater precision and accuracy by fighter jets and missiles, for around Rs 10,000 crore.These aircraft will be equipped with a wide array of indigenous sensors and systems developed by DRDO, like synthetic aperture radars, electro-optical and infrared sensors, for gathering “actionable intelligence” in real-time on enemy infrastructure, build-ups and movements.Another interesting project granted AoN was for semi-submersible autonomous vessels for ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions. They will be acquired under the ‘Make-II’ category project, where prototype development is funded by the industry.Two other naval projects included procurement, through competitive bidding, of super-rapid gun mounts (SRGMs), which are the main 76mm guns fitted on warships, and the DRDO-developed “processor-based moored mines” that detonate upon sensing an enemy warship’s acoustic, magnetic or pressure signature.AoNs were also accorded for procurement of armoured recovery vehicles, electronic warfare systems and the tri-Service integrated common inventory management system for better supply chain management, the MoD said.","The defence ministry on thursday gave preliminary nod to three major acquisition projects and seven smaller ones, collectively worth over rs 1 lakh crore.

Tampa Bay Rays’ Wander Franco was involved in the trafficking of a 14 year old girl and was helped by the victim’s mother



The Tampa Bay Rays’ Wander Franco was once considered to be a pretty promising player in the team and his fans had huge hopes from the star player until it all came crashing down a year ago when he was accused of sexually assaulting a minor in the Dominican Republic. This news had sent shockwaves across the league and here is everything that happened.Wander Franco was 17 years old when he signed a deal with the Tampa Bay Rays for a whopping signing bonus of $3.85 million. He was also ranked as one of the top international prospects in the 2017 international class.All was going well for the Tampa Bay Rays’ Wander Franco and he even ended up tying the knot with his wife in 2021 after the two became parents to two boys in 2018 and 2022.While Wander Franco’s career in the MLB was just taking off, when on 9th July 2024, he was charged with allegations of human trafficking , sexual exploitation of a minor and sexual abuse in the Dominican Republic.The MLB had immediately suspended him and also reacted to the whole scandal. Last year, the league issued an official statement that read as, “We are aware of the charges against Mr. Franco. Our investigation remains open, and we will continue to closely monitor the case as it moves forward.”On 26th June 2025, the Tampa Bay Rays’ Wander Franco was found guilty in the Dominican Republic and the young player received a suspended sentence of two years in prison.As per reports, Wander Franco was accused of being in a sexual relationship with a 14 year old girl when he was 21 years old. The young victim’s mother, Martha Vanessa Chevalier Almonte, was also convicted and has been sentenced to 10 years in prison.Apparently, the prosecutors were able to prove that the victim’s mother had gained a considerable amount of money by trafficking her young daughter to Wander Franco.With this, Wander Franco’s visa issue remains complicated as he has not been able to play in the league since 2023.Also Read: MLB fan sparks outrage after being removed from stadium for interfering with the match in Diamondbacks vs. Giants game","Wander franco has been accused of human traficcking a 14 year old girl.

From the classroom to the workplace, consent remains misunderstood

Social media and toxic masculinity fuel the pressure

In the aftermath of the Hockey Canada sexual assault trial, a group of high school seniors from Kitchener, Ontario, are voicing what many women across the country are feeling — that despite the global attention from the #MeToo movement, little has changed when it comes to real-world safety, respect, and justice for young women.The girls, all 12th-graders, shared their daily experiences with harassment — not in viral headlines, but in grocery stores and bakeries, where older men make predatory remarks and ignore boundaries.Seventeen-year-old Samira Nur explained: “I encounter a lot of creepy men… I’m at work, and under the expectation that I still have to treat these people with kindness, despite the fact that I’m being, like, fully disrespected.”Her classmate, Anna De Sousa, recounted a chilling annual encounter with an older male customer: “Last year, he was like, ‘You’re 17 now. Next year, I’ll be back. We’re gonna go out.’ Every time I see his face, my body literally starts shaking.”These aren’t isolated incidents—they’re part of a wider issue that the girls say their education barely prepared them for. Consent was glossed over in brief lessons, often through awkward metaphors like “the tea video.”As Samira put it: “It wasn’t really treated very seriously.”The rise of online platforms has only made things worse. With Snapchat and Instagram, harassment is more anonymous, more constant, and more cruel. “Honestly, I think it’s gotten worse,” said Nishtha Tomer. “They will not say a word to you in real life, but online, it’s the meanest things.”And with influencers like Andrew Tate spreading misogynistic messages, girls like Loyd Gebreselassie are noticing a shift in male attitudes: “This trend is growing with younger men… All these ideologies they’ve gathered and almost try to force onto women.”The teens acknowledge #MeToo helped break silence and remove shame. But legal and systemic progress feels distant. “More so that than actually really solving anything,” said Shantelle Carrion.Also Read: When will the Hockey Canada sexual assault verdict be delivered?

Toronto’s short-term money couldn’t match Vancouver’s long-term commitment

Canucks’ top-line trust and legacy role likely influenced his decision

In a surprising twist to the NHL offseason, Vancouver Canucks forward Brock Boeser has reportedly turned down a more lucrative contract offer from the Toronto Maple Leafs to stay in Vancouver. The decision, revealed by NHL insider Nick Kypreos in the Toronto Star, reinforces Boeser’s deep-rooted loyalty to the team he has called home for nine seasons.As the Maple Leafs reshaped their roster after trading Mitch Marner to the Vegas Golden Knights, they aggressively pursued free agents. One of their targets was Brock Boeser, who had just completed a solid season with 25 goals and 50 points in 75 games.According to Nick Kypreos, “The word is that the Leafs may have offered a higher annual salary than the $7.25 million (U.S.) that he took to stay with the Vancouver Canucks, but on a much shorter-term deal than the seven years he agreed to.”Boeser instead signed a seven-year, $50.75 million contract with the Canucks, averaging $7.25 million annually—underscoring his desire for stability and commitment to a team that has stuck with him through ups and downs.Boeser’s chemistry with linemates Elias Pettersson and Jake DeBrusk remains a key component of Vancouver’s offense.Having reached a career-high 40 goals in the 2023-24 season, Boeser has clearly proven his worth as a top-line sniper, and the Canucks have rewarded that loyalty.NHL insider Daniele Franceschi commented on The FAN Morning Show that Toronto missed out on a golden opportunity: “They (Leafs) certainly had enough flexibility to make it all happen... I think it would have been an interesting fit, obviously not as complete a player as Mitch Marner, but if you talk about just the star power and certainly the goal-scoring upside.”Franceschi also noted that Boeser’s experience handling pressure in the Canadian market could have made him a valuable asset in Toronto—something Marner, he suggested, struggled with.Also Read: “It’s on the management”: Former NHL executive slams Maple Leafs management for letting Mitch Marner walk away after nine seasons As the Leafs continue to search for their next offensive star, Boeser’s decision sends a clear message: sometimes, stability, familiarity, and loyalty outweigh short-term financial gains.","Vancouver canucks forward brock boeser has signed a seven-year, $50.75 million contract with the canucks.

When George Kittle paid respect to every military worker on the field

George Kittle is known for many things; for being one of the most dynamic tight ends in the NFL, playing for the San Francisco 49ers, his acute athleticism, and his tough blocking. Kittle quickly rose to prominence after being drafted in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL Draft and his ability to both catch passes and block at an elite level makes him a rare dual-threat.He was also known for his philanthropic work, but one of the most standout moments in his career occurred a few years ago when he shook hands with each service member as he entered the field during a game. Though it seemed unusual at first, viewers were quick to applaud his gesture as it showed his deep sense of patriotism.The NFL ground has been no stranger to political statements and several players have taken the opportunity to express their political views via certain gestures which have at times invited backlash. George Kittle’s gesture on the other hand was unanimously well-received and his fans applauded him widely for his gesture.Interestingly, the military used to be a big draw at major sporting events in the US. Up until a few years ago, military personnel would be present at games. Many people may not know his In the past, the Department of Defense paid millions to NFL teams for patriotic displays, such as on-field enlistment ceremonies and military salutes.This was deemed slightly controversial as it was deemed to be ""paid patriotism"" and led to investigations in the mid-2010s. Since then, the NFL and military have reduced promotional partnerships to maintain transparency and avoid the appearance of exploiting patriotism for marketing.However, military appreciation still exists—many teams host “Salute to Service” games, honor veterans during halftime, or invite active-duty members to attend as guests. The difference is that these gestures are now more symbolic, subtle, and focused on genuine tribute rather than scripted promotions or recruitment-driven appearances.",George kittle is a tight end for the san francisco 49ers.

What is the Einstein visa? How Melania Trump qualified for a visa reserved for Nobel-level talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-einstein-visa-how-melania-trump-qualified-for-a-visa-reserved-for-nobel-level-talent/articleshow/122204926.cms,"

What is the EB-1 or 'Einstein' visa?

How did Melania Trump qualify for the Einstein visa?

The larger debate: Loopholes, privilege, and policy





When Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein visa,” in 2001, it raised eyebrows and continues to stir debate. Reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, arts, education, business, or athletics, the EB-1 green card is typically associated with Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, or globally recognized experts. Melania, a Slovenian model at the time, was not widely known for groundbreaking accomplishments, prompting questions about how she met the high bar required. So, what exactly is the Einstein visa, and how did the former First Lady qualify for a program meant for the world’s best and brightest?The EB-1 visa is a US employment-based green card designed for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in specific fields, or who are recognized as outstanding professors, researchers, or multinational executives. Applicants must prove “sustained national or international acclaim” and either win a major international award (like a Nobel Prize) or meet at least three of ten criteria set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include published work, media recognition, contributions to a field of major significance, or commanding a high salary compared to others in the same field.While the standards are rigorous, the process is subjective.Immigration officers ultimately decide if the evidence supports a claim of extraordinary ability. This subjectivity has sparked debate over how consistently the criteria are applied and who benefits most from its loopholes.Melania Trump, then known as Melania Knauss, was living in New York as a model when she applied for the EB-1 visa in 2000. It was approved the following year. Though she was featured in magazines and had some runway experience, she had not received prestigious modeling awards or reached the supermodel status typically associated with international acclaim. Critics argue her qualifications were modest compared to the visa's intent.Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett recently reignited the controversy, questioning whether Melania’s case truly exemplifies merit-based immigration. Her approval has drawn comparisons to other questionable EB-1 recipients, including Playboy models and niche artists who managed to craft narratives aligning with the visa’s requirements.Experts note that while the visa is often seen as exclusive, it can be awarded to applicants whose accomplishments, though not widely known, are well-documented and strategically framed within a narrow field. In Melania’s case, her successful petition may have emphasized uniqueness in her modeling niche, media presence, or professional trajectory.The EB-1 program, limited to around 40,000 visas annually, has been praised for attracting top global talent. But its subjective evaluation process has also made it vulnerable to exploitation. Legal experts and immigration attorneys admit that certain applicants with the right legal guidance can tailor their portfolios to meet the criteria, even without widely celebrated achievements.Adding to the irony, Melania later used her citizenship to sponsor her parents for green cards through “chain migration,” a policy her husband, Donald Trump, has publicly opposed. This contradiction has further politicized her immigration journey and raised broader questions about fairness, privilege, and transparency in the US immigration system.","Melania trump received an eb-1 visa, often dubbed the ‘einstein visa,’ in 2001.

Christian Dvorak turns down Canucks for Philadelphia Flyers



Vancouver Canucks still make key internal moves



The Vancouver Canucks began free agency with clear intent, General manager Patrik Allvin targeted veteran center Mikael Granlund. And reportedly pitching a four-year offer worth around $6 million annually, however, Granlund ultimately declined and opted to sign a three-year deal. That too with the Anaheim Ducks at $7 million per season.This rejection stung the Canucks’ front office. Especially after they had invested time and effort into securing a long-term playmaker up the middle. Granlund was seen as a strong fit given his two-way ability and experience, but Anaheim’s offer proved too appealing. The Canucks’ bid was competitive in term and value, but still fell short of what Granlund wanted.While the Granlund negotiations were unfolding, the Canucks were simultaneously pursuing another top-six option in Christian Dvorak. According to CHEK’s Rick Dhaliwal, Vancouver may have offered Dvorak a three-year, $12 million deal. Yet, he too walked away. Instead signing with the Philadelphia Flyers on a one-year deal worth $5.4 million.Dvorak’s snub came despite the Canucks being willing to invest long term.A move that showed their confidence in his upside, and the Flyers may have offered more clarity in role or vision. The factors that likely tilted Dvorak’s decision away from British Columbia.Despite the dual setbacks, not everything went wrong for Vancouver. On the opening day of free agency, the Canucks locked in star winger Brock Boeser with a seven-year extension worth $50.25 million. That deal ensured that one of their most important offensive weapons remains in place long term.The Granlund and Dvorak rejections will undoubtedly shape the Canucks’ next steps in the market. But the offseason is far from over, and Vancouver still has cap space and internal momentum. What remains unclear is whether these early losses reflect broader concerns among players about the franchise’s trajectory, or whether they were simply outbid in a competitive field.Also Read: What Connor McDavid’s mindset looks like now, according to insiders' view on Oilers contract extension drama",Vancouver canucks missed out on mikael granlund and christian dvorak.

Dominik Hašek didn’t hold back: “Trump is doing everything he can to help Putin”



“The weakest president! @realDonaldTrump chatted with the biggest criminal of the 21st century, Putin, and he immediately sent more than 500 drones and ballistic missiles to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev… Trump is doing everything he can to help Putin in his imperialist goals… Despicable.”

This isn’t Hašek’s first rodeo when it comes to Putin and politics



He says Trump’s call emboldened Putin and now kids are suffering



“Trump has proven more than once that he is indifferent to the Ukrainian people,”

“Despicable.”

Things got darker: Russian officials reportedly threatened Hašek for speaking up



You don’t usually expect brutal political takedowns to come from NHL legends, but Dominik Hašek just changed the game. The Hall of Fame goalie, once known for stopping slapshots, is now stopping short of calling Trump a war enabler. After Donald Trump reportedly chatted with Vladimir Putin , Russia launched over 500 drones and missiles into Ukraine’s capital, injuring dozens. Hašek’s response? A firestorm tweet calling Trump “the weakest president” and accusing him of helping Putin’s “imperialist goals.” Yeah. This wasn’t just shade, it was a direct hit.The timing was too perfect and too horrifying. Just hours after Trump’s phone call with Putin, Russian forces unleashed a terrifying assault on Kyiv. Buildings exploded. Children were hurt. Civilians ran for cover. And Dominik Hašek didn’t stay quiet.Hašek has been one of the most vocal global athletes speaking out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since 2022.He’s labeled the war “imperialist,” demanded bans for Russian athletes who stay silent, and directly criticized international sports organizations for giving Putin a platform.He even called out the NHL for “cowardice” over its continued inclusion of Russian players, saying silence equals support.The latest drone strike wasn’t just any attack, it was one of the largest assaults on Kyiv in months. According to Ukrainian authorities, 539 drones and 11 ballistic missiles were launched, causing massive destruction and multiple injuries, including children.For Hašek, that kind of horror isn’t accidental, it’s the consequence of weak leadership.Hašek wrote.Earlier this year, Hašek revealed that Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president had allegedly sent him death threats in response to his activism. In one chilling message, Medvedev reportedly hinted that Hašek should take his own life. The Czech government took it seriously. Prime Minister Petr Fiala publicly backed Hašek, condemning the threats and offering him protection. But instead of backing down, Hašek went louder, filing formal complaints and urging the IOC and NHL to stop giving Russia a global stage.This isn’t just a former athlete popping off on social media. Hašek is leading a charge demanding accountability from sports leagues, politicians, and fans. He’s not trying to win popularity points. He’s calling Trump “despicable.” He’s calling Putin “the biggest criminal of the 21st century.” And he’s pushing the sports world to wake up and pick a side.Also read - Carolina Hurricanes fans react to Brent Burns’ retirement with emotional tributes","Nhl legend dominik hašek says trump enabled putin’s attack on ukraine. “trump is doing everything he can to help putin in his imperialist goals… despicable,” he tweeted.
