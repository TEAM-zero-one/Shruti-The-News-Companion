Air India Flight Faces Stall, GPWS Warnings After Takeoff From Delhi In Second Near-miss

Scheduling and rostering lapses at Air India continue five months after being reprimanded by the regulator on this issue. In the latest instance, a co-pilot and a senior captain have been taken off flying duty after the airline found they operated a flight each last month with a lapsed English Language Proficiency (ELP) licence in one case. And in the other, a co-pilot did so without undergoing mandatory corrective training after not being able to clear the bi-annual pilot proficiency check (PPC) - instrument rating (IR) test.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is investigating these lapses and has sought a report from the airline. AI is learnt to have asked pilots to ensure they meet all licence requirements.The co-pilot had not been able to clear his latest IR-PPC check. While this is not an out of the ordinary occurrence, pilots have to mandatorily undergo corrective training and get their proficiency rechecked to a satisfactory level of performance before they can fly again. In this case, however, the Airbus A320 co-pilot operated a flight without the same and the lapse is learnt to being viewed very seriously by authorities.On this issue, an AI spokesperson said: “An instance of a first officer operating a flight after an unsatisfactory recurrent training check was detected by the training team.As soon as the error came to our notice, a crew scheduler and the pilot involved were off-rostered. Strong disciplinary proceedings have been initiated and the same has been duly reported to the regulator, DGCA.”In the other case, a senior commander was the pilot-in-command of an A320 flight despite a lapsed ELP licence. A valid ELP is among the requirements mandatory for pilots to exercise the privilege of their licence, or in simple terms fly.On this issue, AI said: “An instance of a senior pilot operating a flight with a lapsed ELP licence was detected. As soon as the error came to our notice, the senior pilot involved was off-rostered and the matter is being investigated. The same has been duly reported to the regulator, DGCA.”Senior pilots say these lapses raise questions over the oversight in AI to ensure only fully compliant pilots are rostered to operate flights.Just a week after the June 12 Ahmedabad crash, the DGCA had found serious issues with AI rostering. While ordering immediate removal of three senior officials increase of crew scheduling following “lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements,” the DGCA had warned AI that “any future violation of crew scheduling norms, licensing, or flight time limitations will attract strict enforcement action, including but not limited to penalties, license suspension, or withdrawal of operator permissions as applicable. ”Basically, the regulator had gone to the extent of shutting down AI if lapses on crew scheduling continue.The June 20 DGCA order on the three officials had said: “Repeated and serious violations voluntarily disclosed by Air India concerning flight crew being scheduled and operated despite lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements… point to systemic failures in crew scheduling, compliance monitoring, and internal accountability.”",A co-pilot and a senior captain have been taken off flying duty after the airline found they operated a flight each last month with a lapsed english language proficiency licence.

“Even Trump Doesn't Know...”: Army Chief on Rapidly Evolving Security Challenges

NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Saturday addressed a gathering in his hometown Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, where he reflected on Operation Sindoor , spoke about the future of warfare, and even took a dig at US President Donald Trump over his unpredictable statements and recent claims about mediating peace between India and Pakistan.Speaking at an event at TRS College, General Dwivedi highlighted the uncertainty and complexity of emerging global challenges. He said, ""... Future challenges are coming. They're instability, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity... You and I are completely clueless about what the future holds.""He then added, ""What is Trump doing today? I think even Trump doesn't know what he is going to do tomorrow. Challenges are coming so quickly that by the time you try to grasp an old challenge, a new one emerges, and the same security challenges our military faces. Whether it's on the border, terrorism, natural disasters, or cyber warfare. The new things that have started: space warfare, satellites, chemical, biological, radiological, and information warfare. The way rumours are spread. As you heard in Operation Sindoor, Karachi has been attacked. So much such news came, which seemed like news to us too. Where did it come from, who did it?... In the scope of all these challenges, you have to work on land, sky, water and all three...""Speaking to reporters in Rewa, General Dwivedi asserted that India only destroyed terrorist infrastructure in the neighbouring country.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan. The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended on May 10 with an understanding to stop military actions.Also read: Foreign policy reset under Trump 2.0?

""We attacked places that had the presence of terrorists. We did not target innocent civilians or defence installations. We achieved our goal in Operation Sindoor and sent a message to Pakistan that we are not like them,"" he said, adding that no action was taken during prayers or namaz.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that he negotiated a peace deal between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.

"Former Prince Andrew brought 40 prostitutes to hotel in Thailand using taxpayer money, reveals historian; 'spectacular fall from grace'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/former-prince-andrew-brought-40-prostitutes-to-hotel-in-thailand-using-taxpayer-money-reveals-historian-spectacular-fall-from-grace/articleshow/125022496.cms,"'No moral boundaries'





Furious Sandringham Residents Slam Andrew’s Move; “He’s A Horrible Man, We Don’t Want Him Here!”

Prince Charles predicted Andrew would 'chase women and play golf'





Why was Andrew stripped of his titles?





Disgraced royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor allegedly had 40 prostitutes brought to his five-star hotel over just four days during an official taxpayer-funded trip to Thailand, according to royal historian Andrew Lownie.Speaking on the Daily Mail podcast Deep Dive: The Fall of the House of York, Lownie accused Andrew of using his role as the UK’s Trade Envoy to “chase women and line his pockets”. He claimed the former prince “had no moral boundaries” and often turned official visits into private holidays.Lownie described what he called Andrew’s “spectacular fall from grace” and said British diplomats allowed the alleged incidents to happen.Andrew went to Thailand to celebrate the birthday of the King.“There was a famous trip to Thailand for the birthday celebrations of the King. Andrew is representing his country and insists on staying in a five-star hotel rather than the embassy, which he always did,” Lownie said. “Andrew had 40 prostitutes brought in the space of four days. This was all enabled by diplomats and others.”The historian told podcast host Sarah Vine that his information was verified by multiple sources, including a Reuters correspondent and a member of the Thai royal family.Lownie also claimed that then-Prince Charles had warned against giving Andrew the Trade Envoy role back in 2001, fearing he would “just chase women and play golf.” Despite the warning, Lownie said Charles was overruled by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his close ally Peter Mandelson.He described Andrew at the time as “a man in the middle of a midlife crisis.” “In 2001, Andrew is 41, he's having his midlife crisis and he basically starts chasing lots and lots of women,” said Lownie.“He uses the excuse of his role as Trade Envoy, paid for by the taxpayer, to go off on these trips. He always puts in two weeks of ‘private time’. So, we pay for his holiday and then he goes off and does things,"" Lownie added.Beyond the claims of sex-fuelled trips, Lownie said his greater concern was Andrew’s alleged misuse of his trade role for personal gain. He accused the former prince of using the position to further business interests for himself and his associate David Rowlands.Prince Andrew was first stripped of his military titles and royal patronages in January 2022 after facing a civil sexual assault lawsuit in the United States, filed by Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abusing her when she was 17 — allegations he denied. His association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had already severely tarnished his public image.Earlier this week, King Charles III went further, removing all of Andrew’s remaining royal titles and honours and evicting him from his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge. The decision followed renewed public outrage after revelations in Giuffre’s posthumous memoir about Epstein’s network and Andrew’s alleged involvement.",Andrew mountbatten-windsor allegedly had 40 prostitutes brought to his five-star hotel over just four days during an official taxpayer-funded trip to thailand.

“Wishing all type of f*cking STDs on me”: Cardi B fights back after Offset 's project and Stefon Diggs ' link-up rumors

NO SWEAT

There’s a limit to one’s tolerance. And once a threshold’s crossed, nobody can stop a calamity from coming. Over the past few months, ever since the Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B gave her “pregnancy with Stefon Diggs” news, she has been subjected to intense scrutiny, judgment, unwanted attention, and a seemingly boundless “dark energy.” All these months, she kept quiet. But now it may have reached her threshold, and she’s going off on all of her haters—one at a time. She thoroughly believes karma is coming for them. “However, one thing I notice, I swear to God, and it’s so real—anybody that messes with me while I’m at my most vulnerable—and my most vulnerable is always when I’m pregnant,” Cardi B said on X Spaces early Friday morning. “God always punishes them. Two, three years might pass…and God goes and punish them the worst way.”Cardi B described the kind of “dark energy” she felt during this crucial time of her life. “Remember when I said at the meet-and-greet that I felt like a lot of dark energy,” she said via Billboard. “And weird things coming on my pregnancy. I felt a lot of hate coming. I felt like there was a lot of hate coming from different angles, and today, I see that I’m still proving that.”Cardi B then stated that the hate was coming from bloggers, her partner Stefon Diggs’ previous relationships, enemies, rappers, and her own past relationships. “There’s hate that was coming from bloggers. There’s hate that was coming from women that my baby dad dealt (with) in the past. There was hate that’s coming from f*cking enemies that I have, rappers wishing all type of f*cking STDs on me while I’m pregnant and clearly partners that I dealt with.”Recently, New England Patriots star wide receiver Stefon Diggs was in the spotlight for a viral rumor that claimed he got Drake’s Kiki (K’yanna Barber) from the “In My Feelings” song pregnant.Rapper Offset dropped a Halloween treat for his fans called “Haunted by Fame” featuring NBA YoungBoy, NoCap, and Lil Dump and one of the songs titled, “NO SWEAT,” supposedly hints at Cardi B—“How the f*ck you leave Jordan for Rodman? (Huh?)You a fool if you think that I’m hurt (Hurt)You ain’t happy, I know how it work (Woo)How you married and still givin’ birth? (Hey)Get some help, b*tch, you goin’ berserk (Hey).”Addressing to these supposed forms of “dark energy,” the 33-year-old rapper has resorted to a belief she’s often noticed—those who mess with her when she’s vulnerable, God punishes them in the worst possible way. “However, one thing I notice, I swear to God, and it’s so real—anybody that messes with me while I’m at my most vulnerable—and my most vulnerable is always when I’m pregnant,” she said. “God always punishes them. Two, three years might pass…and God goes and punish them the worst way.”The American rapper is currently in the final chapter of her pregnancy, and she is expecting her fourth child, her first with Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs. In February, she will begin her “Little Miss Drama Tour,” whose accompanying album, “Am I The Drama?” was dropped on September 19.","Cardi b is currently in the final chapter of her pregnancy.

Offset throws direct shade at Cardi B and Stefon Diggs in “No Sweat” from Haunted by Fame

Cardi B steps forward with Stefon Diggs amid the chaos

Offset turned Halloween into more than just a night of tricks and treats — it became a full-blown lyrical ambush. The rapper shocked fans by dropping his surprise album Haunted by Fame on October 31, and one track in particular, “No Sweat,” instantly lit up the internet. The song’s aggressive tone and pointed lyrics seemed aimed straight at his estranged wife, Cardi B, and her boyfriend, NFL wide receiver Stefon Diggs.This latest release feels like Offset’s most personal outburst since the couple’s public split. Known for turning pain into performance, the former Migos star poured raw emotion into every bar. Yet, one explosive line stood out from the rest — a brutal basketball-themed metaphor that fans quickly decoded as a direct jab at Cardi’s new relationship.On “No Sweat,” Offset delivers a verse that left no room for guessing: “How the f* you leave Jordan for Rodman? / You a fool if you think that I’m hurt.” The reference to NBA legends Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman instantly caught attention, with fans interpreting Offset as the “Jordan” in the comparison — disciplined, accomplished, and steady — and Diggs as “Rodman,” wild and unpredictable. The lyric set social media ablaze within hours, with thousands of fans dissecting its meaning and debating its intent.Offset didn’t stop there. He followed up with another sting: “You ain’t happy, I know how it work / How you married and still givin’ birth? / Get some help, bitch, you goin’ berserk.” The timing of these lines raised eyebrows, coming months after Cardi filed for divorce in July 2024. She later accused Offset of dragging out the process, claiming he demanded she cover his tax debts before finalizing the split.While Offset aired his frustrations through music, Cardi B appeared unbothered. The Grammy winner confirmed she’s expecting her fourth child — her first with Stefon Diggs — and made it clear she’s moved on. She shares three children with Offset: Kulture, 7, Wave, 4, and Blossom, 13 months.Offset’s Haunted by Fame proves that their story is far from over.

Prince Andrew’s Royal Life ENDS: King Charles Forces Brother Out After Epstein Scandal

What happened

What is next for Andrew





King Charles III, on Thursday, has stripped his brother Andrew of his ‘prince’ title and has ordered him to vacate his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge.The move follows weeks of mounting pressure and public scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said, as cited by AP. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”The announcement came amid mounting outrage after Virginia Giuffre, a key accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, reiterated her sexual assault allegations against Prince Andrew, claims that he continues to deny.The claims were detailed in her posthumously published memoir, where she recounts how Epstein allegedly trafficked her to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including twice when she was just 17.Andrew, 65, has consistently denied Giuffre’s allegations but withdrew from royal duties following a widely criticised BBC interview in November 2019, where he sought to defend himself against her claims.Also read: A look at Prince Andrew's former roles and crown perks he’s losing In 2022, he reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement after Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against him in New York. Though Andrew made no admission of guilt, he expressed regret for Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.In a 2019 BBC interview, Andrew said he had known British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of media tycoon and former MP Robert Maxwell, since her university days.It was Maxwell who introduced him to her then-partner, Jeffrey Epstein, in 1999. The three maintained a close friendship, even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.Andrew is also alleged to have personally invited Epstein and Maxwell to Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish estate, that same year, as cited by The Independent.In June this year, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a New York court for her role in recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.In a separate development, reports this week also revealed that Prince Andrew had hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge during his daughter Beatrice’s birthday celebrations in 2006, just two months after a US arrest warrant was issued for Epstein over the sexual assault of a minor, as cited by the BBC.Andrew is expected to relocate to a property on the King’s private Sandringham estate in Norfolk, with the move to be privately funded by King Charles.His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also vacate Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements.Formal notice to surrender the lease at Royal Lodge was issued on Thursday, and Andrew’s move to Sandringham is expected to take place “as soon as practicable.” He will receive a private allowance from the King, while any additional income will be his own responsibility, as reported by The Guardian.Also read: King Charles boots Prince Andrew out of Windsor home, strips all titles over Epstein links Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will keep their royal titles, and he remains eighth in line to the throne.It marks the most dramatic royal exit since 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. The couple were granted the titles Duke and Duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in exile.In contrast, Prince Harry, despite stepping back from royal duties, moving to California, and his ongoing rift with the family, still retains his title as Prince and Duke of Sussex.","King charles iii strips prince andrew of his 'prince' title and orders him to vacate his windsor residence, royal lodge.

JD Vance-Usha Vance rumors







Vice President JD Vance came under a lot of fire Thursday after he sided with Christianity and expressed his wish that his Hindu wife Usha Vance who, according to JD is not a very religious person, embrace Christianity. JD Vance converted to Catholicism in August 2019, long after JD Vance's marriage to Usha Vance.It was a major MAGA implosion moment as social media users started 'shipping' JD Vance with Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk -- politically and also romantically.A few weeks ago, MAGA commentators floated the idea of a Vance-Kirk ticket for 2028 -- JD Vance being the presidential candidate and Erika Kirk, the VP candidate. JD Vance is currently the top choice for the 2028 presidential candidate, apart from Marco Rubio. But in the past few weeks, support for Vance-Kirk grew louder for Vance-Rubio. But after Vance addressed the Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi, the chatter took a different turn and many MAGA supporters insinuated that JD Vance will divorce Usha Vance and will remarry Erika Kirk before his 2028 run because they argued that JD Vance knows America will not accept a 'Hindu First Lady'.The photo of Erika Kirk and JD Vance hugging invited criticism for Erika Kirk as well as she was accused of cosying up with JD Vance on the stage.Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently made some comments about JD Vance and his relationship with Usha Vance saying that Usha is scared of him.

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold



Also Read |





For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The asian arowana (scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

Row erupts over Trump’s White House bathroom redesign as US government shutdown enters 31st day: ‘No food? Look at the marble!’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/row-erupts-over-trumps-white-house-bathroom-redesign-as-us-government-shutdown-enters-31st-day-no-food-look-at-the-marble/articleshow/125015886.cms,"FULL: ‘Dems, Drop F-bombs, Ignore Americans’: Mike Johnson’s Furious Outburst | US Shutdown Day 30

Fixing bathrooms in times of crisis?



White House hits back







A row broke out after President Donald Trump proudly unveiled a lavish makeover of the Lincoln Bedroom’s bathroom in the White House, even as the government shutdown dragged into its 31st day.The MAGA chief shared more than 20 photos of the refurbished bathroom on Truth Social. He described the renovation as a tribute to the 16th US President Abraham Lincoln’s era.The new space, he said, is now “covered from floor to ceiling with black and white polished Statuary marble.” Trump claimed the marble “could be the marble that was originally there,” calling the design “very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln.”The bathroom features gold-coloured fixtures, including the taps, wall sconces, and even a gold trash bin, along with a crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Photos also showed a complete redesign in a black, white, and gold palette.However, the remodelling was not taken well by social media and Democrats, who accused Trump of being out of touch during a national crisis. “Donald Trump actually cares more about his toilet than he does about fixing your healthcare,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on X.Democratic activist Harry Sisson said: “Millions of people are being kicked off of food assistance and millions can’t afford health care anymore. But don’t worry everyone! Trump got a new bathroom.” He later called the move “so tone deaf, out of touch, and disgusting.”Adding fuel to the fire, the lavish redesign comes after the US government has temporarily halted funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), leaving millions of low-income families uncertain about their next meal. The pause comes amid a budget standoff in Congress, with lawmakers unable to agree on a spending bill to keep federal aid flowing. SNAP provides food assistance to over 40 million Americans and is a critical lifeline for families struggling with inflation and rising grocery prices.Responding to the backlash, White House spokesman Davis Ingle told CNBC that Democrats were focusing on the wrong issue. “Democrats are more concerned with President Trump’s historic beautification of the White House than they are for American citizens they are hurting because of their reckless government shutdown,” he said.Later that same day, Trump also boasted about inspecting ongoing construction at the Kennedy Center, where he had earlier replaced several board members and appointed himself as chair. “It is really looking good!” he said. “The exterior columns, which were in serious danger of corrosion if something weren’t done, are completed, and look magnificent in White Enamel — Like a different place!”","President donald trump proudly unveiled a lavish makeover of the lincoln bedroom’s bathroom in the white house.

FBI swoops in after 'pumpkin day' clue





Possible connection to ISIS

Political reaction









A potential ISIS-inspired attack in Michigan was foiled just hours before Halloween, after FBI arrested multiple suspects allegedly plotting a “pumpkin day” assault, reports CNN.The operation was carried out early Friday, preventing what director Kash Patel described as a “violent attack” planned for the holiday weekend.The plan was uncovered after months of online surveillance of a chatroom where several men allegedly discussed carrying out an ISIS-inspired attack in US. According to officials, an undercover FBI operative had been inserted into the group during the early stages of planning.The suspects had recently gone to a shooting range armed with AK-47s and other weapons, practising tactical reloads and firing dozens of rounds. That was when investigators intercepted a spooky reference to “pumpkin day” — believed to be a coded term for Halloween. This led the FBI to act immediately.“This morning the FBI thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend,” FBI Director Kash Patel said on X.“Thanks to the men and women of FBI and law enforcement everywhere standing guard 24/7 and crushing our mission to defend the homeland.”Raids were conducted in the Detroit suburbs, where heavily armed FBI and Michigan State Police teams stormed at least three homes. Investigators seized several legally owned firearms, computers and mobile devices as part of their operation.“This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” according to CNN’s chief law enforcement analyst John Miller, citing briefings from officials.At least two suspects have been arrested, while three others are being questioned. Among them, one was identified as a 16-year-old juvenile. The group had allegedly debated the timing of their attack, with some members pushing to strike on Halloween, while others argued they needed more time to prepare.Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she had been briefed on the arrests and thanked authorities for their swift action. “This morning, I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” Whitmer posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed operations in Dearborn and Inkster, saying, “There is no current threat to public safety.” The Dearborn Police Department also reassured residents that there was “no threat to the community.”Investigators are now probing any links between the arrested individuals and 19-year-old former Michigan Army National Guardsman Ammar Said, who was detained in May for plotting an ISIS-inspired attack on a US Army facility in Warren, Michigan.Officials described the Michigan cell as “home-grown radicals” with possible overseas connections, and credited close surveillance and quick coordination for preventing what could have been a Halloween tragedy.","Fbi swoops in after 'pumpkin day' clue in online chatroom.

Kash Patel pays reimbursement in advance: FBI









The FBI responded to the allegation that director Kash Patel flew on a $60M FBI jet to attend his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins' performance in Pennsylvania, and said he broke no rules while he did that. The allegation came from a former FBI agent-turned-podcaster Kyle Seraphin who commented about Patel flying around the country during the ongoing government shutdown.“We’re in the middle of government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy heads,” Seraphin said. “And this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?”This is not the first time that Kash Patel 's use of FBI jets for personal reasons came under fire. This time, the FBI issued a detailed statement comparing Kash Patel's travels with his predecessors, like Chris Wray and James Comey.The FBI director is not allowed to travel in commercial planes and they are only supposed to travel in government planes. Following the established rules, Director Patel pays a reimbursement in advance, Ben Williamson, assistant director for public affairs at FBI, said.Williamson detailed the steps Kash Patel personally takes to minimize spending.

President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill has resulted in a $16 billion hit for Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta. Meta Platforms has taken a near $16 billion one-off charge in the third quarter (Q3) related to President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said that the bill had led the business to take a non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion. Meta said that excluding this, its third-quarter net income would have increased by $15.93 billion to $18.64 billion, compared with the reported net income of $2.71 billion. The expense crashed Meta's third-quarter profit.Incidentally, this is the same bill that Elon Musk and President TrumpThe implementation of Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act led to “the recognition of a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of the U.S. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax,” Meta said. Meta also said, “We expect a significant reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years due to the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. ”The markets didn't seem pleased with $16 billion charge taken by Meta, as the company's stock fell sharply lower on Wall Street, though briefly.The shares fell $53.60, or 7 per cent, to $698.99 in after-hours trading on Wall Street but recovered to close at $751.67, up less than 1 per cent.“We had a strong quarter for our business and our community,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said in announcing the results. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses.

Meta’s headcount was 78,450 employees as of September 30, up 8% year-over-year.As for quarterly guidance, Meta said that it anticipates fourth quarter total revenue to be $56 billion-$59 billion and full-year 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be $70 billion-$72 billion.","Mark zuckerberg unveils three new meta ai smart glasses.

US Central Command accused Hamas operatives of looting an aid truck, which was traveling as part of a humanitarian convoy delivering needed assistance from international partners, in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday.CENTCOM shared a drone video showing the attack on the truck and said that the Operatives attacked the driver and stole the aid and truck after moving the driver to the road’s median.In a statement, CENTCOM said the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) — which is based in Kiryat Gat — “observed suspected Hamas operatives looting an aid truck traveling as part of a humanitarian convoy delivering needed assistance from international partners to Gazans in northern Khan Younis.”The CMCC was alerted to the incident through video surveillance from an American MQ-9 drone flying over Gaza as part of monitoring of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. “Operatives attacked the driver and stole the aid and truck after moving the driver to the road’s median. The driver’s current status is unknown,” CENTCOM said.The CENTCOM said that over the past week, international partners have delivered more than 600 trucks of commercial goods and aid into Gaza daily.This incident undermines these efforts. Nearly 40 nations and international organizations represented at the CMCC are working together to help flow humanitarian, logistical and security assistance into Gaza.Secretary of State Marco Rubio sharply condemned Hamas on Saturday after a US military drone video surfaced showing suspected operatives of the terror group looting a truck carrying humanitarian aid bound for civilians in Gaza.“Hamas continues to deprive the people of Gaza of the humanitarian aid they desperately need,” Rubio wrote on X. “This theft undermines international efforts in support of President Trump’s 20 Point Plan to deliver critical assistance to innocent civilians.”Rubio said Hamas remains “the impediment,” accusing the terror group of blocking relief intended for civilians. “They must lay down their arms and stop their looting so that Gaza can have a brighter future,” he added.The CMCC opened on Oct. 17 in southern Israel as a central hub for Gaza aid just days after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect.The centre serves as the main hub for Gaza stabilisation efforts and includes an operations floor designed to track real-time developments inside Gaza.Data published in August by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) showed that most of its aid entering the war-torn Gaza Strip had been looted inside the Palestinian territory.","Us central command accused hamas operatives of looting an aid truck, which was traveling as part of a humanitarian convoy delivering needed assistance from international partners, in the southern gaza strip on saturday.marco rubio condemns hamas for blocking relief intended for civilians.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125028457,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-4552968,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

In the Jeffrey Epstein case, another document was released that reveals his financial transactions with Wall Street figures, including two accounts that were linked to Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank.Judge Jed Rakoff ordered the records unsealed as part of a lawsuit between the US Virgin Islands and JPMorgan Chase, following requests by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal.In 2023, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit from survivors of Epstein and an additional $75 million to settle with the USVI, where Epstein owned an island. There was no admission of wrongdoing in these settlements, CNN reported.JPMorgan Chase filed a suspicious activity report with the US Treasury Department on September 26-2019 flagging more than $1 billion in transactions linked to Jeffrey Epstein from October 2003 until July 2019, according to newly unsealed court records.The bank wrote in the SAR it was flagging the transactions because of negative media about Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking of minors, media reports of allegations Epstein misappropriating money as an investment adviser, his use of multiple accounts, the Russian banks, and his relationships with two US presidents.Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged with sex trafficking underaged girls. He died weeks later by suicide in the Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial. Judge Jed Rakoff ordered the records unsealed as part of a lawsuit between the US Virgin Islands and JPMorgan Chase, following requests by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal.There was no admission of wrongdoing in these settlements. The documents are the latest in a slow release of materials tied to Epstein as public demand for accountability and transparency about Epstein has gone global.The Justice Department remained under pressure to release more information about its investigation into Epstein, and House lawmakers were taking depositions for their investigation.Included in the hundreds of pages of unsealed documents are emails between Epstein and Jes Staley, a former top official at JPMorgan Chase, who in 2021 resigned as head of Barclays bank following media scrutiny over his long relationship with Epstein.This year, Staley said he didn’t know about Epstein’s involvement with underaged girls but admitted in court that he had sex with one of Epstein’s assistants.Among the pages are emails between Epstein and Staley, with Epstein suggesting he could set up meetings for Staley to recruit new clients including the co-founders of Google and heads of nations.None of the individuals were accused of any wrongdoing. Prior to Epstein’s death in 2019, JPMorgan filed a number of SARs involving the disgraced financier’s accounts, and the documents show banking officials shared news articles about Epstein’s alleged activities.JPMorgan closed its accounts with Epstein in 2013, five years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and reached a non-prosecution agreement with the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida. The newly unsealed records include the SARs, including one dating as far back as 2002, as well as the last one filed in September 2019.“Generally, the only new material here is the SARs themselves. Those basically summarise financial information produced in litigation, much of which has been public for years. The SARs do confirm what’s been inferred all along: the bank filed SARs about Epstein early on, and specifically when it exited Epstein from the bank in 2013 – and repeatedly between 2013 and 2019, as required,” said Patricia Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase.“It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years.” In the batch of documents, there’s a letter from the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida which in 2007 sought records from Bear Stearns, one of Epstein’s banks that was later acquired by JPMorgan, as part of its then investigation into Epstein that resulted in the non-prosecution agreement.One of the biggest Wall Street names mentioned on the list of transactions on the 2019 SAR is Leon Black, a long-time associate of Epstein, who has maintained that Epstein gave him financial advice.“After an exhaustive investigation more than four years ago, the Dechert law firm concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein only for tax and estate planning advice that saved him and his family billions of dollars. To imply that Epstein somehow had influence over Black is false and patently absurd,” Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, said in a statement. “Indeed, it was Mr. Black who fired Epstein because he was disruptive and believed the fees for his services were excessive. The Dechert Report also found that Mr. Black had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.”The unsealed records include emails between Staley and Epstein about meeting in 2010 with then Prince Andrew. The then-Prince emailed Staley, “Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year.” Sen.
