VISHAKHAPATNAM: The country is emerging as a global hub for wellness under the mantra of 'Heal in India', with yoga playing a leading role in that effort, PM Narendra Modi said Saturday while addressing a record-breaking gathering of 3,02,087 yoga practitioners along Visakhapatnam's beachfront.Modi highlighted yoga's global rise and its integration into modern medicine. ""AIIMS-Delhi has shown yoga's impact on cardiac and neurological disorders, women's health, and mental well-being,"" he said, adding that premier medical institutions are now supporting evidence-based yoga therapies.He recalled India's proposal to UN to mark June 21 as International Day of Yoga , backed by 175 countries. ""This rare global consensus was not just support for a proposal - it was a collective effort for humanity,"" he said. ""After 11 years, yoga is now part of daily life for millions worldwide.""Modi said this year's theme, Yoga for One Earth, One Health, reflects how human well-being is intertwined with environmental health. ""Yoga awakens us to this interconnectedness and guides us toward unity with the world,"" he said.The PM cited examples of yoga's universal appeal - from astronauts practicing it in space to sailors performing asanas aboard Navy ships, and visually impaired people reading yoga texts in Braille. ""Whether at Sydney Opera House, the summit of Everest, or in the vast ocean, the message is the same - yoga belongs to everyone,"" he said.He said yoga is both personal and collective. ""It transforms our journey from 'Me' to 'We',"" he said. ""In times of global unrest, yoga acts as a pause button, helping humanity breathe, restore balance, and become whole again.""","Prime minister narendra modi addressed a record-breaking gathering of 3,02,087 yoga practitioners along visakhapatnam's beachfront.

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Dragging his feet to the truth after repeated denials, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday admitted that India struck Rawalpindi's Nur Khan airbase and the Shorkot airbase during Operation Sindoor , which was carried to avenge the Pahalgam terrorist attack, in which ISI-groomed terrorists killed 26 civilians.India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7. Within 45 minutes of the strike, Saudi Prince Faisal offered to speak to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on behalf of Pakistan's deputy PM, seeking to halt further action against Pakistan.Dar's statement strongly suggests that Islamabad desperately scrambled to find help in persuading India to halt its kinetic action, which was ""precise, measured and non-escalatory"". Pakistan air force Base Nur Khan, situated in Chaklala, Rawalpindi is around 10km from Islamabad, Pakistan capital. It is an active airbase that encompasses the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport within its grounds.The facility, originally established as RAF Station Chaklala and later known as PAF Base Chaklala, continues to serve as a vital military installation in Pakistan.The base is also home to PAF College Chaklala, which trains Aviation Cadets, and Fazaia Inter College Nur Khan, providing additional educational facilities on the premises.Imtiaz Gul, a defence analyst, claimed that the strategically important Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi is “under American control.”Pakistan air force base Rafiqui, situated near Shorkot in Jhang District, is a major military installation located 337 kilometers south of Islamabad. The base features a 10,000-foot runway with a parallel taxiway that serves as an emergency landing strip.The airbase was previously known as PAF Base Shorkot before being renamed after Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui, a fighter pilot from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.The base's infrastructure includes a primary runway and an emergency taxiway system that allows for aircraft recovery operations when needed.Operation Sindoor was India's swift, calculated tri‑service cross-border assault on the dead night of May 6 and 7, targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the brutal April 22 Pahalgam massacre that claimed 26 innocent lives.Within 25 minutes, India’s Army, Navy and Air Force deployed SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER smart bombs, loitering munitions and ground-to-ground weaponry, killing around 70 to 100 militants and crippling key Lashkar‑e‑Taiba, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure at Bahalwalpur and Muridke in Pakistan.Pahalgam's terrorists thought they were sending a message when they murdered husbands in front of their wives, after selecting victims by their religion. Via the name Operation Sindoor, the government sent an immeasurably bigger message back as India avenged the loss suffered by those women.Sindoor, vermillion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. Pakistan's military-intelligence-jihadi complex would have been among the first to note the image put out by Indian Army right after government's confirmation of the strikes - Operation Sindoor in block letters, with the first 'O' represented by a bowl of vermillion.","Pak deputy pm ishaq dar reveals pakistan sought saudi help to stop india’s operation sindoor.

Regional conflict still looms large





A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue . The conflict was triggered by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets last Friday, prompting swift retaliation from Tehran. Hundreds have died, and fears are mounting of a wider regional escalation.Also read: Iran strikes southern Israel; thick black smoke fills sky as missile hits high-rise apartment In the midst of this turmoil, US President Donald Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the United States will intervene militarily, depending on the prospect of renewed nuclear negotiations. Israeli leaders, meanwhile, continue to issue aggressive statements, with Defence Minister Israel Katz saying Iran's Supreme Leader “should not continue to exist.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out a large-scale overnight operation in Tehran, targeting “dozens of military industrial sites for missile production” and the Spand nuclear R&D headquarters. According to the IDF, over 60 fighter jets struck around 120 targets using “precise intelligence guidance.”“These sites were built over years and were the industrial centre of gravity of the Iranian Ministry of Defence,” the IDF said, adding that it also struck a key facility used for producing raw materials for rocket engines.The Spand headquarters, founded in 2011 by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was also hit. The IDF described it as central to Iran’s nuclear weapons programme. During the same operation, four Iranian drones were intercepted.President Donald Trump has said he will decide “within two weeks” whether the US military will become directly involved in the conflict. His remarks, delivered by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, signal a short diplomatic window to avoid further escalation.Also read: Donald Trump to decide on Iran strike in 2 weeks; White House cites 'substantial' chance of negotiations to end conflict Trump said from the Oval Office, “I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.” He added, “I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do. Nothing is finished until it is finished. The next week is going to be very big — maybe less than a week.”His comments come amid reports that the US is considering striking Iran’s underground Fordo facility, which is heavily fortified and believed to be unreachable except by America’s “bunkerbuster” bombs.Israel's opening strikes last Friday reportedly killed several senior Iranian officials, including key figures in Iran's nuclear and military command. Among them was the intelligence chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), although Tehran has not officially confirmed his death.The strikes were aimed at Iran’s nuclear research hubs, ballistic missile sites, and facilities linked to the IRGC’s Quds Force. Israel’s strategy appears to be focused on decapitating Iran’s ability to launch retaliatory operations and to disrupt nuclear infrastructure, which it believes poses an existential threat.While the Israeli military has remained tightlipped on identities, analysts believe the loss of senior IRGC figures will have significant implications for Iran’s military coordination and may have triggered the intensity of its missile response.An Iranian missile that struck Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, Israel, was rigged with a cluster munition warhead, according to Israel’s Home Front Command. This type of weapon carries dozens of submunitions that explode on impact, posing severe risks over a wide area.Also read: Hospital bombed, nuclear sites hit: Iran-Israel clash spirals; Netanyahu vows to make 'tyrants' pay The strike wounded at least 80 patients and medical staff. Although most injuries were minor, the hospital's infrastructure suffered heavy damage. Gas, water and airconditioning systems were all disrupted.Iran denied targeting the hospital, claiming the missile was aimed at a nearby Israeli military tech facility. An Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, admitted there was no specific intelligence suggesting Iran planned to hit the hospital.Israel’s hospitals, including Soroka, had preemptively moved vulnerable patients underground. This preparedness likely saved lives during the strike.Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, directly blamed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for the missile strike on Soroka Medical Center. Katz said Israel’s military “has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.”Also read: Ayatollah Khamenei 'can no longer be allowed to exist,' warns Israel; seeks Iran Supreme Leader's accountability over hospital attack His statement was one of the most direct threats ever issued by an Israeli official against Iran’s top leader. While Israel has often accused Khamenei of orchestrating regional terrorism, such overt calls for his elimination are rare and risky.US officials later said President Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei. Trump confirmed there were “no plans to kill him, at least not for now.”The war of words has added fuel to an already explosive situation and underscores the deeply personal nature of the conflict's rhetoric.New satellite imagery has revealed a notable absence of visible US military aircraft at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, one of Washington’s most strategic sites in the region. The images, captured on Thursday, show that aircraft normally stationed at the base have either been relocated or concealed.While the US Department of Defense has not confirmed any repositioning, analysts say this could be part of a strategic redeployment to either prepare for a strike or to shield key assets from potential Iranian retaliation.Military watchers suggest the US may be trying to reduce its exposure ahead of Trump’s decision. Others believe assets may have been repositioned to naval platforms in the Persian Gulf, which are harder to detect and more flexible in combat operations.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced fierce backlash after citing his son’s postponed wedding as a symbol of personal sacrifice during wartime. Standing in front of the missilestruck Soroka hospital, he said, “Each of us bears a personal cost, and my family has not been exempt.”Also read: 'Son's wedding cancelled for second time': Netanyahu shares 'personal cost' of war with Iran “This is the second time that my son Avner has cancelled a wedding due to missile threats. It is a personal cost for his fiancée as well, and I must say that my dear wife is a hero, and she bears a personal cost.”He continued: “It really reminds me of the British people during the blitz. We are going through a blitz.”While Netanyahu intended to strike a Churchillian tone, the remarks were ridiculed online, with critics accusing him of being emotionally detached from the actual suffering of citizens. With over 20 Israeli civilian deaths already reported, many found the analogy inappropriate.A diplomatic opening may be emerging, with Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi scheduled to meet EU and UK leaders in Geneva. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said, “A window now exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution.” The meetings follow President Trump’s statement allowing a two-week pause before making a military decision. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and representatives from France and Germany will also participate. The talks aim to halt escalation and revive negotiations around Iran’s nuclear capabilities.Also read: European FMs aim to meet Iran for nuclear talks Friday in Geneva With Iranian internet access restricted, information about the strikes and casualties has become increasingly difficult to verify. Israel had warned civilians in the city of Rasht to evacuate industrial zones ahead of targeted airstrikes. However, it's unclear how widely that warning was received. In Tehran and Isfahan, residents reported hearing anti-aircraft fire. The media blackout has complicated the international response and has limited humanitarian organisations’ ability to assess needs on the ground.While the current battle is between Israel and Iran, the implications stretch far beyond. Iran’s close ties to groups like Hezbollah and Hamas raise the risk of a multi-front war. The ongoing Gaza conflict, following Hamas’ attack in 2023, has already destabilised the region. Any miscalculation now—whether by airstrike or political move—could draw in additional players and ignite a broader Middle Eastern war. The coming days will likely prove critical in determining whether diplomacy can rein in the chaos—or whether the region is poised for deeper conflict.","A week into the war between israel and iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue.

This even as Tharoor asserted that the Congress, its values, and its workers were very dear to him as he had worked closely with party workers for 16 years and regarded them as close friends and brothers and sisters. Tharoor also reminded the party of the close relations he shares with party workers in Kerala that ""saw him through in 4 elections in his own constituency of Thiruvananthapuram.""Interestingly, Tharoor's candid admission came on the day people of Nilambur were voting to select their new MLA. The Congress, which is going all out to wrest power from the Left Democratic Front after two consecutive defeats in the state, had pitched the Nilambur byelection as a semi-final ahead of the assembly elections next year.Little wonder, the party's byelection campaign saw active involvement of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra - who is the MP from Wayanad after Rahul Gandhi opted for Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh.So, will the byelection result on June 23 impact the relations between Congress and Tharoor? Well, it certainly can.If the Congress wins the byelection without Tharoor, who has been an integral part of several party campaigns in the state, it may harden its stance further. On the other hand, if the Congress loses the byelection, it might increase the bargaining power of Tharoor vis-à-vis the state leadership.When Tharoor praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the first time in January, it evoked a very strong response from the Congress. Party chief Mallikarjun Kharge warned all leaders to toe the party line. However, the Thiruvananthapuram MP continued with his ""personal"" praise of PM Modi's foreign policies, much to the embarrassment of the Congress. Post-Pahalgam terror attack, Tharoor raised his praise pitch, completely moving away from the party line. The situation turned from bad to worse when the government picked Tharoor for its global diplomacy mission even as the Congress ignored and sidelined its leader.It will be interesting to see how Congress and Shashi Tharoor reach a truce in the near future given the recent strain in ties, which saw one Congress leader dub Tharoor as ""super spokesperson of the BJP"". The assembly elections in Kerala is scheduled for next year, but for the Congress the immediate challenge would perhaps be the upcoming Parliament session. The Congress and other opposition parties will surely go all out to corner Prime Minister Modi over the Pahalgam terror attack and US President Donald Trump's mediation claims on Operation Sindoor. It remains to be seen if Tharoor, who strongly defended the government during his global outreach post Sindoor, comes to the rescue of the government on the floor of the House. Already the BJP leaders are citing Tharoor to school the Congress on nationalism.Will Congress and Tharoor bury their differences or will they walk their own separate ways? Well, we may have an answer after the Nilambur results are out.",The outcome of the nilambur byelection will decide the future of ties between congress and its kerala leader shashi tharoor.

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020. In May 2021 she is alleged to have asked him to visit the apartment she had rented in Jolly Harbour.A group of men of Indian origin burst into the apartment and told Choksi he was “being detained to be interrogated by Indian agencies”, Fitzgerald told the court, London’s Times newspaper reported.Choksi alleges that the men told him they worked for R&AW and beat him up, left him unconscious, and tied him to a wheelchair on the yacht to Dominica to extort a false confession from him and implicate the Congress party.“The evidence points inevitably to India being behind this — they had the motivation, they had the resources,” Fitzgerald told the court, the Daily Telegraph reported.Choksi denies the charges against him.

NEW DELHI: The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right”, and that violating US laws, even after arrival, can lead to visa revocation and ineligibility for future travel.The statement, posted on the embassy’s official X handle on Thursday, emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.“Using illegal drugs or breaking any US laws while on a student/visitor visa can make you ineligible for future US visas. A US visa is a privilege, not a right… and we may revoke your visa if you break the law,” the embassy said.This is the third such advisory from the US Embassy in India in June alone, each one stressing Washington’s firm stance against visa misuse and illegal immigration.On June 10, the embassy stated that while the United States welcomes legitimate travellers, it ""cannot and will not tolerate"" illegal entry or violation of laws. A follow-up on June 16 went a step further, noting that the US has established new visa restrictions on foreign officials and facilitators of mass or illegal immigration.The latest statement comes amid a surge in deportation cases and the circulation of a viral video showing an Indian student in handcuffs at Newark Airport, allegedly being deported. The clip, shared by Indian-American author Kunal Jain, triggered a wave of concern across Indian social media.“I witnessed a young Indian student being deported from Newark Airport last night, handcuffed, crying, treated like a criminal. He came chasing dreams, not causing harm,” Jain posted on X. He said the student appeared to be from Haryana and was heard shouting: “I’m not crazy… they are hell bent to prove that I am crazy.”Jain, who tagged the Indian Embassy and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, alleged that such deportations were becoming alarmingly routine. “Every day 3-4 such cases are happening,” he wrote, describing the student as “disoriented and helpless.”As per India's Ministry of External Affairs, 1,080 Indian nationals have been deported from the US since the Trump administration returned to power earlier this year. The recent crackdown in Los Angeles has also seen mass immigration sweeps, with Trump declaring, “They spit, we hit,” in a controversial order during unrest in the city.","The us embassy in india has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a us visa is a privilege, not a right” the statement emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121954420,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1176238,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

After Phone Call With PM Modi, Trump Repeats Claim He Stopped India-Pakistan War | Op Sindoor

Change in stance after Trump calls PM Modi



After weeks of loudly claiming he brokered peace between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, US President Donald Trump has shifted his tone, crediting the two countries' leaders directly for ending the hostilities.Speaking from the Oval Office after hosting Pakistan's army chief Asim Munir for lunch on Wednesday, Trump said he was ""so happy that two smart people ... decided not to keep going with that war ... That could have been a nuclear war. Those are two nuclear powers, big ones, big, big nuclear powers, and they decided that"".Notably, Trump refrained from inserting himself as the central figure in the de-escalation – a sharp contrast to his repeated boasts since May 10, when India and Pakistan agreed to cease hostilities.In the same remarks, Trump praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and General Munir as ""very smart people"" who chose not to escalate a conflict that, in his words, ""could have been a nuclear war"".For weeks, Trump had insisted that it was his personal diplomacy - and the lure of US trade deals - that convinced the two sides to step back. On multiple occasions, he publicly claimed, ""I stopped the war"".That narrative was firmly rejected by India over the weeks, but was decisively put down by PM Modi on Wednesday.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri, speaking from the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Canada, said PM Modi told Trump during a 35-minute call that there was no US mediation, no trade-based incentive, and no discussion of American involvement at any level during Operation Sindoor , India's military response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.""India has never accepted mediation nor would it ever accept it. We have complete political unanimity on this,"" Misri quoted PM Modi as saying.PM Modi also underscored that the decision to end military action came after Pakistan - facing heavy damage to nine of its key air bases - requested a ceasefire through existing military communication channels.Trump's remarks on Wednesday came just hours after he again repeated his earlier claim: ""I stopped the war between Pakistan and India."" But the addition of a more diplomatic framing - placing emphasis on the decisions made by PM Modi and Munir - suggests a quiet climbdown, perhaps prompted by PM Modi's clear pushback and India's public disclosure of the actual sequence of events.Read: 'Two big nuclear powers avoided war': Donald Trump on meeting with Asim Munir; says trade talks on with India, Pakistan Trump's modified tone may not go unnoticed.As PM Modi ensured his side of the story was made public, fact-checkers, diplomats, and world leaders will likely be watching closely to see if Trump’s narrative continues to shift - or reverts to form.Either way, the message from New Delhi is now clear: the credit for ending the conflict lies with India and Pakistan - and not with a third party looking to insert itself into the frame.","After weeks of loudly claiming he brokered peace between nuclear rivals, us president donald trump has shifted his tone.

He noted that the extraordinary contribution of French writers opened new ways of thinking.""More than 100 years ago, in a transformative act of literary vision, Nalappat Narayana Menon translated Victor Hugo's Les Misérables into Malayalam as ‘Paavangal'. It was a cultural transplantation and the soil of Kerala received it not just out of curiosity but with gratitude and a bit of revolutionary fervour. Our famous communist leader, EMS Namboothiripad, said ‘Paavangal' was one of the sparks that led him to communism. Writers like Thagazhi and O V Vijayan have said that in the translated works of French writing, they found a new idiom of empathy, a new narrative possibility and a new lens through which to view the oppressed and the invisible.With ‘Paavangal', Malayalam found a weapon for awakening and that engagement partly contributed to the decades of remarkable visionary and social ferment in Kerala from the 1930s onwards,"" Tharoor said.He also mentioned that many other Malayalis started to translate works of French and Russian fiction and modernist works and that's how the doors to people like Guy de Maupassant, Victor Hugo and Émile Zola were opened to Malayali minds. ""That's how many Malayalis discovered the challenges of realism and introspection in a literature that mirrors society and questions it,"" he added.""The French, in many ways, have a cultural affinity to us, including in our great conversational habit.

NEW DELHI: A new report by Financial Action Task Force has flagged Pakistan's attempts to procure equipment for its missile programme by mislabeling shipment, drawing attention to the country's failure in implementing measures to combat financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which is one of the recommendations of the global watchdog.The report not only reveals that critical components for ballistic missiles originating from China were mislabeled in documents but also links the importer to Pakistan's National Development Complex which handles missile production.India is likely to use the revelations in its dossier to make another push for Pakistan's return to the FATF 'grey list' which identifies countries with weaknesses in their anti-money laundering and terror financing systems. These countries are subjected to closer monitoring and must demonstrate progress on corrective action plans. Pakistan has been on the list three times with the most recent sanction of 2018 lifted in 2022.In Feb 2020, a Chinese vessel named 'Da Cui Yun', which was en route to Port Qasim in Karachi, was intercepted at Gujarat's Kandla port. While the equipment was seized, the ship and its crew were allowed to leave after investigation.In its latest report titled 'Complex Proliferation Financing and Sanctions Evasion Schemes', FATF refers to the investigation by Indian Customs. ""Indian authorities confirmed that documents mis-declared the shipment's dual-use items. Indian investigators certified the items for shipment to be 'autoclaves', which are used for sensitive high energy materials and for insulation and chemical coating of missile motors,"" it read.""The sensitive items are included in dual-use export control lists of the Missile Technology Control Regime, India, and other jurisdictions. The Bill of Loading of the seized cargo provided evidence of the link between the importer and National Development Complex,"" it added.FATF may release the report next month amid hopes in India that it would expose Pakistan's inadequacies in combating terror financing - something which could potentially result in the country being placed under enhanced monitoring, and being returned to 'grey list'.This move would subject Pakistan to increased financial scrutiny, impacting foreign investment and capital inflows. India has been pushing for Pakistan's return to the list, citing its brazen support for terrorism and failure to comply with FATF norms.",A new report by financial action task force has flagged pakistan's attempts to procure equipment for its missile programme.

Dwyane Wade’s legendary NBA career has produced unforgettable moments, but a recent fan interaction may have added one of the most bizarre to his post-retirement highlight reel. While attending Fanatics Fest, the former Miami Heat star came face-to-face with a life-sized banana boat, courtesy of some creative fans. They actually asked him to sign it. What followed was a hilarious callback to one of the most iconic off-court images in NBA history, all thanks to his wife, Gabrielle Union , who reposted the incident on her Instagram story.The banana boat has long been part of Dwyane Wade’s public lore. Back in 2015, Wade, Gabrielle Union, LeBron James , and Chris Paul vacationed in the Bahamas. During that trip, they were photographed riding an inflatable banana boat, a photo that instantly went viral and became an internet sensation. Despite its global reach, Wade insists it wasn’t meant to be seen.Fast forward, the incident has resurfaced, and Dwyane actually signed on the banana boat. “D-Wade signed on actual banana boat…” the video caption read on the story of Union. In the video, Wade was seen with his swift chuckles. “What you want me to sign in as?” Wade asked. “To the gang,” the fans responded, prompting Wade to repeat with the same chuckle. Wade obliged and later shared the surreal moment on Instagram.Speaking on the Pardon My Take podcast, Wade previously shared, “My wife wanted to go on a banana boat. So, Chris Paul, Bron, and I all got on a banana boat. Now, we were in the middle of nowhere, no one was supposed to know this but us.” He continued, “Someone took a photo from God knows where. No one was supposed to have seen us on a banana boat!”Adding a playful touch, he joked, “If I knew they were taking a photo, we would have looked a little cooler.”Gabrielle Union also had fun with the moment. She once revealed that it was her idea to go on the banana boat in the first place, unknowingly setting the stage for one of the most talked-about images in sports pop culture.The ""Banana Boat Crew"" eventually became an unofficial nickname for Wade, LeBron, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony, even though Anthony wasn’t in the original photo. “Melo showed up late,” Wade said. “Had he been there on time, he’d be in it too.”Also Read: Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union keeps their love alive with touching tributes and romantic gestures amid vacation in France Now, years later, fans are still keeping the memory alive, this time with a Sharpie and a floating yellow tribute.
