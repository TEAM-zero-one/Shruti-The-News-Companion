"Prisons must be made disabled friendly, says Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prisons-must-be-made-disabled-friendly-says-supreme-court/articleshow/122548214.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Observing that incarceration does not suspend the right of prisoners to live with human dignity, the Supreme Court has expressed deep concern over the plight of jailed individuals with disabilities and ordered that prisons be made disabled friendly with accessible toilets, ramps and a sensory-safe environment to ensure universal accessibility.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said basic facilities needed for prisoners with disabilities are not being provided and passed a slew of directions to ensure these are made available to them. ""The punishment lies only in restriction of liberty, not in the denial of humane treatment or reasonable accommodations. Failure to meet these obligations inflicts disproportionate suffering on disabled prisoners and betrays the constitutional role of the State as a custodian - not a tormentor - of those it detains,"" the bench said.Justice Mahadevan, who penned the verdict for the bench, said persons with disabilities must be provided healthcare equivalent to that available in the general community and this includes access to physiotherapy, speech therapy, psychiatric care and assistive devices, such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, or crutches.""Most prison facilities are structurally inaccessible to individuals with mobility, sensory or cognitive impairments,"" it said.","Supreme court expresses deep concern over the plight of jailed individuals with disabilities.

Poll Do you trust Air India to handle the aftermath of the crash responsibly? Yes, they will do the right thing. No, I don't trust them.





LONDON: Relatives of flyers who died in the June 12 Air India crash have slammed the preliminary probe as a “cover-up” to protect the Tatas-owned airline, Boeing and the Indian government.“This report is wrong. We don’t accept it,” said Ameen Siddiqui, whose British brother-in-law and Gloucestershire resident Akeel Nanabawa, died alongside his wife Hannaa Vorajee and their daughter Sara in the June 12 crash of the Ahmedabad-London flight.Speaking to the UK’s The Telegraph from Surat, Siddiqui alleged that “they want to blame dead pilots who can’t defend themselves”. Siddiqui added that he had rejected Air India ’s compensation offer and would take the airline to court for “killing our family members”.UK law firms are already representing families of dozens of passengers who died in the AI 171 crash and considering legal action against Boeing and Air India.Tushar Joge, whose male cousin’s in-laws, Vallabh Nagji Agheda and wife Vinaben Vallabh Agheda, both in their 70s, died in the crash, echoed the claim that the probe report was a “cover-up” for Air India and Boeing.“We were pre-empting that they would start blaming the pilots.Why are they not looking for a mechanical fault? How qualified are the people in the Indian Air Accident Investigation Bureau? The FAA (US aviation regulator) gave an advisory in 2018 to check the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature. Shouldn’t they have made this a mandatory requirement rather than an advisory?” Joge asked.The Agheda couple were coming to the UK to spend time with their youngest daughter and her family in Reading. Speaking to TOI from Vadodara, their son-in-law said: “It does not look like it’s the pilot’s fault. It could be Boeing’s design fault with the switches, or it could be Air India’s maintenance issues. Most of the families believe it’s a problem withthe aircraft. Air India is helping us with compensation but we are more concerned about getting the right report. We want the truth to make sure another disaster doesn’t happen.”Imtiyaz Ali Syed, whose London-based brother Javed died with his wife and two children lamented that the probe report was replete with “aviation jargon praising Boeing’s systems” while saying “nothing conclusive”. “Everyone, Air India, Boeing, government, has something to protect. But we have lost our entire families. How can we move on without the truth?” Imtiyaz asked.Sameer Rafik, cousin of crash victim Faizan Rafik from Leicester, told the BBC he did not trust the Indian government. “Until the airline provides the cockpit recording to us, I’m not going to believe the report,” Rafik said.","Relatives of flyers who died in the june 12 air india crash have slammed the preliminary probe as a “cover-up” to protect the tatas-owned airline, boeing and the indian government.

Re-entry & splashdown

Recovery operations

Learning For Gaganyaan

With Grace’s gentle splash into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego at 3.02 pm (IST) on Tuesday, Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux) ended his mission, wrapping up months of training, experiments in orbit, and India’s latest stride in human spaceflight participation.When Wing Commander (retd) Rakesh Sharma soared into space aboard a Soviet spacecraft in April 1984, Shux wasn’t even born. It would be another year and a half before he entered the world. Forty-one years later, Shux’s Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission comes at a time India is making a deeper entry into human spaceflight, expanding ambitions beyond satellites and rockets.And this hasn’t escaped Shux, who in his last speech from the International Space Station (ISS), had said: “As this journey completes… India’s human spaceflight journey is both long and challenging. But I assure you, if we decide, even the stars are attainable.”PM Modi, while welcoming Shux back, said as India’s first astronaut to the ISS, he has inspired a billion dreams through his dedication, courage and pioneering spirit. “...It marks another milestone towards our own Human Space Flight Mission - Gaganyaan ,” the PM said.Grace, the Dragon capsule carrying Shux, mission commander Peggy Whitson, mission specialists Tibor Kapu and Slawosz Uznanski, had undocked from the ISS at 4.45 pm Monday.As part of the re-entry and splashdown operations, around 2.07 pm on Tuesday, Grace began the 18-minute de-orbit burn, and by 2.27 pm, Grace jettisoned the trunk (with solar panels and radiators), and the nose cone was closed by 2.33 pm.Around 2.57 pm, Grace deployed the drogue parachutes and about a minute later, the four main parachutes got deployed at an altitude of 1,000 metres. In a three-minute operation, these parachutes together reduced Grace’s velocity from 563kmph to 23kmph as altitude dropped to 800m, 600m and 400m, before the splashdown.At 3.07 pm, Peggy radioed to mission control that the crew was ready for recovery and by 3.10 pm, the recovery boats reached Grace. The recovery personnel, wearing PPE suits, first checked for hazardous gases around Grace before beginning rigging the capsule at 3.15 pm, as flight surgeons stood by for the initial medical tests to be conducted.Between 3.29 pm and 3.30 pm, Grace was nested on recovery ship “Shannon”, when the recovery teams began some routine leak checks and de-rigging and ensured it was safe for the crew to egress or exit from the side hatch.By 3.37 pm Grace was being moved from its initial place on Shannon to a deck where the crew was expected to be recovered. Between 3.40 pm and 3.41 pm, the recovery personnel opened the side hatch and began preparations to allow the crew to egress.At 3.49 pm, Peggy slid out of the capsule with a smile, followed by Shux at 5.52 pm and mission specialists Slawosz Uznanski and Tibor Kapu in the next couple of minutes. The crew was then taken to land by a helicopter. Following medical checks, they will be taken to Houston for de-briefing and other procedures.Just as Shux, Isro too has acknowledged the importance of the mission that has cost India Rs 548 crore. “...Ax-4 is one small step in orbit, but a giant leap in India’s pursuit of human spaceflight and scientific discovery,” the agency had said post-launch.Isro chairman V Narayanan, while stressing that learning outcomes — spanning astronaut training (for two), mission operations, and hardware-software-human interface — cannot be measured purely in monetary terms, had told TOI that benefits from Ax-4 far outweigh the cost.Indian Space Association director-general Lt Gen (retd) AK Bhatt said: “This is a stepping stone for India’s future crewed space journeys, including Gaganyaan and goals of landing an Indian on the Moon by 2040. It’ll not only support Isro but also give impetus to both global and Indian private space industries.”Satcom Industries Association-India president Subba Rao Pavuluri, echoing Bhatt’s views, said: “...While our ancestors explored Planets with intuition, we’ll be exploring planets with experimentation and going there. Shukla’s mission is the first step to realise ‘Bharat’s Space ambitions’ .”Also read | Minister Jitendra Singh: India has found a lasting space in world of space; hints at Shubhanshu Shukla's India return","Shubhanshu shukla returns safely, next mission: helping gaganyaan.

‘Carefully consider…’: Indian embassy in Iran issues fresh advisory; urges nationals to use available exit options,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/carefully-consider-indian-embassy-in-iran-issues-fresh-advisory-urges-nationals-to-use-available-exit-options/articleshow/122530597.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Indian Embassy in Iran issued a fresh advisory on late Tuesday, urging Indian nationals to avoid non-essential travel to the country, citing recent security-related developments.The advisory, posted late evening on the embassy's official handle on X, also asked those already in Iran to remain vigilant and consider returning using available commercial and ferry services.“In view of the security-related developments over the past several weeks, Indian nationals are advised to carefully consider the evolving situation before undertaking non-essential travel to Iran,” the embassy wrote.“They are also advised to continue to monitor the latest regional developments and follow updated advisories issued by the Indian authorities. Indian nationals already in Iran, and interested in leaving, may avail the commercial flight and ferry options which are available right now.”The warning comes amid heightened tensions in the region following a series of military escalations involving Israel, Iran, and the United States.Last month, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites including Natanz and Fordow. That was followed by Operation Midnight Hammer on June 22, when the US struck multiple Iranian facilities.Iran retaliated with missile attacks on Israel and a US base in Qatar. Later, US President Trump announced a ceasefire, ending the 12-day-long conflict.During the days of conflict, the Indian Embassy had cautioned Indian nationals in Iran to avoid unnecessary movement and follow safety protocols following the regional flare-up. That advisory had come in the wake of multiple explosions and reports of casualties at strategic Iranian locations.Adding to the concerns, the US state department last week launched a public awareness campaign warning Americans, especially those with Iranian heritage, against travel to Iran.US spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the Iranian regime routinely denies consular access to dual nationals and stressed that “it is not safe to travel to Iran,” despite the cessation of bombing.Meanwhile, Indian authorities are continuing to monitor the situation closely. The embassy has urged Indian citizens in Iran to stay connected via its social media platforms and to remain updated through official advisories.","The warning comes amid heightened tensions in the region following a series of military escalations involving israel, iran, and the united states.

Will bring Pahalgam attackers to justice: External affairs minister S Jaishankar at SCO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-bring-pahalgam-attackers-to-justice-external-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar-at-sco/articleshow/122534936.cms,"EAM Jaishankar with Chinese President Xi Jinping

India presses for strong rebuke on terror, Pahalgam in SCO declaration | page 22

The Pahalgam terrorist attack was deliberately conducted to undermine Jammu & Kashmir's tourism economy and sow a religious divide, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers' meeting in China's Tianjin, even as his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar looked on.Recalling the strong condemnation of the April 22 attack by UNSC, where China is a permanent and Pakistan non-permanent member, Jaishankar called upon the Eurasian bloc to take an uncompromising position on terror and stressed that India would continue to work to bring the perpetrators of the J&K attack to justice.While raising the issue of the Pahalgam terror attack at the SCO foreign ministers' meeting in China on Tuesday, S Jaishankar did not name Pakistan as the bloc's charter prohibits member-states from raising hostilities in bilateral relations. However, like in his address at the same meeting in Islamabad last year, he reminded his counterparts that the bloc was founded to combat the three evils of terrorism, separatism and extremism.""Not surprisingly, they often occur together. Recently, we in India witnessed a graphic example in the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22. It was deliberately conducted to undermine tourism economy of Jammu & Kashmir, while sowing a religious divide,"" Jaishankar said.He also said while India would continue to approach new ideas and proposals by SCO positively for ""collective good"", such cooperation must be based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and in accordance with territorial integrity and sovereignty of member states.The foreign ministers' meeting looked to finalise the agenda, including the final declaration, for the SCO summit that will be hosted by President Xi Jinping in Sept and in which PM Modi is expected to participate. India is pressing for a strong condemnation of terrorism in the declaration, including the Pahalgam attack.""UNSC, of which some of us are currently members, issued a statement that condemned it in strongest terms and 'underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice'. We have since done exactly that and will continue doing so. It is imperative that SCO, to remain true to its founding objectives, take an uncompromising position on this challenge,"" the minister added.In a bilateral meet with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Monday, EAM had described terrorism as a shared concern, expressing hope that SCO will strongly uphold zero tolerance against terrorism. Combating terrorism and ensuring a terror-free Afghanistan tops India's priority list in the security-oriented group that is looking to expand cooperation in areas like trade, investment & people-to-people exchanges.On Afghanistan, Jaishankar said it had been long on the SCO agenda and the compulsions of regional stability were buttressed by India's long-standing concern for the well-being of the Afghan people. ""The international community, particularly SCO members, must therefore step up with development assistance. India, for its part, will certainly do so,"" he said.The minister lamented lack of assured transit within the SCO space, saying its absence undermines the seriousness of advocating cooperation in economic areas. This again was a dig at Pakistan which continues to block land access to Afghanistan and Central Asia for India.While talking about a world besieged by conflicts, competition and coercion, Jaishankar said the challenge before SCO is to stabilise the global order, de-risk various dimensions and ""through it all, address long-standing challenges that threaten our collective interests"".""World is moving towards multi-polarity. This is not just in terms of redistribution of national capacities, but also emergence of effective groupings like SCO. Our ability to contribute to shaping of world affairs will depend on how well we come together on a shared agenda. That means taking everybody on board,"" he added.","India presses for strong rebuke on terror, pahalgam in sco declaration.

Pak drones fly at higher altitudes near border to avoid detection

AMRITSAR: Operation Sindoor put brakes on drone intrusions for a while but Pakistani smugglers have returned with upgraded tactics and are pushing drones deeper into Indian territory with alarming accuracy.""Post Op Sindoor, there was a temporary lull in cross-border drone intrusions. However, these activities have now resumed with greater precision as Pakistani smugglers are deploying drones that penetrate deeper into Indian territory to drop drugs, arms and ammunition,"" said BSF DIG AK Vidyarthi.According to sources, airdropping earlier was often close to the international border - around a kilometre in - but now Pakistani drones have been observed as far as 2km to 2.5km or even more inside Indian territory.A source said, “During Op Sindoor, priorities were broader — it wasn’t just about curbing cross-border smuggling but more about preventing drone and missile attacks. Smuggling activity from across the border significantly decreased since Pakistani smugglers lacked local operatives on the Indian side to retrieve dropped consignments.”But then, why have cross-border drone intrusions increased after Op Sindoor? As per sources, Pakistani smugglers have equipped themselves with more advanced Chinese drones, while the anti-drone technology deployed on the Indian border has not been as effective as it should be.Currently, drones are often detected only by their sound or spotted visually, after which information is relayed to the anti-drone team. The system is then activated to jam the drone or sever its connection with the operator in Pakistan. Such interceptors should ideally be placed every few kilometres along the international border in Punjab to instantly detect an incoming drone — its direction, speed, altitude and other details — so that it can be jammed and forced into the ground, said sources.Asked why Pakistani smugglers were trying to push drones deeper into Indian territory, sources pointed out BSF had intensified patrolling and tightened security and surveillance after Op Sindoor. By sending consignments deeper into Indian territory, smugglers seek to ensure receivers (collectors) are further away from the international border, minimising the chance of being detected by BSF patrols.Nowadays, Pakistani drone pilots tend to fly drones at higher altitudes near the border to avoid detection. Once the drones cross into Indian territory, they drop to a lower altitude and follow zigzag routes to dodge surveillance. Drones are also intentionally crashed once they reach the drop zone.","Operation sindoor put brakes on drone intrusions for a while.

HYDERABAD: Sixty-five in-flight engine shutdowns in five years. Eleven ""Mayday"" distress calls from aircraft cockpits in 17 months, excluding the London-bound AI-171 that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 and a diverted domestic IndiGo flight.These numbers, obtained by TOI through a Right to Information (RTI) query to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), suggest a scary reality: engine malfunctions plague airlines operating in India at the rate of nearly one incident a month.Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's report mentioning fuel cut-off to engines of the crashed AI Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner fits the broader pattern of technical failures being handled by experienced pilots, until one crops up that is unmanageable.DGCA data covers all engine shutdowns, including failures during take-off and mid-air. ""A total of 65 incidents related to in-flight shutdown of engines from 2020 to 2025 (till date) were reported across India,"" states the aviation regulator's RTI reply.In all 65 of these instances, pilots were able to safely manoeuvre aircraft to the nearest airport with a single, unaffected engine. Experts attribute engine shutdowns to technical issues ranging from low fuel to turbine malfunction and faulty electronic components.""Primary causes of engine shutdowns include blocked fuel filters, fuel contamination with water, interrupted fuel supply to engines, and foreign objects entering engine stack, all of which can halt flight operations,"" Capt C S Randhawa, president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told TOI.The RTI data shows that between Jan 1, 2024, and May 31, 2025, there were Mayday calls from 11 flights, reporting various technical glitches and seeking emergency landing. Besides AI-171, the list doesn't include a June 19 IndiGo flight from Guwahati to Chennai that had to be redirected to Bengaluru due to congestion at the destination, only for the aircraft to report low fuel around 35km before landing.RTI data reveals that four of the 11 flights issued distress calls due to technical glitches and landed at Hyderabad.Airline Pilots' Association of India states that Mayday signals are exclusively used in life-threatening situations, distinguishing them from ""Pan Pan"" urgency alerts.""Flight crew initiate MAYDAY calls when confronted with critical emergencies such as aircraft fires, engine failures or situations posing imminent danger, necessitating immediate landing or grounding as continued flight becomes unsafe,"" said Anil Rao, secretary of ALPA India.AX Joseph, director of air safety at DGCA, said the aviation regulator was responsible for promulgating ""civil aviation requirements, circulars, aeronautical information circulars and public notices for compliance by the stakeholders to ensure safe operations"".While experts say that in-flight engine shutdowns and Mayday calls aren't uncommon across the world, India's position in global aviation safety standards may not be confidence-inspiring.

NEW DELHI: India’s Got Latent host Samay Raina, and four other social media influencers, appeared before the Supreme Court on Tuesday in a case concerning allegations of ridiculing people with disabilities, including those suffering from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and blindness.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi recorded their presence and directed them to file their replies to the petition within two weeks, warning that no extensions would be granted. The court also instructed them to appear in person on the next date of hearing. An exception was made for influencer Sonali Thakkar, also known as Sonali Aditya Desai, who was permitted to appear virtually due to a physical condition.The bench, according to news agency PTI, observed the matter raised serious concerns and said that any absence by the influencers during the next hearing would be “viewed seriously.” The conduct of the influencers, the court said, was “damaging” and “demoralising,” and called for serious remedial and punitive action to ensure such incidents are not repeated.On the larger issue of social media content and accountability, the court asked Attorney General R Venkataramani to assist in framing guidelines that balance freedom of speech with the rights and dignity of others.Venkataramani sought time to deliberate, noting that enforceability would require detailed consideration.Justice Surya Kant remarked, “There are many free advisors in the market. Ignore them. The guidelines should be in conformity with constitutional principles balancing freedom and the rights and duties of a person. Then we will examine it. We will have open debate on such guidelines. Let all members of the bar and stakeholders including the so-called stakeholders also come and give their viewpoints.”Stressing the importance of dignity, Justice Kant added, “We need to understand that the right to dignity also emanates from the right which someone else is claiming. Article 19 of the Constitution,” he said, “can't overpower Article 21. Suppose a race takes place between Article 19 and 21, Article 21 has to trump Article 19.”He also underlined the need to frame guidelines with utmost caution. Speaking to senior advocate Aprajita Singh, who appeared for the NGO, Justice Kant said, “What we are doing is for posterity. You have to ensure that not a single word is misused by anyone. You have to ensure balance. We have to protect citizens' rights. A framework must be there that the dignity of anyone is not violated.”The top court had issued notices to Raina, Vipul Goyal, Balraj Paramjeet Singh Ghai, Sonali Thakkar, and Nishant Jagdish Tanwar, following a plea filed by NGO Cure SMA Foundation of India, which alleged that the influencers mocked persons with disabilities on a YouTube show.The Supreme Court had earlier, on May 5, warned the five influencers to appear before it or face coercive action. It had also directed the Mumbai Police Commissioner to serve notices to the individuals to ensure their attendance.Raina, along with podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia, had been booked by police in Maharashtra and Assam over their comments made on the YouTube show India’s Got Latent.

‘AIMIM’s constitution against

’

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court expressed concern on Tuesday over the encouragement given to regionalism by political parties to seek votes and said this poses as much danger to the unity and integrity of India as the promotion of communal divide in society.""Regional parties openly promote regionalism and seek votes during elections. Is this not against the unity and integrity of the country?"" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked while declining to entertain a petition seeking cancellation of the registration of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen. It said it would not single out any one political party when many were indulging in communalism.""No doubt the petition raises an important issue. But this can only be gone into when a neutral petition is filed without accusing a single party,"" the bench said and gave liberty to the petitioner to file a neutral petition raising the larger issues relating to electoral reforms.However, it said a conjoint reading of the clauses of the AIMIM's constitution does not show there is anything which runs contrary to the Constitution of India.""If a religious law is protected by the Constitution, then a political party has the right to propagate that,"" the court said.It said if a candidate of a party, which conforms to the standards set by the Constitution and Representation of the People Act, seeks votes in the name of religion, then s/he is liable for disqualification.For petitioner Tirupati Narasimha Murari, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said AIMIM’s constitution advocates the cause of the Muslim community alone and has the objective of promotion of Islamic education, commitment to Sharia law, formation of Majlis Shura and prioritisation of employment, education and economic welfare of the Muslim community.“This is against secularism, the basic tenet of the Indian Constitution,” he said.As against this, he argued, the Election Commission would refuse to register a political party with a Hindu name and a constitution that espouses the cause of Hindus and promotes Vedic education.The bench disagreed and said, “If the EC refuses to register such a party, then there are forums to challenge the EC decision.”",Justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi declined to entertain a petition seeking cancellation of the registration of all india majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen.

During that visit, India also signed the Artemis Accords, an initiative undertaken by Nasa to return humans to the Moon.Earlier, it was PM Modi who gave the astronaut wings to Group Captain Shukla and three other IAF pilots — Group Captain Prashanth Balakrishnan, Group Captain Ajith Krishnan, Group Captain Angad Pratap — and revealed Gaganyaan mission astronauts to the world.On Shukla’s successful return, defence minister Rajnath Singh spoke to Shambhu Dayal Shukla, the father of the astronaut, following his successful return to Earth. ""Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's successful return from the historic Axiom-4 mission is a proud moment for every Indian. He has not just touched space, he has lifted India's aspirations to new heights,"" Singh said on X.As soon as Shukla made a successful splashdown in the Pacific Ocean aboard SpaceX 's Crew Dragon, thousands of miles away, his hometown of Lucknow erupted with chants of ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" and applause.Shukla's father, Shambhu Dayal Shukla, mother Asha Devi and sister Suchi Misra were charged with emotions as the Dragon splashed in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast. “He has been to space and back and we are all over the moon because this mission has its own importance for the country's Gaganyaan programme,"" Shambhu Dayal Shukla said.Shux’s mom Asha Shukla said, ""We are very excited...We are waiting for our son... We are proud that our son wrote his name in history...

Fans wondered about the reason, but the actual story behind this unexpected move is now coming to light and it speaks much about Wembanyama's mental attitude.Victor Wembanyama did something unexpected this summer. Instead of training in the U.S. or France, he flew to China. Fans were surprised. Why was the NBA star at a Shaolin temple? What was he doing there?The 21-year-old didn’t follow the usual path. Most NBA players work out in gyms. They train with coaches. But Wembanyama went somewhere different. He chose a temple known for kung fu, not basketball.He spent part of his offseason there. The place is old and full of history. It’s where monks train their minds and bodies. It’s not where you’d expect to find a 7-foot-4 athlete.According to Michael C. Wright of ESPN, Wembanyama stayed at the Shaolin Temple in Zhengzhou. He was there for 10 days in early July 2025.The temple is in Henan Province, China. It’s world-famous for training monks in kung fu and mental discipline.Sources told Michael C. Wright of ESPN that Victor Wembanyama made the trip to challenge both his body and mind. “He wanted something different,” Wright reported. “It wasn’t about shooting drills or weights. It was about control, focus, and learning how to move better.”Wembanyama used this time to study kung fu and body movement techniques. He worked on mental focus and learned how to position his body in new ways that may help his performance on the basketball court. According to Wright, this style of training could help him improve his flexibility and balance, skills that are beneficial for a big man in the NBA.“He’s always pushing himself,” said one team staff member who spoke anonymously. “He doesn’t think like other players.”The French star is also coming off a serious medical condition. In March 2025, he was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder. Now, he’s been cleared to return to full training and plans to apply what he learned in China to his game.Wembanyama led the NBA in blocks in his second season, even though he only played 46 games. His efforts in China demonstrate his commitment to reaching his full potential.The trip to China wasn’t made public at first. It was only after he returned that fans discovered his unusual training method.
