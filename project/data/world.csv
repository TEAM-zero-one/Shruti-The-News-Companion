"Top 10 extreme weather events cost world more than $122 billion in 2025: Rainfall in India, Pakistan claimed 1,860 lives - report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/top-10-extreme-weather-events-cost-world-more-than-122-billion-in-2025-extreme-rainfall-in-india-pakistan-claimed-1860-lives-report/articleshow/126198277.cms,"NEW DELHI: Top 10 extreme weather events such as wildfires, heatwaves, floods and cyclonic storms cost the world more than $122 billion in 2025, said a report - Counting the Cost 2025 - released by a global not-for-profit organisation, Christian Aid.Exceptionally heavy monsoon rainfall experienced by large parts of India and Pakistan from June to Sept is listed as one of the 10 most expensive and impactful climate disasters in the year.The extreme rainfall events in India and Pakistan, put together, took at least 1,860 lives and cost a combined total of $5.6 billion. Though the region comes at fifth in the list of 10 in terms of suffering financial loss, it reported the highest number of casualties.Globally, the US - the largest historical carbon emitter - bore the brunt with the fires in California topping the list as the single biggest one-off event at $60 billion in damage (nearly 50% of the total cost globally) and leading to the deaths of more than 400 people.The annual report of Christian Aid, released on Saturday, underlined that most of these estimates are based only on “insured losses”, meaning the true financial costs are likely to be even higher, while the human costs are often uncounted.Second on the list after the US were the cyclones and floods that struck Southeast Asia in Nov, causing $25 billion in damage and killing more than 1,750 people across Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Malaysia. Third were the devastating floods in China which displaced thousands, caused $11.7 billion in damage and killed at least 30.“These disasters are not ‘natural’ — they are the inevitable result of continued fossil fuel expansion and political delay. While the costs run into the billions, the heaviest burden falls on communities with the least resources to recover. Unless govts act now to cut emissions and fund adaptation measures, this misery will only continue,” said Joanna Haigh, emeritus professor of Atmospheric Physics, Imperial College London.Though the top 10 focuses on financial costs, which are usually higher in richer countries because they have higher property values and can afford insurance, some of the most devastating extreme weather events this year hit poorer nations, which have contributed little to causing the climate crisis and have the least resources to respond.“The suffering caused by the climate crisis is a political choice. It is being driven by decisions to continue burning fossil fuels, to allow emissions to rise, and to break promises on climate finance,” said Patrick Watt, Christian Aid CEO, while urging world leaders to act in 2026.","Extreme weather events such as wildfires, heatwaves, floods and cyclonic storms cost the world more than $122 billion in 2025.

'Enjoy what may be your last…': Trump's Christmas message for 'sleazebags' who loved Jeffrey Epstein; warning shot fired,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/enjoy-what-may-be-your-last-trumps-christmas-message-for-sleazebags-who-loved-jeffrey-epstein-warning-shot-fired/articleshow/126181193.cms,"Trump Tears Into Dems Who ‘LOVED’ Epstein In New Christmas Message | ‘Radical Left WITCH HUNT!’





US President Donald Trump in his Christmas message on Thursday (local time) launched a sharp attack on his critics, calling them ""sleazebags"" and accusing them of having close ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before ""dropping him like a dog"" and then ""blaming Trump. "" He also fired shots at Democrats and ""fake media coverage"" further warning ""enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas.""Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump posted, ""Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein, gave him bundles of money, went to his Island, attended his parties, and thought he was the greatest guy on earth, only to 'drop him like a dog' when things got too HOT.""He claimed these critics ""falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him, didn’t know him, said he was a disgusting person, and then blame, of course, President Donald J Trump.""Trump further went on to assert that he was ""actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so.""The US President further alleged that those who would be named in the ""ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt"" would largely turn out to be Democrats.He said, ""When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt (plus one lowlife 'Republican,' Massie!), and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do, much like there was when it was made public that the Russia, Russia Hoax was a fictitious story - a total Scam - and had nothing to do with 'TRUMP.'""He also criticised the media coverage on Epstien files singling out The New York Times.""The Failing New York Times, among many others, was forced to apologize for their bad and faulty Election 'Reporting,' even to the point of losing many subscribers due to their highly inaccurate (FAKE!) coverage. Now the same losers are at it again, only this time so many of their friends, mostly innocent, will be badly hurt and reputationally tarnished. But sadly, that’s the way it is in the World of Corrupt Democrat Politics!!! Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!"" he added.The post comes amid renewed scrutiny of Epstein's links with powerful figures, alongside ongoing political and legal debates over the release of documents.Trump and Epstein were friends for several years, but the MAGA leader has stated that they fell out around 2004, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Meanwhile, the US Justice Department (DOJ) has released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Epstein, marking the largest disclosure so far in the long-running investigation.The newly released files contain multiple references to Trump, including an email from a prosecutor noting flights Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s.In a response to the latest files released, the DOJ said that some of the latest documents released from the Epstein files contained ""untrue and sensationalist claims"" against Trump, which were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 US election.The latest disclosure follows criticism of an earlier tranche of records, some of which were briefly removed from the DOJ's online portal over concerns about protecting victims’ identities. The files were later restored after authorities determined that no victims were depicted in the disputed material.The newly released material also included hundreds of video and audio files, as well as surveillance footage from August 2019, the month Epstein was found dead in his jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.","Trump tears into dems who ‘loved’ epstein in new christmas message | ‘radical left witch hunt!’ he also fired shots at democrats and ""fake media coverage"" further warning ""enjoy what may be your last merry christmas""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126181750,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-43342,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

India on Friday flagged its concerns to the US over the cancellation of pre-scheduled H-1B visa interviews for large numbers of Indian applicants and said both sides were engaged on the issue.The interviews of thousands of H-1B visa applicants slated from the middle of this month in India were abruptly postponed by several months to scrutinise their social media posts and online profiles.Some applicants whose visa appointments were scheduled last week received emails from US immigration authorities informing them that their interviews were being pushed back as late as May next year.The Indian government had received several representations from Indian nationals facing problems with the rescheduling of their visa appointments, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said at his weekly media briefing.Visa-related issues pertained to the sovereign domain of any country, he said, adding: ""we have flagged these issues and our concerns to the US side, both here in New Delhi and in Washington DC.""Also read: No more lottery: How the new H-1B visa selection system will work — key changes explained Jaiswal said several Indians had been stranded for extended periods in India, causing a lot of ""hardships"" to them and their families.""The Government of India has received multiple representations from Indian nationals facing delays and difficulties in scheduling or rescheduling US visa appointments.While visa matters fall under the sovereign domain of the issuing country, India has raised these concerns with the US authorities in New Delhi and Washington DC.

'If Pakistan Comes in Dowry...': Rajnath Singh Recalls The Humorous Side of Atal Bihari Vajpayee

India's beloved former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee remained unmarried his entire life, but there was a time when he was proposed to by a woman, a Pakistani woman to be precise.On the late prime minister's 101st birth anniversary on Thursday, defence minister Rajnath Singh narrated the anecdote, recalling Vajpayee's repartee and sense of humour.Singh recalled that during Vajpayee's visit to Lahore, a Pakistani woman reporter proposed to him, inspired by his speech.""I would like to share one incident. Inspired by his speech, a Pakistan i reporter said she was ready to marry him, but sought ceding of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan in Mehr,"" Singh said.Atalji, with a smile on his face, said, 'Madam, I am ready to marry you, but in return, I want Pakistan as dowry,"" Singh said, drawing laughter and applause from the audience.Vajpayee definitely had a way with his words. He was admired for his oratory skills across parties and was an accomplished poet known for his patriotic and humanist compositions.Once, when a supporter urged him to remain ""atal"" (unshakeable), Vajpayee quipped back playfully, with, ""Atal toh hoon, lekin Bihari bhi hoon!"" (“I am Atal, but I am also a Bihari!”).Vajpayee travelled to Lahore by bus in 1999 and embraced Pakistan’s then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, a gesture that came to symbolise hope for better ties between the two neighbours.However, the bonhomie did not last long. Just months later, the Pakistan Army carried out a covert operation to send troops into the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir, triggering a limited conflict that Pakistan ultimately lost.Rashtra Prerna Sthal was inaugurated by PM Modi on Thursday and has been developed as a landmark national memorial and inspirational complex of enduring national significance. Constructed at an approximate cost of Rs 230 crore and spread across an expansive area of 65 acres.","Atal bihari vajpayee remained unmarried his entire life.

SRINAGAR: Mirwaiz Umar Farooq removed on Thursday his designation as Hurriyat Conference chairman from his social media handle, blaming the move on “pressure” from J&K authorities and calling it a “Hobson’s choice”.“For some time now, I was being pressed by the authorities to make changes to my X (formerly Twitter) handle as all constituents of Hurriyat Conference, including Awami Action Committee that I head, have been banned under UAPA, making Hurriyat a banned organisation, failing which they would take down my handle,” Mirwaiz said.He bemoaned the alleged “pressure” that had shut out a key outreach outlet for him since Thursday. “At a time when public space and avenues of communication stand severely restricted, this platform remains among the very few means available to me to reach out to my people and share my views on our issues with them and the outside world,” Mirwaiz said.Most of Hurriyat’s 20-odd constituents have been proscribed since the Aug 2019 abrogation of Article 370 and J&K’s conversion into a Union territory.The social media curbs came as Mirwaiz was put under house arrest, preventing J&K’s chief cleric from addressing Friday prayers at Srinagar’s historic Jamia Mosque. Since his release in Sept 2023 after being under house arrest for four years following the abrogation of Article 370, Mirwaiz has frequently faced such restrictions, with police often detaining him at home on Fridays without offering any explanation.The social media move unleashed trolling against Mirwaiz, with many accusing him of compromising on Hurriyat’s ideology. But former CM and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti described the removal as “immaterial”, arguing that Hurriyat “is an idea and reflects alienation”. “You can remove names from any platform but you have to address this idea of Hurriyat,” Mehbooba said.PDP MLA Waheed Parra backed Mirwaiz, saying choosing “peace over rigidity is not weakness, it is leadership”.Tanvir Sadiq, spokesperson for J&K’s governing National Conference (NC), slammed the alleged coercion. “Mirwaiz is a religious scholar, and if he is being pressured, then it is wrong,” Sadiq said.BJP described Mirwaiz’s move as the “right decision”. “It is a message to J&K’s youth that the road of separatism has ended,” spokesperson Altaf Thakur said.",Mirwaiz umar farooq removed his designation as hurriyat conference chairman from his social media handle.

Red Line From New Delhi: India Calls Out Yunus Govt As Minority Attacks In Bangladesh Escalate

‘2,900 incidents against minorities have been documented during Yunus government’

NEW DELHI: The acrimonious exchanges between India and Bangladesh in the past few weeks came to a head on Friday with India slamming Dhaka for ""unremitting hostility"" against minorities - including Hindus, Christians and Buddhists - in the country at the hands of extremists.Calling it a matter of grave concern, ministry of external affairs (MEA) condemned the recent killing of a Hindu youth in Mymensingh and stressed that the perpetrators of the crime must be brought to justice.Asked about the return of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman to Dhaka after 17 years, the Indian govt only said it should be seen in the context of India's call for efforts to ensure free, fair and inclusive parliamentary polls in Bangladesh.PM Narendra Modi had earlier expressed concerns about the failing health of Tarique's mother and former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia and offered all possible assistance to her.Tarique returned to Dhaka on Thursday, further energising BNP - which was revived by former PM Sheikh Hasina's ouster last year - ahead of the Feb 12 parliamentary elections.On the security situation in Bangladesh, the ministry said it rejected the false narrative created in the country.""You would understand that law and order or security situation or the developments that are happening in Bangladesh is the responsibility of the govt of Bangladesh, and to portray a narrative where things go in some other direction is completely false and we reject that,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.The official said that more than 2,900 incidents of violence against minorities, including cases of killings, arson, and land grab, have been documented by independent sources during the tenure of the interim govt and these incidents cannot be brushed aside as mere media exaggeration or dismissed as political violence. The interim govt led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly brushed aside India's concerns as propaganda by the Indian media.""We are all aware of the recent developments in Bangladesh. We have been closely following them. And, as far as the law and order situation is concerned, I have been apprising you from time to time as to what our position has been or should be and is today. The unremitting hostility against minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists at the hands of extremists, is a matter of grave concern,"" said the official.“India wants close and friendly relations with people of Bangladesh which is rooted in Liberation struggle and strengthened through various development and people-to-people initiatives,” he said.BNP had earlier said it wanted balanced ties with India. Indian govt’s response was that it remained committed to the best interests of people of Bangladesh, including peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country and will continue to engage constructively in this regard with all stakeholders.","India condemns 'hostility' against bangladesh minorities.

Bangladesh Election Turmoil Deepens, Hasina's Awami League Rejects Poll Timeline Under Yunus Re

NAGPUR: Amidst the brutal persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh in the run-up to the February polls, a party registered in April hopes to fight its maiden elections, seeking Hindu and other minority votes.Bangladesh Minority Janta Party (BMJP) is preparing to contest 91 of 300 seats of Jatiya Parishad (national parliament), hoping to win 40 to 45 seats, said the outfit's president, Sukriti Kumar Mandal.Talking to TOI on phone from Dhaka, Mandal said, ""We have zeroed in on constituencies where the minority, especially the Hindu vote-bank, ranges from 20% to 60%.""Scrambling to file nominations before the Monday deadline, Mandal feels Hindus need to feel safe to come out and vote. A tie-up with any mainstream party - be it Tarique Rahman's BNP or Jamaat-e-Islami - can help. ""With an alliance with these parties, minorities can come out of their houses without fearing retaliation. Awami League is off the radar, and BMJP is the only voice of persecuted Hindus,"" Mandal told TOI.Mandal said the party candidates would be finalised in a day or two. ""By Saturday, all nominations would be filed,"" he said.He said India should change its stand on Bangladesh and only back the cause of Hindus, instead of supporting the Awami League.""If India shifts from its pro-Awami League stand, mainstream Bangladesh parties will sit up and take note. India must know that BMJP is the sole voice of minorities,"" Mandal said. A change in stand could also lead to a change in Bangladeshi mindset towards India, he said, adding the Awami League only used India to gain power.The five-point agenda shared with TOI includes working towards a secular Bangladesh, establishing a federal system by carving out five provinces, and establishing fundamental and constitutional rights of each state. BMJP also proposes changes in textbooks with a secular and scientific approach, apart from ensuring fair rights for minorities.","Bangladesh minority janta party (bmjp) is preparing to contest 91 of 300 seats of jatiya parishad (national parliament) the outfit's president, sukriti kumar mandal, hopes to win 40 to 45 seats.

Pakistan Embarrassed Globally As Saudi Deports 56000 Beggars Despite No Fly Lists And Warnings

Most Indians deported for staying beyond visa validity

HYDERABAD: Over 24,600 Indians were deported from 81 countries in 2025, as per the latest ministry of external affairs data tabled in Rajya Sabha. It wasn't the US but Saudi Arabia that recorded the highest deportations - over 11,000 in 12 months.While in comparison, only 3,800 Indians - mostly private employees - were deported from the US in 2025, these numbers are the highest recorded from the country in the last five years, the report says. Experts attribute it to the recent crackdown and increased scrutiny of documents, visa status, work authorisation, overstays, etc, by the Trump administration.Most deportations from the US were carried out from Washington DC (3,414) and Houston (234).Countries that saw a significant number of deportations of Indians include Myanmar (1,591), UAE (1,469), Bahrain (764), Malaysia (1,485), Thailand (481), and Cambodia (305). According to latest MEA data, common grounds for deportations, especially from Gulf countries, include overstaying visa or residency, working without a valid work permit, violation of labour regulations, absconding from employers, and involvement in civil or criminal cases.""This is a pattern with Gulf countries, which see a large migration of workers from India who either take up jobs as labourers in the construction sector, become caregivers, or work as househelp. Most of them are low-skilled workers who migrate through agents and, in many cases, in an attempt to earn extra money, end up involved in minor offences,"" said Bheema Reddy, vice-chairman of Telangana govt's NRI advisory committee. ""In other instances, lack of awareness about local laws and regulations proves costly,"" he added.In many cases, these migrant workers fall prey to fraud perpetrated by agents back home and are deported once caught by police abroad.Deportations from countries like Myanmar and Cambodia, however, follow a different pattern. ""Most of these are linked to cyber slavery. These countries have emerged as major hubs of a multi-billion dollar cybercrime industry where Indians are lured with promises of high-paying jobs but are later trapped, forced to work in illegal operations, and eventually detained and deported,"" Reddy explained.It is, therefore, important that workers are made aware of rules before they land on foreign shores, said Naga Bharani of Telangana Overseas Manpower Company. ""People should be told to closely track their visa timelines, and comply with local rules. There is always an option to apply for a visa extension,"" she said. Deportation of Indian students was the highest from UK, with 170 sent home in 2025. This was followed by Australia (114), Russia (82) and US (45).","Most deportations from the us were carried out from washington dc (3,414) and houston.

Shashi Tharoor’s video tribute

Leaders across parties remember Singh

NEW DELHI: First death anniversary of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was marked on Friday with leaders paying tributes across the country.Manmohan Singh, who served as Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014, passed away last year at the age of 92.Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi paid tribute, saying Singh’s decisions helped the poor and underprivileged, and his humility and hard work remained an inspiration.Rahul also paid floral tributes at Manmohan Singh’s residence at 24, Akbar Road in New Delhi. Party leaders and workers remembered Singh at events held in different states.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge described Singh as a transformative leader who changed the direction of India’s economy. He said Singh’s reforms expanded opportunities and helped millions move out of poverty.Shashi Tharoor shared a video message, describing Singh as an ""erudite and deeply decent leader"". He said Singh’s quiet nature often spoke louder than political noise.""Today the nation pauses to mark a solemn milestone, the first death anniversary of a man whose silence often spoke louder than the clamour of our current political discourse, our former Prime Minister, the erudite and deeply decent Dr Manmohan Singh.It has been a year since we lost him, yet the void he left in the intellectual and moral landscape of Indian public life remains palpable Dr Singh was in many ways, in the famous phrase, an accidental politician, but he was a very conscious patriot,"" Tharoor said in his video message.He said Singh would be remembered as a transformative Prime Minister who combined a quiet manner with firm conviction, pointing to his decision to stake his government on the civil nuclear deal that strengthened India’s position globally.Tharoor added that Singh’s years as Prime Minister were not only about economic growth. They were also about building a framework of rights, including the Right to Information, the Right to Education, MGNREGA, the right to work and the Right to Food Security.""On the death anniversary of former Prime Minister, 'Padma Vibhushan' Dr Manmohan Singh ji, humble tribute to him. As finance minister and Prime Minister, he made invaluable contributions to the nation's development,"" UP CM Adityanath wrote on X.West Bengal's CM Mamta Banerjee wrote, ""Remembering former Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, on his death anniversary.""Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar, NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar faction) MP Supriya Sule, and Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar were among the many leaders who remembered Singh.Born in 1932, Manmohan Singh was an economist who served as RBI Governor and finance minister before becoming Prime Minister.","First death anniversary of former prime minister manmohan singh marked on friday.

Speaking in public, O'Malley questioned the availability or preparedness of well-known figures including Alex Pereira, Conor McGregor, Jon Jones, and Ilia Topuria.



There is increasing pressure on Dana White to produce a roster befitting of the historic occasion as a result of injuries, personal breaks, and internal hesitations impacting a number of elite competitors. Fans are left wondering if the White House UFC event can live up to their enormous expectations as uncertainty increases.

Sean O’Malley says the UFC White House Card is lacking superstars and the organization needs him! 😳

Sean O’Malley shared that uncertainty grows as star availability comes into question

Sean O’Malley is a mixed martial artist from the United States who competes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship's (UFC) bantamweight division. He became one of the promotion's most marketable figures and a former UFC bantamweight champion after becoming well-known for his flamboyant style, knockout power, and highlight-reel finishes. Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), said that the White House UFC show is already having problems that it was supposed to face. As the event's rumors grew, so did the worries associated with it about whether there would be enough big-name acts to lead the historic show. Former UFC bantamweight champion Sean O'Malley has now added to those worries after talking about the matter in public. Coordinated with Donald Trump's birthday, the White House card is anticipated to be a historic UFC event. The ultimate arrangements, however, are still up for question. Fans are highly concerned about how strong the card will appear in the end due to the possible absence of some well-known players.In an interview with Joe ""Diesel"" Riggs and Tim ""Red Hawk"" Welch, Sean O’Malley highlighted the challenging circumstances Dana White and the UFC are currently experiencing. He said that putting together the ideal matchups could be difficult, even though the concept of holding a UFC event inside the White House seems huge.While having a conversation with Tim “Red Hawk” Welch and Joe “Diesel” Riggs, O’Malley shared that he has doubts about several high-profile names linked to the card. He mentioned in the conversation that Conor McGregor may not be ready to compete by the proposed date. Not just this, O'Malley even raised a question whether Jon Jones would be able to make an appearance.Sean O’Malley even highlighted that Ilia Topuria has left for personal reasons and won't be back until early 2026. O'Malley has raised doubts about another important player, Alex Pereira, who might not be available. This has created a lot of buzz amongst the fans.Additional complications arose when more popular names on the card, including Sean Strickland and Khamzat Chimaev, were discussed by Sean O’Malley. Islam Makhachev has reportedly shown interest in competing on the White House card, though there are rumors that his mentor, Khabib Nurmagomedov, does not fully support the idea. Heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall's recent eye injury has raised concerns about his future availability, stated O'Malley.Dana White and the UFC are under pressure as the announcement date comes closer to the uncertainty around fighters' availability. There are still possibilities, but the increasing number of unresolved issues and unavailability raises concerns about whether the White House card can live up to the historic expectations.

Candace Owens, Charlie Kirk, Erika Kirk, and George Farmer: what TikTok claims and what dates show

Alex Jones’ RARE Warning Over Candace Owens’ ‘WILD’ Charlie Kirk Theory | ‘DANGEROUS & Troubling’





A viral TikTok has pushed an old rumor back into the spotlight. The video claims Candace Owens once had strong feelings for Charlie Kirk , and that she stayed bitter after he married another woman. The post spread fast and pulled in thousands of comments. Some users say the story explains years of tension. Others say the timeline does not match the facts.According to the ibtimes , TikTok says Owens was “100% falling over to this dude” before Kirk met his future wife. It adds that Kirk seemed interested too, and that Owens pictured a future with him. When Kirk later married Erika Kirk, the creator says Owens felt she lost “the one that got away.” The claim also suggests Owens rushed into her own marriage after Kirk’s engagement. That last part is where many viewers stopped and checked dates.The TikTok, shared by creator The Older Millennial, goes further. It says Owens accepted a proposal over FaceTime just 18 days after meeting her husband, and that this was a reaction to Kirk’s engagement. The creator ends by saying Owens’ anger toward Erika comes from believing she “stole her man.”Comments split right away. Many users agreed with the tone of jealousy. One wrote, “Her behaviour is the epitome of a woman scorned.” Another added, “She’s giving bitter ex girlfriend and if my spouse was talking about a friend like that I would be super suspicious.” Others piled on with short takes like, “All her drama is jealousy,” “She just low-key jealous,” and “Massive jealousy.”But several viewers pushed back with dates. One comment said, “She met her husband before he met Erika. So that time line doesn’t work.” Another added, “She married two years before Charlie got married to Erika.”Public timelines back this up. Owens married George Farmer in 2019. Charlie Kirk married Erika in 2021. That means Candace Owens was already married well before Charlie Kirk’s wedding. Because of this, the claim that Owens rushed her marriage due to Kirk’s engagement does not hold up.As the debate grew, some comments went far beyond romance. A few users made extreme claims, with one writing, “The more she talks the more I’m convinced she was involved.” Others quickly called that a “holy reach” and said it had no proof at all.The story shows how fast online talk can grow. A short TikTok video about her old feelings turned into claims about jealousy, and wild accusations.

Former basketball Gunnar Schubert player identified as suspect in Capitol Building vandalism and fire incident

A once-promising sports career cut short as former Gonzaga athlete Gunnar Schubert charged in Capitol incident

Late one night, police were called upon to the Washington State Capitol after there were reports of unusual activity and sounds of alarms could be heard inside the building. What officers discovered was really shocking, as it unleashed a serious incident that even included damage to public property and the arrest of a former professional basketball player. The case immediately caught public attention, not just because of its serious nature, but also because of the alleged suspect’s past in a game like basketball.According to the law enforcement officers, the situation began when they noticed an abandoned vehicle near the State Capitol. As they searched the area to locate the driver, they could hear the sound of fire alarms coming from inside the building. This immediately raised concerns, and they quickly rushed inside towards the building to investigate if there was any fire-related accident or a foul play to potentially damage the structure.As the officers got inside the building, they could sense the visible signs of damage, and attempted to damage the structure. Broken glass, smoking coming out of the building, and damaged interiors suggested that there had been an attempted trespass to destroy the building. One office that belonged to a state representative was heavily damaged, as parts of broken window glass had been found, possibly smashed using heavy tools.And the damage was not limited to a single room, as officers found evidence of damage done as they were moving through different sections of the building.While inspecting, the officers also noticed signs of burnt marks inside the building. A flag was found burning inside, along with a distinct smell of cigarettes coming in from the building. Outside the Capitol, officers found a man walking near the building. That man was later identified as Gunnar Schubert, a former basketball player who used to play college basketball when he was young. What was even more shocking was that right before he was taken into custody, Schubert discarded a container filled with some liquid. The officers then put him inside a patrol vehicle while they continued investigating the damage done inside the building.Gunnar Schubert used to play college basketball at the Gonzaga University, where he played over 100 games and largely contributed to his team. It is believed that he was so good at playing that it led to his selection in the MLB Draft by the Miami Marlins, a moment only a few could achieve and many young players dream of. And although his professional journey was brief, Schubert was able to reach the minor leagues before his final release. Since then, Schubert has remained largely out of the public eye, keeping his personal life private, until this recent incident, which has brought his name back into the headlines, for reasons far from sports.Following his arrest, Grunnar Schubert was charged with several serious offences. Offences that were related to felony, burglary, theft, and an attempt to damage public property. He is expected to appear in court next month, where the decisions regarding his punishment and other legal matters will be discussed. The case reflects a sharp reminder of how quickly life can take a U-turn, even for those who once nearly achieved professional success.Also Read: “GOAT FATHER” – Fans can’t get over LeBron James gifting his daughter a mini house in a heartfelt throwback clip","Former miami marlins draft pick gunnar schubert arrested in washington state capitol break-in.

Putin 'TEASES' Zelensky; Offers Ukraine Land Captured By Russian Troops But Not Donbas | Report





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that he will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida over the weekend, as diplomatic efforts continue to bring an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.Speaking to reporters, Zelenskyy said the discussions on Sunday will focus on security guarantees for Ukraine. He said negotiators are close to finalising a proposed 20-point peace framework, which “is about 90% ready.”The upcoming talks come as Washington leads a broad diplomatic initiative aimed at stopping Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022. Progress has been difficult due to major disagreements between Kyiv and Moscow over key conditions for ending the conflict.Zelenskyy said his announcement followed a “good conversation” on Thursday with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the US president’s son-in-law.Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would consider pulling its forces out of parts of the eastern industrial region if Russia does the same. Under his proposal, the area would become a demilitarised zone overseen by international monitors.Also read: 'Terrorist scum': Why Trump ordered US strikes on ISIS in Nigeria — what it means Moscow has not signaled acceptance of such a plan. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday that negotiations were showing “slow but steady progress,” but Russia continues to press its own demands, reported AP.The Kremlin insists that Ukraine surrender the territory it still controls in the Donbas, a demand Kyiv has rejected. Russian forces currently occupy most of Luhansk and roughly 70% of Donetsk, the two regions that make up the Donbas.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that contacts between Russian and US officials are ongoing following a recent meeting in Florida between Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev and US representatives. “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue,” Peskov said.","Ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said he will meet us president donald trump in florida over the weekend.

From December 26, mandatory biometric checking of all non-US citizens, including Green Card holders, at border points comes into effect.

Kenny Stills believes “Trump curse” played a part in Detroit’s late-season setback



What looked like a season heading toward meaningful January football has ended with frustration, questions, and a sense of opportunity wasted. The Detroit Lions’ campaign unraveled at the wrong time, and their 23-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas night finally closed the door on any postseason possibility while clearing the way for the Green Bay Packers to secure their place instead.The defeat was not an isolated stumble. It capped a worrying run of form in which Detroit simply could not hold its footing during the most demanding stretch of the schedule. Performances dipped, execution failed, and the Lions repeatedly found themselves second best. By the time Minnesota controlled Thursday night’s contest, it felt like the end result had been building for weeks.As the disappointment settled, an unexpected angle resurfaced online. Former Miami Dolphins receiver Kenny Stills revisited an earlier moment from Detroit’s season, sharing a clip of Amon-Ra St. Brown’s celebration from the Lions’ convincing win over Washington. Stills suggested that the celebration invited bad luck, even calling it a “Trump curse” on Twitter, sparking debate rather than being brushed aside as harmless commentary.That celebration once symbolized Detroit’s swagger, coming in a game they controlled comfortably.What followed tells a harsher story: only two wins in seven outings, momentum gone, confidence shaken, and ultimately the playoff push slipping away. Supporters can joke about superstition, but the real issue lies in how quickly standards dropped when pressure intensified.Against Minnesota, the shortcomings were clear. Drives failed to sustain, defensive gaps appeared at crucial moments, and the Vikings showed greater composure in decisive situations. It wasn’t a curse that ended Detroit’s season; it was a mix of stalled offense, lapses in execution, and timing that worked entirely against them.Now the Lions head into the offseason knowing this one will hurt. A promising position dissolved into a late-season slide that cost them everything they were chasing. The challenge ahead is not about addressing online narratives; it is about restoring consistency, rediscovering belief, and ensuring a collapse like this does not define the group moving forward.",Kenny stills believes ‘trump curse’ played a part in detroit’s late-season setback.

That look like any America you've ever heard of?On a report on X about the Donald Trump administration announcing “full suspension” of immigration and naturalisation for citizens of 19 countries, he commented, “Now do India”.These countries with full or partial travel restrictions include Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. The US has intensified its crackdown on immigration after an Afghan national was accused of shooting one National Guard member and critically wounding another in Washington, DC.""I really appreciate the invitation. It's very gracious. I have said a lot of negative things about JD Vance. So for him to extend an invitation like that to me to have dinner, a traditional Indian dinner, with his family...it actually moved me. It actually touched me a little bit. I have been nothing but antagonistic to this guy, really unprovoked; I started the beef,"" Nick Fuentes said, suggesting that Indians eat s**t.""And so for him, in the spirit of the holiday and Christmas, for him to extend an invitation in public like that, to enjoy a traditional Indian dinner prepared by his wife with his family at the Naval Observatory, he is a better man than me. Credit where it is due,"" Fuentes said.Fuentes added that he would have to decline the invitation respectfully as he does not want to eat s**t. ""That's why we don't want them here,"" Fuentes said adding that he knows that Indian eat cow dung and they scratch their a** and prepare the food.Fuentes has used anti-India slurs against her multiple times. He in one of the podcasts called her J**t, which is a common slur used against Indian-origin people. In one of the podcasts, Fuentes used racist slurs, saying, ""Your guy (JD Vance) is literally a fat, gay, race traitor that married a J***.""Earlier, Fuentes launched his attack on Vance and his family after Vance joined Trump’s re-election campaign last month.Fuentes questioned Vance's loyalty to white identity, citing his marriage to an Indian woman and the name of their child, Vivek.Not only this, recently, the podcaster mocked the photo featuring JD Vance celebrating Thanksgiving with his Hindu wife Usha’s Indian-origin family.Right-wing commentator Nick Fuentes mocked the Thanksgiving photo in a manner that many netizens deemed 'racist' on this year's Thanksgiving.Pointing at the image, Fuentes mocks its composition, claiming there are “two white people” and “24 Indian or East Asian people” dressed in what he calls “indigenous garb.” He sarcastically challenges viewers to “spot the differences,” using the moment to ridicule the family’s multicultural setting. Fuentes goes on to make a historically warped joke, insisting the first Thanksgiving involved Indigenous Americans, “not real Indians from India. ”He then takes a crude swipe at a red drink on the table, comparing it to street beverages in India prepared “with flies” and unsanitary handling. Using the photo as political ammunition, Fuentes argues that anyone considering Vance as a leader should simply look at the image, framing it as all they “need to know.”""This is not your home. And you know it's not your home. That's why you married an Indian and you had Indian kids, You gave them Indian names and you didn't assimilate, you didn't even adopt the religion of our country. And you go around telling us that we don't even have to speak English to be American. F**k you. You should go back to India where there's a lot more people like you. There's a billion and a half Indians in India and you don't have to worry about being called a J**t there because there's a billion and a half f**king J**ts in India and they won't call you one over there,"" Fuentes said in the recent podcast after his AmFest speech.""Go live there if it makes you feel uncomfortable. If you want to live here, give ounce and a shred of respect to the people that built this country. We're not asking anymore. We're telling you. And if you think now that you're gonna become the governor of Ohio, telling white people that you're as American as them, you got your anchor baby, birthright citizenship from your H1-B f****ng parents, you think you're gonna go around Ohio telling people that have been there since the civ or since the Revolutionary War, you're as American as them, you're now going to be their governor,"" he added.Over his Op-ed piece on New York Times, Fuetnes said, ""“Reminder that Vivek Ramaswamy is an actual anchor baby, so everything he says can be completely disregarded ... Foreigners who have no right to be here don’t get to lecture me about what it is to be American.”","Nicholas j fuentes, an american white nationalist known for his racist and sexist rants, has been after india for a very long time. He had several times used anti-india slurs at his podcasts, especially targeting usha vance, us vice president's jd vance's wife, and vivek ramaswamy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126193313,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-42212,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
