"Working to find ways to stop trade volume dip, sanctions won’t hurt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/working-to-find-ways-to-stop-trade-volume-dip-sanctions-wont-hurt/articleshow/125730746.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit for the India-Russia annual summit, Moscow has backed oil trade with India saying sanctions against Russian companies will cause only an insignificant dip in India’s imports from Russia.Briefing the media, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said both sides were working to find ways to not allow volume of trade to fall, adding Russia has deep experience of performing under a regime of illegal sanctions through technologies at its disposal.“There can be, for a very brief time, insignificant drops in volume of oil trade, but we consider those sanctions to be illegal from the point of view of international law,” said Peskov, who also stressed the need for India and Russia to make bilateral trade immune to pressure from third countries.The Modi-Putin summit will take place against the backdrop of pressure applied by the US and EU on India to review its energy ties with Russia. The US has slapped an additional 25% tariff on India for purchasing oil from Russia.“We do not accept these limitations, and we are doing our best to ensure that we continue our trade and that our purchasers enjoy guaranteed supplies of oil and oil products. We are managing that quite successfully,” he added.Peskov said the bilateral relationship rests on historical background of mutual understanding. “And mutual vision of global affairs & a system of global affairs based on international law, rule of law and ability to take into account each other’s interests,” he added.While Russia is looking at $100 billion trade with India by 2030, he said, Moscow is fully aware of New Delhi's concerns about the massive trade deficit and is working with it to fix “the problem”.Peskov said the tie must be free of any influence from third countries that are trying to create obstacles for India-Russia trade partnership.","Kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov said both sides were working to find ways to not allow volume of trade to fall.

Pakistan Sparks Controversy With Expired Relief Claims As India Rejects Airspace Allegation Strongly

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Tuesday renewed its allegations that its relief operations for cyclone-hit Sri Lanka were being “hampered by lack of cooperation” from India, claiming that permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.“India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The special aircraft carrying Pakistan’s humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka continues to face delays for over 60 hours now awaiting flight clearance from India,” the Pakistan Foreign Office said in a post on X.It added that the “partial flight clearance issued by India last night, after 48 hours, was operationally impractical: time-bound for just a few hours and without validity for the return flight, severely hindering this urgent relief Mission for the brotherly people of Sri Lanka.”Shortly after, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them “ridiculous” and “yet another attempt to spread anti-India misinformation.”He clarified that the request for overflight clearance for the Pakistani aircraft carrying humanitarian aid was received by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad around 1:00 PM on December 1, 2025. “Given the urgency of the humanitarian assistance, the Government of India processed the request expeditiously the same day and granted overflight permission as per the proposed itinerary at 5:30 PM on December 1, 2025,” he said, in an official statement.Officials also dismissed reports in the Pakistani media claiming India had not granted overflight permission as “fake”. “Pakistani media, as usual, is indulging in propaganda and peddling fake news. These allegations are baseless and misleading. All requests for overflight or transit are processed strictly in accordance with established procedures and international norms,” one of the people said.Meanwhile, the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka faced criticism online after sharing images of the relief materials sent to the flood-hit country.In a post on X Tuesday, the High Commission uploaded photos showing stacks of packaged supplies, stating: “Relief packages from Pakistan have been successfully delivered to assist our brothers and sisters affected by the recent floods in Sri Lanka, which signifies our unwavering solidarity.” However, netizens quickly noticed what appeared to be expiry dates of October 2024 printed on some of the packages.Sri Lanka has been grappling with widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, leaving several districts isolated and severely straining the country’s disaster-response capacity. India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu to assist Sri Lanka in its recovery efforts.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed at least 410 deaths and 336 missing as of Tuesday morning due to the catastrophic floods and landslides caused by extreme weather conditions since November 16.","Pakistan claims permission to use indian airspace was being delayed.

NEW DELHI: The Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) has successfully conducted a high-speed rocket-sled test of a fighter aircraft escape system at the Rail Track Rocket Sled (RTRS) facility of the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, Chandigarh. The test validated canopy severance, ejection sequencing, and complete aircrew recovery.Conducted in collaboration with the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the complex dynamic test ""India in an elite club of nations with advanced in-house escape system testing capability,"" stated a government press release.Further explaining the significance of the trial it added, unlike static tests, dynamic ejection trials simulate real-life conditions to evaluate ejection seat performance and canopy severance efficacy.A dual-sled system with the LCA aircraft forebody was propelled to a precisely controlled velocity using phased firing of multiple solid-propellant rocket motors. An instrumented Anthropomorphic Test Dummy recorded critical loads, moments, and accelerations, while onboard and ground-based imaging systems captured the entire sequence. The test was witnessed by officials from the Indian Air Force and the Institute of Aerospace Medicine for certification.Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO, IAF, ADA, HAL, and industry partners, calling the test a significant milestone in India’s indigenous defence capability and a step forward towards self-reliance.Dr Samir V Kamat, Secretary of the Department of Defence R&D and Chairman of DRDO, also congratulated the team for the successful demonstration.","The defence research and development organisation ( drdo ) has successfully conducted a high-speed rocket-sled test of a fighter aircraft escape system.

Why Did Pakistan Navy Stay Out During Operation Sindoor: Indian Navy Chief Reveals Stunning Details

NEW DELHI: Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi on Tuesday said that India’s third indigenously built nuclear-powered submarine will be commissioned soon. Speaking ahead of Navy Day, he also explained how the Navy’s strong action during counterterror Operation Sindoor forced Pakistan’s naval forces to stay close to their coastline.Admiral Tripathi said, ""The aggressive posturing and immediate action during Operation Sindoor… forced Pakistan Navy to remain close to their ports or near the Makran coast."" He added that the operation is still ongoing.He also described how busy the Navy has been over the past year, completing 11,000 ship days and 50,000 flying hours since the last Navy Day. One Indian ship has been continuously deployed in the Gulf of Aden since 2008 for anti-piracy duties, and 138 ships have taken part so far, escorting more than 3,700 merchant vessels from different countries.Admiral Tripathi said the Navy has received international recognition, noting that one naval ship was praised by the International Maritime Organisation for rescuing nine crew members from an Omani vessel last year.

PM Modi’s ‘Drama Nahi, Delivery’ Message Sets Fiery Tone As Winter Session Begins Amid Tensions

NEW DELHI: New complex housing the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) will be called ‘Seva Teerth’, officials said on Tuesday.Earlier known as the ‘Executive Enclave’, the complex is now in its final stages of completion, marking a significant step in the Central Vista redevelopment.Officials described Seva Teerth as a workplace designed to reflect the spirit of service, a space “where national priorities take shape”. They said India’s public institutions were undergoing a “quiet but profound shift”, with governance moving from “satta (power) to seva (service)” and from authority to responsibility.“The change was not just administrative, but cultural and moral,” they added, as quoted by PTI.The enclave will house the PMO along with the offices of the Cabinet Secretariat, the National Security Council Secretariat and India House, which will serve as a venue for high-level talks with visiting dignitaries.As part of this broader shift in governance philosophy, Raj Bhawans—the official residences of state governors—are being renamed ‘Lok Bhawans’.The Central Secretariat, too, is now known as Kartavya Bhavan.Officials said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi , spaces of governance have been reshaped to reflect ‘kartavya’ (duty) and transparency. “Every name, every building and every symbol now points to a simple idea. Government exists to serve,” they said.Several landmarks have already been renamed in recent years. Rajpath became Kartavya Path, while the prime minister’s official residence was renamed Lok Kalyan Marg in 2016, a name intended to convey welfare rather than exclusivity.“These changes mark a deeper ideological transition. Indian democracy is choosing responsibility over power and service over status,” officials said. “A shift in names is also a shift in mindset. Today, they speak the language of seva, kartavya and citizen-first governance,” they added.","New complex housing the prime minister’s office (pmo) will be called ‘seva teerth’, officials said on tuesday.

The bottom line

Global arms revenues surged to an all-time high of $679 billion in 2024, up 5.9% in real terms, according to the latest SIPRI Top 100 ranking. While Europe and the US drove most of the increase, Asia and Oceania stood out as the only region to post a decline—largely due to a dramatic drop in Chinese arms company revenues, the SIPRI report said.India, though still far from being a global arms giant, posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies. In sharp contrast, Chinese arms revenues fell 10%, a setback tied to a wave of high-profile corruption scandals and major contract delays that rattled Beijing's defense establishment.India’s three Top 100 firms-Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders-together pulled in $7.5 billion in arms revenue in 2024, up from $6.9 billion in 2023.BEL led the growth with a 24% revenue jump, hitting $2.47 billion. The boost came from domestic orders, particularly in radar systems and electronic warfare equipment, both prioritized in India’s military modernization drive.HAL, India’s top-ranked defense firm at rank 44 globally, earned $3.81 billion, a marginal 0.3% decrease from the previous year. The company faced delivery lags, but remained a cornerstone supplier to the Indian Air Force and Navy.Mazagon Dock, focused on naval shipbuilding, recorded $1.23 billion in arms revenue, with a 9.8% year-on-year increase, thanks to continued submarine and destroyer production.India is pressing ahead with its “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) campaign in defense production. While not grabbing global headlines, its incremental gains highlight an emerging industrial base that could challenge traditional suppliers over time.“The combined arms revenues of the three Indian companies in the Top 100 increased by 8.2 per cent to $7.5 billion on the back of domestic orders,” the SIPRI report said.The picture in China couldn’t be more different. For the first time in years, China’s eight arms producers in the SIPRI Top 100-previously hailed as key enablers of President Xi Jinping’s military modernization push-lost major ground.The steepest fall came from NORINCO, China’s primary land systems manufacturer, which saw its revenue plunge 31% due to corruption scandals and leadership upheaval.CASC, China’s aerospace and missile systems leader, dropped 16% following delays in military satellite programs and the removal of its president amid graft allegations.Even AVIC, the country’s biggest defense company, slipped 1.3%, hampered by delays in aircraft deliveries.“A host of corruption allegations in Chinese arms procurement led to major arms contracts being postponed or cancelled in 2024,” said Nan Tian, director of the SIPRI military expenditure and arms production programme.China’s top-down, state-controlled defense sector may be big-but its opacity leaves it vulnerable to internal shocks. Political purges tied to Xi’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign disrupted procurement and leadership pipelines across several top defense firms.Only two of China’s eight arms producers recorded revenue growth-CSSC, the shipbuilding powerhouse, was one, rising 8.7%, aligned with China’s naval buildup in the South China Sea.India’s slow, state-driven growth might lack flash, but it also avoids the internal disarray seen in Beijing. Its procurement is transparent, aligned to strategic plans, and largely free of major political scandal.China, meanwhile, is still far ahead in sheer scale but vulnerable to top-level instability.While China dragged down the region’s total, other Asian powers picked up slack:South Korean arms producers rose 31% to $14.1 billion, driven by booming exports.Japan posted the largest jump in Asia: a 40% increase in arms revenues across five firms, reaching $13.3 billion, reflecting Tokyo’s shift toward proactive defense spending amid regional tensions.US firms remain the backbone of the global arms industry. The 39 American companies in the Top 100 generated $334 billion in arms revenues in 2024, a 3.8 per cent increase that leaves them with just under half of global Top 100 sales. Lockheed Martin alone booked $64.7 billion, while RTX, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics each sat comfortably above $30 billion.Yet the American giant is struggling to turn money into timely capability. Programmes such as the F-35 fighter, the Columbia-class nuclear submarine and the Sentinel ICBM are all running late and over budget. Lockheed’s F-35 deliveries in 2024 were delayed by an average of 238 days per aircraft, and the programme’s projected sustainment costs have ballooned towards $1.6 trillion over its life. Northrop’s Sentinel programme has breached US cost-growth thresholds by around 80 per cent versus its original estimate.SIPRI’s Xiao Liang warns that “The delays and rising costs will inevitably impact US military planning and military spending… This could have knock-on effects on the US government’s efforts to cut excessive military spending and improve budget efficiency.” In plain terms, even as the US spends more, it risks getting less capability per dollar.European producers surged by 13%, reaching $151 billion, as countries rearm in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.Russia’s corporate footprint in the SIPRI Top 100 remains surprisingly small—just two entities, Rostec and United Shipbuilding Corporation—but their combined arms revenues jumped 23 per cent in 2024 to an estimated $31.2 billion. Domestic demand linked to the Ukraine war more than offset shrinking exports. Russian plants have ramped up output of artillery shells, missiles and armoured vehicles; SIPRI cites reports of 1.3 million 152-mm shells produced in 2024, a more than fivefold increase over 2022.Where Russia is constrained, the Middle East is expanding. For the first time, nine companies from the region appear in the Top 100, with combined arms revenues of $31.0 billion, up 14 per cent where comparable data exist. Israeli firms alone generated $16.2 billion, a 16 per cent increase, fuelled both by the Gaza war and strong demand for uncrewed systems and missile defence worldwide.For India:Expect a continued push for domestic procurement and local manufacturing under the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP).India may look to expand exports, especially to Africa and Southeast Asia, but lacks the global competitiveness of Korean or Israeli systems.For China:Beijing still accounts for around 13 per cent of total Top 100 arms revenues, and its shipyards and missile producers have been central to the rapid expansion of the PLA Navy and rocket forces over the past decade.But the 2024 rankings hint at a temporary pause or re-ordering in its modernisation drive just as tensions over Taiwan and in the South China Sea remain high.Recovery will depend on restoring procurement integrity, managing talent loss, and containing political fallout.For Asia:The regional arms race is far from over.The pivot from importing to building continues—but success will depend on supply chain resilience, governance, and geopolitical alignment.India is climbing slowly, but surely-fueled by trust in institutions, steady demand, and political will.China, long considered an unstoppable defense juggernaut, now faces turbulence not from outside threats, but from within.In the evolving landscape of Asian defense, discipline may matter more than dominance.

India to soon commission 3rd nuclear submarine with ballistic missiles: Navy chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-soon-commission-3rd-nuclear-submarine-with-ballistic-missiles-navy-chief/articleshow/125724661.cms,"Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripath

Navy Chief Confirms India’S Third Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine Soon

NEW DELHI: India will early next year add some sharp teeth to its sea-based leg of the nuclear triad by commissioning its third nuclear-powered submarine, which is larger than the first two and capable of carrying more long-range nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.The third such submarine, called SSBN in naval parlance, is in “the final stages of trials and will be commissioned soon” as INS Aridhaman, Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said on Tuesday.Sources, in turn, said the fourth SSBN (codenamed S-4*), which will also have a displacement of 7,000-tonne like INS Aridhaman, is likely to be commissioned in 2027. The first two, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, both with a 6,000-tonne displacement, became fully operational in 2018 and 2024, respectively.Parallelly, India will also get a nuclear-powered attack submarine (called SSN), armed with conventional or non-nuclear weapons for long-range hunting-killing missions, on a 10-year lease from Russia by 2027-28.The delivery of this advanced Akula-class SSN, which will be commissioned as INS Chakra-3, was to take place much earlier under the $3 billion deal with Russia in March 2019 but has been delayed due to the ongoing Ukraine war, as reported by TOI earlier.Both SSBNs and SSNs, which can stay underwater for months on end, are crucial for India’s credible strategic deterrence against the collusive and fused China-Pakistan threat, which is only going to further expand in the coming years.While SSBNs are meant for retaliatory nuclear strikes in line with India’s “no first-use” policy, SSNs are designed for conventional warfare by quietly gathering intelligence, tracking and destroying enemy targets at extended ranges.India’s first two nuclear triad legs are the land-based Agni series of ballistic missiles and fighters like Sukhoi-30MKI, Mirage-2000, Jaguar and Rafale capable of delivering nuclear gravity bombs. SSBNs, however, are considered the most secure, survivable and potent platforms for retaliatory nuclear strikes, which in turn can deter an adversary from launching a first strike.Admiral Tripathi, on his part, said India’s own project to build two SSNs is “proceedings as per plans” after being cleared by the PM-led cabinet committee on security for Rs 40,000 crore in Oct 2024.The first of these two 9,800-tonne SSNs, each with a 190 MW pressurised light-water reactor, will be ready for induction by 2036-37, followed by the second one a couple of years later, as was earlier reported by TOI.On the SSBN front, INS Aridhaman will be capable of carrying double the number of K-4 ballistic missiles, which have a strike range of 3,500-km, as compared to INS Arighaat. INS Arihant is armed only with 750-km range K-15 missiles.The K-4 missile is going to be soon tested for the second time from INS Arighaat after the first test in Nov last year did not meet all the laid down parameters. There are also K-5 and K-6 missiles, with strike ranges of 5,000 to 6,000-km, on the anvil.India’s existing SSBNs are less than half the size of the ones with the US, China and Russia. China is rapidly expanding its existing fleet of six Jin-class SSBNs, with 10,000-km range JL-3 missiles, and six SSNs. The US, in turn, has 14 Ohio-class SSBNs and 53 SSNs.India also has the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones.",Navy chief confirms india’s third nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine soon.

Why Cincinnati Makes Sense for Buxton

Astros’ Motive: Rotation Stability

Twins’ Return: Prospects to Support a Transition

Why the Deal Still Feels Unlikely

The Cincinnati Reds may be approaching the offseason with several areas to evaluate, but one need sits clearly above the rest: adding more power to a lineup that struggled to produce consistent thump. A new trade concept from MLB.com’s Anthony Castrovince puts forward a dramatic solution - one that involves making a push for Minnesota Twins star Byron Buxton through a multi-team blockbuster. It’s an idea built around the Reds’ pitching depth and the possibility of acquiring a dynamic, game-changing outfielder without diving into the expensive end of free agency.But the proposal isn’t limited to a simple two-team exchange. Castrovince outlines a three-team structure involving the Reds, Twins, and Houston Astros, each addressing a different roster priority. For Cincinnati, it’s about landing a high-impact bat. For Houston, it’s securing a mid-rotation arm. And for Minnesota, it’s about collecting a group of prospects to support their transition. The concept may be unlikely to materialize, yet it brings together several logical elements that make it worth exploring.Castrovince’s concept revolves around the Reds leveraging their pitching depth, the Astros reinforcing their rotation, and the Twins securing a wave of prospects.Here is how the deal would look based on the proposal:Buxton, who has spent his entire career with Minnesota, is seen as an ideal fit for a Reds club that has been searching for a dynamic bat. As Castrovince wrote, “Buxton would be perfect for a Reds team that could use its pitching depth to address a lineup in need.”One of the major selling points is Buxton’s contract. He is owed roughly $15 million annually for the next three seasons, a number that sits well below what top free-agent hitters will command on the open market. That affordability naturally increases his appeal across the league, though Buxton previously declared himself “a Minnesota Twin for life,” a statement that could complicate any trade discussions.Houston’s inclusion centers on adding right-hander Brady Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration. The Astros are facing the likely departure of Framber Valdez in free agency, leaving a gap in the middle of their rotation. Singer fits both their competitive timeline and their payroll.Castrovince noted, “Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration, does not fit a Twins team in transition but does fit an Astros team that needs an affordable mid-rotation arm.” (H/t: Sporting News)Minnesota’s role in the deal is centered on long-term roster building. The Twins would receive four prospects, two from Cincinnati and two from Houston: Tyson Lewis, Mason Neville, Walker Janek, and Cole Hrtzler. The organization is navigating a transitional phase, and a multi-prospect return aligns with their broader strategy.Even with the pieces seemingly aligned, the proposal faces a major hurdle - Buxton’s ability to veto a trade. His long-standing connection to the Twins organization and his recent comments make any potential move difficult to finalize.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could bag $30 million Milwaukee Brewers 2x All-Star to improve title odds ahead of deadline Castrovince admitted that this is likely a trade that never happens, though he added that the framework hits several logical points for all involved clubs.

Ayesha Curry’s playful ring-removal moment goes viral again in a hilarious throwback clip

There’s nothing the internet loves more than digging up an old clip and giving it a fresh round of drama, and Ayesha Curry just became the latest star to get the “throwback treatment.” A resurfaced talk-show moment of her jokingly sliding off her wedding ring when a shirtless man walked into the set has returned to everyone’s timeline and the reactions? Absolutely unhinged. It’s wild watching people rediscover a clip that was clearly meant to be silly, but somehow it keeps sparking passionate debates every time it pops back up. So let’s rewind and break down why this tiny moment refuses to die.The viral clip comes from an older talk-show appearance where Ayesha is chill, chatting, and living her daytime-TV life. Suddenly, a shirtless model/waiter strolls onto the stage, the kind of dramatic entrance talk shows love. Ayesha’s reaction? She playfully pretends to slide her wedding ring off, leaning all the way into the bit with exaggerated expressions that immediately sent the audience into laughter.It was lighthearted, harmless, and extremely on-brand for fun talk-show energy. But the internet has a special talent for turning goofy moments into cultural debates, which is exactly what happened the first time this clip circulated… and the second… and now again.The internet isn’t obsessed with this clip because it’s scandalous, it’s obsessed because it’s chaotic in the funniest way possible. Ayesha is known for being polished, wholesome, and very “Curry family aesthetic,” so seeing her in full goofy, unserious mode feels refreshing. It also gives fans a peek at the playful side of her personality that doesn’t always get the spotlight.Every generation of viewers seems to rediscover this clip and react like it’s happening in real time, which is part of why it always goes viral. It’s new for some, nostalgic for others, and confusing for many who insist it must mean something deeper.Ayesha has recently been more open, more playful, and more unfiltered in interviews compared to her early public image. That shift has put her under a much sharper social microscope. So when this old clip resurfaced now, fans connected it with today’s Ayesha even though the context is years old.Also read - Klay Thompson names his boat “SS Stallion” after Megan Thee Stallion — fans lose their minds","Ayesha curry’s playful ring-removal moment goes viral again in a hilarious throwback clip.

Akademiks pushes the claim that every man linked to Megan Thee Stallion ends up in a downfall, leading to major backlash and discussion

DaBaby had a career cool-down after their collaborations







Tory Lanez ended up in prison after the shooting trial







Pardison Fontaine “fell off” after their breakup







Klay Thompson is having one of the worst statistical stretches of his career







DaBaby: Yes, he worked with Megan, but his decline in popularity came after multiple controversies unrelated to her.







Tory Lanez: His conviction came from his actions in the 2020 shooting case involving Megan.







Pardison Fontaine: His fade from the spotlight is more about industry cycles than anything Megan-related.







Klay Thompson: His rough season is well documented, but it has nothing to do with Megan.







“This is the first time that I’ve seen a victim who was shot be the one with “bad juju”

“The only real curse here is people refusing to accept responsibility and preferring conspiracy over reality.”

There’s always a new celebrity “curse” flying around the internet, but this week, Akademiks decided to nominate Megan Thee Stallion as the latest target. A clip of him claiming she carries “bad juju” around the men associated with her has gone viral, and honestly, the timelines people are stitching together online are even wilder. As this conversation grows, fans are trying to separate actual facts from pure social-media chaos.Akademiks, known for stirring up hip-hop drama, went on a rant accusing Megan Thee Stallion of having “bad juju” that supposedly affects the men who cross paths with her. In the clip, he lists DaBaby, Tory Lanez, Pardison Fontaine, and now Klay Thompson as examples.He claims:The names are real, the associations are real, but the “juju” narrative is purely his interpretation. Still, the internet loves patterns, especially messy ones so the conversation exploded instantly.Even though Akademiks presented these situations like a checklist, each case has its own context:Fans pointed out that Ak is mixing real-life outcomes with a dramatic narrative to push the “curse” angle.Twitter comment sections immediately filled up with reactions. Some people joked about the “Meg curse” like it’s the new “Kardashian Curse,” while others called the entire theory lazy and unfair.Many fans argued that:The only verified truth here is that Akademiks actually made this claim, and each man he listed has been publicly tied to Megan in different ways. But there is zero factual evidence connecting her to their downfalls.The “bad juju” angle is simply a viral social-media narrative, not a real pattern.Also read - Klay Thompson names his boat “SS Stallion” after Megan Thee Stallion — fans lose their minds","Akademiks, known for stirring up hip-hop drama, went on a rant accusing megan thee stallion of having “bad juju” that supposedly affects the men who cross paths with her.

The vanishing rules of restraint





Washington’s outrage masks its long memory





The doctrine revealed









Frederick Forsyth has created many memorable protagonists, but Calvin Dexter from Avenger remains one of his most fascinating. Dexter, an ex–Tunnel Rat who crawled through the subterranean hellscape of Vietnam, eventually reinvented himself as a mercenary with a strangely unwavering commitment: he would go deep into hostile territory, extract a villain alive, and deliver him to an American courtroom. Dexter did not believe in summary execution or improvised vengeance. He believed in the symbolism of a fair trial, in an America that could demonstrate its moral superiority by forcing even its enemies to answer to the law.That ideal — the idea that America kills when it must but prosecutes when it can — stands in deliberate contrast to the way American foreign policy has often functioned in reality. For all its talk of a rules-based international order, the United States has long operated on a simpler formula: identify a threat, define the battlefield, and impose a solution. Dexter’s fictional insistence on due process is compelling precisely because it feels like the exception rather than the rule.Which brings us to Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and the now-infamous “Kill Them All” directive. The mainstream American commentariat is working overtime to portray his alleged order — to eliminate the two survivors clinging to the wreckage of a bombed Caribbean vessel — as a shocking departure from established norms.But the truth is far less flattering. The Caribbean strike is not a fracture in American conduct. It is the logical expression of it. It is not an aberration. It is a revelation.Modern historians like to point to the Bill Clinton years, when cruise-missile strikes became the norm, citing the attacks in Sudan and Afghanistan. Some commentators even joke that some bombings helped iron out the rough edges that emerged post L’Affaire Lewinsky.But the United States entered the era of decisive, extraterritorial force long before Clinton ever signed a strike order. In the early twentieth century, under Theodore Roosevelt and the administrations that followed, American marines were dispatched across the Caribbean and Central America to enforce Washington’s conception of stability. Entire governments were unseated or reorganised according to geopolitical convenience, and the Monroe Doctrine became less a strategic principle and more a permission slip for action wherever America felt entitled.By the mid-century, American power took on a covert dimension. Dwight Eisenhower oversaw operations that toppled governments in Iran and Guatemala. John Kennedy authorised sabotage campaigns and clandestine strike missions. Lyndon Johnson escalated covert activity in Southeast Asia. These actions were always couched in noble language — containing communism, preserving order, promoting democracy — but they normalised the idea that the United States could choose its villains and neutralise them without ever seeing the inside of a courtroom.This longstanding tradition meant that when Clinton embraced precision strikes, when George W. Bush declared a global war on terror, and when Barack Obama turned targeted killing into a highly systematised bureaucratic machine, they weren’t inventing anything. They were refining a tool that had been honed for decades. Pete Hegseth is simply the first to wield it without bothering to hide the edges.From the 1990s onwards, American foreign policy adopted the sheen of surgical precision. Bill Clinton’s strikes were sold as carefully calibrated actions necessitated by global threats. George W. Bush then expanded America’s reach across continents, constructing the legal scaffolding for a war without recognised borders.Under Barack Obama, targeted killing became a streamlined process. Committees met, memos were drafted, and every strike carried the appearance of oversight — all while the fundamental principle remained unchanged: if the United States decides a person or organisation is a threat, lethal force may follow anywhere.Donald Trump’s first term stripped away much of the procedural varnish. Rules of engagement loosened, oversight narrowed, and operational discretion expanded. What earlier administrations whispered, Trump said aloud. And in his second term, Pete Hegseth inherited a system already primed for a harder, more unapologetic edge.The key shift in the Caribbean is the reclassification of suspected drug traffickers as quasi-military targets. For decades, boats ferrying narcotics were part of the law-enforcement domain. The US Coast Guard intercepted them, the Drug Enforcement Administration prosecuted the smugglers, and courts handled the rest.But when Hegseth and Donald Trump began describing these traffickers as “narco-terrorists,” the frame changed entirely. A criminal investigation became a counterterrorism operation. A maritime patrol zone became a battlefield. A person clinging to debris — unarmed, immobile, incapable of resistance — became a threat to be eliminated rather than a suspect to be detained.And this is where the Washington Post revelations become indispensable. According to officials familiar with the mission, US surveillance had tracked an eleven-man go-fast vessel off the coast of Trinidad, believed to be running narcotics for the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. When the first missile hit, the boat erupted into flames and the crew was scattered into the water.Two men survived, visibly wounded, clinging to the wreckage. It was at this moment, the Post reported, that Pete Hegseth issued the spoken order to “kill everybody.” The commander overseeing the strike relayed the directive, and SEAL Team 6 executed a follow-on attack that obliterated the survivors in the water. The Pentagon later tried to pass this off as an attempt to “remove maritime hazards,” but the reporting makes clear that this was not housekeeping; it was a deliberate act meant to ensure that no one lived to contradict the administration’s narrative of a clean, righteous hit against Venezuelan-linked narco-terrorists.But officials have pushed back sharply. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell rejected the allegations outright, calling the story “completely false.” The White House has since insisted that the follow-up strike was ordered not by Pete Hegseth but by Admiral Frank M. Bradley, and that it was “within his authority and the law,” according to press secretary Karoline LeavittInternational law insists that shipwrecked survivors be treated as protected individuals. American military doctrine, shaped over generations, echoes that view. Even during the fiercest years of the post-9/11 wars, wounded combatants were expected to be captured, not executed.Yet the logic that guided the Caribbean strike is unmistakable. Once someone is designated a threat, their status does not change simply because they are incapacitated. Vulnerability does not equate to innocence. Survival does not trigger rescue; it invites resolution. This worldview is not unique to Pete Hegseth. It is the natural consequence of decades in which the United States has equated security with preemption and legality with interpretation.Predictably, Washington reacted with indignation. Members of Congress demanded briefings. Commentators questioned legality. Editorial pages called for accountability. But beneath this ritualised shock lies a quiet truth: for decades, lawmakers turned a blind eye as the executive accumulated extraordinary power to designate, target and eliminate individuals far beyond US borders.The Caribbean incident is unsettling not because the United States killed suspected criminals — it has done so in various forms for generations — but because the order was so starkly expressed. It exposed a foreign-policy instinct that usually hides behind diplomatic grammar.Calvin Dexter is fiction because he represents the America that Washington likes to imagine itself to be — the America that captures, prosecutes and proves its moral superiority through due process. Pete Hegseth is reality because he represents the America that has quietly expanded its latitude to act without restraint.In the end, the most disturbing thing about the Caribbean strike is not that it happened but that it happened openly. Every administration before Pete Hegseth prepared the ground. They broadened the definitions, stretched the mandates and normalised the exceptions. Hegseth simply removed the curtain.The “Kill Them All” directive should not be read as a terrifying new innovation. It is the moment when America stopped pretending that its foreign-policy instincts are built on restraint. It is the moment when the façade cracked and the architecture underneath — the one constructed long before Clinton ever authorised a missile — finally became visible.Calvin Dexter’s world imagined an America that insists on trials even for enemies. Pete Hegseth’s world reflects the America that actually exists: one that prefers solutions that do not leave survivors to testify.","America’s habit of decisive violence did not begin yesterday.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

How Elon Musk sees AI and robotics reshaping global industries





Elon Musk: A Different Conversation w/ Nikhil Kamath | Full Episode | People by WTF Ep. 16

Elon Musk’s prediction of AI-driven instant manufacturing





Elon Musk’s view of AI evolving beyond human well-being goals





Elon Musk’s vision of a future where ‘money becomes irrelevant’









Elon Musk has once again shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour. During a conversation on Nikhil Kamath’s People by WTF podcast, the Tesla and SpaceX chief suggested that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and robotics is pushing society towards a future where humans no longer need to work to survive. Musk’s view is rooted in the belief that machines will eventually handle all essential tasks, allowing people to approach work as a creative or recreational activity rather than an economic necessity.He expressed strong confidence that the world could reach this turning point within the next two decades. For Musk, this future is not a distant fantasy but a likely outcome of the accelerating technological breakthroughs unfolding today.Musk argued that the extraordinary pace of development in AI models, autonomous systems, and humanoid robots is already rapidly reshaping industries worldwide. According to him, the next phase of technological growth will create intelligent machines that can replicate or even surpass human capability in almost every domain, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare, education, and creative services.He believes that this massive transition may occur much sooner than most people expect, possibly within ten to fifteen years. Musk compared future labour to home gardening. Just as people may choose to grow vegetables for enjoyment rather than necessity, he thinks future generations will increasingly engage in work for personal fulfilment, creativity, or social contribution rather than mere survival. The essential work that maintains society will be managed entirely by advanced automated systems that require minimal or no human oversight.A core part of Musk’s argument is that AI systems will eventually be able to create anything a person can imagine. His own AI company, xAI, along with its chatbot Grok, reflects his belief that increasingly capable generative systems will expand into physical production through robotics, automation, and smart manufacturing techniques. As these technologies combine, they could enable a world where scarcity becomes obsolete and resource distribution becomes more equitable. Musk visualises a future in which goods and services can be produced instantly and efficiently.He emphasised that the ability to turn ideas into tangible products without traditional labour inputs would fundamentally reshape economies, social structures, and the global workforce. Once technology reaches this stage, he thinks most constraints on human consumption and lifestyle will disappear, creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation, creativity, and human progress.Musk also explored a lesser-discussed aspect of hyper-advanced AI. He suggested that there may come a time when AI and robotics complete every possible task aimed at improving human well-being. After satisfying all imaginable human desires and demands, these systems could reach a saturation point where they no longer have meaningful human-centred tasks to perform.At that stage, Musk believes AI may begin working on activities that serve its own optimisation because the catalogue of tasks that benefit humanity is finite. This idea raises profound questions about the long-term relationship between humans and intelligent machines once human needs are no longer the defining force behind technological activity. Musk’s predictions extend far beyond the automation of work. At the US Saudi Investment Forum earlier this month, he stated that humanoid robots and AI systems have the potential to eliminate poverty. His argument relies on the assumption that when machines can produce goods for virtually no cost and at limitless volume, wealth becomes universal because essential resources are accessible to everyone.If machines can meet all human needs, the traditional economic struggle for income, resources, and opportunity would disappear. Musk envisions a world where every person benefits equally from the capabilities of intelligent robots that can generate abundance without relying on human labour.In his discussion with Kamath, Musk introduced an even more radical idea. He predicted that money might eventually lose its relevance. In his view, money exists primarily as a tool for allocating labour and determining the value of goods that require human effort to produce. If production becomes entirely automated and unlimited, the need for money as a mechanism for distribution fades.Musk suggested that in such a world, the primary form of value might shift towards power generation. Energy would become the foundational currency because machines require it to operate, create and sustain the systems that support human life. The economy would therefore revolve around energy capacity rather than labour or manufactured goods.","Elon musk has shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour.

MPC meeting: RBI's three day monetary policy discussions begin today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mpc-meeting-rbis-three-day-monetary-policy-discussions-begin-today-another-repo-rate-cut-coming/articleshow/125732317.cms,"Another rate cut? Here's what experts say



The RBI’s three-day monetary policy committee meeting opens in Mumbai on Wednesday, marking the start of the central bank’s latest policy review. Over the course of the discussions, members of the six-member panel is set to hold discussions on how the central bank should navigate policy, in accordance with the newest growth and inflation readings.The meeting will be conducted from December 3 to 5 and the results of the monetary discussions will be announced by RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra at 10 AM on Friday.The review is taking place during a phase in which the economy is showing considerable resilience while prices are cooling at an unprecedented pace.As the Reserve Bank of India prepares to announce its decision this week, the latest economic data has presented a contrasting backdrop — rapid economic expansion on one hand, and historically low inflation on the other.India’s GDP expanded by 8.2% in the second quarter of FY26, a pace of growth that has encouraged expectations of stability in policy action. Economists say the momentum may have extended into the October–December period as well, supported by firm rural demand and improving urban consumption patterns.At the same time, inflation has fallen sharply. Consumer price inflation dropped to a series low of 0.25% in October, driven largely by a decline in food prices.Forecasts suggest this softness could persist and even settle below the Reserve Bank’s own earlier projections.Commenting on the conflicting economic signals, Mehul Pandya, MD and Group CEO of CareEdge Ratings, highlighted how they complicate rate decisions. ""Both these developments (of a continued strong GDP growth and multi-year low inflationary levels) are mutually opposing forces from an interest rate perspective. Central banks usually do not tend to cut interest rates during the periods of strong economic activity, represented by GDP growth. At the same time, the central banks usually respond to a low inflationary environment by cutting interest rates,"" ANI quoted Pandya as saying.Some industry voices believe the data now gives the central bank enough headroom to ease policy. Taking an optimistic view, Mayur Modi, Co-founder and Co-CEO of Moneyboxx Finance Limited, argued that robust growth has widened the RBI’s scope for action. He said, ""With inflation easing to multi-year lows and remaining comfortably within the RBI's tolerance band, the probability of a repo rate cut has strengthened meaningfully. Softening price pressures give the MPC more room to prioritise growth without risking macroeconomic stability."" Modi added that a well-timed reduction could help lift consumption cycles and stimulate credit demand across key segments.Despite growing speculation of a cut, an assessment by Bank of Baroda suggests that the central bank will keep the repo rate unchanged at 5.50% and maintain its neutral stance. The report pointed out that economic performance has continued to beat expectations, with urban spending and a resilient rural economy expected to sustain momentum into the third quarter. It also flagged signs of recovery in private investment, supported by a rise in credit demand.",The rbi’s three-day monetary policy committee meeting opens in mumbai on wednesday.
