Prime Minister Narendra Modi strongly raised issues like the need to shun double standards on terrorism, presence of Indian economic offenders in the UK and Khalistan extremism in his meeting with counterpart Keir Starmer, saying those who use democratic freedom to undermine democracy must be held accountable.Thanking Starmer for his strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack, Modi said that the two leaders were united in their view that there can be no place for double standards in the fight against terrorism.Modi also said that Indian and British agencies would work together for the extradition of economic offenders, in what was seen as a clear message to fugitives such as Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi and Sanjay Bhandari that government intends to get them back to face legal action in the country.Although government has got assistance, Mallya and Nirav Modi have been seeking to prolong their stay in the UK by using multiple forums for appeal.While the formalisation of India-UK free trade agreement was the highlight of Modi's visit to the UK, another significant takeaway was the launch of a Vision 2035 roadmap for boosting ties in areas like defence, technology, education, clean energy and people-to-people contacts.The leaders adopted a blueprint for defence industrial cooperation to promote, as the Indian government said, collaboration in co-design, co-development and co-production of defence products to meet the growing demand in both countries as well as for the world market.On the issue of Khalistan extremism, which he was expected to raise with Starmer, Modi said there was agreement between India and the UK that forces with extremist ideologies must not be allowed to misuse democratic freedoms. ""Those who misuse democratic freedoms to undermine democracy itself must be held to account,"" said the PM, in his joint press statement with the UK PM.""On the matter of extradition of economic offenders as well, our agencies will continue to work together in close coordination and cooperation,"" added Modi, who sought the UK's cooperation in bringing the fugitives to justice. India and the UK also reached an agreement between the CBI and the UK's National Crime Agency to jointly fight organised crime.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said that the leaders committed to strengthen the global fight against terrorism. ""While noting that extremism and radicalisation pose threat to both societies, they agreed to further enhance bilateral cooperation to deal with the menace,"" said the official.Modi said that Vision 2035 will serve as a roadmap for a strong, trusted, and ambitious partnership in the areas of technology, defence, climate, education, and people-to-people connectivity. ""It is our commitment that, from AI to critical minerals, semiconductors to cyber security, we shall create the future together,"" he said, while inviting Starmer to visit India soon. Starmer accepted the invitation. Amid concerns over the erratic US trade policies, both sides also sought to promote a fair, non-discriminatory and inclusive trading system.According to the roadmap, India and the UK reaffirmed their shared commitment to a rules-based international order and to strengthening multilateralism through meaningful reform. Importantly for India, the roadmap focuses on reform of the United Nations, including the security council, and other multilateral institutions such as the Commonwealth, WTO, WHO, IMF, and the World Bank, ensuring these bodies ""reflect contemporary global realities and are equipped to address emerging challenges"".","India, uk unveil road map to boost defence, tech, energy ties.

Jeju Air Crash: Pilots shut off wrong engine; probe finds clear evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/jeju-air-crash-pilots-shut-off-wrong-engine-probe-finds-clear-evidence/articleshow/122811341.cms,"



South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike, a source familiar with the probe said on Monday.The investigation, led by South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), has found that the left engine, which was less damaged, was shut off instead of the right engine, which had been more seriously affected by the bird strike.The source told Reuters that cockpit voice recordings, computer data, and a physical engine switch recovered from the wreckage support this conclusion.""The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so its finding will not change,"" the source said, speaking anonymously as the official report has not yet been released.The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operating a flight from Bangkok, crashed while attempting to land at Muan Airport on 29 December 2024. Of the 181 people on board, only two survived, making it the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.An examination of the recovered engines confirmed there were no defects before the bird strike and the crash, according to a government source.Investigators reportedly shared these findings with the victims' families during a private briefing on Saturday.A third source, who was present at the meeting, said the families were told the right engine had suffered greater damage, but the left, less-damaged, engine was shut down instead.The ARAIB has not officially commented on the findings. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, directed queries to ARAIB. Engine manufacturer CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France’s Safran, has not responded to requests for comment.Jeju Air said it is actively cooperating with the investigation and is awaiting the official release of the results.While a preliminary report issued in January confirmed the presence of duck remains in both engines, it did not specify the extent of damage. A scheduled media briefing on Saturday was cancelled after victims’ families objected to the report being made public, saying it unfairly focused on pilot error and failed to consider other factors.The Jeju Air flight overshot the runway during an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment. The collision caused a fire and a partial explosion, Reuters reported.Victims’ families and the pilots’ union have urged the investigation team to also examine the embankment’s role in the severity of the crash. Aviation experts believe the structure may have contributed to the high death toll.The pilots’ union has criticised ARAIB for “misleading the public” by suggesting there was no problem with the left engine, even though bird remains were found in both engines. The union accused the investigators of making the pilots scapegoats and not providing enough scientific evidence to prove the aircraft could have landed safely with just the left engine running.The union also said the investigation has so far failed to address possible organisational responsibility. A group representing the bereaved families added that the language in the planned press release made it appear as if a final conclusion had already been reached. They have called for all facts surrounding the crash to be fully examined and clarified.Under international aviation rules, a final accident report is expected within a year of the incident.","South korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the jeju air plane that crashed in december shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike.

The MMRCA Shock:

Plans, Plans, Plans…:

Made In India?

Engine Failure:

Are Drones The Solution?

October onwards, India will have just 29 fighter jet squadrons- Pakistan has 25. That’s near-parity, and a scary one, especially because Pakistan’s ‘iron brother’ China has 66 squadrons. A squadron typically has 18-20 fighter jets. In two months’ time, India will have 522 fighter jets. Pakistan has 450, and China, 1,200.Air chief A P Singh said India needs to induct at least 40 fighter jets every year. That, currently, looks worse than impossible.Some pundits say that unless India ups its game, more squadrons with old fighter jets, Mirage, Jaguar and other MiG variants, will be phased out, it will have the same number of fighter squadrons as Pakistan in less than 10 years. The proximate cause for this worry is IAF phasing out its last two MiG-21 squadrons. But the bigger reasons have been at play for years.The 2015 cancellation of the 126-jet Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft deal made a huge difference. The 36 Rafale jets India acquired through a govt-to-govt deal with France were nowhere near enough given IAF’s ageing fighter fleet. India has ordered 26 more Rafales, but for the Navy.There are plans to buy 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft. But nothing’s moved on this.The grand plan was that indigenous Tejas Light Combat Aircraft will maintain India’s air superiority over Pakistan. IAF currently has just about two squadrons, 38 fighters, of Tejas Mark-1. Delivery of the improved Tejas Mark-1A jets, 83 of which are supposed to be delivered by HAL, has blown through multiple production deadlines. Not even one is in service. This is in part thanks to massive delays in the delivery of GE’s F-404 engines, and partly because of so-far-unsolved issues with integrating Astra air-to-air missiles and fixing certain critical avionics.IAF hopes another 97 Tejas Mark-1A will come through, along with another 108 Tejas Mark-2 variant with the more powerful GE F-414 engine. The engine is to be co-produced in India with 80% transfer of technology. But it’s all on paper now.Then, there’s the proposed 5th generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft. The most that can be said about this is that it’s an idea.The key hurdle in Made in India programme is the inability to produce an indigenous jet engine. The old Kaveri engine development project failed to meet standards. Modern fighter jet engines are complex machines with thousands of parts that must withstand high pressure and temperatures. It requires billions of dollars to develop a fighter jet engine.Essentially, an engine has four parts- compressor, combustion chamber, turbine and nozzle.The hot part of the engine, combustion chamber and turbine blades, is tricky to get right, requiring advanced ceramics. But India’s talent depth in material science is shallow. Only a few thousand materials engineers graduate each year. India even struggles to manufacture basic stuff like ceramic-coated electrodes, required in the production of green hydrogen. These are imported. So, forget about fighter jet engines made here, at least in the near future.Many pundits reckon large military platforms like fighter jets and warships are becoming redundant, given the changing nature of warfare. Ukraine has done amazing things with drones in its war against Russian aggression, taking out Russian warships and fighter jets with UAVs that cost a fraction of the price of a jet.Ukraine will produce 4 million drones this year. India’s armed forces have talked about using many more drones. But there are two issues. Any domestic production will have to account for ever-evolving drone tech. And India needs a specialist corps to operate drones or specialist drone subunits.Those who challenge the drones-are-it strategy point out that India’s strategic security theatre is very different from Ukraine’s, and fighter jets provide a penetrative, offensive capability that drones can’t, at least not now.So, the reality that India and Pakistan are almost at parity when it comes to fighter jets is still scary.","In two months’ time, india will have 522 fighter jets.

"India develops personnel sphere, completes welding on submersible after 700 trials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-develops-personnel-sphere-completes-welding-on-submersible-after-700-trials/articleshow/122867246.cms,"MATSYA-6000

NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement for India’s Deep Ocean Mission, Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel MATSYA-6000, designed to carry humans up to 6,000 metres (6km) below the ocean surface, by completing a critical welding process after 700 weld trials.‘Samudrayaan', a project under the Deep Ocean Mission of the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), aims to strengthen India’s capabilities in deep-sea exploration. The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), under MoES, collaborated with Isro’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) to design and fabricate the spherical crew compartment. The Deep Ocean mission will allow scientists to explore unexplored deep-sea areas, assess mineral resources like nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements, and study marine biodiversity. The mission is expected to be realised by 2026.Central to the Samudrayaan effort is the creation of a human occupied vehicle (HOV) that can withstand extreme pressure and temperature conditions on the seafloor. “At the heart of the HOV is a titanium personnel sphere, a 2,260mm diameter enclosure with 80mm thick walls, made from a high-strength alloy. Designed by VSSC, the sphere is built to endure pressure up to 600 bar and temperatures as low as -3°C,” Isro said Wednesday.One of the biggest challenges scientists faced in creating this weld lay in the properties of titanium as a metal. While titanium is known for its strength, it can be difficult to weld. The technical challenge was developing a reliable electron beam welding process capable of fusing thick (80-102 mm) titanium plates. Isro’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Bengaluru, took charge of augmenting its welding facility from a 15kW to a 40kW EBW capacity.LPSC developed the process and infrastructure for the welding process and non-destructive evaluation (NDE). While LPSC had the expertise to carry out welding up to 20mm thickness, it augmented the EBW machine from a 15kW rating to 40kW, while also making alterations to the chemical cleaning and handling equipment to accommodate the increased size and mass.Over 700 weld trials were conducted to optimise the process parameters, ensuring high quality and structural integrity. For quality assurance, Isro enhanced its X-ray radiography capability, one of the highest energy levels used in India, allowing detailed non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of the welded joints.The breakthrough came with the successful completion of the first high-penetration weld on the actual sphere hardware. This involved 80mm thick welds over a 7,100mm length, achieved in a continuous 32-minute operation, “a national first in scale and precision” as per Isro.The milestone marks a significant leap for India’s underwater exploration ambitions and brings Matsya-6000 closer to sea trials. Once complete, the vehicle will be among the very few human submersibles in the world capable of reaching such depths, opening new frontiers for deep sea science, resource exploration and technology development.","Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel matsya-6000.

The unexplained 10 seconds



Poll Should flight crews undergo more rigorous training for emergency scenarios? Yes, definitely No, current training is adequate

NEW DELHI: The fatal crash of Air India Flight AI 171 has drawn intense attention to a brief but pivotal sequence in the cockpit—ten seconds that may explain how a routine takeoff ended in disaster. As investigators dig into the timeline, a Bloomberg report says that the unexplained actions and delays during this window are now central to understanding what went wrong with Boeing’s advanced 787 Dreamliner.On June 12, Flight AI 171 departed Ahmedabad for London with 242 people on board. Both pilots, senior captain Sumeet Sabharwal and junior co-pilot Clive Kunder, were cleared for duty and the aircraft’s initial climb appeared normal. But within seconds, a sudden loss of engine power set off a chain of events that the crew could not recover from, despite their efforts.• Just three seconds after takeoff, the 787 Dreamliner reached its maximum recorded airspeed.• Both engine fuel switches were inexplicably set to cutoff within a single second, shutting down fuel flow to the engines.• Confusion erupted in the cockpit, with each pilot denying responsibility for moving the fuel switches, according to Bloomberg’s reporting.• There was a 10-second delay before the first fuel switch was reset, and another four seconds before the second was restored.• The aircraft was too low and slow for the engines to be reignited in time to regain thrust.•The significance of the ensuing 10-second delay cannot be overstated. As retired FAA inspector Michael Daniel told Bloomberg, “The 10 seconds are crucial because the aircraft was simply too low and too slow to re-ignite the engines to gain thrust in order to climb.”• The sudden shutdown triggered a barrage of cockpit alarms, possibly causing a psychological “startle effect” and momentary freeze in pilot response.• Emergency systems like the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) provided minimal power, but only to the captain’s controls, forcing a rapid transfer of control from co-pilot to captain.• Despite resetting the switches, the crew ran out of time; a “Mayday” was sent, but the plane crashed just outside the airport, killing 260 people.The preliminary report, as cited by Bloomberg, has left investigators with more questions than answers. While Air India’s CEO said that fleet-wide safety checks found no anomalies, the focus remains on what happened inside the cockpit during those critical seconds. Human factors—including confusion, sensory overload, and psychological shock—are now under close scrutiny, as experts seek to determine whether these played a critical role in the delay that doomed the flight.","The fatal crash of air india flight ai 171 has drawn intense attention to a brief but pivotal sequence in the cockpit.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla is expected to announce the formation of a high-level inquiry committee to examine charges against Allahabad high court Judge Yashwant Varma, news agency PTI reported on Thursday quoting official sources.The move follows the submission of a notice signed by 152 Members of Parliament on July 21, calling for a probe into the grounds for Justice Varma’s potential removal. The notice, now deemed the ""property of the House,"" has triggered formal consultations to establish a three-member inquiry panel.According to the Judges (Inquiry) Act, such a committee must include either the Chief Justice of India or a Supreme Court judge, a Chief Justice of a high court, and a distinguished jurist. Sources confirmed that consultations are already underway, with Speaker Birla expected to write to the Chief Justice of India to recommend two of the committee members. The choice of the jurist, however, will rest solely with the Speaker.The Rajya Sabha is also involved in the process, as a similar notice signed by 63 opposition MPs was submitted to the Upper House on the same day. Consequently, coordination between both Houses has become crucial to the next steps.Since the submission of the notices, senior leaders including home minister Amit Shah, Rajya Sabha leader of the house JP Nadda, Speaker Birla, and deputy Chairman Harivansh, who is currently presiding over the Upper House following Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar’s resignation, have been in intense deliberations over the path ahead.Dhankhar, who had invoked the Judges (Inquiry) Act in the Rajya Sabha on Monday to clarify procedure, later resigned in a surprise move, citing health concerns.

Dhankhar resigns: Has the VP been asked to vacate his residence immediately? Govt clarifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhankhar-resigns-has-the-vp-been-asked-to-vacate-his-residence-immediately-govt-clarifies/articleshow/122872618.cms,"Poll Should the government provide more transparency regarding the reasons for Dhankhar's resignation? Yes, transparency is crucial. No, it's a private matter.

NEW DELHI: The government has dismissed social media rumours claiming that former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar has been asked to vacate his official residence immediately following his surprise resignation earlier this week.The Press Information Bureau (PIB) issued a public clarification, stating: “It is being widely claimed on social media that Vice President’s official residence has been sealed and former VP has been asked to vacate his residence immediately. These claims are Fake. Don’t fall for misinformation. Always verify news from official sources before sharing it,” the PIB Fact Check team posted on X.The clarification came as speculation mounted online over the circumstances surrounding Dhankhar’s abrupt resignation, nearly two years before his term was due to end in August 2027. While the official reason cited was health concerns, several opposition leaders have questioned the timing and suggested that the former vice president may have been pressured to step down.According to PTI, Dhankhar, 74, has begun packing and is preparing to move out of the Vice President’s Enclave, where he had been residing since April last year. Constructed under the Central Vista redevelopment plan, the Enclave is located on Church Road near the Parliament House complex.“He will be offered a Type VIII bungalow in Lutyens’ Delhi or another area,” an Urban Development Ministry official told PTI.As per protocol, former vice presidents are entitled to government accommodation, and the transition is being handled in accordance with standard procedures. The PIB reiterated that the residence has not been sealed and that the move is not sudden or forced.Congress President and Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, questioned the narrative, saying: “The government should answer why he resigned. I can see ‘dal mein kuch kaala hai’. His health is fine. He used to defend RSS and BJP always. Who and what is behind his resignation should be known to the country.”Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee went a step further, alleging Dhankhar was “forced” to resign by the Prime Minister and senior ministers and was “threatened” with impeachment.Meanwhile, the Election Commission has initiated the process for electing a new vice president. The electoral college comprises elected and nominated members of both Houses of Parliament. According to Article 68(2) of the Constitution, a new vice president must be elected “as soon as possible” after a vacancy arises. The NDA currently holds a comfortable majority in both Houses, giving it an edge in the upcoming election.",Jagdeep dhankhar resigned as vice president earlier this week.

NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday informed Parliament that 112 Air India pilots reported sick on June 16, in an aftermath of the AI-171 crash in Ahmedabad that claimed 260 lives.Minister of state for civil aviation Murlidhar Mohol told Lok Sabha that the airline saw a ""minor increase"" in sick leave across all fleets. The minister said that 51 commanders (P1) and 61 first officers (P2) called in sick on a single day after the deadly crash, news agency PTI reported.The June 12 crash involved a Boeing 787-8 aircraft bound for London Gatwick. It plummeted into a building shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing 241 passengers, 19 people on the ground, and leaving just one survivor. The catastrophe is one of India’s deadliest civil aviation accidents in recent history.In light of the tragedy, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has reiterated its 2023 circular advising airlines to implement customised mental health training for crew and to ensure access to Peer Support Programmes (PSP) - confidential, non-punitive systems designed to help flight crew cope with stress, anxiety, and trauma.In a separate written reply, the minister clarified that no specific compensation policy currently exists for civilian victims on the ground in plane crashes.Meanwhile, India on Wednesday virtually trashed a British media report, which claimed that two grieving families in the United Kingdom received wrong bodies of the victims of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad.Also read: Thai woman delivers baby at 30.000 ft on Muscat-Mumbai flight; Air India Express crew assists in labour The ministry of external affairs said all mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased.""We have seen the report and have been working closely with the UK side from the moment these concerns and issues were brought to our attention,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.""In the wake of the tragic crash, the concerned authorities had carried out identification of victims as per established protocols and technical requirements,"" he added.Jaiswal was responding to media queries regarding a report in the ""Daily Mail"" on the Air India crash ""All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, in no uncertain terms, reaffirmed India’s stand against expansionism, a veiled reference to Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific region.During the press briefing with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer after India and the UK signed the landmark free trade agreement (FTA), PM Modi said the ""demand of the present era is not expansionism, but developmentalism"".""We have continued to share views on peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and the situation in West Asia. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations is essential,"" PM Modi said.China’s aggression in the Indo-Pacific has become a central concern for regional and global powers alike. At the heart of the issue is Beijing’s growing assertiveness, both military and strategic, across vital waterways and territories.In the South China Sea, China claims nearly the entire region through a controversial “Nine-Dash Line,” despite a 2016 international tribunal ruling in favour of the Philippines that invalidated these claims.China has ignored the ruling and instead built artificial islands, turned them into military outposts with airstrips and missile systems, and has routinely blocked other nations like Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines from accessing their own waters.In the East China Sea, tensions persist with Japan over the Senkaku Islands (called Diaoyu by China), with frequent incursions by Chinese naval and air forces that risk sparking a direct confrontation.Similarly, across the Taiwan Strait, China continues to threaten the self-ruled island of Taiwan, viewing it as a breakaway province. Beijing regularly conducts large-scale military drills around Taiwan, sends fighter jets into its air defence zone, and attempts to isolate the island diplomatically, raising fears of a potential invasion.In the Indian Ocean, China is expanding its footprint through what many analysts call a “String of Pearls” strategy by building or financing ports and strategic infrastructure in countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan (Gwadar), and parts of East Africa.While these moves are presented as economic partnerships, they are viewed as attempts to encircle India and project power far beyond China’s shores. Beijing has also embraced an aggressive diplomatic posture, often referred to as “Wolf Warrior diplomacy”, where it lashes out at countries that challenge its positions, including Australia, India, and the Philippines.India, in response, has taken multiple steps to counterbalance China’s influence. It has deepened strategic ties with like-minded nations through the Quad alliance (India, US, Japan, and Australia), increased its participation in joint naval drills, and boosted maritime surveillance and infrastructure across the Indian Ocean Region.As the geopolitical contest heats up, the Indo-Pacific has emerged as the most critical arena in the ongoing power struggle between a rising China and countries that support a free, open, and rules-based order.","Pm modi said the ""demand of the present era is not expansionism, but developmentalism"" china’s aggression in the indo-pacific has become a central concern for regional and global powers alike.

NEW DELHI: The`tanks in the air’ for the Army are finally here. Three of the six long-delayed Apache AH-64 attack helicopters, contracted under the Rs 5,691 crore deal with the US in Feb 2020, arrived in India on Tuesday.The three Apache gunships were transported on board a gigantic Antonov-124 aircraft to the Hindon airbase, on the outskirts of New Delhi, at 10 am. The heavy-duty choppers will now be flown to Jodhpur, where the Army had raised an Apache squadron in March last year to cater for the western front with Pakistan.The next three Apaches, which are armed with Stinger air-to-air missiles, Hellfire Longbow air-to-ground missiles, guns and rockets, will be delivered by Nov, as earlier reported by TOI.“The arrival of the first batch of the Apache helicopters for the Army is a significant step towards strengthening India’s defence capabilities. These advanced helicopters will enhance the Army Aviation Corps’ operational effectiveness, especially in challenging terrains,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.The six Apaches for the Army, which were delayed due to supply chain problems faced by Boeing, will add to the 22 such choppers inducted by IAF under the Rs 13,952 crore deal with the US in Sept 2015.One of those choppers was badly damaged after a hard landing near Khardung La in Ladakh on April 4 last year.Also Read: India to tie-up with France for next-generation fighter jet engine?

UK pact comes amid tariff turmoil created by Trump

LONDON/NEW DELHI: More than three years after they began negotiations, and amid intense uncertainty in the global trade ecosystem, India and the UK finally signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which slashes duties on both sides. It also makes it more predictable for investors and business workers to get visas, and allows access for audit and accounting firms in the two countries as part of efforts to more than double bilateral trade from the current $56 billion by 2030.Consumers can look forward to cheaper British-made cars, cosmetics, medical devices and Scotch, as govt has agreed to slash average tariffs from 15% to 3%. The zero duty import list also includes silver - the largest item in the UK's export basket ($2.1 billion last fiscal). But all the changes won't happen overnight, with some duty cuts planned over 10 years, allowing Indian industry time to adjust.In return, govt got the UK to allow zero duty import on 99% of product lines. ""This is more than just an economic partnership; it is also a blueprint for shared prosperity. It paves the way for enhanced market access in the UK for Indian textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, seafood, and engineering goods. It will also unlock new opportunities for India's agricultural produce and processed food industry. Above all, this agreement will be especially beneficial for India's youth, farmers, fishermen, and the MSME sector,"" PM Modi said.Govt has, however, managed to keep several agricultural products such as oats, apples, edible oil and sensitive seeds, as well as dairy outside the ambit of tariff reduction.""We're living through a new and more dangerous global era... we believe building stronger partnerships is the best response... today we are confirming this approach in our new deal with India - the biggest and most economically significant trade deal for the UK since leaving the EU,"" said British PM Keir Starmer.The India-UK trade agreement, announced on May 6, but formalised at Chequers, the official country residence of British PM, came amid tariff turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's moves, prompting countries to not just rush to Washington to strike deals but also speed up negotiations on other treaties.India is ready to roll out treaty with European Free Trade Association, comprising Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, from Oct, while seeking to finalise the agreement with EU after 18 long years of talks. FTAs with New Zealand, Oman and several other countries are in the pipeline. But the CETA with the UK is unlikely to be implemented for at least a year as it requires British legislative approval.The pact with the UK, which was in the making for three-and-a-half years, required significant give-and-take, with India managing to keep a bilateral investment treaty out of the current deal, just as the UK did not agree to carve-outs on carbon tax for Indian products.India also claimed victory in getting a more predictable visa regime for business and professional visitors, but the bigger gain is in the form of a Double Contribution Convention, which will ensure that Indian workers in the UK for up to three years do not have to contribute to the National Insurance (NI) system there, while also seeing deductions towards Employees' Provident Fund Organisation. But it did offer some major concessions. Trade research body GTRI argued that govt's promise for ""adequate remuneration"" to patent holders when compulsory licensing provisions are invoked risks delays.In addition, govt opened an estimated 40,000 central contracts above a certain value to UK businesses, who would be granted local contractor status with 20% or more domestic content.","Tariffs eliminated on 99% indian exports to uk.

NEW DELHI: In a boost to India's military capabilities close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, the crucial Mudh airfield project in the high-altitude Nyoma area in eastern Ladakh is all set to be completed by Oct.The upgrade work by (BRO) at the airfield, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, included extending and strengthening the original airstrip into a 2.7km 'rigid pavement' runway with a dispersal area and turning pads, among other things.The Rs 230 crore upgrade will allow operations by all kinds of fixed-wing aircraft like heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. ""The runway, with 46m width, is fully ready. The allied infrastructure, including the ATC complex, hangar, crash bay, watch towers, accommodation and the likes, is also more or less complete,"" an official told TOI.""Nyoma will prove crucial as a forward staging ground for troops deployed in the region and transporting supplies quickly to them. The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026, though high altitude will be a limiting factor, much like what Chinese air force faces across LAC,"" he said.China, in fact, has systematically worked over the last five years to offset terrain constraints at its airbases facing India due to high altitude and rarefied air, which limits weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.With new and extended runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities, China has managed to deploy additional jets, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones, at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports along the 3,488km LAC, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.India is trying to play catch-up. Located about 35km from LAC, Nyoma will be another operational base for IAF in Ladakh after the Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground). Nyoma was reactivated as an ALG when a medium-lift AN-32 transport aircraft first landed there in Sept 2009. The upgrade project began during the military confrontation with China that erupted after the People's Liberation Army made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.In addition to strengthening the capacity of existing airbases to handle more aircraft, India has progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Fukche and DBO in Ladakh, as well as Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, civil ALGs in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh) of LAC are also now being increasingly used for military purposes.",Mudh airfield project in the high-altitude nyoma area in eastern ladakh is all set to be completed by oct.

American President Donald Trump on Tuesday night once again claimed credit for helping stop the recent India-Pakistan conflict and said that it was probably going to end up in a ""nuclear war"".""We stopped wars between India and Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda,"" Trump said at a reception in the White House.""They shot down five planes and it was back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. I called them and said, 'Listen, no more trade. If you do this, you're not going to be good…' They're both powerful nuclear nations and that would have happened, and who knows where that would have ended up.

""As the Modi Govt continues in its refusal to give firm dates for a debate on Pahalgam-Sindoor in Parliament and as the Modi Govt persists in its refusal to commit to a reply by the PM in the debate, President Trump reaches the silver jubilee, the quarter century mark on his claims.He has trumpeted 25 times in the last 73 days but the Prime Minister of India is totally quiet - finding time only to travel abroad and to destabilise democratic institutions at home,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.Earlier, an American diplomat told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that recent ""de-escalations"" between India and Pakistan were facilitated by the United States — a claim that echoes President Donald Trump’s repeated assertions of mediating a ceasefire between the two neighbours, though New Delhi has consistently denied any third-party role.""Across the globe, the United States continues to work with parties to disputes, wherever possible, to find peaceful solutions,"" acting US representative smbassador Dorothy Shea said at a UN Security Council open debate on ‘Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes’. The meeting was chaired by Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, as Pakistan holds the rotating presidency of the Council for July.Shea said, ""In the past three months alone, the US leadership has delivered de-escalations between Israel and Iran, between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and between India and Pakistan.""""The United States, under President Trump’s leadership, played an important role in encouraging the parties to reach these resolutions, which we applaud and support,"" she added.Meanwhile, India's permanent representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, said that India stopped the military operation at the request of Pakistan. ""On achieving its primary objectives, a cessation of military activities was directly concluded at the request of Pakistan,"" he said.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK in response to the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which killed 26 people. This led to four days of clashes between the two sides, which ended on May 10 after an understanding to stop further military actions.Since May 10, the Trump administration has repeatedly said that the US president ""helped settle"" the conflict between India and Pakistan. Trump has also claimed that he told both countries that the US would engage in ""a lot of trade"" with them if they stopped the conflict. However, New Delhi has consistently rejected these claims, saying that the decision to halt military action was made through bilateral channels, following a call initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) to his Indian counterpart.Last week, the US designated The Resistance Front as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. India welcomed the move.","Donald trump once again claimed credit for helping stop the recent india-pakistan conflict and said that it was probably going to end up in a ""nuclear war"" the congress questioned prime minister modi's silence on trump's repeated claims, saying he is finding time only to travel abroad and to destabilise democratic institutions at home.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122849349,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-null,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
