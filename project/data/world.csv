NEW DELHI: French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday reaffirmed the close and growing partnership between India and France during a meeting on the sidelines of the 2025 G20 Summit in Johannesburg.After the discussion, President Macron posted on X, saying, “Thank you, my friend, dear Narendra Modi. Nations are stronger when they move forward together. Long live the friendship between our countries!”PM Modi also hailed the relationship, writing, “Delighted to meet President Macron during the Johannesburg G20 Summit. We had an engaging exchange on different issues. India-France ties remain a force for global good!”Earlier, during the second session of the G20 Leaders’ Summit, PM Modi highlighted the rising frequency of natural disasters and their growing impact on populations across the world. He stressed the need for stronger international cooperation and noted that India had created the Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group during its 2023 G20 presidency. He also commended South Africa for prioritising the issue.“Natural disasters continue to pose a major challenge to humanity. This year as well, they have impacted a large portion of the global population. These events clearly highlight the need to strengthen international cooperation for effective disaster preparedness and response.To support this idea, India formed the Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group during its G20 Presidency. I also congratulate South Africa for giving priority to this important agenda,” he said.Calling for a shift from a “response-centric” to a “development-centric” approach to resilience building, PM Modi proposed a G20 Open Satellite Data Partnership to improve access to satellite data from G20 space agencies. He said the initiative would be particularly valuable for the Global South.",French president emmanuel macron and prime minister narendra modi reaffirmed the close and growing partnership between india and france during a meeting on the sidelines of the 2025 g20 summit in johannesburg.

At G20 Summit, PM Modi Proposes Global Knowledge, Skills, Health And Security Initiatives For Future

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Saturday proposed a G20 Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative, saying for global growth, sustainability and clean energy are essential, and critical minerals have a huge role to play.“Under this, innovations such as re-cycling, urban mining and second-life batteries can be promoted,” said Modi, addressing a G20 meeting in Johannesburg. This comes amid concerns China is leveraging its chokehold over supply of rare and critical minerals to further its strategic goals.“If there is investment in circularity, then dependence on primary mining will be less. This will also reduce the pressure on the supply chain, and it will also be good for nature. This initiative can support joint research, technology standards and pilot recycling facilities in the Global South,” Modi said.Resilience cannot be built in silos, stressed the PM. “The G20 should promote comprehensive strategies that combine nutrition, public health, sustainable agriculture, and disaster preparedness, to create a robust global defence,” he said. PM Modi also suggested a G20 open satellite data partnership saying India believes that the entire humanity should benefit from space technology.“This will make satellite data and analysis of space agencies of G20 countries more accessible, interoperable and usable for countries in the Global South,” he said.","Pm narendra modi saturday proposed a g20 critical minerals circularity initiative.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck Pakistan in the early hours of Friday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The agency said the quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.In a post on X, the NCS said, “EQ of M: 5.2, On: 21/11/2025 03:09:12 IST, Lat: 36.12 N, Long: 71.51 E, Depth: 135 Km, Location: Pakistan.” Officials said more information is awaited.The NCS also shared details of another recent tremor. On Thursday, a magnitude 3.9 earthquake struck Pakistan at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, making the region susceptible to aftershocks. The agency posted: “EQ of M: 3.9, On: 20/11/2025 17:19:20 IST, Lat: 35.02 N, Long: 71.63 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Earlier on November 10, an earthquake of magnitude 3.6 was recorded at 02:42 AM at a depth of 90 kilometres.

The region frequently experiences moderate to strong earthquakes, often felt across borders in Afghanistan and northern India.Multiple provinces lie close to major fault lines. Balochistan sits near the active boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan fall along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Punjab and Sindh are positioned on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, making large parts of the country vulnerable to frequent seismic activity.","An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck pakistan in the early hours of friday, according to the national centre for seismology.

What happened on 10/11

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said Pakistan ""knows it cannot defeat India in a direct fight"" and that with an explosion in Delhi, it attempted to ""assert its presence once again"".""Pakistan now knows that it cannot defeat India in a direct fight. Therefore, it tries to wage a proxy war, a pseudo-war, and with an explosion in Delhi, it attempts to assert its presence once again,"" the Maharashtra CM was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Condemning Pakistan-fomented terrorism, Fadnavis said India first identified the threat and conducted operations, as the terror outfits behind the Delhi blast intended to “detonate bombs in every corner of India”.""I am glad that today we have a changed India. India first sensed these things and conducted operations... their intentions were to detonate bombs in every corner of India, and many cities of our country, including Mumbai, were their targets. But when our Indian agencies sensed this and directly attacked them, they demonstrated their presence by carrying out an explosion in Delhi,"" Fadnavis said.The Centre, however, has not officially confirmed or denied Pakistan's role in the attack, and Union home minister Amit Shah has said that the probe is under way and every aspect is being thoroughly probed.Shah has said that no culprit behind the Delhi car blast will be spared and that perpetrators would be hunted down in ""pataal"" (netherworld).Fadnavis also said that had the previous government taken action like PM Modi-approved Operation Sindoor , the country would not have suffered terror attacks like Pahalgam, where 26 civilians were killed in Baisaran meadow.""The 9/11 attack was carried out on the Twin Towers to tell that America's might was in the Twin Towers. Therefore, by attacking the Twin Towers, America's sovereignty was challenged. Similarly, the Taj and Trident weren't just hotels. Mumbai, India's economic capital, was chosen to tell the world that we had attacked India. This attack was on India's sovereignty. This attack was a challenge to us. If we had understood that challenge and perhaps shown the courage of Operation Sindoor, no one would have dared to attack us today. But we didn't show that courage at that time,"" the Maharashtra CM said.Hailing PM Modi for approving cross-border military action against terrorism, Fadnavis said: ""After Pahalgam, the Prime Minister stated very clearly that terror and talks cannot coexist and gave our army a free hand. The Indian Army entered Pakistan and eliminated all targets. Pakistan was unable to do anything. In a way, the world witnessed India's strength and capability through Operation Sindoor, and today the world recognises that India is a transformed nation. India is a strong nation.""At least 15 people were killed and several others injured after a powerful explosion ripped through a Hyundai i20 car near the Lal Quila Metro Station on November 10.According to preliminary post-mortem findings, the victims sustained severe injuries, including multiple fractures and head trauma.The blast wave caused extensive internal damage, rupturing lungs, eardrums, and abdominal organs, while many victims showed deep wounds and heavy bleeding, suggesting they were thrown against hard surfaces by the force of the explosion.","Devendra fadnavis: pakistan ""knows it cannot defeat india in a direct fight"" he said terror outfits behind the delhi blast intended to “detonate bombs in every corner of india’ fadnavis also said that had the previous government taken action like pm modi-approved operation sindoor, the country would not have suffered terror attacks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125507425,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-53960,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The fatal crash of an Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet at the Dubai Air Show 2025 has prompted defence experts to raise the possibility of a “G-force blackout”, after visuals showed the aircraft abruptly losing height during a low-altitude manoeuvre before plunging to the ground. Wing Commander Naman Syal, who was piloting the aircraft, died in the incident.Defence expert Captain Anil Gaur (Retd.) said the nature of the crash suggested the pilot may have lost control during the manoeuvre or experienced a blackout linked to high gravitational forces. Speaking to ANI, he said, “It is sad that our Tejas jet was crashed during the Dubai air show and our brave pilot lost his life. From the visuals, it seems that the jet lost control during the acrobatics, or there might have been a pilot blackout. Blackout here means the excessive gravitational force.” He added that pilots wear G-suits to prevent blood from pooling in their legs, and only data retrieved from the cockpit would confirm what happened.The Indian Air Force said the aircraft went down during an aerial display on Friday, adding, “An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at the Dubai Air Show today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident.IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief.”A court of inquiry has been ordered.The Dubai Media Office said emergency teams “responded rapidly to the incident and are currently managing the situation on-site”.Also Read: IAF pilot dies as Tejas fighter crashes at Dubai air show Back in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district, the death of Wing Commander Syal has left his home village of Patiyalkar grief-stricken.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened the G20 Summit in Johannesburg by calling for a renewed push towards inclusive and sustainable growth, stressing that the moment demands fresh thinking and collective action.India also set out six major proposals for the summit: a Global Traditional Knowledge Repository, a G20–Africa Skills Multiplier Initiative, a Global Healthcare Response Team, a joint effort to counter the drug–terror nexus, a Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative, and an Open Satellite Data Partnership — aimed at strengthening health systems, expanding knowledge-sharing, improving resource security and confronting global threats.Speaking at the first session, which focused on inclusive and sustainable growth, he wrote on X that “NOW is the right moment for us to revisit our development parameters and focus on growth that is inclusive and sustainable,” adding that India’s civilisational values, particularly the principle of Integral Humanism, “offers a way forward.”PM Modi said he had put forward “a few actionables to realise our dream of all-round growth,” beginning with the creation of a G20 Global Traditional Knowledge Repository.He noted that India “has a rich history in this regard,” saying that such a platform would allow member nations to share inherited knowledge systems that support “good health and wellbeing.”He also highlighted Africa’s growing role in global governance, stressing, “Africa’s progress is vital for global progress,” and expressed pride that the African Union was made a permanent G20 member during India’s presidency. Taking this forward, he proposed a G20–Africa Skills Multiplier Initiative aimed at producing one million certified trainers in Africa over the next decade.On global health, PM Modi called for a G20 Global Healthcare Response Team to help countries respond quickly to emergencies. “We are stronger when we work together in the face of health emergencies and natural disasters,” he wrote, urging the creation of multinational teams of trained medical experts ready for rapid deployment.He also pushed for coordinated action against drug trafficking, warning of the spread of “extremely dangerous substances like fentanyl.” India, he said, was proposing a G20 Initiative on Countering the Drug–Terror Nexus, declaring, “Let us weaken the wretched drug-terror economy!”At the session, India proposed the G20 Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative to advance recycling, urban mining, and second-life batteries.PM Modi also proposed creating a G20 Open Satellite Data Partnership to make satellite data more accessible to countries of the Global South.PM Modi’s message came as he began a packed schedule in Johannesburg, where he received a warm welcome from the Indian diaspora with cultural performances showcasing folk traditions from 11 Indian states.Also Read: G20 Summit: Bloc breaks tradition, ignores US pressure in South Africa; sends clear message to Trump His visit also included meetings with tech entrepreneurs and winners of the Bharat Ko Janiye quiz, which he said “truly strengthens our diaspora’s connect with India.” He described a performance of the South African Girmitiya song—sung in both Bhojpuri and Tamil—as a “joyful and emotional experience,” saying it reflected the enduring cultural bond shared by the community.Ahead of the summit deliberations, PM Modi met Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to review cooperation in sectors including defence, nuclear energy, trade and education.","At g20 summit, pm modi proposes global knowledge, skills, health and security initiatives for future.

G20 Leaders’ Declaration: 'We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations'

PM Modi at G20 Summit





NEW DELHI: The G20 bloc in South Africa adopted a landmark declaration, unanimously agreed upon despite opposition and boycott by the United States.In a break from tradition, the world leaders adopted the joint declaration at the start of the summit as opposed to concluding day of discussions. The US boycotted the event due to a diplomatic rift with the host country.The 2025 G20 Leaders’ Declaration in Johannesburg under South Africa's presidency centres on climate ambition, debt relief and development justice, with a strong political message on multilateralism, terrorism and global conflicts. The document “unequivocally” condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, aligning with India’s long‑standing demand that there are no “good” and “bad” terrorists.Leaders reiterated support for an open, fair, inclusive and rules‑based multilateral trading system and call for reform of the WTO to make it more responsive to development concerns. It frames everything under South Africa’s theme of “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability”, with an explicitly pro–Global South tiltAccording to Reuters, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the US objected to the wording of the declaration.However, he emphasised that it could not be “renegotiated.” His remarks underscored growing tensions between Pretoria and Washington.In opening remarks to the summit, Ramaphosa acknowledged the ""overwhelming consensus and agreement for the declaration. He said, ""There's been overwhelming consensus and agreement that one of the other tasks we should undertake right at the beginning is to adopt our declaration.""Ramaphosa’s spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, noted that the declaration was adopted unusually early in the proceedings, a move driven by the strong support it received. ""Normally, the adoption of the declaration happens right at the end. But there was a sense that we should actually move to have the summit declaration adopted first as the first order of the day,” Magwenya said, according to AP.The South African officials also confirmed that Trump had put pressure on them not to adopt a leaders' declaration in his absence. ""We had the entire year of working towards this adoption, and the past week has been quite intense,"" the spokesperson said.The declaration statement highlights growing global instability driven by geopolitical rivalries, economic fragmentation, and widening inequalities. It stresses the importance of multilateral cooperation as essential to addressing shared global challenges.The declaration also reaffirms commitment to the UN Charter’s principles, calling on all states to avoid the use or threat of force against the sovereignty or territorial integrity of others. It urges nations to promote friendly relations, uphold human rights, and ensure equality irrespective of race, gender, language, or religion.Read Also : G20 Summit: PM Modi proposes 4 big initiatives; focus on healthcare, knowledge and war on drugs It also commits to working for a just and lasting peace in conflict zones such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and Ukraine, emphasising that global peace is fundamental to achieving sustainable development and prosperity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a three-day visit to South Africa to attend the G20 summit. He spoke at the summit about inclusive and sustainable growth. In a post on X, he highlighted the need to revisit the development parameters.""Spoke at the first session of the G20 Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, which focused on inclusive and sustainable growth,"" the Prime Minister wrote, ""Now is the right moment for us to revisit our development parameters and focus on growth that is inclusive and sustainable. India’s civilisational values, especially the principle of Integral Humanism, offer a way forward.""He has also held talks with the world leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.US President Donald Trump is boycotting the event as the agenda for the meeting that focuses on climate action and energy transition does not align with the US policy.The inclusion of the term “climate change” was widely seen as a subtle rebuke to President Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary driver of global warming. For many observers, the language in the declaration underscored a deliberate effort by participating nations to reaffirm their commitment to climate science despite past US scepticism.","The g20 bloc in south africa adopted a landmark declaration, unanimously agreed upon despite opposition and boycott by the united states.

'This Is How Democracy Should Work': Shashi Tharoor's Truth Bomb on Cong After Trump-Mamdani Meeting

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday fired a fresh salvo at Congress questioning whether Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi would “get the message” after Congress MP Shashi Tharoor praised a display of political cooperation in the US.Reacting to a post showing US President Donald Trump meeting newly elected New York City Mayor and one of his fiercest critics Zohran Mamdani at the White House, Tharoor remarked about respecting the voters' will and working towards the better interest of the nation.The Congress leader posted on X, “This is how democracy should work. Fight passionately for your point of view in elections, with no rhetorical holds barred. But once it’s over, & the people have spoken, learn to cooperate with each other in the common interests of the nation you are both pledged to serve. I would love to see more of this in India — and am trying to do my part.”The remark, framed as a broader appeal for post-election cooperation, quickly drew a pointed response from BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala.Tagging Tharoor’s post, he wrote, “Once again Shashi Tharoor reminds Congress to put India First not Parivar. To behave democratically and not like sore losers. But will Rahul Gandhi get the message? One more Fatwa loading against Shashi???”This isn’t the first time Tharoor has given ammunition to the BJP to take a swipe at Congress, recently his comments praising PM Modi for his speech at an event drew flak from his fellow party leaders.With former MP Sandeep Dikshit asking ""why are you in Congress"" and even terming him a ""hypocrite"".Also Read: Now, BJP uses Indira peace prize as ammo to target Congress The Thiruvananthapuram MP is known for making unsettling comments for his party.

NEW DELHI: An Air Force Tejas fighter jet crashed during an aerobatic display at the Dubai Airshow on Friday, killing the pilot, Wing Commander Namansh Syal. The single-engine Tejas Mark-1 plunged straight into the ground during a low-altitude demonstration, erupting into flames and scattering debris across the venue.The aircraft reportedly failed to recover from a negative-G turn before crashing at around 2.10pm local time at Al Maktoum International Airport.Before the show began, a video now widely circulated online captured the ill-fated pilot interacting with defence officials.

IAF pilot dies as Tejas fighter crashes at Dubai air show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-pilot-dies-as-tejas-fighter-crashes-at-dubai-air-show/articleshow/125496211.cms,"Also read |

Bravery In The Sky: The Story Of Namansh Syal, Tejas Pilot Who Died During The Dubai Airshow Display

Since its 1st squadron was raised in 2016, Tejas has had an excellent safety record

.

In a major blow to India's much-delayed project for indigenous fighters as well as their export potential, a single-engine Tejas jet crashed during a demonstration at the Dubai Airshow on Friday afternoon. The IAF pilot, Wing Commander Namansh Syal, died in the accident.The Tejas Mark-1 fighter was on a low-altitude aerobatic demonstration sortie when it couldn't recover from a ""negative G-turn"" and plummeted to the ground, exploding in a ball of fire in front of a large audience at the Al Maktoum International Airport at 2.10 pm, local time.Wing Commander Syal was from Kangra in Himachal Pradesh and was posted at TN's Sulur IAF station. His wife is a retired wing commander. The couple has a daughter, who is seven years old.This is the second crash of the lightweight multi-role Tejas, manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics and powered by American GE-F404 turbofan engine, since it was inducted into the IAF 10 years ago.In the first crash near Jaisalmer on March 12 last year, the pilot had managed to eject safely. The jet was returning from the Bharat Shakti military exercise at Pokhran.Wing Commander Syal, an experienced fighter pilot, was not so lucky. He could not eject in time before the jet slammed into the ground.The pilot sustained fatal injuries,"" an officer said. The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry (CoI) to ascertain the exact reason behind the crash after coordinating with Dubai aviation authorities and recovering the ""black box"" of the ill-fated fighter. ""It's very difficult to say what led to the crash at this moment. It could be a sudden loss of power or control malfunction at a critical juncture,"" said a veteran fighter pilot, who did not want to be named.""Pilots can also suffer spatial disorientation during negative G-turns when they push the controls forward to make their planes dive, though they are trained to manage and mitigate negative G forces,"" he added.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said he was ""deeply anguished at the loss of a brave and courageous IAF pilot"", adding the nation stands firmly with the bereaved family in this tragic hour. Military aviation is inherently dangerous, with fighters being pushed to their limits through extensive combat manoeuvres and low-level flying and diving missions.The 13.5-tonne Tejas so far has had an excellent safety track-record since its first squadron '45 Flying Daggers' was raised with only two jets at Sulur in July 2016 despite its torturous development saga and excruciating delays. Over the last few years, India has been deploying the fourth-generation Tejas Mark-1 jets for airshows in Dubai, Singapore and other places to showcase its ""superior handling characteristics and manoeuvrability"" through low-level aerobatics to an international audience in a bid to win export orders.IAF, however, has inducted only 38 Tejas Mark-1 fighters, with the second squadron '18 Flying Bullets' deployed at Naliya, of the 40 ordered for Rs 8,802 crore in the 2006-10 timeframe. ""Three Tejas jets were sent for the Dubai air show for the No 45 and 18 squadrons,"" another officer said. IAF has also ordered 180 'improved' Tejas Mark-1A jets for over Rs 1.1 lakh crore, with the latest Rs 66,500 crore deal for 97 jets being inked in Sept this year. The force, however, is yet to begin getting Tejas Mark- 1A deliveries due to huge delays in supply of engines from the US as well as pending weapons trials.The trials involve Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs and their integration with Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system.","The tejas mark-1 fighter was on a low-altitude aerobatic demonstration sortie when it couldn't recover from a ""negative g-turn"" the pilot, wing commander namansh syal, died in the accident. This is the second crash of the lightweight multi-role tejas since it was inducted into the iaf 10 years ago.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125496558,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1655084,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

DEHRADUN: In a significant show of combat readiness, Indian Army 's Western Command carried out a month-long integrated ground and air drill involving over 20,000 personnel, simulating offensive operations across the Pakistan border in Punjab.The exercise, which was first of its kind held in Uttarakhand by the Army, concluded near Haridwar on Saturday and was held in terrain mimicking the riverside plains of Punjab.The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command. Though the location operationally falls under Central Command, army officials said it was chosen due to geographical similarities with the Punjab sector. The exercise included fighter jets, reconnaissance aircraft, Apache attack helicopters, amphibious armoured vehicles, tanks, drone-based surveillance, and night-time paratrooper deployment.General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command, Lieutenant General Manoj Kumar Katiyar, who inspected and validated the final phase of the drill, said it focused on rehearsing responses to major provocations by Pakistan.""In the recent Operation Sindoor, we delivered a robust response, which resulted in extensive damage to Pakistani forces. But we doubt whether it has learnt any lesson. If there is another mischief by it, we are prepared to respond with far greater force, including entering Pakistan from Punjab,"" he said. He added that the location was selected as it allowed simulation of riverine obstacles similar to those found in Punjab. ""We conduct exercises in operational areas under other commands too to ensure readiness,"" he said.A senior Army officer involved in the exercise told TOI, requesting anonymity, that the drill tested operational agility, multi-domain capabilities and real-time coordination across land, air and cyber domains.Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retired), former deputy director general of military operations during the Kargil war, told TOI the drill was vital to test preparedness for the Punjab sector.""Pakistan has constructed numerous canals in Punjab to act as barriers against our armoured and mechanised units.

At G20 Summit, PM Modi Proposes Global Knowledge, Skills, Health And Security Initiatives For Future

PM Modi lauds South Africa’s presidency

In his address at the G20 summit in Johannesburg on Saturday, PM Narendra Modi pitched for sustainable and inclusive growth and made four proposals, including a coordinated global effort to combat the drug-terror nexus, calling drug trafficking a threat to public health, stability and security and a source of terror financing.He pushed for reconsidering the parameters of growth, saying the existing framework has left a vast section of the population deprived of resources and led to overexploitation of nature.Modi, who was instrumental in getting the African Union as a permanent member of G20 at the New Delhi meet of the grouping two years ago, emphasised the continent has suffered the most because of skewed growth priorities. “Today, as Africa hosts G20 Summit for the first time, it is imperative for us to reconsider the parameters of development.”The PM mentioned “integral humanism”, an idea associated with BJP’s ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay, as a path forward. “We will have to look at the individual, society and nature as an integrated whole. Only then can we achieve true harmony between progress and nature,” he said.He proposed creation of a global traditional knowledge repository built on Indian knowledge systems’ initiative, saying this can preserve the collective wisdom of humanity for future generationsBatting for a global healthcare response team to bring together experts from G20 countries, he said it will ensure swift measures in case of health emergencies and natural disasters.The speech was marked by an unabashed advocacy of what Modi called India’s civilisational ethos. India’s civilisational values, he said, can offer ways to reevaluate development parameters.Focusing on Africa, PM said the continent can benefit from skills transfer. He said Africa’s development and empowerment of its young talent are in the interests of the entire world and proposed a ‘G20-Africa Skills Multiplier Initiative’. This can operate under a “train-the-trainers” model across various sectors, and all G20 partners can finance and support this effort, he added.“Our collective goal will be to prepare one million certified trainers in Africa over the next decade. These trainers will, in turn, help equip millions of young people with skills. This initiative will have a powerful multiplier effect. It will strengthen local capacity and significantly contribute to Africa’s long-term development.”Turning his attention to drug trafficking, PM Modi singled out the “rapid spread of highly lethal substances like fentanyl”. “This has emerged as a serious challenge to public health, social stability and global security. It also serves as a significant channel for financing terrorism,” he said.A G20 initiative to counter this global threat can bring together various instruments relating to finance, governance and security. Only then can the drug-terror economy be effectively weakened, he said. Modi lauded South Africa’s presidency for making commendable progress on key areas such as skilled migration, tourism, food security, AI, digital economy, innovation and women’s empowerment, noting that historic initiatives undertaken at the New Delhi G20 Summit have been carried forwardPM Modi on Saturday also proposed a G20 Critical Minerals Circularity Initiative, saying that for global growth, sustainability and clean energy are essential, and critical minerals have a huge role to play.“Under this, innovations such as re-cycling, urban mining and second-life batteries can be promoted,” said PM Modi. This comes amid concerns China is leveraging its chokehold over supply of rare and critical minerals to further its strategic goals.“If there is investment in circularity, then dependence on primary mining will be less. This will also reduce the pressure on the supply chain, and it will also be good for nature. This initiative can support joint research, technology standards and pilot recycling facilities in the Global South,” PM Modi said.Resilience cannot be built in silos, stressed the PM. “The G20 should promote comprehensive strategies that combine nutrition, public health, sustainable agriculture, and disaster preparedness, to create a robust global defence,” he said.PM Modi suggested a G20 open satellite data partnership saying India believes that the entire humanity should benefit from space technology. “This will make satellite data and analysis of space agencies of G20 countries more accessible, interoperable and usable for countries in the Global South,” he said.","Pm narendra modi pitched for sustainable and inclusive growth at the g20 summit.

AICC spokesperson Supriya Shrinate also said that she did not find find any reason to praise the PM's speech.On Nov 9, Congress had ""dissociated"" itself from Tharoor's statement praising veteran BJP leader L K Advani and made it clear that ""like always he speaks for himself and the fact that he continues to do so as a CWC member reflects the party's democratic and liberal spirit"".Congress's remarks had come after Tharoor, reacting to criticism over his birthday greetings for Advani, said reducing the veteran BJP leader's long years of service to one episode, however significant, is unfair.
