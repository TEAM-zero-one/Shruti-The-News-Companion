NEW DELHI: A month before the retirement of MiG-21s, which were the first supersonic fighters to be inducted by India from Russia in 1963 but plagued by an alarmingly high crash rate in later years, the IAF chief and other officers flew sorties in the single-engine jet as a final farewell to the old workhorse.“It’s an amazing aircraft to fly, very agile and manoeuvrable…It will be missed by all who flew it,” Air Chief Marshal A P Singh said after the MiG-21 sorties at Nal airbase. “But everything has a time and place.

PMO Office In Huddle Ahead Of Trump Tariff Dead, Big Announcements Likely To Counter U.S. Onslaught

WASHINGTON, DC: US President Donald Trump, during a bilateral meeting with the President of the Republic of Korea, said he was proud of having prevented multiple conflicts, including one between India and Pakistan that he claimed was close to turning nuclear.""I stopped 7 wars that were raging... including India and Pakistan that was probably two weeks away from being a nuclear war. They were shooting down airplanes all over the place. I am very proud of that..."" Trump said.Linking his approach to conflict prevention, President Trump said he used tariffs and trade measures to stop wars, claiming that several conflicts were avoided during his presidency.""Of the 7 wars I stopped, 4 were because I had tariffs and trade, and I was able to say, 'If you go fight and want to kill everybody, that is okay, but I am going to charge you each a 100% tariff when you trade with us.' They all gave up..."" Trump said.He added, ""We are taking trillions of dollars in tariffs and stopping wars due to tariffs... Other countries did it to us and now we are doing it to other countries.""Trump's remarks came as US Vice President JD Vance defended the imposition of secondary sanctions and tariffs on India, calling them part of Washington's strategy to apply ""aggressive economic leverage"" against Russia over the war in Ukraine.Speaking to NBC News' Meet the Press, Vance said the Trump administration is making it harder for Moscow to profit from its oil economy through measures that include tariffs on India.""I think this question betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of where we are. The President has applied aggressive economic leverage, for example, the secondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy. He has tried to make it clear that Russia can be reintegrated into the world economy if it stops the killing, but they are going to continue to be isolated if it doesn't,"" Vance said.On Secretary Marco Rubio's doubts that sanctions would force Russian President Vladimir Putin into a ceasefire, Vance said sanctions remain an option.""Sanctions are not off the table, but we are going to make these determinations on a case-by-case basis. What we do think is actually going to exert the right kind of leverage to bring the Russians to the table? You said sanctions were not going to lead to a ceasefire, I think that's obviously correct. If we look at the way Russians have concluded themselves, they don't want a ceasefire. They don't want to cease for complicated reasons,"" he said.Vance said the US still has ""a lot of cards left to play"" and stressed that the Trump administration has already applied more economic pressure on Moscow than previous governments.Responding to criticism that Washington has not imposed similar measures on China, the largest buyer of Russian oil, Vance said, ""We have 54 per cent tariff on PRC right now, so we have already applied pretty hefty sanctions on the Chinese and we have had a number of conversations at all levels of government to try to encourage the Chinese to be better partners in bringing this war to a close.""Vance also suggested that the US could reduce tariffs on some countries if progress is made with Russia, or increase them further if needed.""We are applying aggressive economic pressure to bring this war to a close. Maybe we will apply additional pressure, or maybe we feel like we are making progress, and we will dial that pressure back,"" he said.On Russia-Ukraine negotiations and guarantees for Ukraine, the Vice President underlined Washington's commitments.""It is providing the Ukrainians the kind of security guarantees that ensure the country is not going to be invaded again. This is why I think we have made a lot of progress, even though we are not there yet,"" Vance said.Highlighting US diplomatic efforts, he added, ""We are trying to negotiate as much as we can with both the Russians and the Ukrainians to find a middle ground to stop the killing. I think what the President has tried to do here is try to engage in very aggressive, very energetic diplomacy because this war is not in anyone's interest. It's not in Europe's or the United States' interest. We don't think it's in Russia's or Ukraine's interest to keep going, so we're going to keep on pushing for a diplomatic solution.

AHMEDABAD: Just two days ahead of the Aug 27 deadline for US President Donald Trump's proposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods, PM Narendra Modi on Monday underlined the challenge of ""self-centred economic policies"" and called on citizens and businesses to embrace Swadeshi - urging them to buy and sell only 'Made in India' products to make the country self-reliant and developed.""I am asking our shopkeepers and traders. Do not sell foreign goods. This will provide a huge boost to the Make in India movement,"" the PM said, adding that he would not cave in to pressure.The pitch for Swadeshi came at a time of uncertainty over whether Trump would Wednesday carry out his threat to slap an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, with many considering the remark about “self-centered economic policies” to be a reference to Washington’s switch to extractive mercantilism.Modi avoided mentioning names but made plain his intent not to succumb to pressure, emphasising that the interests of farmers and small businesses was paramount. “For Modi, the interests of farmers, cattle-rearers and small-scale industries are paramount. Pressure on us may increase, but we will bear it all,” the PM affirmed. He hit out at Congress, saying the party which ruled India for 60-65 years, made the nation dependent on other countries in order to indulge in “import scams”.Seeking to promote Swadeshi, he said : “Festivals are coming... From the land of revered Bapu Mahatma Gandhi, I am repeatedly urging countrymen to make it their life mantra — whatever we buy will be Made in India, it will be Swadeshi. Whatever items are for home decoration, let them be Made in India. If you want to give a gift to friends, let it be a gift made in India, made by the people of India,” urged Modi, addressing a public meeting in east Ahmedabad.PM laid foundation stones and unveiled projects worth Rs 5,477 crore for Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Mehsana districts in Gujarat.",Pm narendra modi calls on citizens and businesses to embrace swadeshi.

The riots erupted after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984, by her Sikh bodyguards in retaliation for Operation Blue Star , a military action earlier that year to remove militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar.Following her death, mobs, often armed with voter lists and political backing, targeted Sikhs in Delhi and several other cities. Over 3,000 Sikhs were brutally killed, their homes and businesses looted or burned, and many women faced horrific violence. Eyewitness accounts and later investigations indicated the role of Congress leaders in instigating and organising the violence, while the state machinery largely failed to act.The riots left deep scars on India’s social fabric, fostering alienation among Sikhs and fueling militancy in Punjab. Justice for victims has been slow, with many cases dragging on for decades.Rajiv Gandhi, who was sworn in as Prime Minister soon after Indira Gandhi’s assassination, made a controversial remark about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots during a rally at the Boat Club in New Delhi on 19 November 1984, Indira Gandhi’s birth anniversary. He said, “When a big tree falls, the earth shakes.”The statement was widely interpreted as an attempt to justify or downplay the violence against Sikhs, though Congress later maintained he was speaking metaphorically about the impact of his mother’s death on the nation.",Haryana chief minister nayab singh saini announced that family members of those who were killed in the 1984 anti-sikh riots would be given appropriate jobs in the state government. 121 people from the state were killed during the riots.

Those monsters who killed the innocent people, husband in front of wife and father before son,"" Chouhan said.Speaking at the 12th convocation ceremony of the Bhopal-based Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) on Monday, Chouhan also dismissed claims of any foreign nation’s role in ending the hostility between the two countries.""When they thought that Bharat would reach their nuclear base, they knelt, and came to talk with folded hands,"" he said.Referring to repeated claims made by US President Donald Trump, Chouhan remarked, ""They are saying 'I did it, I did it'.""India launched Operation Sindoor in May this year following the killing of 26 people by terrorists at Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir on April 22.""We went for the pinpointed target hitting if you all remember. We demolished the terrorists' refuge. We did not attack their Army or civilian (base) first.This is Bharat,"" he added.Chouhan said that when Pakistan used missiles and drones for its attack, India responded with Brahmos, Agni and Prithvi missiles, dismantling all of Pakistan’s air bases.""Bharat runs on Bharat's strength. We don't attack any individual. We don't spare terrorists,"" the senior BJP leader said.Chouhan added that the families of the Pahalgam attack victims had demanded the terrorists be shot in the head. ""The terrorists have been eliminated,"" he said.Union home minister Amit Shah had also said earlier that the families of the victims and others had wanted the three terrorists to be shot in their heads and that they met the same fate in Operation Mahadev.Shah further said that investigations revealed the identity of the three terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev, clearly establishing that the Pahalgam attack was carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba, as all three belonged to the group.",Shivraj singh chouhan said pakistan was forced to kneel and seek talks with folded hands.

Capital-clampdown: Donald Trump hints ‘maybe we like a dictator’ while tightening federal crackdown in Washington; clarifies he’s not a one,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/capital-clampdown-donald-trump-hints-maybe-we-like-a-dictator-while-tightening-federal-crackdown-in-washington-clarifies-hes-not-a-one/articleshow/123514323.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump on Monday defended his unprecedented federal takeover of policing in Washington, DC, while suggesting that some Americans may even welcome authoritarian leadership.“They say ‘we don’t need him. Freedom, freedom. He’s a dictator. He’s a dictator.’ A lot of people are saying, ‘Maybe we like a dictator,’” Trump told reporters during a wide-ranging 80-minute Oval Office event, as reported by news agency AFP.He immediately added, “I don’t like a dictator. I’m not a dictator. I’m a man with great common sense and a smart person.”The comments came as Trump signed a series of executive orders to escalate his clampdown on crime and immigration in the capital. One directive orders the attorney general to prosecute flag-burning, despite a 1989 Supreme Court ruling protecting it as free speech. “If you burn a flag you get one year in jail, no early exits, no nothing,” Trump declared.He also instructed defence secretary Pete Hegseth to create a special National Guard unit in Washington for public order and announced the end of cashless bail, while vowing to rename the Pentagon’s department the “Department of War.”“Defense is too defensive,” he argued.According to Forbes, Trump said he may replicate the model in other Democratic-run cities, specifically naming Chicago and Baltimore. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker branded him “a wannabe dictator” who wants to use troops to “punish his dissidents and score political points.”Chicago’s Mayor Brandon Johnson warned that the president’s proposal would mark “the most flagrant violation of our Constitution of the 21st Century.”Around 2,000 National Guard troops are already deployed in Washington, with some authorised to carry firearms, even though violent crime in the city has fallen to a 30-year low.Civil rights advocates have also criticised the removal of homeless encampments under the new crackdown.Democrats, including Senator Ed Markey and California Governor Gavin Newsom, have accused Trump of militarising US cities for political gain. “It’s what dictators do,” Markey posted on X, while Newsom called the Los Angeles deployment “the start of an authoritarian takeover.”Despite mounting criticism, Trump dismissed detractors as “sick” and doubled down on his strongman style. He even repeated his admiration for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, telling reporters, “I get along great with him.”","Us president donald trump defended his unprecedented federal takeover of policing in washington, dc.

US President Donald Trump has claimed that the United States holds overwhelming leverage over China, even suggesting that if he chose to use it, he could “destroy” the world’s second-largest economy.Speaking in the Oval Office on Monday before a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, Trump insisted Washington’s position was stronger than Beijing’s in the ongoing trade dispute. “They have some cards. We have incredible cards,” he told reporters.“But I don’t want to play those cards. If I did, that would destroy China. I’m not going to play those cards.” The US president did not clarify whether he was referring to economic, political, or strategic tools, reported Fox News.Trump added that he had spoken recently with Chinese President Xi Jinping and was considering a trip to Beijing. “At some point, probably during this year or shortly thereafter, we'll go to China,” he said, noting that Xi had extended an invitation.The remarks came as Washington and Beijing agreed on 12 August to prolong their trade truce for another 90 days to give negotiators more time to find common ground. Tariff battles have escalated over the past year, with Trump raising duties on Chinese goods several times.The highest duty peaked at 145% in April, while most Chinese imports are currently subject to a 30% tariff.China has responded with a 10% levy on US imports, according to Fox News.Adding to the strain, Trump singled out China’s rare earths policy, warning that unless Beijing supplied the US with magnets, “we have to charge them 200% tariff or something”, according to news agency Reuters.China tightened export restrictions on rare earth items in April as part of its retaliation.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has previously described China’s oil trade with sanctioned states as another sticking point. As per Fox News, he identified Beijing’s imports of Iranian and Russian oil during negotiations in Sweden, calling it a central dispute.Washington argues that revenue from such exports helps Tehran and Moscow fund destabilising activities.Bessent has also pushed for Beijing to reduce reliance on exports and open itself up as a stronger importer in global trade, while the US aims to limit China’s dominance as the world’s manufacturing hub.","Us president donald trump has claimed that the united states holds overwhelming leverage over china.

Magic Johnson reacts after Washington Commanders confirm Terry McLaurin deal

Terry McLaurin signs extension after tense Washington Commanders offseason

The city of Washington is buzzing with sports excitement once again. A huge development has brought new energy to the NFL team and sparked celebrations among fans. What makes the moment even more special is the reaction of NBA legend Magic Johnson, now a proud co-owner of the Washington Commanders. His words, shared on social media, turned a routine announcement into a headline moment that no one wanted to miss.On Monday, August 26, NBA legend Earvin “Magic” Johnson, now 66 years old, went public with his reaction after the Washington Commanders made a headline announcement. Johnson, who became a co-owner of the Commanders in 2023, took to his official X account to share his thoughts.He wrote: “I’m thrilled that we re-signed Terry McLaurin! Job well done by my partner Josh Harris and GM Adam Peters. This is great news for Commander players, our organization and all Commander fans! Terry is more than just a great football player; he is an outstanding leader and does tremendous things in the DMV community.”The message came just hours after ESPN’s Adam Schefter confirmed that the Commanders had reached a deal with star wide receiver Terry McLaurin. The three-year extension, worth up to $96 million, put an end to weeks of uncertainty around the player’s future.Fans quickly pointed out a slip in Johnson’s wording, noting that “re-signed” appeared as “resigned.” The playful confusion spread across social media, but the core message remained clear - Johnson was proud of the move and thrilled for the team.The deal itself was confirmed earlier on August 26, when Terry McLaurin’s agents, Buddy Baker and Tony Bonagura, finalized the extension. McLaurin, who had been holding out during training camp, finally ended his standoff with the front office just days before the Commanders face the New York Giants in their Week 1 game.The 28-year-old wideout admitted in July that the long wait had taken a toll. Speaking at the time, he said:“I’ve been pretty frustrated, not gonna lie. Everything that has transpired up until this point has been disappointing and frustrating. I want to continue my career here, I’ve created my life here, my wife and I have bought our first home here, so this is somewhere I’ve always wanted to be.”Pushing into the NFC Championship Game for the first time in over 30 years, he had 82 receptions for 1,096 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2023: the highest single-season performance of his career.This only gives more energy for both the Commanders and McLaurin to go forward. For Johnson, who has already invested in multiple sports teams across Los Angeles, this moment showed how strongly he values building a winning culture in Washington.","Washington commanders announce terry mclaurin has signed a three-year deal worth up to $96 million.
