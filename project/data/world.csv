How do you see the political and economic ties between India and the Netherlands in the context of what’s happening in the rest of the world?

How do you see the

India EU FTA

strengthening this relationship with the Netherlands and India?

Do you see the Netherlands emerging as a major destination for Indian students?

Which are the sectors where cooperation can begin in the near future?

How do you see the situation in Europe in the context of the Ukraine war? Do you expect the war to end soon and what are the implications for the region?

n Ties have always been strong, for example in field of water and agriculture, but also the large companies of the Netherlands that have always been active here in India, like Philips. The recent geopolitical developments give an extra impetus to the importance of our ties. That’s what my visit was also about to see how in specific areas we can do more. We now have a letter of intent in the field of security and defence where we’re looking at more intensive cooperation. We also signed an MoU in the field of semiconductors and modern technologies. We are very like minded countries, we are democracies, we are countries that believe in the international rule of law in free trade and those countries need to stick together.n It’s not easy to have a FTA with the EU because you have 27 completely different countries with different economies and different interests. It is in all of our interest to reach an agreement with India on an FTA soon for same reasons I mentioned earlier. We believe in same values, same norms. We are all democracies and we have a lot to offer to each other.n Already there are many Indian students in the Netherlands, and not only students, but also technical students that after their studies found work, in one of our high tech companies like ASML.I heard that there were around 10 cricket clubs now around Eindhoven. That’s testimony to the great relationship that we already have in that field. We also have a very large Indian diaspora in the Netherlands . We are a society where Indians feel at home, where they thrive and contribute to our economy and society.n In the field of semiconductors, I visited one of the Dutch companies here, which is called NXP, which is a spin off of Philips and they do design and production of high end mobility chips. They already design most of its high end chips here in India. This company is providing over 3,000 jobs here in India working on the high end of the semiconductor industry. We want to invest more in R&D together, we want to put more effort in talent development. There’s a big wish on the Indian side to also have more in the production facilities of semiconductors. There’s a broader basis that we already can build on with regards to semiconductors.n We all want this war to end soon. It’s been going on for almost four years at an incredible cost for Ukraine, but also for Russia. We all hope that we will soon reach a ceasefire and hopefully a durable peace agreement. That’s why Europe is actively engaging in the negotiations that are now ongoing, led by the US and where we see that Ukraine is willing to come to the table and reach a deal and an agreement, and we hope that Moscow will do so too.","Ties have always been strong, for example in field of water and agriculture.

NEW DELHI: India has proposed an assistance package worth $450 million for the purpose of rebuilding cyclone-hit Sri Lanka. It will include $350 million in concessional lines of credit and $100 million of grants, announced external affairs minister S Jaishankar who is visiting the Indian Ocean neighbour as a special envoy of PM Narendra Modi.Earlier in the day, Jaishankar called on Lankan President Anura Kumara Disanayake to discuss damage caused by Cyclone Ditwah and delivered a letter to him from PM Modi. “The letter from PM Modi that I handed over builds on our first responder role and commits a reconstruction package of $450 million to Sri Lanka. Our talks centred around how expeditiously this commitment can be delivered,” said the minister.He said the assistance will cover the sectors worst affected by the cyclone — including rehabilitation and restoration of road, railway and bridge connectivity; support for construction of houses, health, education systems, and agriculture; and better disaster response.“We are conscious that work towards mitigating the impact of Cyclone Ditwah on people of Sri Lanka must be done in the quickest time possible. We are discussing an effective coordination mechanism for earliest possible delivery,” said Jaishankar, while promising support also to boost FDI and tourism from India.Jaishankar recalled that India’s relief and assistance mission — Operation Sagar Bandhu — commenced on the day Cyclone Ditwah made landfall.“Overall, Operation Sagar Bandhu delivered over 1,100 tonnes of relief material, including dry rations, tents, tarpaulins, hygiene kits, essential clothing and water purification kits. About 14.5 tonnes of medicines and medical equipment were also provided. Yet another 60 tonnes of equipment were brought to Sri Lanka to assist relief operations,” he said.",India has proposed an assistance package worth $450 million for the purpose of rebuilding cyclone-hit sri lanka.

Sheikh Hasina Slams Yunus Over Violence In Bangladesh, Calls Out 'Hostile Statements Against India'

Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina reacted to the death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi, accusing the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of presiding over “lawlessness” and claiming the violence reflects a breakdown of governance that has worsened since her ouster.In an email interview with ANI, Hasina said the killing of the youth leader underscored a growing culture of violence under the interim administration, warning that the situation was destabilising Bangladesh internally and straining ties with neighbouring countries, particularly India.“This tragic killing reflects the lawlessness that uprooted my government and has multiplied under Yunus. Violence has become the norm while the interim government either denies it or is powerless to stop it. Such incidents destabilise Bangladesh internally but also our relationships with neighbours who are watching with justified alarm. India sees the chaos, the persecution of minorities, and the erosion of everything we built together. When you cannot maintain basic order within your borders, your credibility on the international stage collapses. This is the reality of Yunus's Bangladesh,” Hasina said.Her remarks came after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader associated with Bangladesh’s 2024 “July uprising” and spokesperson of the political platform Inqilab Mancho.Hadi was shot at close range by unidentified assailants while travelling in a rickshaw in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area on December 12. He sustained a critical gunshot injury to the head and was initially treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital before being shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition worsened.He was later airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment and admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit at Singapore General Hospital.Inqilab Mancho announced Hadi’s death in a social media post, stating that he had fought for his life for six days, according to Bangladesh news outlet Daily Star. An aspiring independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency, Hadi emerged as a prominent political figure following last year’s uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina’s removal from office.Hasina also expressed serious concern over the killing of a Hindu youth amid the unrest, linking the incident to what she described as the interim government’s failure to protect minorities and maintain basic law and order.Referring to the lynching of 27-year-old Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh district, the former PM held the Yunus-led administration responsible. Das was allegedly beaten to death by a mob over accusations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire, triggering nationwide outrage.Hasina said such incidents were contributing to diplomatic strain, particularly with India and accused the interim government of allowing extremists to dictate both domestic and foreign policy.“The strain you are witnessing is entirely of Yunus's making. His government issues hostile statements against India, fails to protect religious minorities, and allows extremists to dictate foreign policy, then expresses surprise when tensions rise. India has been Bangladesh's most steadfast friend and partner for decades. The ties between our nations are deep and fundamental; they will outlast any temporary government,” she said.She further claimed that anti-India hostility was being deliberately fuelled by radical elements emboldened under the current dispensation, pointing to attacks on diplomatic facilities, media houses and minority communities.“This hostility is being manufactured by extremists who have been emboldened by the Yunus regime. These are the same actors who marched on the Indian embassy and attacked our media offices, who attack minorities with impunity, and who forced my family and me to flee for our lives. A responsible government would protect diplomatic missions and prosecute those who threaten them. Instead, Yunus grants immunity to hooligans and calls them warriors,” Hasina alleged.Sheikh Hasina also warned of what she described as the growing influence of radical Islamist forces, claiming the interim government had released convicted terrorists and allowed extremist-linked groups to enter public life, raising alarms about Bangladesh’s secular foundations.""I share this concern, as do the millions of Bangladeshis who prefer the safe, secular state we once were. Yunus has placed extremists in cabinet positions, released convicted terrorists from prison, and allowed groups linked to international terrorist organisations to take roles in public life. He is not a politician and has no experience governing a complex nation. My fear is that radicals are using him to project an acceptable face to the international community while they systematically radicalise our institutions from within,"" Hasina said.Separately, Hasina criticised the interim government’s approach to Pakistan, arguing that major foreign policy shifts were being pursued without democratic legitimacy.She said that Bangladesh had long adhered to a balanced diplomatic principle but accused Yunus of moving hastily to reorient ties after alienating traditional allies.“Bangladesh has always believed in friendship to all, malice toward none. Of course it makes sense for our country to have a stable relationship with Pakistan, but Yunus’ headlong embrace is inappropriate. Having needlessly alienated many of our longstanding allies, he now seems desperate to find a friend on the world stage,” Hasina said.She further stressed that the interim administration lacked the mandate to undertake strategic realignments that could have long-term consequences.“The crucial point is this: Yunus has no mandate to realign Bangladesh's foreign policy. He was not elected, so he has no right to make strategic decisions that could impact generations. Once Bangladeshis can vote freely again, our foreign policy will return to serving our national interests, not the ideological fantasies of extremists who have temporarily seized power. The ties between Bangladesh and India are fundamental and will endure long after this interim government is gone,” she added.",Sheikh hasina slams interim government over death of sharif osman hadi.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh on Monday suspended all consular and visa services at its high commission in New Delhi, a day after its foreign affairs adviser said Dhaka was considering “scaling back” its presence there, citing a protest held outside the mission over the lynching of a Hindu man in Bangladesh.“Due to unavoidable circumstances, all consular and visa services at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi have been temporarily suspended until further notice. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted,” a notice pasted outside the mission said.The move comes days after India temporarily shut its visa application centre in Chattogram until further notice, following protest by scores of demonstrators outside the Assistant High Commission of India in the port city, the neighbouring country’s second-largest.Though New Delhi–Dhaka ties have been tense since the August 2024 ouster of Bangladesh’s then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a student-led movement, the latest tensions were triggered by the fatal shooting of youth politician Sharif Osman Hadi, with a section of Bangladesh’s political class blaming India.Hasina, meanwhile, has been living in New Delhi since being forced to resign and flee.In a press release on Sunday, Bangladesh’s foreign ministry described the protest outside its high commission the previous day as “regrettable,” adding that the incident cannot be dismissed as “misleading propaganda”—a phrase used by the Ministry of External Affairs in a statement rejecting the way Bangladeshi media portrayed the demonstration.Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s Prothom Alo reported that the country’s visa centre in Siliguri, West Bengal, was “vandalised” during a protest over the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das, the Hindu man who was attacked by a mob accusing him of blasphemy.According to the report, a five-member delegation from the roughly 300 demonstrators entered the visa office and told the staff to keep it closed as a “form of protest.”A decision on reopening the facility will be made after the situation is ""closely monitored.""","Bangladesh suspends consular and visa services at its high commission in new delhi.

(With inputs from agencies)

Ties between India and Bangladesh have hit another roadblock after the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka sparked anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year’s July uprising in Bangladesh, was killed amid rising political tensions, triggering widespread unrest. Bangladesh government suspended visa services in India following protests outside Bangladeshi missions.Protests also erupted in Bangladesh following the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu man lynched in Mymensingh. Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a demonstration outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday. Protesters described the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.Speakers said Dipu Das, a factory worker recently promoted for his dedication, was falsely accused of religious defamation before being brutally killed.India, meanwhile, has raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions, and what it describes as misleading narratives emerging from Bangladesh.Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.Yunus used the call to reiterate his pledge to hold general elections on February 12, saying the country was “eagerly waiting” to reclaim voting rights allegedly denied under the previous regime.Sharing the details of the conversation, US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said during the call Gor discussed the ""recent events"" in Bangladesh.""Today, Special Envoy for SCA Ambassador Sergio Gor held a productive call with Chief Advisor Yunus @ChiefAdviserGoB to discuss recent events in Bangladesh and shared US interests to advance prosperity through trade,"" US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs wrote on X.Amid mounting protests, Bangladesh suspended visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi and missions in Tripura and Siliguri, citing unavoidable circumstances. The decision followed demonstrations outside Bangladeshi diplomatic premises, while India had earlier suspended visa services at its Chittagong mission after protesters attempted to storm the compound.Yunus insisted the interim government remained committed to delivering a “free, fair and peaceful” election within roughly 50 days, describing the vote as an opportunity to restore democratic legitimacy. At the same time, he warned that supporters of the ousted Awami League regime were allegedly spending millions to disrupt the electoral process, with a fugitive leader inciting violence from abroad.Inqilab Moncho, the platform Hadi led, issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding justice, warning that failure to act would trigger a mass movement to oust the interim government. The group demanded a speedy trial tribunal, involvement of international agencies like the FBI and Scotland Yard, and accountability from home and law advisers. Its leaders accused intelligence agencies of failing to identify perpetrators and alleged Awami collaborators were embedded within security structures.Concerns deepened after another leader of the student-led uprising, Motaleb Shikder, was shot in the head in Khulna days after Hadi’s death. Police launched a manhunt but said they remained unclear about the motive or perpetrators. The attack reinforced fears that a coordinated campaign of violence was targeting figures linked to last year’s protests. With multiple leaders injured or killed, questions grew over whether the interim government could guarantee safety during the election period.Earlier on Wednesday, India had summoned Bangladesh’s envoy and expressed strong concern over extremist elements threatening diplomatic missions and minority communities. On December 21, the ministry of external affairs rejected what it called false narratives suggesting security breaches at Bangladesh’s High Commission in Delhi, insisting protests were brief and controlled. New Delhi urged Dhaka to bring perpetrators of the lynching of Hindu man Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained vigilant over minority safety.Bangladesh’s interim government said that it may review the scale of its diplomatic presence in New Delhi if the situation continues to worsen. Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain's remarks came hours after India dismissed Bangladeshi media reports on protests outside the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”.“Regarding the Indian press note, we completely reject it, entirely reject it. The issue has been presented as if it were very simple, whereas in reality it is not,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted Hossain as saying at the media briefing.From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed Yunus entirely for Bangladesh’s instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities, and undermining relations with India. She warned that lawlessness under Yunus had damaged Bangladesh’s credibility and endangered regional stability. Hasina claimed radical groups were exploiting Yunus to reshape foreign policy without a mandate, insisting that ties with India would normalise only after legitimate governance was restored. Her remarks added a powerful external voice to an already volatile political landscape.The assassination of Sharif Osman Hadi, shot at close range in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area and later dying in Singapore, became the catalyst for widespread protests. A key figure in the 'July uprising' that toppled Sheikh Hasina, Hadi’s death sparked anger among supporters who accused the state of inaction. Demonstrations erupted across Dhaka, with calls for accountability growing louder as Yunus declared a national day of mourning. The killing also fuelled fears that political violence was returning just weeks before a pivotal election.The unrest soon spread to Bangladesh’s media houses, with violent mobs attacking the offices of Prothom Alo, The Daily Star, and other outlets in Dhaka. Prothom Alo was forced to halt print publication for the first time in its 27-year history. Yunus condemned the attacks, calling them assaults on truth and press freedom, and pledged full justice. Authorities later said 31 suspects had been identified through video footage, with several arrests made, but the damage to Bangladesh’s democratic image was already significant.","Muhammad yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with us special envoy for south and central asia sergio gor.

‘Not Misleading Propaganda’: Bangladesh Responds To India Over Delhi High Commission Protest

Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], December 23 (ANI): The Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) on Monday wrote to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , seeking urgent intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of Indian medical students currently studying in Bangladesh amid ongoing protests, tensions, and incidents of violence, particularly in Dhaka and surrounding regions.In the letter addressed to the Prime Minister, the Association urged him to intervene to ensure the safety and protection of Indian medical students in view of the prevailing unrest and uncertain conditions in Bangladesh.National Convenor of the Association, Nasir Khuehami, said that there are around 9,000 Indian students pursuing medical education in various colleges across Bangladesh, among them over 4,000 students from the Kashmir Valley.Khuehami said, ""We have been told by students studying in Dhaka that they have been advised to hide their identity for their own safety, which is deeply disturbing and unacceptable for young Indians who have gone abroad solely to pursue education."" He added that the reported ""death and lynching of a student leader has further shocked and alarmed the entire student community and their families back home,"" underlining the gravity of the situation and the potential risks faced by Indian students on the ground.Highlighting the plight of students, the Association said, ""Many students are confined to hostels and accommodations, facing restrictions on movement, lack of clarity, and fear of being caught in violence. Parents in India are living in constant anxiety, unsure about the safety of their children. The prevailing conditions are unsafe and uncertain, and students feel vulnerable and stranded.""Khuehami said the Association has been receiving distress calls and messages from students and their families, who are extremely anxious about the rapidly deteriorating situation and the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty prevailing there.Urging immediate action, Khuehami said, ""We urge the Prime Minister to kindly intervene to ensure the immediate safety and protection of Indian medical students in Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: Protest erupted across multiple cities including outside the Bangladesh high commission in Delhi, to condemn the mob lynching of Dipu Chandra Das, a Hindu worker in Bangladesh.In Delhi outside Dhaka's mission visuals showed Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) protesters clashing with security forces, attempting to march towards the building. They broke through police barricades but were stopped by multi-layered security cordons comprising police and paramilitary staff.Security was beefed up around the commission in the national capital following the protest call by the VHP.Tensions escalated when a massive crowd of demonstrators pushed the security barricades. Protestors were chanting ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"", ""Yunus Sarkar Hosh me Aao"", and ""Hindu Hatiya Band Karo,"" reported ANI.Also read: India-Bangladesh ties sour; US dials Yunus; Dhaka suspends visa services – 10 key points Members of the Sarbo Bharatiya Hindi Bangali Sangathan, VHP, and Bajrang Dal also held a protest near the Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus Metro Station, raising slogans about Bangladesh's Hindus and their security.Meanwhile, Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, Pranay Verma was summoned to Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs, reported Prothom Alo.One protester sobbingly said, “Hindus are being killed there.

The move came days after India temporarily halted visa operations at its Chittagong mission following an attempt by protesters to breach the compound.Earlier on Wednesday, India summoned Bangladesh’s envoy and conveyed strong concerns over threats by extremist elements to diplomatic mission and minority communities. On December 21, the ministry of external affairs rejected what it described as false narratives of security lapses at Bangladesh’s High Commission in Delhi, maintaining that the protests were brief and effectively managed. New Delhi also urged Dhaka to ensure justice in the lynching of Hindu man Dipu Chandra Das.Bangladesh’s interim government indicated that it could reassess the scale of its diplomatic presence in India if the situation deteriorates further. The remarks by foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain came shortly after India dismissed reports in sections of Bangladeshi media on protests outside the High Commission in Delhi as “misleading propaganda”.“Regarding the Indian press note, we completely reject it, entirely reject it. The issue has been presented as if it were very simple, whereas in reality it is not,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted Hossain as saying at a media briefing.Hadi, a prominent organiser of last year’s 'July Uprising,' was shot at close range and later died while receiving treatment abroad.

NEW DELHI: Robert Vadra on Tuesday joined chorus after Congress MP Imran Masood pushed Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra 's name as the party's face for the prime minister’s post.Responding to the remarks, Priyanka Gandhi’s husband, Robert Vadra told news agency IANS, ""There are demands from everywhere that Priyanka should come forward.

RAIPUR/NEW DELHI: Vinod Kumar Shukla, who created a universe of quiet grace from the small histories and inner worlds of ordinary people in his novels and poems, and who became the first Jnanpith awardee from Chhattisgarh last year - passed away Tuesday. He was 88.The renowned Hindi writer was undergoing treatment for a lung ailment in the Chhattisgarh capital since Dec 2 and was on ventilator support since Dec 19. His body had weakened but his resolve to write remained unswerving.""He carried a writing pad, even inside the ICU. In the hospital, he wrote his last poem. Probably inspired by what he had observed around him,"" his son Shashwat told TOI.His last poem, penned in an infirm hand from his hospital bed on Dec 6, went: ""Batti maine pehle bujhayee / Phir tumne bujhayee / Phir dono ne mil kar bujhayee (I turned out the light first / then you did / then we turned it off together).""In a conversation with PM Modi some weeks back, he had said, ""Writing is like breathing for me. I want to return home as soon as possible - I want to keep writing.""PM condoled the writer's passing in a post on X, ""He will always be remembered for his invaluable contribution to the world of literature.""Shukla wrote sparingly, but deeply. He wrote in a tone that never needed to raise itself. His prose moved gently like the wind, his poetry like breath.His writing did not insist; it illuminated. And it traversed the vacant space between remembering and forgetting.""Forgetting is my nature. I forget, again and again. Since forgetting is my nature, so is remembering. If I forget, I also remember. Forgetting is a form of leaving behind. Remembering is trying to bring it back,"" he told actor Manav Kaul in director Achal Mishra's documentary on his life, 'Chaar Phool Hain Aur Duniya Hai' (2024).Naukar Ki Kameez (The servant's shirt, 1979) was his most celebrated work. The novel was adapted by renowned filmmaker Mani Kaul into a feature film in 1999. ""Initial sales were slow. But after 2020, it became a best-seller,"" says Satyanand Nirupam, editor, Rajkamal Prakashan. A Facebook Live presentation by him was watched by a high 18,000 viewers during the 2020 Covid lockdown.""In 2025, it sold 10,000 copies, a huge number for a book released five decades ago,"" says Nirupam. Some months back, there was even an unpleasant online controversy over the royalty he had earned.Shukla was born in Rajnandgaon, now part of west Chhattisgarh. A post-graduate in krishi vigyan (agriculture science) from Jabalpur, his first poetry collection, Lagbhag Jai Hind (Almost Jai Hind) was published in 1971.As a writer, Shukla never carried the baggage of literary politics. Perhaps a reason why fame trickled to him, like water dripping from a tap in a desert town. He received the Sahitya Akademi award in 1999 for his novel, Deewar Mein Ek Khidki Rehti Thi (A window lived in the wall). Khilega To Dekhenge (Will see when it blooms) was another feted work.In 2023, he became the first Indian to receive the PEN/Nabokov Award. ""Writing for decades without the recognition he deserves, Shukla has created literature that changes how we understand the modern,"" the PEN/Nabokov judges panel said.Sahitya Akademi recipient writer Mridula Garg says that Shukla was truly one of a kind. ""Articulate but not verbose, simple but not simplistic, real but not realistic, individualistic but not self-centered. Equally empathetic to individual and social desires and ills,"" she says.Another Sahitya Akademi awardee Anamika poetically puts it that in Shukla's poems and novels ""we meet a lonely man full of empathy and grace, a man of the community, a man like the Christ on cross in Rembrandt's painting, a man who belongs - his bones hanging, skin sagging, the pain of inner struggle writ large on his face.""Senior journalist Sunil Kumar, who was associated with Shukla for decades, said, ""He was the most prominent Hindi writer of significance in the last half a century, but his feet remained solidly on the ground. Shukla ji was a man of unique simplicity, in language, life, and values, all. He had a strange ability to remain aloof from praise or criticism, success or failures.""When asked for his reaction on receiving the Jnanpith, India's most prestigious literary award, Shukla had said, ""Mujhe likhna bahut tha, lehin bahut kam likh paya,"" (I had a lot to write, but could write very little."" Following his demise, every reader too enchanted by his world of writing has been left wanting for more.","The renowned hindi writer was undergoing treatment for a lung ailment in the chhattisgarh capital since dec 2.

This even as India reopened its visa centres in Khulna, Rajshahi and Sylhet, keeping ""humanitarian needs in mind"", especially of those applying for medical visas, and despite the security threat to its diplomatic facilities.Bangladesh's move came a day after it claimed that protests near its high commission left the ""high commissioner and his family feeling threatened"".

Zero Tariff Access For Indian Exports As Modi Govt Seals Landmark Free Trade Deal With New Zealand

NEW DELHI: The India-New Zealand FTA ran into some political opposition in Wellington as the right-wing New Zealand First (NZF), a member of the ruling coalition, opposed the deal, calling it neither free nor fair. NZF leader Winston Peters, who is also the foreign minister of New Zealand, said his party would vote against the enabling legislation as and when it's introduced.""Regrettably, this is a bad deal for New Zealand. It gives too much away, especially on immigration, and does not get enough in return for New Zealanders, including on dairy,"" said Peters.However, the opposition Labour Party was reported to have indicated support for the legislation when it's introduced in Parliament. According to Peters, while New Zealand is completely opening its market to Indian products under the deal, India is not reducing the significant tariff barriers currently in place for New Zealand's major dairy products. ""The India FTA would be New Zealand's first trade deal to exclude our major dairy products -- including milk, cheese and butter.

Our intelligence agencies, ED and CBI, have been weaponised. ED and CBI have zero cases against the BJP, and most of the political cases are against the people who oppose them.

We will create a system of opposition resistance that will succeed.

China dominates production today, which means that it is difficult to give employment to a large number of people. Countries like India, the US and Germany cannot give their employment based on services. How do democracies produce in this transition? What are the models that are required, how do you think about production in a democratic environment, and what are the types of partnerships that India, the US and Europe can create for production? It will become very difficult for democracy to sustain itself if we are not able to produce,"" he said.""A huge part of the turbulence that we are seeing in Europe, India and the US, polarisation of politics, is because we are not able to give our people jobs, which is because we said: China, you produce for the world,"" he added.Rahul Gandhi is on a five-day visit to Germany.His remarks come after he had claimed that manufacturing in India is declining.During his visit to the BMW World museum in Munich, Germany, on December 17, he said, ""Manufacturing is the backbone of strong economies.

NEW DELHI: Seeing the consequences of a duopoly in Indian skies earlier this month when IndiGo schedule collapsed, the aviation ministry has stepped up its efforts to ensure Indian flyers have more choices when it comes to airlines. It has issued no objection certificates to two proposed airlines this week.“Over the last one week, met teams from new airlines aspiring to take wings in Indian skies—Shankh Air, Al Hind Air and FlyExpress. While Shankh Air has already got the NOC from Ministry, Al Hind Air and FlyExpress have received their NOCs in this week. It has been endeavour of the ministry to encourage more airlines in Indian aviation which is amongst the fastest growing aviation markets in the world owing to the policies of Modi government. Schemes like UDAN, has enabled smaller carriers Star Air, India One Air, Fly91 etc to play an important role in the regional connectivity within the country and there is more scope for further growth,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said on X Tuesday.The aviation industry wants the govt to take a close look at factors that have led to India having among the highest operating cost for airlines globally, essentially high jet fuel prices and taxes.“In Indian aviation ecosystem, almost all stakeholders — barring airlines — make money. That’s why we keep seeing airlines regularly collapsing over the last three decades or even more. A new airline can be floated but the same remaining airborne due to several factors like high cost structure, taxes, lack of management bandwidth and thin funding is a big challenge,” said an old timer.To be sure airline collapses are a global phenomenon and not limited to India. The additional worrying factor here is the cost-hostile environment for airlines. “Flying is no longer a luxury and the dream that it remain in the reach of the common man makes it mandatory to have cost and tax rationalisation,” said a senior airline official.",The aviation ministry has stepped up its efforts to ensure indian flyers have more choices when it comes to airlines. It has issued no objection certificates to two proposed airlines this week. The aviation industry wants the govt to take a close look at factors that have led to india having among the highest operating cost for airlines.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126144851,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-837232,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Authorities and first responders described the incident as a possible gas explosion.“We understand that there are people trapped inside,” said Ruth Miller, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, according to The Associated Press.Emergency crews responded immediately to the facility, working to evacuate residents and search for those who may have gone missing. Video footage on social media showed police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks with flashing lights at the scene, while flames and black smoke poured from the building. Windows were blown out, and part of the roof collapsed.The Upper Makefield Township police department called the explosion a “mass casualty incident” and urged residents to avoid the area due to the large emergency response, reports the Independent.Lieutenant Sean Cosgrove of Bristol Township police told Levittown Now that residents were evacuated by emergency crews, staff, and even bystanders.

'Get yourself Green Card': Indian-origin CEO's long-term advice for H-1Bs stuck in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/get-yourself-green-card-indian-origin-ceos-long-term-advice-for-h-1bs-stuck-in-india/articleshow/126143747.cms,"JD Vance Insults India Over H1B Visa?

H-1B visa appointments canceled en masse

'Get out of H-1B quagmire'





Indian-origin CEO Vijay Thirumalai commented on the present H-1B situation as thousands of Indians got stuck in India as they traveled to their home country to get their visas stamped only to be informed that their appointments have been deferred by a minimum fo six months. As they are stranded in India without knowing if they will be allowed to work from India remotely, many people on social media mocked on how Indians can be stranded in India.Thirumalai said the mocking is brutal as he knows what people are going through with their visa appointments getting delayed all of a sudden. The delay was triggered by the State Department's social media vetting process that started from December 15.""People who mock the concept of being stranded, have no idea what is going thru. They have their homes, their jobs, kids school and their entire lives back in US, what was supposed to be a 2 week trip is now stretching to 3-4 months and maybe more, god knows, how long. It is brutal,"" the Indian-origin CEO noted.The consulates in India rescheduled hundreds of appointments leaving candidates amid unprecedented uncertainty.As social media vetting in which visa officers are checking the social media profiles of applicants is taking a longer time, the consulates reduced the number of visa appointments per day. December appointments have been pushed after March; January dates have been deferred to November. Those who are still in the US can defer their travel to the US but those who are already in India are stuck for indefinite time now.Thirumalai said the ideal situation for Indian H-1Bs would be to get out of the H-1B quagmire as soon as possible. Immigration will become only difficult and hence H-1B visa holders should try to get Green Card. ""With the hostile political rhetoric & AI job losses, immigration is going to get only worse. Do all you can to get yourself a GC. Don't listen to folks egging you to get to India, you have worked hard so far, to study here, get a job, have a base, invest 4-5 more years, get a GC + passport to build the optionality for you & you have the best of all worlds. Despite the best Govt, USD/ INR is 90 and macro only getting worse, imagine the situation with a bad govt + even more hostile neighbours,"" the Indian-origin CEO said.",Indian-origin ceo vijay thirumalai commented on the present h-1b situation.
