'If Pakistan does anything more, our response will be far stronger'

NEW DELHI: India will hit terrorists in Pakistan, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told US secretary of state Marco Rubio in a phone call on May 1 after the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22, which killed 26 people.""We will hit the terrorists in Pakistan, and there should be no doubt about it,"" Jaishankar told Rubio, according to ANI citing sources. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke with US vice-president JD Vance on May 9, ""If they (Pakistan) do anything more, our response will be far stronger"" when the latter called him up to convey what US intelligence had gathered about Pakistan's intent to massively escalate hostilities.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi told US Vice President JD Vance clearly that if Pakistan does something, the response will be more devastating and strong. On the same night, Pakistan attacked 26 sites and India responded very strongly. Strikes were launched on their bases,"" news agency ANI quoted sources as saying.According to the report, Vance, who was in India with his Indian-origin wife Usha and their children on the day (April 22) of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which led to the conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours, called PM Modi on Friday (local time) with the message that the US officials had assessed there was a ""high probability of a dramatic escalation of violence that could tip into full-scale war.""PM Modi listened but ""did not commit to any of the ideas"" proposed by the US Vice President to de-escalate, the report added.Vance's intervention came just days after he said in an interview that the India-Pakistan conflict is ""fundamentally not our business.""India-Pakistan ties hit when terrorist opened fire at a famed meadow near Pahalgam town, dubbed ""mini Switzerland,"" and started firing at tourists. India blamed Pakistan for the attack, a charge denied by Islamabad. After this, India retaliated back on May 7 with ""Operation Sindoor.""India conducted strikes on nine terrorist locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK). In response, Pakistan initiated unprovoked aggression using artillery weapons and unmanned aerial vehicles.During the night spanning May 7-8, Pakistan launched offensive operations targeting multiple military installations across Northern and Western India, including Awantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Pathankot, Amritsar, Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Adampur, Bhatinda, Chandigarh, Nal, Phalodi, Uttarlai, and Bhuj, utilising drones and missiles.The Integrated Counter UAS Grid and Air Defence systems successfully intercepted these attacks.Both the countries reached to an agreement for ceasefire on May 10 but after few hours, India accused Pakistan of violating the terms of the understanding on Saturday night and asked it to take ""appropriate steps"" to address these violations and deal with the situation with ""seriousness and responsibility"".But after few hours, the situation cooled down even though residents in several border areas continue to live in a state of fear following days of shelling and drone incidents.During discussions on May 10 between Rubio and Jaishankar regarding India-Pakistan tensions, Rubio stressed the importance of immediate tension reduction.He also confirmed US backing for direct talks between India and Pakistan whilst supporting enhanced communication channels.","India will hit terrorists in pakistan, external affairs minister s jaishankar told us secretary of state marco rubio in a phone call on may 1.

NEW DELHI: India successfully managed to achieve three main objectives - political, military and psychological - from the May 7 military strikes , according to government sources.""The military aim was, as the PM said, terrorists ko mitti mein mila denge. That was achieved in Bahawalpur, Muridke and Muzaffarabad. The political was to raise the cost of terrorism for Pakistan and to keep Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance till Pakistan stops promoting cross-border terrorism .And the psychological objective was 'ghar mein ghus ke marenge' and that no place is safe for you. All three were successfully achieved,"" the source said.Also read: India agreed to pause as 'main objectives had already been achieved' The sources said India's military strikes on terrorist camps marked a new normal in ties - that LoC or nuclear threat could no longer be used to carry out terrorist attacks in India. They stressed that India was determined from the day of the Pahalgam attack that it would hit Pakistan's terror factory, with the PM asking armed forces to respond to every 'goli' (bullet) with a 'gola' (cannonball).While admitting that US Vice President J D Vance spoke to PM Modi on May 9, government sources said even after the talks, Pakistan targeted 26 places in India at night, after which Indian armed forces hit back hard.Government sources also said the Indian DGMO had spoken to his Pakistani counterpart minutes after the May 7 strikes. He is learnt to have told him that India had hit terrorist camps and was ready to talk. The Pakistani DGMO that day showed no interest in engaging India on the military situation, but came around after India rained ""hell fire"" on May 10.According to Indian authorities, while violence has stopped, Operation Sindoor is still not over and the Indus Waters Treaty will remain in abeyance till the time Pakistan stops cross-border terrorism. Modi is learnt to have conveyed India's resolve to bring the perpetrators to justice in a conversation with US President Donald Trump on April 22 itself, while he was in Saudi Arabia on the day of the Pahalgam attack, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar told his counterpart Marco Rubio on May 1 that India would hit at terror camps in Pakistan.At a briefing on Sunday, director general of air operations Air Marshal A K Bharti made it clear that the calibrated strikes on the Pakistan airbases and radar sites were undertaken after Pakistan upped the ante by relentlessly launching waves of drone attacks to target Indian airbases, military assets and civilian areas.Also read: 'Decided to strike where it would hurt': Air Marshal AK Bharti gives details of India's retaliatory strikes on Pakistan airbases Displaying ""before and after"" satellite and other images to show how some of the bases were hit multiple times, he said there was major damage to runways, aircraft hangers and base infrastructure at other Pakistan airbases like Sargodha, which houses F-16 jets, Skardu, Jacobabad, Bholari, Sukkur and Rahim Yar Khan as well.""To start with, our fight was only with the terrorists and not with the Pak Army. But we were relentlessly attacked and left with no choice,"" Air Marshal Bharti said.A NOTAM (notice to airmen), incidentally, has been issued by Pakistan, saying that the only runway at the Rahim Yar Khan base would be ""not be available for flight operations"" for at least a week.""Even more than the actual damage, the messaging that we can hit the heartland of Pakistan was the key. The strikes were precise in order to not cause collateral damage to civilian infrastructure,"" another senior officer told TOI.In all, the IAF fighters targeted nine airbases - the others being Rafiqui and Murid - as well as radar sites at Pasrur, Chunian and Sialkot aviation bases, as was reported by TOI earlier.Air Marshal Bharti did not specify the precision strike weapons used in the operation. Sources, however, said IAF deployed the twin-engine Sukhoi-30MKI fighters armed with the BrahMos missiles, whose range has been extended from 290 to 450-km, among other jets and weapons, for the mission that did not involve crossing the Line of Control or the international boundary.Other weapons included Crystal Maze-2 missiles, Scalp air-to-ground cruise missiles, Hammer air-to-ground precision-guided munitions and Spice-2000 precision-guided bombs.The Sukhois, with a combat radius of almost 1,500-km without mid-air refuelling, and the extended range BrahMos, which flies almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, together constitute a decidedly deadly weapons package.Around 40 Sukhoi fighters have also been modified to carry the BrahMos missiles. The IAF has been practising air-to-ground precision strikes against high-value targets from long stand-off distances in the Bay of Bengal for quite some time now.This time, the strike mission was across the frontier with Pakistan. ""The IAF has successfully executed its assigned tasks in Operation Sindoor, with precision and professionalism.

NEW DELHI: Deep precision airstrikes with BrahMos supersonic missiles and other standoff weapons on several crucial airbases in Pakistan early Saturday proved to be decisive in the escalating hostilities between the two nations, causing the US to step in and push for a truce.India agreed as it had achieved its three main objectives — political, military and psychological — according to govt sources.The major hit on the Nur Khan-Chaklala airbase at Rawalpindi, which caused some damage to the infrastructure there, was particularly significant since it is located close to HQ of Pakistan’s Strategic Plans Division, which handles its nuclear arsenal, and is barely 10km from Islamabad.Also read: Response to Pahalgam terror attack marks new normal in India-Pakistan ties Pakistan’s nuclear warheads, estimated to be around 170 like India, would be spread around the country in secret locations.

JAMMU: An uneasy calm descended Sunday on the forward areas along the international border and LoC in J&K’s Jammu division after days of heavy shelling by Pakistan, including for a few hours after a pause was declared on military operations.Residents of towns and villages in Rajouri, Poonch, Jammu, Samba and Udhampur gingerly got back to work amid confirmation that there was no ceasefire violation and drone activity from across the LoC since midnight.“With Pakistan, you never know.

NEW DELHI: Amid Indo-Pak tensions, Isro chairman V Narayanan on Sunday said 10 satellites are continuously working round-the-clock for the strategic purpose to ensure the safety and security of citizens of the country.Addressing the 5th convocation ceremony of Central Agricultural University (CAU) at Agartala, the Isro chief said, “If we want to ensure the safety of our country, we have to serve through our satellites.We have to monitor our 7,000 km seashore areas. Without satellite and drone technology, we can’t achieve many things.”As of now, Isro has launched a total of 127 Indian satellites, including those from private operators and academic institutions. Of these, 22 are in low earth orbit (LEO) and 29 are in geo-synchronous earth orbit, owned by the central govt. India has around a dozen spy or surveillance satellites. They include Cartosat and RISAT series, as well as EMISAT and MicroSat series, which are designed for specific surveillance tasks.Just days ago, Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) chairman Pawan Kumar Goenka had said at Global Space Exploration Conference 2025 that India would put in orbit a constellation of 52 satellites over the next five years to step up space-based surveillance capabilities.“We have fairly strong capabilities already. It is just that it needs constant enhancement,” Goenka said. He said the plan is intended at increasing surveillance capabilities of the defence sector. “So far, this was primarily done by Isro. We will bring in the private sector as we move forward,” he said. The new satellites will help Indian Army, Navy and Air Force track enemy movements, monitor borders and improve real-time coordination during military operations.Narayanan’s statement has come at a time when Isro is scheduled to launch another surveillance satellite, EOS-09 (RISAT-1B) radar imaging satellite, into a sun-synchronous orbit on May 18 that will boost India’s surveillance powers along its sensitive borders.Saying that advanced satellite technologies are required for the common man's development, Narayanan predicted that before India celebrates 100 years of its independence, the country would be a master in every field, the country would be an outstanding contributor to the world.Isro and its several satellites are operational for the development of northeastern states and the execution of many projects in the region, he added. He urged students that after taking degrees, their responsibility is to give something to society.","Isro chairman v narayanan said 10 satellites are working round-the-clock.

As per sources, the attacks were carried out using advanced air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs), likely the BrahMos.Imagery released by Indian space analytics firm KawaSpace confirms a direct hit on a hangar at Pakistan Air Force’s Bholari Airbase.Debris and structural damage were visible, with the strike's proximity to the runway suggesting that the targeted hangar may have had a quick reaction alert (QRA) role.At Shahbaz Airbase in Jacobabad, another precision strike reportedly hit a hangar on the main apron. KawaSpace imagery also suggests possible secondary damage to the air traffic control (ATC) building at the site.Sargodha Airbase was also struck, though the extent of damage has not been officially disclosed. KawaSpace provided updated runway imagery but has withheld additional assessments pending verification.Imagery from a Chinese satellite firm, MizazVision, appears to confirm that Pakistan’s Nur Khan Airbase was targeted as well. The Indian Air Force strike reportedly focused on disabling ground support vehicles and critical infrastructure on site.These strikes follow escalating military tensions and are part of India's broader Operation Sindoor , which aims to neutralize cross-border terror infrastructure .Earlier in the evening, in a rare joint press briefing by all three defence services, Air Marshal AK Bharti emphasized that the Indian response was deliberately focused on high-value targets. “A decision was taken to strike where it would hurt,” he said, outlining how Indian forces carried out a swift, coordinated, and calibrated assault on key Pakistani military infrastructure.The targets included airbases at Chaklala, Rafiq, and Rahim Yar Khan, followed by strikes on Sargodha, Bhulari, and Jacobabad. These strikes, Bharti added, were meant to send a clear message: “Aggression will not be tolerated.”Bharti also confirmed that the Indian Air Force thwarted an attempted breach of Indian airspace by Pakistani fighter jets following India’s cross-border counterterror strikes under ‘Operation Sindoor’.“Their planes were prevented from entering our borders. We have definitely downed a few planes and inflicted losses on their side,” Bharti said, assuring that all Indian pilots involved in the operation had returned safely.The briefing came as all three wings of India’s armed forces shed light on Operation Sindoor, the large-scale military response launched on May 7 following the Pakistan-backed terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.","The indian air force (iaf) conducted coordinated precision strikes on at least four pakistani airbases.

NEW DELHI: Air Marshal AK Bharti on Sunday briefed on Operation Sindoor and said that the armed forces successfully destroyed terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir achieving its objectives with precision.During a press briefing regarding Operation Sindoor, he said the results were evident to the world.Regarding the operation, Air Marshal Bharti said, ""Have we achieved our objectives of decimating the terrorist camps, and the answer is a thumping yes, and the results are for the whole world to see.""The Air Marshal further added that the operation was aimed at hitting designated targets with precision, ""not to count the body bags,"" referring to the matter of the number of estimated casualties.""Whatever methods and whatever means we have chosen, it had the desired effects on the enemy targets. How many casualties? How many injuries? Our aim was not to inflict casualties, but in case there have been, it is for them to count. Our job is to hit the target, not to count the body bags,"" the Marshal said.DGMO Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai said that armed forces killed more than 100 terrorists including high value targets.""Those strikes across those nine terror hubs left more than 100 terrorists killed, including high-value targets such as Yusuf Azhar, Abdul Malik Rauf and Mudasir Ahmed, who were involved in the hijack of IC814 and the Pulwama blast,"" the DGMO said.The Marshal said the Indian Armed Forces successfully executed Operation Sindoor, achieving all selected objectives, with all Indian pilots returning safely.""All I can say is that we have achieved our objectives that we selected and all our pilots are back home,"" he said.Air Marshal Bharti confirmed that the Indian Air Force had downed several Pakistani planes while preventing enemy aircraft from breaching Indian airspace.""Their planes were prevented from entering inside our border. Definitely, we have downed a few planes. Definitely, there are losses on their side which we have inflicted,"" he said.DGMO Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai said that Pakistan's actions were ""no less than war"". He also said that the Pakistan Army may be involved in the infiltration across LoC.""The activities that have been going on for the last 3–4 days are no less than a war. Under normal circumstances, the air forces of each other's countries do not fly in the air and attack each other. Under normal circumstances, infiltration across the Line of Control is done by terrorists. We have information that the Pakistani army may also be involved in infiltration across the Line of Control, which is trying to harm our posts,"" the Lieutenant General said.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri on Saturday said that Pakistan’s military contacted India earlier in the day, and both sides agreed to stop all military action on land, at sea, and in the air starting from 5 pm.He added that orders were given to enforce the ceasefire, and another meeting between the two countries will take place on May 12 at noon.Hours after the ceasefire was announced, Pakistan reportedly violated it again, with Indian air defence intercepting Pakistani drones during a blackout in Srinagar.India urged Pakistan to take proper action to stop the violations and handle the situation seriously and responsibly. Earlier, Pakistan was also warned that any future act of terrorism against India would be treated as an ""act of war.""The Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7, targeting nine terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoK).The strike came in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians.After India’s action, tensions between India and Pakistan increased sharply. This led to more cross-border shelling from Pakistan, with India responding in kind.Several areas near the border were placed on high alert, and blackouts were reported during Pakistani attacks.","'our job is to hit the target, not to count the body bags,' says air marshal bharti.

NEW DELHI: PM Modi is learnt to have told US vice-president J D Vance on Friday, ""If they (Pakistan) do anything more, our response will be far stronger"" when the latter called him up to convey what US intelligence had gathered about Pakistan's intent to massively escalate hostilities.If Vance had expected that his dire message about the offensive intent of a nuclear-armed country would get Modi to lower the ante, he was mistaken.So, when Pakistan indeed widened the theatre a few hours later, India struck back by carrying out precision strikes at multiple PAF airbases, laying bare its air defence.The successful execution of Modi's intent was what forced Pakistan to approach India for pausing hostilities. India agreed, but after laying down its 'if you don't act, we don't act; but if you act, we react strongly' bottomline.Sources also feel Pakistan's alleged threat, which dramatically moved Vance from terming the conflict as ""fundamentally none of our business"" just a day before to playing the concerned mediator, may have been part of its by now familiar playbook to tap into the West's fears of a nuclear conflagration.New Delhi, however, did not indulge Washington's activism. Sources said external affairs minister S Jaishankar made it clear to US secretary of state Marco Rubio that if Pakistan wanted to talk, it could directly approach the DGMO here.Faced with the strong and effective response of our armed forces, they (Pakistan) ran to their uncle to seek its intervention,” a senior source said on what could have led the US to junk its ‘it is for them to sort it out’ aloofness to seek to play the firefighter.As the pause in conflict took effect, there is satisfaction here that Pakistan’s plan to drum up support by painting doomsday scenarios of nukes flying did not work. It failed to rally the Muslim nations, with deputy foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, Adel Al Jubeir, visiting New Delhi as a mark of solidarity. “They were upset that the mass killings happened in Pahalgam during PM Modi’s visit (to Saudi Arabia) and conveyed the message that they were ready to help if needed,” the source said.Sources pointed out Iran was also sympathetic towards India. Algeria, an Islamic country which, like Pakistan, is a non-permanent member of UNSC, was party to resolution which stressed the “need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of the reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.

NEW DELHI: Vice Admiral AN Pramod on Sunday said that in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack , the Indian Navy immediately mobilised its carrier battle group into the northern Arabian Sea in full combat readiness, adopting what he called a ""decisive and deterrent posture.""Speaking at a joint press briefing alongside Army and Air Force officials, he confirmed that the Indian Navy had remained forward deployed with the capability to strike high-value targets, including Pakistan’s financial capital, Karachi, under Operation Sindoor “In the aftermath of the cowardly attacks on innocent tourists at Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistani-sponsored terrorists on 22nd April, the Indian Navy's Carrier battle group, surface forces, submarines and aviation assets were immediately deployed at sea with full combat readiness,” said Vice Admiral Pramod.“We tested and refined tactics and procedures at sea during multiple weapon firings in the Arabian Sea within 96 hours of the terrorist attack,” he added.Vice Admiral also mentioned that Pakistan’s naval and air units were forced into a largely defensive stance, retreating to harbours or staying close to the coastline, movements that Indian forces continuously monitored.“Our forces remained forward deployed in the Northern Arabian Sea in a decisive and deterrent posture with full readiness and capacity to strike select targets at sea and on land, including Karachi, at a time of our choosing,” he said.Vice Admiral Pramod highlighted the measured approach adopted by India. “Our response has been measured, proportionate, non-escalatory and responsible from day one,” he said. “As we speak, the Indian Navy remains deployed at sea in a credible deterrent posture to respond decisively to any inimical action by Pakistan.”Delivering a pointed warning, he stated, “This time if Pakistan dares to take any action, Pakistan knows what we are going to do.”The briefing came just a day after Pakistan approached India with a proposal for a full ceasefire across land, air, and sea an understanding it violated later the same evening.All three branches of India’s armed forces, Army, Navy, and Air Force, addressed the media to provide a detailed account of Operation Sindoor, the military response launched on May 7 in retaliation for the Pakistan-backed attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives.Pakistan responded to India’s counterterror operation with a swarm of drones and missile incursions over the subsequent days. However, India’s air defence systems acted swiftly and effectively, neutralising the threats and preventing any casualties or damage.Ironically, even as these hostilities unfolded, Pakistan reached out to India on Saturday, proposing a full ceasefire across land, air, and sea. The request, made via a call from Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations to his Indian counterpart, was positioned as a step toward de-escalation.Yet, within hours of this outreach, Pakistan breached the very peace agreement it had proposed, casting a shadow over the credibility of its peace overture.","Vice admiral an pramod said that in the wake of the pahalgam terror attack, the indian navy immediately mobilised its carrier battle group into the northern arabian sea in full combat readiness. “our response has been measured, proportionate, non-escalatory and responsible from day one,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121083062,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-982686,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: A Squadron Leader was among five Pakistan Air Force (PAF) personnel killed at Bholari in Sindh while the Rahim Yar Khan airbase housed within the international airport of the same name in Punjab province suffered massive damage in coordinated Indian missile strikes targeting the country’s air defence infrastructure, authorities confirmed Sunday after taking stock of the impact of India’s “retaliatory” action early on May 10.The missile fired at Rahim Yar Khan airbase caused a massive crater on the portion of the runway, the district deputy commissioner said.Sources acknowledged that the attack in the dead of night had been timed to avoid civilian casualties. Although passenger flights to and from the airport have since resumed, the missile strike has severely limited the military operations from the airbase.Pakistani officials emphasise Rahim Yar Khan’s strategic role in southern air defences, close to India’s Rajasthan border. They contested India’s statement that a wave of drones launched from the airbase to attack border villages invited the strong missile retaliation.The PAF casualties at Base Bholari in Sindh’s Jamshoro district included Sq Ldr Usman Yousaf and four others in uniform. The base supports F-16 and JF-17 fighter jets, critical to Pakistan’s southern air operations. Pakistani authorities didn’t specify the material losses. Indian media reports, unverified by Pakistan, suggest damage to aircraft and infrastructure.Pakistani officials also confirmed simultaneous attacks on Nur Khan airbase at Chaklala in Rawalpindi, Rafiqui airbase at Shorkot in Punjab), Murid airbase in Chakwal and Chunian airbase in Punjab. They mentioned damage to transport aircraft at Nur Khan and technical facilities at Chunian.India officially named eight PAF bases, including radar sites in Pasrur and Sialkot. Pakistan’s “Operation Bunyan-ul-Marsoos” targeting Indian sites didn’t cause significant damage, the Indian military said in its first official presser since a pause in military operations.",A squadron leader was among five pakistan air force (paf) personnel killed at bholari in sindh.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following escalated cross-border tensions in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives.The ceasefire was the result of direct engagement between Indian and Pakistani officials, with Islamabad agreeing to the terms with ""no preconditions, no postconditions, and no links to other issues.""This comes after the armed forces carried out precision strikes on terrorists hotspots in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir under 'Operation Sindoor'.Following India's action, Pakistan launched missiles and drones across LoC and International Borders which were intercepted by Army's air defence systems.The Indus Waters Treaty will remain in abeyance, government sources confirmed. “There are no preconditions to the ceasefire agreement reached on Saturday, and the IWT will remain suspended,” sources in the ministry of external affairs said.Brokered by the World Bank in 1960, the treaty governs the distribution and use of the Indus River and its tributaries between India and Pakistan.The treaty has historically benefited Pakistan, which receives about 80% of the total water flow from these rivers—vital for agriculture, particularly in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh.The Integrated check-post at Attari will also remain shut. The Attari-Wagah border crossing between India and Pakistan was completely closed following a week of heavy cross-border movement.The check post at Attari in Punjab was closed, and those who crossed over with valid documentation were instructed to return through that route before May 1.The prohibition on all imports from Pakistan, whether direct or routed through intermediary nations, will also continue.Additionally, Pakistan-registered vessels are barred from entering Indian ports, and Indian ships are prohibited from accessing Pakistani harbors—reflecting a tougher diplomatic stance.A newly incorporated provision under “Prohibition on Import from Pakistan” in the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) says, “Direct or indirect import or transit of all goods originating in or exported from Pakistan, whether or not freely importable or otherwise permitted, shall be prohibited with immediate effect, until further orders.”India will continue to enforce the closure of its airspace to flights originating from or traveling through Pakistan, a measure that came into effect on April 30.This move will force foreign carriers that typically overfly Pakistani airspace after exiting Indian airspace to take longer, alternate routes.In the interest of national security, India will maintain its ban on Pakistani actors and artists performing within the country.In addition, all OTT platforms, media streaming services, and intermediaries operating in India are required to discontinue web series, films, songs, podcasts, and other digital content of Pakistani origin—whether available via subscription or otherwise.India will continue the suspension of all types of visas for Pakistani nationals.Following the Pahalgam terror attack, the government had suspended all categories of visas for Pakistani citizens and instructed those already in India to leave by April 27. However, medical visas were given an extension until April 29, after which they were also revoked.“In continuation of the decisions made by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack, the Government of India has decided to suspend visa services to Pakistani nationals with immediate effect,” the Ministry of External Affairs stated.The ministry also advised Indian nationals currently in Pakistan to return at the earliest.","India and pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following escalated cross-border tensions in the wake of the pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives.

BJP posted a video on X criticising the UPA regime for its ""passivity"" and calling it out on its ""futile peace talks"" with Pakistan.""The message to the enemies is loud and clear. Don't mess with us! Unlike the UPA regime’s passivity, New India has no patience for futile peace talks,"" it said.Tharoor's reaction comes at a time when his appreciation for the Modi-government in certain foreign policies made headlines fueling rumours of rift with the grand old party. BJP leader Amit Malviya even took a jibe at him calling him PM Modi's fan after he sided with the current government's stance on Russia-Ukraine policy. ""Prime Minister Modi needs new haters… Old ones are turning into his fans,"" Malviya had said.Additionally, his presence at Vizhinjam port inauguration and sharing stage with PM Modi gained attention after the prime minister said that the event would give ""sleepless nights to several people"" taking a jibe at INDIA bloc.However, BJP leader CR Kesavan criticised Congress saying, ""We salute the exemplary courage and unparalleled commitment of our brave armed forces in decisively defeating the cowardly attacks of Pakistan on Bharat and our civilians...But unfortunately, the poisonous political propaganda of the Congress Party and their noxious fake narratives have now been weaponised by the enemy state of Pakistan...After Operation Sindoor commenced, Udit Raj of the Congress Party gave the name Operation Sindoor a communal colour. So the Congress Party is failing the nation again and again. It's high time they stop politicising the army and stop their fake factory of false narratives...""Meanwhile, India and Pakistan have agreed to stop the military action against each other with the former categorically maintaining ""a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations"".""India and Pakistan have today worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action.

JAISALMER: A bomb disposal squad of the Indian Army safely detonated a powerful Pakistani missile warhead found in Badoda village of Rajasthan's Jaisalmer district on Sunday, capping a pause in hostilities that had kept the border area on the edge for over three days.The warhead, containing live ammunition, was discovered in a farmer's field after India's air defence system intercepted and shot down a Pakistani missile Saturday night, causing its debris to land in Badoda.The operation to detonate the unexploded warhead was conducted after cordoning off a large area to ensure there was no damage. A deep pit was excavated before the disposal team safely destroyed the warhead.The explosion was so loud that vibrations were felt some distance away as clouds of smoke and dust filled the sky, locals said.Officials said that had the warhead exploded on landing, it would have potentially caused a large number of casualties and extensive damage to property. SP Sudhir Chaudhary and officials from Jaisalmer Civil Defence oversaw the detonation with members of the Army brass.Chaudhary had issued a public advisory not to handle any discovered ordnance and to immediately report to the nearest police station if villagers found munition or any explosive. The SP also barred civilians from sharing images of ammunition on social media platforms.Meanwhile, an old hand grenade and some rusty cartridges were found in Pohda village of Jaisalmer.Police station in-charge Bagdu Ram said these appeared to be remnants from previous military exercises.","Security forces defused a missile that fell in a field after it was recovered the day before in jaisalmer on sunday.
