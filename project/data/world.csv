Marco Rubio Praises India’s Handling Of Delhi Red Fort Blast Probe, Says India Doesn't Need US Help

PM Modi's strong message

BJP's 'response loading' clip



NEW DELHI: United States secretary of state Marco Rubio on Thursday said the repercussion of the Delhi car bomb blast has the ""potential of becoming something broader"" as he acknowledged the explosion near Red Fort was a “heinous terror incident. ”Rubio has said the Hyundai i20 explosion near Red Fort was “clearly” a terrorist attack and commended India for being “very measured” and “very professional” in the way it is investigating the deadly incident.A high-intensity blast outside the Red Fort in Delhi on Monday claimed at least 13 lives. India on Wednesday termed the car explosion as a “heinous terror incident.”“Yeah, we’re aware of the potential that that holds. But I think the Indians are – need to be commended; they have been very measured and cautious and very professional in how they’re carrying out this investigation,” Rubio said Wednesday in remarks to the press in Canada' Hamilton.“That investigation continues. Clearly, it was a terrorist attack. It was a car loaded with highly explosive materials that detonated and killed a lot of people,” Rubio said.When asked how concerned he was about rising tensions between India and Pakistan, against the backdrop of the four-day conflict between the two neighbours in May, Rubio said: “(But) I think they’re doing a very good job of carrying out an investigation; and I think when they have facts, they’ll release those facts.”India had launched Operation Sindoor targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. The on-ground hostilities ended with an understanding of stopping the military actions following talks between the directors general of military operations of both sides on May 10.“But clearly, ... we’re aware of the potential that it has, and so we spoke about that a little bit today – the potential that it has to become something broader. But I think we’re going to wait and see what their investigation reveals,” Rubio said, according to news agency PTI.Rubio also met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on the margins of the G7 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Niagara.He added that the US has offered to help, but “I think they’re very capable in these investigations. They don’t need our help. They’re doing a good job, and I thought they were very measured and professional in how they’ve approached it, as they usually are.”Following his meeting with Rubio, Jaishankar said in a post on X: “Good to meet @SecRubio this morning at #G7 FMM. Appreciate his condolences on the loss of lives in the blast in Delhi. Discussed our bilateral ties, focusing on trade and supply chains. Exchanged views on the Ukraine conflict, the Middle East/West Asia situation and Indo-Pacific.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that those responsible for the Delhi car blast won't be spared and will be brought to justice. PM Modi, who was on a two-day visit to Bhutan, said that he monitored the situation all night after the blast.""Today, I come here with a very heavy heart. The horrific incident that took place in Delhi yesterday evening has deeply saddened everyone. I understand the grief of the affected families. The entire nation stands with them today,"" he said.The Prime Minister added that he was in touch with all agencies investigating the incident.""I was in touch with all the agencies investigating this incident throughout last night. Our agencies will get to the bottom of this conspiracy. The conspirators behind this will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice,"" he added.Union home minister Amit Shah also on Thursday said that those responsible for the recent Delhi bomb blast will be given the “strictest possible punishment”.He added that the action will send a strong message to the world that no one should ever dare to attack India again.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday posted a clip of how India responded to every terror attack with a cross-border surgical strike, airstrike, and Operation Sindoor, which was launched to avenge the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack.In a drastic revision of its security doctrine, India, in May, after the Pahalgam attack, declared that it would from now on consider every instance of terrorism directed against it as an 'act of war' and would respond accordingly.Sources explained that the decision considerably lowers the threshold for India to give a full-scale military response to attacks orchestrated from across the border.","U.s. secretary of state marco rubio said the repercussion of the delhi car bomb blast has the ""potential of becoming something broader"" he acknowledged the explosion near red fort was a “heinous terror incident.” rubio commended india for being “very measured” and ‘very professional’ in the way it is investigating the deadly incident.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125303188,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-40608,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.",Cji b r gavai calls 1979 rape verdict a'moment of institutional embarrassment' he says it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable.

How far are we from resuming the talks on a bilateral trade deal?

When the talks were halted, it had reached a certain level. So, does that mean that you're reviewing what was agreed upon till then?

What do you make of foreign minister Anita Anand's remarks on progress in the normalization of the relationship being contingent upon the law enforcement dialogue?

Did you discuss India's purchase of Russian oil?

For India, visas are an important issue especially for professionals and business visitors in trade agreements. Can you give us a sense of what the visa policy is going to be?

And this would be STEM and similar skills?

Now that high level engagements have resumed, can we expect the Prime Ministers to meet on the margins of the upcoming G20 summit in South Africa? Can we expect Prime Minister Carney to visit India for the AI Summit in February?

Canada’s minister for international trade Maninder Sidhu, who is in India to take forward the bilateral dialogue on trade and investment ties, says that his government is looking for skilled workers from foreign countries, focusing more on quality. In an interview, he tells TOI that India and Canada are taking one step at a time and assessing the changes in the global economy before moving ahead with talks on a trade deal. Excerpts:We had a great meeting today to focus on a lot of the opportunities; opportunities around aerospace, energy, AI and critical minerals. These are all critical sectors for India. As India grows, Canada is there in complementary services and that's what we discovered today in terms of how fast India is growing.India needs 70% more energy by 2040. Canada is building the projects to get there. We have seven LNG projects in various phases of development. It was our first trade and investment dialogue at the ministerial level in many years.We need to continue building on that energy. Prime Minister Carney has given me a mandate, an ambitious target of $300 billion of (additional) non-US exports within the next 10 years and I'm looking at every market to see how we can continue diversifying and building on our trade partnerships.India is a great partner with $30 billion of two-way trade right and there's room to grow.Right now, we're identifying opportunities and hopefully, in the near future we'll be able to get into the trade conversations, taking investment and trade to the next level. We also need to bring the business community along with us.Look, this is a new government, new Prime Minister, new mandate, new focus. As you've seen from Prime Minister Carney, it's new energy, it's starting afresh. The context has changed from even six months ago. You know, President Trump's tariff policies have really shifted things globally. So, we're in a different frame right now. We just wrapped up a trade agreement with Indonesia a few weeks ago and launched negotiations with Thailand, with the Philippines. Two weeks ago, I ran into minister Jaishankar at the Asean Summit in Malaysia.We had a good conversation. Canada is looking at every opportunity, but now is the window that we can use. Our geography with the US Is not going to change. They'll always remain important. We have to match the energy from businesses in Canada. It was very positive to hear from minister Goyal that he's looking to come to Canada early next year with a delegation so we can continue building on this. Minister Jaishankar was in Canada yesterday and I'm here today. You know, there's this sustained energy that we need to continue building upon because it's not going to happen overnight.The minister’s visit was positive, and it laid the groundwork for what I'm doing now. The safety and security of citizens of both countries is paramount. So those conversations are encouraging that law enforcement agencies are talking to each other to resolve some of the challenges. My job as an economic minister is to focus on the trade and investmentsWe talked about alternative sources of energy and Canada can provide that. As you look for stable, reliable, long-term supply, Canada is that. These contracts are done for 10, 15, 20 years, now is the time to get in early. You'll notice in LNG, different countries have invested that those countries are now receiving the first shipments.Look, immigration comes up quite a lot; look at the diaspora, it's huge in both countries. We have a lot of family and friends visiting each other. That's why I sat down with Air Canada to talk about more flight options. In Canada, 13% of our trade flows through our airports. The Prime Minister has been very clear on immigration. It's a focus on economic immigration, a focus on skilled immigration. So making sure we're creating pathways to permanent residency for those skilled immigrants is very important for Canada's growth plans.When you look at what's happening to the south of us with the H1B anxieties, it's in our budget. It's still early in the conversations, but we're looking at different pathways to attract technical capabilities, skilled capabilities to Canada. The PM's focus is how do we build Canada. You have your localized talent, but you also need to bring in some talent that can add to that. So a part of that is looking at India and maybe something around the H1B programme is very important.Yes, STEM, skilled workers. We need nurses and doctors. We have specialized pathways. Are we going to continue that as a government? These are all considerations that we were looking at because in the past, it was more about quantity. With us, yes, the quantity, quality is also important. There are no caps on postgraduates, they can come to Canada and study at the University of Toronto, McGill, many of the universities.Prime Minister Modi has been very clear he'd like universities and colleges to come to India from other countries like Canada to set up shop here. And so we're facilitating those conversations because we'd like that partnership. It's important. It helps build the partnership and trust between communities through research, through students. And so we're looking at that option as well.The schedules are still being looked at. But of course, more conversations are very important to this relationship, to have that sustained dialogue.","Canada’s minister for international trade maninder sidhu is in india to take forward the bilateral dialogue on trade and investment ties.

Indian Air Force Opens Nyoma Airbase In Ladakh, A Strategic Game-Changer Along The China Frontier

Nyoma airbase underwent Rs 230cr upgrade

Also read:

NEW DELHI: In a major booster shot for military capabilities in eastern Ladakh, India on Wednesday operationalised its new Nyoma airbase close to the frontier with China, even as a large Army exercise called 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' is now under way in Arunachal Pradesh on the eastern front.The developments at the opposite ends of the 3,488-km LAC underscore the high military readiness being maintained along the China frontier. ""There is ongoing reset in bilateral diplomatic ties. Military CBMs are also being progressively strengthened but the trust deficit on the ground remains high,"" a senior officer told TOI. ""With no de-escalation along LAC, troops will continue to be forward deployed for 6th successive winter since multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020,"" he said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, to formally inaugurate the strategically located airbase. He was accompanied by Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Jeetendra Mishra.Located just about 35 km from the LAC, Nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth Rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway, a new ATC complex, hangars, crash bay and accommodation, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Mudh airfield is now fully capable of handling and sustaining operations by heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. Primarily, it will help quickly rush troops, weapons and supplies to areas such as Pangong Tso, Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026 though high altitude will be a limiting factor. China has assiduously upgraded all its airbases facing India over the last five years to offset the terrain constraints due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.China now has additional fighters, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones deployed at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports all along the LAC.In the far reaches of the Eastern Himalayas, thousands of soldiers from the 3 Spear Corps of the Indian Army, along with elements of IAF, ITBP and others, are now also engaged in the 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' exercise in the high-altitude terrain of Mechuka and other areas of Arunachal Pradesh.From airlift and force projection to mountain warfare manoeuvres and multi-domain integrated operations, the exercise aims at validating rapid mobilisation, operational logistics and precision-strike capabilities.

SRINAGAR: Counting of votes began for Budgam assembly bypoll in Jammu & Kashmir on Friday, marking the final stage of a closely watched electoral contest that saw nearly 50% voter turnout earlier this week.The Budgam bypoll, held on Tuesday, November 11, recorded a turnout slightly lower than the 52.27% registered during last year’s assembly elections.Polling remained largely peaceful across the constituency, which has around 1.26 lakh registered voters.The bypoll is being viewed as a litmus test for chief minister Omar Abdullah’s government and his party, the National Conference (NC). The election was necessitated after Abdullah vacated the Budgam seat following his victory from his family stronghold of Ganderbal in last year’s assembly polls.A traditional stronghold of the National Conference since 1962, Budgam has seen the party dominate in nearly every election, barring a lone Congress win in 1972. NC’s Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi had represented Budgam for three consecutive terms — 2002, 2008, and 2014 — before Omar Abdullah’s win in 2024.This time, Aga Syed Mehmood of the ruling NC faces a tough fight from PDP’s Aga Muntazir, making it a rare Shia-versus-Shia contest in the Valley. Other key contenders include BJP’s Syed Mohsin, Awami Ittehad Party’s Nazir Ahmad Khan, AAP’s Deeba Khan, and Independent candidate Muntazir Mohiuddin.As counting proceeds amid tight security, the results are expected to indicate not only the public mood in central Kashmir but also serve as a referendum on the Omar Abdullah-led government’s performance in its first year in office.","Counting of votes began for budgam assembly bypoll in jammu & kashmir on friday.

Islam Makhachev opens up on the street named after him and Khabib Nurmagomedov’s legacy



Islam Makhachev is gearing up for one of the biggest fights of his career as he faces Jack Della Maddalena for the welterweight title at UFC 322 this weekend. Ahead of the fight, Makhachev talked about his close bond with Khabib Nurmagomedov.Nurmagomedov, Makhachev’s longtime friend and mentor, named a small street after him in his village. However, Makhachev revealed that the locals have been teasing him about the street’s poor condition and demanding he get it fixed. He also spoke about his relationship with Khabib and shut down talk of any rivalry between the two, saying their shared goal is to honor the legacy of Khabib’s late father and legendary coach, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov.When one of the reporters asked Islam Makhachev about Khabib Nurmagomedov naming streets after him, Makhachev laughed and said, “Khabib put my name on some street in his village, but it’s a small street. I’ll give him back, I’ll put in my village’s biggest street, Khabib’s name… Khabib is a very smart guy… Now we have to fix it, you know. People from the village tell me, ‘Islam, if you don’t fix our street, we’re gonna change this name.’”The 33-year-old Dagestani fighter is chasing history as he moves up to the 170-pound division. If he beats Della Maddalena, Makhachev could become a two-division UFC champion. Despite this, he firmly rejected comparisons with Nurmagomedov.In an interview with ESPN MMA, he said, “This is a stupid question. He’s my brother… If he didn’t want me to beat his record, he would never help me… One day, he told me he does all this because if one guy becomes a champion, it changes the lives of many people around him.”The MMA fighter noted that his records are nothing compared to those of Khabib’s late father and legendary coach, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov.“It’s not a question I want to answer, like I beat Khabib’s record or something like that. It’s all about Abdulmanap’s legacy, our coach who is not with us right now. After ten or fifteen years, people will understand what he did for our country, for MMA, for sports”, Makhachev added.The UFC lightweight defending champion will lock horns with Jack Della Maddalena for the welterweight title at UFC 322 on Saturday, November 15, at Madison Square Garden.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers

Fresh Indian-hate takes over US over H-1B







Right-wing commentator and writer Ann Coulter commented on the ongoing H-1B controversy and called Indians and Chinese 'cheaters'. Reacting to Donald Trump's recent statement that America needs certain foreign talents, leading to a major MAGA meltdown, Ann Coulter said there are photos of them crawling out of windows and passing answers to someone. ""America is traditionally a high-trust society,"" Ann Coulter said, adding that when someone shows the high score of Indians or Chinese, the odds are that they are probably cheating.Appearing on a podcast, Ann Coulter said that the H-1B 'scam' does not only involve cheating and taking away the jobs of Americans -- but also the Indiana and the Chinese bring their whole village to the US.""The Indian and the Chinese and the H-1B workers come in and then they bring their elderly parents so they can instantly go on social security. They can bring the whole village in who you’ll be paying for, America,"" Ann Coulter said.H-1B is the visa program that allows US companies to hire foreign talent. The Trump administration has been tough on this program to save jobs for Americans and imposed a $100,000 fee for H-1B. But Donald Trump's latest Fox News interview, in which he said America needs certain foreign talent, triggered a fresh row that has now boiled down into India-hate.Trump also specified which type of talent he was referring to. “In Georgia, they raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out — they had people from South Korea that made batteries all their life,” Trump said. “You know, making batteries is very complicated. It’s not an easy thing. Very dangerous, a lot of explosions, a lot of problems. They had like 500 or 600 people, early stages, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it. Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. You’re going to need that,"" Trump said.","Right-wing commentator ann coulter said indians and chinese openly cheat.

'H-1B flawed but America needs the best of other countries'







Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said his words on H-1B were taken out of context as he drew flak for defending the visa program that steals American jobs. President Donald Trump's recent statement that America needs certain talents from foreign countries reignited the H-1B row once again, and this time Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are not in the picture, like they were in 2024. MAGA is now openly revolting against Trump, claiming that they didn't vote for H-1B.Ben Shapiro came under attack as he was seen defending the visa program. But he later said that his words were taken out of context, as he was explaining how labor is connected with the affordability issues and if companies move out of the US, no American gets a job.Shapiro said there are indeed some positions that require people from outside because American universities are not producing graduates with that particular skill in enough numbers. Shapiro called it the shortcomings of the education system. ""We should absolutely up our game educationally but in the meantime, if you do not bring people into tech, tech will go find the labor supply. So in an office, there are 30 Americans and 3 H-1B visa people, but if the cost goes too high, the company goes elsewhere, hires 30 Indians and 0 Americans,"" Shapiro said.Citing the example or Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella, Ben Shapiro said America needs the best of other countries. The process of determining the best can be improved and H-1B might be flawed, Shapiro said, asserting that brain-draining other countries is good for America. Shapiro added that there should be the precondition that these foreigners assimilate with American values, they should like America and become American patriots.Shapiro defended Donald Trump's latest stand on H-1B and got canceled by MAGA who told him that he has no idea what scam H-1B is.","Ben shapiro draws flak for supporting h-1b visa program.
