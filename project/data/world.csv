RAISEN: The world sees ""new India"" as a strong, fast-growing economy whose ability to defeat its enemies with ""homegrown strength"" has become the envy of those who think ""sabke boss toh hum hain"", defence minister Rajnath Singh said Sunday, taking a veiled swipe at US President Donald Trump amid escalating tariff tensions.""Many wonder how India is growing at such a fast pace. They are trying their best to ensure goods made in India, by Indians, are costlier than goods made in their countries,"" Singh said at the foundation ceremony of the Rs 1,800-crore BEML Rail Hub for Manufacturing in MP's Raisen.""They feel this will ensure that when goods made in India become expensive, the world wouldn't buy them. They are putting in much effort to ensure this.""Singh predicted that attempts to browbeat India with additional tariffs wouldn't succeed, given how the country had positioned itself.India is progressing so fast that I could say with full confidence - no power in the world can now stop us from becoming a big power, Rajnath Singh said.Singh said that despite the naysayers, Operation Sindoor was proof that India possessed the capabilities to show its enemies their place without depending on anybody.He termed the operation ""a befitting reply to the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack in Pahalgam"" and a loud and clear message that India no longer tolerates an attack on its integrity and sovereignty. ""We don't provoke anyone, but those who provoke us will not be spared,"" he added.The defence minister said the country's armed forces effectively utilising indigenous equipment was crucial to the success of Operation Sindoor. ""India was able to reach this position only because it has taken the pledge to become atmanirbhar in the defence sector.""Crediting PM Narendra Modi for the transformation, Rajnath Singh said India wasn't just manufacturing defence equipment for its own use, but also catering to the security needs of friendly countries.""Our defence production and export are increasing at an unprecedented pace, touching record figures. This is the new defence sector of new India.""Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and MP chief minister Mohan Yadav were also at the event.","We don't provoke anyone, but those who provoke us won't be spared: rajnath singh.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

Aerial interception and final missile strike

NEW DELHI: Even as Operation Sindoor continues, the navies of India and Pakistan are set to conduct separate naval drills in the Arabian Sea starting tomorrow, defence sources confirmed on Sunday.According to officials, both navies have issued Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) restricting air traffic in their respective territorial waters for the duration of the exercises.""Indian Navy warships would be carrying out drills in the Arabian Sea on August 11-12. Pakistan Navy has also issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) for carrying out its own naval exercises in its waters,"" defence sources said.A NOTAM is issued to alert pilots and air traffic controllers of airspace restrictions during specific operations, such as military drills.The drills come months after a tense military standoff in May when Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed Operation Sindoor with India’s top commanders.As per media reports, PM Modi reportedly told navy chief Admiral Dinesh Tripathi, “Humne aapke mooh se niwala cheen liya, aapko mauka phir milega” -- indicating the Navy’s planned strike on Karachi was called off at the last moment. Despite concerns about possible Pakistani retaliation, Modi gave full operational autonomy to the services.The military leadership displayed varied strengths: Air chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh, known for his daring as a test pilot; Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, a troop-focused leader; and Admiral Tripathi, a strong advocate for naval offensive action. This blend helped execute coordinated strikes while balancing strategic caution.Between May 7 and 10, the Indian Air Force targeted critical Pakistani military assets, destroying fighter aircraft, radar systems, and airborne early warning platforms.The Army’s deployment of advanced artillery and loitering munitions forced Pakistani troops to retreat along the Line of Control.Concurrently, the Navy’s mobilisation pushed Pakistani vessels into shelter at Gwadar port.A significant engagement saw an Indian S-400 missile intercept a Pakistani Saab AEW&C aircraft deep inside Pakistan, severely impacting its surveillance capability.The conflict’s last strike was a BrahMos missile attack on the Bholari airbase on May 10, marking India’s successful mission completion.",The navies of india and pakistan are set to conduct separate naval drills in the arabian sea starting tomorrow.

Strengthen domestic manufacturing and exports Focus on diplomatic negotiations and trade deals

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday took a veiled jab at US President Donald Trump over the recent tariff hikes on Indian goods, accusing unnamed global powers of trying to derail India's economic momentum. Without naming Trump, Singh said, ""Some 'boss' is jealous, unable to accept India's growth; trying to disrupt the country’s economy"".“There are some people who are not happy with the speed at which India is developing. They are not liking it. ‘Sabke boss toh hum hain’, how is India growing at such a fast pace?” Singh told a gathering.The comments came after Washington imposed a 25% tariff on Indian goods, along with an additional 25% penalty in response to New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil.The US President also threatened further tariff hikes, dismissed India’s economy as “dead,” and faced criticism from New Delhi after aides accused India of financing Russia’s war in Ukraine.Also Read: India’s 50% tariff is actually a US sanction in disguise. Why that makes it worse Singh alleged that some countries were trying to ensure “products made in India, by Indian hands, become more expensive than those made in other countries, so that when prices rise, the world will stop buying them.” But he insisted, “India is advancing so rapidly that I say with full confidence: no power in the world can now stop India from becoming a major global power.”Pointing to defence exports as an example of resilience, Singh said, “We are exporting defence items worth more than Rs 24,000 crore. This is the strength of India, this is the new defence sector of the new India, and exports are continuously increasing.” He added that the sector had not been impacted by the tariff dispute.","Defence minister rajnath singh accuses unnamed global powers of trying to derail india's economic momentum.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday called for for “zero defect and zero effect” manufacturing for ' Make in India ', meaning flawless products with no environmental harm.Speaking at a public event in Bengaluru, PM Modi emphasised that India’s economy has climbed from 10th place to the top five in the past 11 years, and urged the youth of Bengaluru and Karnataka to lead the ‘Make in India’ and ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ initiatives.""We have to strengthen the presence of Bengaluru and Karnataka in 'Make in India'. I urge that our products should be of the standards of 'Zero Defect, Zero Effect'. That is, there should be defect-free products, and their manufacturing should also not have any negative impact on the environment. I expect that the talent of Karnataka will lead this vision of 'Aatmnirbhar Bharat'"", the Prime Minister said.The Prime Minister said the next big focus should be a “Tech Atmanirbhar Bharat,” pushing for innovation and self-reliance in technology. “Now is the time to give more priority to the needs of India and move ahead faster in developing new products,” he said.He further said that India’s economy is advancing at a rapid pace and is on course to become the world’s third-largest and credited the progress to the government’s “reform, perform and transform” approach, clear intentions, and honest efforts.“We are rapidly moving towards becoming the top third economy,” he said.“This speed came to us from the spirit of reform, perform, and transform. This speed came to us from clear intention and honest efforts.”Highlighting infrastructure gains since 2014, the Prime Minister noted that metro services have expanded from just five cities to more than 1,000 km of network in 24 cities. Rail electrification has doubled from 20,000 km to over 40,000 km, airports have risen from 74 to over 160, and operational national waterways have increased from three to 30.Citing the recent success of Operation Sindoor , PM Modi credited the achievement to indigenous defence technology and the role of Karnataka’s youth. “The success of Operation Sindoor is due to our technology and the power of ‘Make in India’ in defence. The youth of Bengaluru and Karnataka have contributed a lot to this,” he said, adding that Bengaluru has become a symbol of the new India’s rise.""We are seeing Bangalore emerging as a city that has become a symbol of the rise of the new India... A city that has put India's flag on the global IT map. If there is anything behind Bangalore's success story, it is the hard work and talent of its people,"" the Prime Minister said.This was PM Modi’s first visit to the city since the operation, and he praised India’s ability to destroy terrorist hideouts deep across the border, forcing Pakistan “to its knees” within hours.Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister inaugurated Bengaluru Metro ’s Yellow Line from RV Road (Ragigudda) to Bommasandra, part of the Rs 7,160 crore Phase-2 project.According to news agency ANI, the 19 km route with 16 stations will extend the city’s metro network to over 96 km, benefiting more than six lakh daily commuters. PM Modi also laid the foundation stone for the Rs 15,610 crore Phase-3 project and flagged off three Vande Bharat Express trains, underlining the government’s push for modern, world-class rail travel.However, his comments came amid escalating trade tensions with the United States. US President Donald Trump recently announced tariffs totalling 50% on Indian imports, accusing New Delhi of buying Russian oil and indirectly funding the Ukraine war.","Prime minister narendra modi called for for “zero defect and zero effect” manufacturing for ‘make in india’ he said the next big focus should be a “tech atmanirbhar bharat,” pushing for innovation and self-reliance in technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123217462,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-835001,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: The downing of a large Pakistani aircraft in the air during Operation Sindoor was ""actually the largest-ever recorded surface-to-air kill by India"", Air Chief Marshal A P Singh said Saturday.Delivering the 16th ACM LM Katre memorial lecture in Bengaluru, Singh said, ""One large aircraft, which could be either an ELINT (electronic intelligence) aircraft or an AEW&C (airborne early-warning and control) aircraft, was taken out at a distance of 300km... The S-400 was a game changer for us.""Armed with slides and satellite grabs at Bengaluru that exorcised the ""ghost of Balakot"" in the recent air-to-ground strikes with credible evidence, ACM Singh also said IAF's surface-to-air missile systems, primarily the Russian-origin S-400 'Triumf' air defence system, had ""five confirmed kills"" of Pakistani fighters in the air.The confirmation for all these kills, of course, is only through electronic means, with their blips disappearing from radar screens after being hit by missiles, and not physical since the wreckage of the planes fell in Pakistan.Singh, however, did not quantify the IAF fighter losses during the initial strikes on the nine terror hubs on May 7, which were conducted without suppression or destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) that is typically undertaken before launching any air campaign.Chief of defence staff Gen Anil Chauhan, on the sidelines of the Shangri-La dialogue in Singapore on May 31, had admitted India lost some fighter jets during the initial strikes but then changed tactics (including undertaking SEAD/DEAD) to inflict major damage on Pakistani airbases deep across the border.Other senior officers told TOI that the S-400 system, which has missiles with interception ranges of 120km, 200km, 250km and 380km as well as long-range acquisition and engagement radars, had engaged 16-18 targets in the air during the hostilities.""Apart from the five Pakistani jets and one large aircraft or 'high-value aerial asset', the others were incoming large UAVs, cruise missiles and long-range stand-off weapons like the H2 and H4 precision-guided glide bombs,"" an officer said.The IAF chief, on his part, said three Pakistani aircraft hangars were also targeted during air-to-ground strikes - UAV hangar at Sukkur, AEW&C hangar at Bholari & F-16 hangar at Jacobabad.The IAF deployed Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 jets to launch BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles for calibrated pinpoint strikes.At least one AEW&C aircraft, possibly a Swedish-origin Saab Erieye, and ""a few F-16s"" were under maintenance inside the Bholari and Jacobabad hangars at that time. ""One half of the Jacobabad hangar is gone. I am sure there were some aircraft inside,"" ACM Singh said.Other such strikes destroyed two surface-to-air guided weapon sites at Lahore and Okara, two underground command centres at Murid and Chaklala and six radar centres, ""some big, some small"", the IAF chief added.Officers said these radar sites were at Sukkur, Lahore, Arifwala, Chunian, Jacobabad and Nayachor. Overall, IAF struck eight air bases like Sargodha, Rahimyar Khan, Chaklala, Rafiqi, Jacobabad, Sukkur, Murid and Bholari, with the runways being especially targeted in the first two. The runway at the Rahimyar Khan airbase, incidentally, is still not operational three months after the strikes.","Air chief marshal a p singh said iaf's surface-to-air missile systems had ""five confirmed kills"" of pakistani fighters in the air.

India seeks transparency from China over construction of mega dam on River Brahmaputra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-seeks-transparency-from-china-over-construction-of-mega-dam-on-river-brahmaputra/articleshow/123219826.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

DHARAMSHALA: The Government of India has raised serious concerns over China's reported construction of a mega dam on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, a development that could have significant implications for South Asia's ecology, water security, and geopolitics, according to Phayul.The ministry of external affairs said in a statement that they were carefully monitoring China's hydropower project on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo (upper reaches of the Brahmaputra) River in Tibet.This project, first made public in 1986, has been a subject of concern for India due to its potential impact on the country's interests and the livelihoods of local tribes.Minister of state for external affairs, Kirti Vardhan Singh, said that the government carefully monitors all developments related to the Brahmaputra River and takes necessary measures to protect its interests. The government has consistently conveyed its views and concerns to the Chinese authorities, emphasising the need for transparency and consultation with downstream countries.""The Government of India has taken note of reports about the commencement of construction of the mega dam project by China on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo (upper reaches of the Brahmaputra) River in Tibet. This project was first made public as far back as 1986 and since then, preparations have been underway in China,"" the MEA stated in response to an unstarred question in the Rajya Sabha.The MEA said that the government remained committed to safeguarding Indian interests in the region.""Government carefully monitors all developments relating to the Brahmaputra river, including plans by China to develop hydropower projects, and takes necessary measures to protect our interests, including preventive and corrective measures to safeguard life and livelihood of Indian citizens residing in downstream areas,"" the statement said.The Yarlung Tsangpo originates in Tibet's Jiema Yangzong Glacier near Mount Kailash, flows into Arunachal Pradesh as the Siang, becomes the Brahmaputra in Assam, and eventually merges with the Ganges in Bangladesh before reaching the Bay of Bengal. Any disruptions upstream could directly affect ecosystems, agriculture, and livelihoods across the entire region, Phayul reported.The project is situated in a seismically active and ecologically fragile part of the Himalayas. Environmentalists, quoted by Phayul, have warned that such large-scale infrastructure in this region could have devastating consequences, including disrupted river flows, loss of biodiversity, and increased flood risks.India and China have discussed such issues under the Expert Level Mechanism set up in 2006, as well as through ongoing diplomatic engagement. Singh highlighted that India has urged China to ensure transparency and to engage in meaningful consultations with downstream nations before moving ahead with any hydropower developments, Phayul noted.India has also pressed for the resumption of hydrological data sharing, which China has suspended during crucial monsoon periods in the past. The issue was brought up again during External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's visit to China from July 14-16 for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Foreign Ministers' Meeting, according to Phayul.While China has promoted the dam as part of its renewable energy strategy, India remains wary that the project could allow Beijing to exert control over water flows in South Asia, a strategic tool with far-reaching consequences, Phayul reported.","India has raised serious concerns over china's reported construction of a mega dam on the lower reaches of the yarlung tsangpo river in tibet.

CHENNAI: Pakistan's ""narrative management"" during Operation Sindoor convinced its citizens they had triumphed, but ""victory is in the mind"", Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi said recently, describing how India planned and executed the cross-border strike like a high-stakes chess match.""If you ask a Pakistani whether you lost or won, he'd say my chief has become a field marshal. We must have won only, that's why he's become a field marshal,"" he said at an event at IIT Madras. ""Narrative management system is something we realise in a big way because victory is in the mind. It's always in the mind.""Recounting the operation launched after the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack, Gen Dwivedi said the Army abandoned conventional tactics. ""We were making chess moves. We didn't know the enemy's next move. Somewhere we were giving him the checkmate, and we were going in for the kill at the risk of losing our own. But that's what life is all about.""The planning began a day after the Pahalgam assault, he said. ""This was the first time the Raksha Mantri (defence minister Rajnath Singh) said, 'Enough is enough'. All three chiefs were very clear something had to be done.A free hand was given.

But yes, IAF has projected an urgent need for additional Rafales to stem the depletion in the number of its fighter squadrons,"" a source said.The IAF move comes three months after military hostilities with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, during which the 4.5-generation Rafales were extensively used for long-range strikes across the border.While India has not declared its fighter losses, it has dismissed Pakistan's claim that it shot down six IAF jets, including three Rafales, on May 7. Pakistan used Chinese-origin jets like J-10s, armed with PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles with ranges over 200km, against IAF fighters on that day.With the MRFA case hanging fire for the last seven-eight years after an initial cost estimate of over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, IAF is now grappling with a depleted strength of 31 fighter squadrons (16-18 jets in each). The number will go down to the lowest-ever figure of 29 squadrons after the retirement of the MiG-21s next month.This when IAF is authorised 42.5 squadrons to tackle the collusive challenge from China and Pakistan, which was strongly reinforced during Sindoor. Moreover, China is set to supply Pakistan with at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation stealth jets in the near future.IAF has also projected the requirement for two to three squadrons of 5th-gen fighters, with the Russian Sukhoi-57 and the American F-35 being the contenders, till the indigenous AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft) is ready for production by 2035. ""But no official talks have begun with either Russia or the US yet,"" an official said.The IAF argument is it would make ""much better economic and logistical sense"" to go in for more Rafales through a government-to-government deal in the MRFA project. ""The deal can be concluded faster than going in for an open global tender,"" another source said.IAF inducted 36 Rafales, acquired under the Rs 59,000 crore inter-governmental contract with France in Sept 2016, which are deployed at the Ambala and Hasimara air bases. ""Both air bases already have the infrastructure and storage capacity to base at least one more Rafale squadron each,"" the source said.Navy is also slated to get its 26 Rafale-Marine jets, which will operate from aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, in the 2028-2030 timeframe under the Rs 63,887 crore (almost 7 billion euros) deal inked with France in April. ""There will be a commonality in platforms and equipment if more Rafales are acquired,"" he said.The push for the MRFA comes after a high-level committee, led by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, recently chalked out a detailed roadmap for IAF's ""all-round accelerated capability enhancement"" to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner, with greater participation from the private sector to complement the ongoing efforts of the DRDO and defence PSUs.",Iaf will move the mrfa case for initial acceptance of necessity (aon) the first step in the long-winded procurement process is to be approved by the rajnath singh-led defence acquisition council (dac) iaf is grappling with a depleted strength of 31 fighter squadrons.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123223197,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-12280,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Taylor Swift had once opened up about why she has been so public about her romance with Travis Kelce



Taylor Swift was extremely private about her relationship with Joe Alwyn, years before she met Travis Kelce



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been pretty public about their relationship ever since the two started dating in 2023. The two high profile stars never tried to hide their relationship and were always spotted in public holding hands as they went on their dates. In 2023, just months after Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce began dating, she opened up about why she is so public with the Kansas City Chiefs’ star player.In 2023, the billionaire pop star, Taylor Swift became the 2023 Time Person of the Year. The “Cruel Summer” singer spoke to TIME about her relationship with Travis Kelce and the reason behind their public romance.Taylor Swift said, “When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care…”The billionaire pop star added, “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”Taylor Swift’s public romance with Travis Kelce is completely opposite to how she was with her ex boyfriends, including in her long relationship with Hollywood actor, Joe Alwyn.Taylor Swift has always been extremely protective of her romances and has always tried to keep them out of the public eye.Despite being together for six years, Taylor Swift and her ex boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, were hardly ever spotted together in public.The two were mostly seen hiding their faces and running away from cameras to avoid being linked together.With Travis Kelce, Taylor Swift is completely different as she is extremely public about their expensive date nights. The billionaire pop star shocked her fans when she arrived at the stadium in 2023 to cheer on Travis Kelce, just weeks after rumours of their romance had begun.Now, it’s been two years and Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are deeply in love with each other and are still going strong. While there are speculations about their engagement, neither of them have confirmed their future plans yet and have maintained complete privacy over their much speculated future.It seems the two are in for a long haul and are trying to spend all their time with each other.Also Read: Selena Gomez opens up about Taylor Swift as the singer and Travis Kelce reportedly end all ties with Blake Lively","Taylor swift had opened up about her public romance with travis kelce.

Amid the intense anti-H-1B sentiment in the US, Republican senator Greg Murphy was trolled on X after he said H-1B visas are critical to address the physician shortage in the country. He said rural communities can't find US doctors, and foreign medical graduates are the only ones who treat those patients.""H1-B Visas are critical for helping alleviate the severe physician shortage this nation faces. We cannot train enough American Doctors fast enough. We can’t let lack of knowledge of the importance of this program to affect patient care,"" the Republican leader who is also a physician said.

'India is ‘maharaja’ of tariffs': White House trade adviser calls additional 25% duty 'national security issue',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/50-tariffs-on-india-white-house-trade-adviser-calls-additional-25-duty-national-security-issue-what-peter-navarro-said/articleshow/123182601.cms,"White House trade counselor Peter Navarro

Poll Do you agree with the US imposing a 25% tariff on Indian goods due to national security concerns? Yes, it's necessary for national security. No, it harms trade relations.





White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro has said that the additional 25 per cent tariff imposed on India is a ""national security issue"" connected to New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil.Last week, US President Donald Trump had announced a 25 per cent reciprocal tariff on Indian goods, which came into effect on August 7. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order imposing an additional 25 per cent levy, raising the total duties on Indian goods to 50 per cent, which is among the highest placed on any country by the US.Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, Navarro said the new tariff was different from the earlier one.""This was a pure national security issue associated with India’s abject refusal to stop buying Russian oil,"" he said. He also said, ""every American needs to understand the math of this because it is related to the trade situation.""Navarro added, ""You start with the fact that India is the ‘maharaja’ of tariffs, it’s the highest tariffs in the world charging on American products, and it’s got a high non-tariff barrier so we can’t get our products in.""He claimed that the US sends dollars to India in an “unfair trade environment” to buy Indian goods, and India then uses those dollars to buy Russian oil. According to Navarro, Russia uses the American dollars to fund its military, which is then used in the war against Ukraine.“India then uses American dollars to buy Russian oil. Russia then uses those American dollars that come from India to finance its armaments, to kill Ukrainians, and American taxpayers are then called upon to pay for the weapons that have to defend Ukraine against Russian armaments paid for by American dollars that came from India,” he said.Navarro stated, ""That math does not work. The president understands the connection between economic security and national security so that was the bottom line there.""When asked why China, which imports more Russian oil than India, has not been targeted similarly, Navarro said, ""As the boss says, let's see what happens. Keep in mind that we have over 50 per cent tariffs on China already…so we don't want to get to a point where we actually hurt ourselves.""","White house trade counselor peter navarro has said that the additional 25 per cent tariff imposed on india is a ""national security issue"" navarro claimed that the us sends dollars to india in an “unfair trade environment” to buy indian goods, and india then uses those dollars to buy russian oil.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123185027,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-836962,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'No Pakistani aircraft could come near the boundaries of Akash'

Hardly any collateral near Jaish-e-Mohammad's headquarters

NEW DELHI: Haunted by the ""ghosts of Balakot"", IAF chief Amar Preet Singh on Saturday came fully armed with more visual proof of the precision airstrikes carried out deep inside Pakistan during Operation Sindoor , showcasing the extent of damage inflicted on key military and terror infrastructure.From high-value airbases to the headquarters of ISI-backed terror outfits, the strikes, conducted in retaliation to the Pahalgam killings, demonstrated India’s ability to hit strategic targets with pinpoint accuracy, well inside enemy territory.""I'm very happy that this time we were able to take care of that ghost of Balakot that we were able to tell the world what we have achieved,"" the IAF chief remarked.The evidence included images and videos of the destruction of Pakistan’s Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi, the flattening of Jaish-e-Mohammed ’s command centre in Bahawalpur, and crippling damage to Lashkar-e-Taiba ’s headquarters in Muridke. The IAF also presented proof of severe hits on the Rahim Yar Khan, Sukkur, and Bholari airbases.The strikes inflicted a significant setback on Pakistan’s military capabilities by destroying the Nur Khan Airbase, a key pillar of the country’s air power, during precision strikes under Operation Sindoor.Located in Rawalpindi and formerly known as PAF Chaklala, the base served as the command hub of Pakistan’s Air Mobility Command.It housed critical aerial assets such as Saab Erieye airborne early warning aircraft, C-130 transport planes, and IL-78 aerial refuelling tankers.IAF's precision strikes under Operation Sindoor caused tremendous damage to Jaish-e-Mohammed’s headquarters in Bahawalpur, Pakistan, the ISI-backed terror group’s main command hub.Among those killed were ten members of JeM chief Masood Azhar’s family, marking a major blow to the group’s leadership.Carried out nearly 100 kilometres inside Pakistani territory, the strike was described as the most powerful of the operation, employing India’s most potent weapon.In total, the armed forces eliminated nine terror launchpads, but the Bahawalpur hit was considered the most significant for both strategic and symbolic reasons.Another key terror site that IAF had targeted was Muridke, where Lashkar-e-Taiba's headquarters was located.Demonstrating the level of damage caused by the strikes, IAF chief said, ""This is their senior leadership's residential area. These were their office building where they would get together to conduct meetings. We could get video from the weapons themselves as the location was within range.""The strikes killed around a dozen high-value terrorists in Pakistan, including IC-814 hijacker Yusuf Azhar, Lashkar’s Muridke chief Abu Jundal alias Mudassar, and the son of the 2016 Nagrota attack plotter.The damages at the Rahim Yar Khan airbase from Operation Sindoor was so intense that it remained non-operational for at least two months.The base, located about 230 km south of Bahawalpur, is a key element of Pakistan’s southern air defence due to its proximity to India’s Rajasthan border and was heavily damaged in India’s precision strikes in early May.Situated within an international airport, the airbase first issued a Notam on May 10, closing the runway until May 18, which was later extended. Another closure notice followed in early June, pushing the date to July 4.The image shows the before and after scenes at Sukkur Pakistani airbase. Its dual-use radar was targeted as it is located very close to Rajasthan and used for nefarious activities.At Bholari, strikes targeted the AEW&C hangar.""We attacked three hangars. One was the Sukkur UAV hangar, the Bholari hangar and the Jacobabad F-16 hangar. We have an indication of at least one AEW&C in that AEW&C hangar and a few F-16s, which were under maintenance there,"" IAF chief said.Singh on Saturday said the forces shot down five Pakistani jets and one airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft during the Operation Sindoor. The IAF Chief’s remark is the first confirmation from any high-ranking official of the number of Pakistani jets India damaged during its cross-border anti-terror operation.He also said that India's air defence systems did a wonderful job and praised the S-400 system, calling it a game-changer.""Our air defence systems have done a wonderful job. The S-400 system, which we had recently bought, has been a game-changer. The range of that system has really kept their aircraft away from their weapons like, those long-range glide bombs that they have, they have not been able to use any one of those because they have not been able to penetrate the system,"" the IAF chief said.Read | J&K: 2 soldiers killed as 9-day Kashmir gunfight grinds on He said that as far as India's offensive was concerned, ""that night we didn't have any hold bar and we decided that we would go attack at Pan Front, we would stretch resources"".""None of their aircraft could come anywhere near the boundaries of Akash and even MRSAM. All their aircraft were taken on by LRSAM because they were trying to stay away, but still they were within our range at times, and that is the opportunity targets that we got. As far as our offensive was concerned, that night we didn't have any hold bar and we decided that we would go attack at Pan Front, we would stretch resources. The idea was once again not to attack one particular airfield and decimate that airfield. The idea was to give him that feeling or give him that indication that look, we can attack you deep inside, at will, wherever we want to...Bholari, an AEW&C hangar, was attacked. And here we have a very clear hint that there was an aircraft in sight when this attack took place,"" he said.Showing the before and after images of the damage India caused at Bahawalpur, where the terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed's headquarters are located, Singh said: ""There's hardly any collateral here... The adjacent buildings are fairly intact... Not only did we have satellite pictures, but also from local media, through which we could get inside pictures.""The IAF chief said: ""People got down to their egos in the war...

NEW DELHI: Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi took a swipe at Pakistan over its claim of winning clashes with India in May following Operation Sindoor While speaking at IIT Madras on August 4, Dwivedi said that narrative management plays a key role in war. ""If you ask a Pakistani whether you lost or won, he'd say, 'My chief has become a field marshal. We must have won, that's why he's become a field marshal,'"" he said.Dwivedi was referring to the Pakistan government’s move to promote its Army chief, Asim Munir, to a five-star general and field marshal.He also claimed that the Centre gave a ""free hand"" to the armed forces to execute Operation Sindoor.""What happened on 22 April in Pahalgam shocked the nation. On the 23rd, the next day itself, we all sat down. This is the first time that Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said, 'Enough is enough.' All three chiefs were very clear that something had to be done. The free hand was given — 'you decide what is to be done.' That is the kind of confidence, political direction, and political clarity we saw for the first time,"" Dwivedi said.""That is what raises your morale. That is how it helped our army commanders-in-chief to be on the ground and act as per their wisdom,"" he added.Earlier, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal AP Singh also attributed the success of Operation Sindoor to the “political will” of the central government, asserting that the Indian Armed Forces carried out the mission without any external constraints.Read | Pakistani terror sites to airbases: Haunted by 'ghosts of Balakot', IAF chief comes armed with proof on Operation Sindoor - see news pics “A key reason for success was the presence of political will.

The forces decided what the rules of engagement would be. We decided how we wanted to control the escalation. We had full freedom to plan and execute,” Singh said at an event at the HAL Management Academy in Bengaluru.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people. The armed forces targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists linked to groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen.Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling, attempted drone strikes, and air defence measures.
