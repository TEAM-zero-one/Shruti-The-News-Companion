NEW DELHI: Asserting that ""India will not bow down to anybody"", commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday that countries will restructure their trade routes and partners.""The world keeps evolving, international trade keeps finding new pathways. What we are seeing today is possibly a churn that is bound to happen every few years - new countries come up, some go down. This is India's time,"" he said at a Business Today event. The minister said India's exports during the current fiscal year will be higher than last year. In 2024-25, India's exports reached a record $825 billion, with goods shipments valued at over $437 billion, around the same level as the previous year.Asked about the impact of Trump tariffs, he retorted by saying that India finds opportunities in crisis. ""The nation's morale is high... There is a lot of strength in the Indian economy... India will emerge as the winner,"" he said.Trump's tariffs have induced uncertainty, especially with Indian exports to the US going to attract 50% duty from Aug 27.

Army-IAF launch another hunt for 200 light choppers to replace old Cheetahs & Chetaks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-seeks-200-copters-to-replace-ageing-cheetah-chetak-fleet/articleshow/123196628.cms,"From Crown Jewel To Flying Coffin: IAF To Phase Out Iconic Mig-21 Fighter Jets After 62 Years

NEW DELHI: India has once again resumed the hunt to replace its old single-engine Cheetah and Chetak helicopters, which lack modern avionics, in-built safety mechanisms and have been dogged by a high crash rate just like the MiG-21 fighters, causing the death of scores of pilots over the years.The Army on Friday issued a request for information (RFI) to vendors for the acquisition of 120 reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters (RSHs) and another 80 for the IAF. “The defence ministry intends to urgently replace the fleet of existing Cheetah and Chetak helicopters with suitable light helicopters of modern design,” the RFI said.The RSHs should be able to perform surveillance by day and night, transport small number troops for special missions, carry internal and external loads in support of ground operations and perform a “scout role” in conjunction with attack helicopters, the RFI added.The armed forces have been demanding new light helicopters to replace their around 350 Cheetah and Chetak choppers, which are of the design vintage of the 1960s, for well over two decades now. They have sounded the alarm several times but to no avail till now, as reported by TOI earlier.Defence officials told TOI the 200 RSHs will add to the 187 (Army 126, IAF 61) light utility helicopters (LUHs), in the 3-tonne class, being built by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) in another long-delayed project.Progressive induction of these new LUHs will see the Army finally begin to retire its old Cheetahs and Chetaks from 2027 onwards, with the entire retirement-induction plan taking around a decade, an officer said. A separate `Make in India’ project for 60 Utility Helicopter-Marines for the Navy, incidentally, is also yet to take off.It’s, however, very early days for the RSHs. The Army itself said the RFI has been issued to finalise staff qualitative requirements, decide the procurement category and identify probable vendors, including Indian companies forming joint ventures or production arrangements with foreign original equipment manufacturers.While the Cheetahs and Chetaks have certainly been the workhorses of the 14-lakh strong armed forces, especially in high-altitude and forward areas, they have also grappled with poor serviceability and maintainability.The Cheetahs lack modern avionics and glass cockpits that assist in stability augmentation and build better situational awareness for the pilots to operate in low visibility and bad weather conditions.Officials are keeping their fingers crossed this time. For instance, the inter-governmental agreement inked with Russia in 2015 for 200 twin-engine Kamov-226T choppers for Army (135) and IAF (65) in a `Make in India’ project worth around $2 billion, eventually failed to take off due to pricing and other issues.","The army on friday issued a request for information to vendors for the acquisition of 120 reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters.

No trade talks till tariff issue resolved: Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-trade-talks-till-tariff-issue-resolved-trump/articleshow/123196616.cms,"MoD denies report of Rajnath cancelling US trip

There was suspense over the fate of the India-US trade negotiations after American President Donald Trump said that there would be no talks till the tariff issue is resolved. ""No, not until we get it resolved,"" Trump said on Thursday while responding to a query on whether he expected more trade negotiations with India.A team of US negotiators is scheduled to reach Delhi on Aug 24 to hold talks in what, by all indications, is going to be a tough salvage job. But India was not ready to slam the door shut on a possible rapprochement yet. On Friday evening, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal listed the US among countries with which India was negotiating trade treaties. He, however, did not elaborate on the talks. tnnBut the temperature has soared since last week after US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on India and then doubled it as ""penalty"" for India's arms and oil imports from Russia, although his administration has been cosying up to Moscow and talks with President Vladimir Putin are likely over the next few weeks. India has also hit back at the US, with PM Modi asserting that there will be no compromise on the interests of farmers, fisherfolk and dairy farmers.Concessions for agriculture and dairy were among key items on which India had drawn the red line during five rounds of discussions with the US.With tariff tensions continuing to rise, speculation, triggered by a news agency that defence minister Rajnath Singh had cancelled his US trip and some of the defence deals were being reassessed, gained virality.It furiously did the rounds until the ministry of defence stepped in with a denial.During Trump's first presidency, too, India and the US had begun discussions for a mini trade deal, but it was abandoned midway due to serious differences over retaliatory tariffs. This time, Trump has been weaponising tariffs against countries and settling for deals which impose at least 10% additional duty on each country, while getting contracts for American companies and claiming market access for goods. While India and the US began talks in March for a trade deal by fall (Sept/Oct), Trump went ahead and announced ""reciprocal tariffs"" in April and sought to get countries to the negotiating table. With govt rebutting his claims that it agreed to suspend Operation Sindoor on the promise of a trade deal, Trump is seen to have brought Russian oil and defence purchases into the picture.","Mod denies report of rajnath cancelling us trip.

China remained the top bu-yer of Russian energy with a tab of over EUR 200 billion (20,000 crore).The report points out the growing role of G7 tankers in transporting Russian oil since the EU's June sanctions. This underlines the disconnect between western policy and practice pointed out by New Delhi. ""Since Jan, the G7+ share in Russian oil transport has increased from 36% to 56%,"" it says. More than half of Russian seaborne oil exports were transported in G7+ tankers in June, reflecting a six percentage point increase over May.Use of western tanker fleet means those shipments were compliant with the price cap and other terms of the sanctions. India argues it has helped prevent a flare-up in oil prices by buying Russian oil, accounting for about 9% of daily global supply. That is also the key consideration that led the US and the EU to opt for a price cap - rather than choking off the flow with sanctions - for curbing funding for Moscow's war efforts without spooking the oil markets.Overall, however, the report does say that ""Russian fossil fuel revenues in second quarter of 2025 dropped by 18% year-on-year - lowest in a quarter since the invasion of Ukraine. This occurred despite an 8% increase in volumes exported in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025.""Read | Trump tariffs: Exporters on edge, fear losing orders","European union countries account for 23% of russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports.

SC to examine validity of BNS 'sedition' provision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-examine-validity-of-bns-sedition-provision/articleshow/123196299.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine the constitutional validity of the 'sedition' provision in Section 152 of BNS and tagged the petition on this issue to pending petitions that challenged the validity of Section 124A of IPC.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria issued notice to the Centre on the petition filed by retired Maj Gen S G Vombatkere, who alleged that BNS Section 152 was merely a rewording of the sedition provision defined in IPC Section 124A, which had the maximum penalty of life sentence.In a PIL filed through advocate Prasanna S, he said, ""Section 152 of BNS reintroduces the colonial sedition law, Section 124A of IPC. Though the language is altered, its substantive content - criminalising vague and broad categories of speech and expression such as 'subversive activity', 'encouragement of separatist feelings', and acts 'endangering unity or integrity of India' - remains the same or is even more expansive. "" He was among petitioners who challenged the validity of the IPC section earlier.On April 23, 2023, a bench led by then CJI D Y Chandrachud had referred to a five-judge bench to decide the validity of the sedition provision under IPC Section 124A after rejecting govt's plea to pause judicial scrutiny and await Parliament's view on the proposed new penal code in BNS.On May 11,2022, a bench headed by then CJI N V Ramana had suspended operation of the sedition provision to stop police from invoking it against anyone and also stayed both probe and trial in existing sedition cases to allow the Centre to examine pruning the rigour of Section 124A.

Putin briefed Modi about developments related to the Russia-Ukraine war, including his talks this week with Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff. Ahead of his proposed meeting with Trump, Putin also briefed Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping Friday about Ukraine.While dates for Putin’s India visit are still being worked out, the leaders are expected to meet later this month in Tianjin for the SCO summit. An official announcement by India is still awaited but China practically confirmed Modi’s participation as its foreign ministry said Friday that “China welcomes PM Modi to China for the SCO Tianjin summit” and that leaders of all member-states will attend the meetings.Except the last SCO summit in Kazakhstan, Modi has participated in most such meetings of the Eurasian bloc in the past but his likely presence alongside Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, at a time India’s ties with the US have gone into a tailspin, is unlikely to be overlooked in Washington. The summit begins August 31, days after Trump’s additional 25 percent tariff on India will come into effect in case both sides are unable to reach a trade agreement.“Had a very good and detailed conversation with my friend President Putin. I thanked him for sharing the latest developments on Ukraine. We also reviewed the progress in our bilateral agenda, and reaffirmed our commitment to further deepen the India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership. I look forward to hosting President Putin in India later this year,” Modi himself said in a post on X.NSA Ajit Doval, who called on Putin this week, had said in Moscow on Thursday that the date for the India-Russia annual summit had been almost finalised. Doval had said on Thursday that the date for Putin’s visit, which has been on the cards since late last year, has been almost finalised. Trump imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on India for its energy imports from Russia, even though China continues to purchase more from Moscow.According to an Indian readout, Putin briefed Modi about the latest developments related to the war with Ukraine. “While thanking President Putin for his detailed assessment, Prime Minister reiterated India’s consistent position for peaceful resolution of the conflict,” said the Indian statement. Putin is likely to meet Trump soon as the latter works to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.It’s in India’s interest that the war be stopped soon as that would render untenable Trump’s secondary sanctions against India. Modi again invited Putin to India later this year for the 23rd India-Russia Annual Summit. As of now, Putin’s visit is likely to take place either in November or early December, according to government sources.","Pm narendra modi and russian president vladimir putin spoke friday, reaffirming their commitment to strengthen india-russia relations.

Global rights organisation Amnesty also questioned the move. The home department has described the action as part of an ongoing crackdown on publications allegedly promoting secessionist ideologies, glorifying terrorism, or disseminating distorted historical narratives.Chief minister Omar Abdullah responded to accusations that he had ordered the ban. “Get your facts right before you call me a coward, you ignoramus. The ban has been imposed by the LG using the only department he officially controls - the Home Department. I’ve never banned books & I never would,” Omar posted on X, responding to the allegations.Following Tuesday’s order under section 98 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) 2023, police had on Thursday seized allegedly “subversive” books from stores and literary venues, including Chinar book festival on the banks of Dal Lake.NC spokesman Tanvir Sadiq asked “why we are so afraid of differing opinions”. “History shows that banning books only fuels curiosity, people want to know why something is banned, and readership often increases as a result. Silencing or intimidating opinions never worked and it won’t work now,” Sadiq said.Amnesty India stressed that of the 25 banned books, including Roy’s Azadi, many were written by respected journalists, historians, feminists, and peace scholars, and these weren’t “terror manuals” but “critical voices”. “Censoring books on the basis of an executive notification without due process and judicial oversight doesn’t bring peace; it silences dissent. When govts fear ideas, it tells you more about the state than the speech,” Amnesty said in a statement.Thursday’s seizures included copies of A Dismantled State: The Untold Story of Kashmir After Article 370 by Anuradha Bhasin, The Kashmir Dispute, 1947–2012 by Noorani, and Kashmir at the Crossroads by Sumantra Bose.","J&k's governing national conference decries banning books as 'unfortunate and deeply ill-conceived' lg manoj sinha-led home department banned 25 titles, including some by booker-prize winning author arundhati roy and constitutionalist ag noorani.

NEW DELHI: PM Modi responded on Thursday to US President Donald Trump's decision to raise the tariff against India to 50% by ruling out concessions to American business in the agriculture, dairy and fishery sectors, and said he was ready to pay any price he may personally have to pay for resisting the pressure.""For us, the interests of our farmers is top priority. India will never compromise on the interests of its farmers, dairy farmers and fishermen. I know I will personally have to pay a heavy price but I am prepared for it,"" Modi said.The PM's remarks came hours after Trump imposed an additional 25% tariff burden on Indian goods as a penalty for, ostensibly, buying Russian oil, bringing the overall duty on Indian exports to 50% and further fanning tariff tensions. US's insistence on access to agriculture, dairy and fishery sectors has been among the major points of discord, with India putting its foot down. ""For the farmers of my country, for the fishermen of my country, for the livestock rearers of my country, Bharat stands ready today,"" he said.The PM's response on Thursday built upon his earlier public ""no"", the one at Varanasi on Saturday, to US's pressure. The US has not only been demanding low tariffs on certain farm products such as corn, soybeans, apples, cotton, almonds and ethanol, but also pitching for allowing entry of its genetically modified produce like maize, soy, canola & cotton into Indian market.It also wants India to let in beef and cattle feed, which has bones & other animal parts; both absolutely ""no-go"" zones for govt.During trade negotiations, India resisted the US demand to lower tariffs on these products as it will negatively impact Indian farmers who produce maize, soybean, pulses, cotton and fruits and nuts. India also opposed the American move to push GM products due to biosafety concerns.Significantly, the ""whatever-it-takes"" assertion came during the PM's speech at an event to mark the centenary of legendary agricultural scientist M S Swaminathan, the driving force behind 'Green Revolution' which helped India overcome its dependence on US foodgrains and shake off the stigma of ""ship-to mouth"" economy. Modi's statement about his readiness to pay a ""personal price"" also marked an escalation of Indian resistance and the transformation of the trade dispute into an issue of national pride and self-reliance.With Modi taking it upon himself to lead the ""resistance"", Trump's claim, already neutered by his hectoring, that he had leveraged a promise of a tariff deal to get India to pause Operation Sindoor, appeared to have receded into the background.Outlining his vision for Indian agriculture, Modi, on the occasion, pushed for combining traditional Indian agricultural practices with modern science, and emphasised the need to ensure nutritional security, crop diversification and development of climate-resilient crop varieties. He also pitched for integration of AI and machine learning in agricultural systems.""Govt has always considered the strength of farmers as the foundation of national progress,"" Modi said, noting that the policies formulated in recent years were not merely about assistance, but about instilling confidence among farmers.","Pm's readiness to pay 'personal price' marks escalation of resistance to us demands.
