I should not be under protection in a country like this,” said Patnaik.His remarks came amidst efforts by both sides to rebuild the relationship after the diplomatic strife over Khalistan -related issues. India has indicated that it is willing to move on and recently hosted Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand in a sign that it does not want the relationship to remain hostage to the Khalistan issue. Anand and her counterpart S Jaishankar announced a series of initiatives during the visit to restore the relationship. However, concerns remain about the anti-India activities of Khalistan separatists in Canada.In another interview, to The Canadian Press, Patnaik had said the aggressive tone of the Khalistan movement was scaring away investment. “While we are trying to move trade forward, a whole lot of businesspeople (in India) feel uncomfortable because they see this as a place where violence, extortion, intimidation is rising,” he said last Thursday. “Nobody wants that kind of impression,” he added.",India's new high commissioner to canada dinesh patnaik has rejected as politically motivated allegations made by both the royal canadian mounted police (rcmp) and former prime minister justin trudeau.

NEW DELHI: London-based academician and researcher Francesca Orsini was on Monday denied entry into India upon arrival at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here, as she “was blacklisted in March this year for having violated the conditions of her tourist visa by undertaking research during her previous visits”, according to govt sources.Orsini, Professor Emerita of Hindi and South Asian Literature at the School of Languages, Cultures and Linguistics in London, is a literary historian working with Hindi and Urdu texts and has been researching into how multilingualism works within the literary cultures of South Asia. Orsini had reportedly arrived in Delhi from Hong Kong before she was deported.“She was denied entry in line with the visa rules. It had come to the agencies’ notice that she was doing research projects while in India on a tourist visa. This is a clear violation of her visa conditions. As per standard global practice, if a person is found violating visa conditions, he or she can be blacklisted,” a senior govt official told TOI. To undertake research in India, a foreign national must have an ‘R’ visa.As some prominent persons, including Opposition MPs, took to X to slam Orsini’s deportation without being offered a reason as mark of “a govt that is insecure, paranoid and even stupid,” officials stressed that it is every nation’s sovereign right to admit or deny entry to a foreigner.“In this case, the subject was blacklisted and offering an explanation is not mandatory while deporting a blacklisted person,” said the official.In Feb last year, another UK academic, Nitasha Kaul, was deported upon arrival at Bengaluru airport on the basis of a preventive lookout circular opened against her after Indian agencies flagged her consistent “pro-separatist” comments and “anti-India” line on Kashmir on public fora. Her ‘overseas citizen of India’ was also cancelled later.An application for R visa must specify the subject or topic of the research project, details of places to be visited in India during the project period, details of any previous visits to India, certificate of affiliation from a recognised Indian university or institution and evidence of financial resources to meet the expenses for stay in India.","London-based academician and researcher francesca orsini was on monday denied entry into india upon arrival at the indira gandhi international airport.

"India restores embassy in Kabul, Taliban to appoint 2 diplomats in Delhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-taliban-ministers-visit-kabul-embassy-restored/articleshow/124729352.cms,"India Upgrades Technical Mission In Kabul To Full Embassy After Afghan FM Muttaqi’s Delhi Visit

NEW DELHI: India restored its embassy in Kabul Tuesday, following the announcement during Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s recent visit to India that it would upgrade its technical mission to the level of embassy. As per the understanding reached between the 2 sides, India will designate the head of the mission in Kabul as chargé d'affaires, eventually appointing an ambassador, and the Taliban are expected to send 2 diplomats to New Delhi by November this year.The diplomats will work out of the Afghan embassy here, even in the absence of a formal recognition by India of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), the name used by Taliban for Afghanistan. The elevation of diplomatic ties clears the path for expansion of economic cooperation between the 2 countries, allowing India to contribute more meaningfully to the development of Afghanistan, even as its position on recognition remains largely aligned with that of the international community.Muttaqi’s unprecedented visit to India and the decision to ramp up diplomatic ties came in the middle of mounting tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan that saw deadly border skirmishes while Muttaqi was still in India.“In keeping with the decision announced during the recent visit of the Afghan Foreign Minister to India, the Government is restoring the status of the Technical Mission of India in Kabul to that of Embassy of India in Afghanistan with immediate effect,” said the Indian government in a statement, adding the decision underscored India’s resolve to deepen its bilateral engagement with the Afghan side in all spheres of mutual interest.The government also said that the embassy will further augment India’s contribution to Afghanistan’s comprehensive development, humanitarian assistance, and capacity-building initiatives, in line with the priorities and aspirations of Afghan society.India had shut its embassy after the return of the Taliban to Kabul in August, 2021. However, following security assurances from Kabul, India started to run a technical mission from the premises in June 2022, mainly to oversee distribution of Indian humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.The Taliban see Muttaqi’s visit as marking a new phase in the relationship. Significantly, both sides committed to respecting each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and, in a message to Pakistan, also unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from “regional countries”. Taliban’s backing of India’s sovereignty over J&K had also angered Pakistan, leading to lodging of a formal protest by Islamabad with Kabul.Earlier this week, the Taliban also dismissed Pakistani claims about India’s role in fomenting tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan as baseless and illogical.""These accusations are groundless. Our policy will never involve using our territory against other countries. We maintain relations with India as an independent nation and will strengthen those ties within the framework of our national interests,” said Afghanistan’s defence minister Mawlawi Mohammad Yaqoob. The 2 countries agreed to a ceasefire this week after talks in Doha.“At the same time, we will preserve our relations with Pakistan based on good neighborliness. Our aim is to expand relations, not create tensions. Pakistan’s accusations are unfounded, illogical, and unacceptable,” added the minister.Aligning with the global community on the issue of recognition for the Taliban government, India has also continued to raise issues related to the need for a more inclusive government in Afghanistan and respect for rights of women and children. Russia remains the only country to have formally recognised the government in Kabul, while others like China and Pakistan have accepted Taliban ambassadors and diplomats.","India upgrades technical mission in kabul to full embassy after afghan fm muttaqi’s delhi visit.

The purchase is part of India’s broader strategy to expand its advanced missile defence systems amid evolving regional threats.India signed a deal with Russia in 2018 to acquire five S-400 squadrons. Three have already been delivered on time, but the Russia-Ukraine war delayed the delivery of the fourth unit.India has requested Moscow to expedite the remaining deliveries and is also exploring the possibility of adding more S-400 and even S-500 systems in the future.Alongside the missile purchase, India and Russia are also holding talks on acquiring new air-to-air missiles to strengthen India’s beyond-visual-range capabilities.

KULLU: A 27-year-old Canadian paraglider died after crash-landing into the Dhauladhar mountains in Himachal Pradesh last week, while two foreign pilots were rescued from the upper reaches of Kangra and Kullu districts on Monday. In keeping with her wishes, Megan Elizabeth from Canada was cremated in Bir as per Hindu rituals on Tuesday.All three paragliders had taken off from the 8000-ft Bir-Billing site near Dharamshala, which draws adventure-seekers from across the world. Elizabeth took off at 9.45am Saturday (Oct 18), but was forced to crash-land below a rocky cliff in the Dhauladhar mountains, around 40km away, at an altitude of 4,000m (13,120ft).A search and rescue operation was launched as soon as Kangra administration was informed of the accident. A team from Billing Paragliding Association (BPA) carried out helicopter sorties in the Dhauladhar mountains and dropped its leader, Rahul Singh, near the site where Elizabeth had crash-landed on Saturday evening, as there was no space for landing a chopper. Singh was to find Elizabeth and help her survive until a full rescue team arrived, but he couldn’t locate her and spent the night on a cliffside.On Sunday morning, four more BPA team members were air-dropped, and they managed to locate her body.“Elizabeth was forced to crash-land either due to a sudden weather change or because of a problem with her glider. She used the reserve glider while crash-landing, but I guess she was flying at a low altitude and hit the rocks while landing. She sustained serious head injuries,” said BPA founder-director Suresh Thakur.BPA members carried Elizabeth’s body down for over 1,000m (nearly 3,300ft) until a chopper could airlift it to Kangra, where an autopsy was conducted. The two paragliders rescued Monday were Russian Nikita Vasiltsov and Austrian Jakob Krammer. Nikita (38) had crash-landed near Patalsu peak in Pir Panjal range near Manali, around 70km from where he took off, at an altitude of around 4,000m.Hundreds of ‘free flyers’ (solo pilots) from around the world gather in Bir-Billing in Oct every year, which is considered the best time for cross-country flights. However, Bir-Billing has seen frequent paragliding accidents and fatalities.In the past decade, over a dozen solo paragliders — mostly foreign nationals — have died after taking off from Bir-Billing, six of them in the last three years.","Megan elizabeth, 27, died after crash-landing into the dhauladhar mountains in himachal pradesh.

"Charges against Sonam Wangchuk ‘flimsy, childish, baseless’: Wife",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/charges-against-sonam-wangchuk-flimsy-childish-baseless-wife/articleshow/124727934.cms,"SRINAGAR: Jailed climate activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife Dr Gitanjali J Angmo submitted Tuesday a detailed representation to Ladakh administration , National Security Act (NSA) advisory board, and Union home ministry, calling the charges against her husband “flimsy, childish and baseless”.The representation responds to the NSA order issued on Sept 27 and the grounds of arrest dated Sept 28, following the Sept 24 police firing in Leh that left four people dead and over 70 wounded during violent protests demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh.“We have stated that the accusations against Sonam Wangchuk, based on videos, are very flimsy. His video speeches have been taken out of context,” Angmo said. “The NSA charge sheet cites several videos, but we have provided full versions with subtitles and transcripts to show that the allegations are baseless.”Angmo, co-founder of Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh, said one of the videos cited by authorities was “grossly misinterpreted”. “In one clip, he refers to revolutions in Bangladesh and Nepal and Gen Z but clearly says ours should be peaceful. Authorities twisted this to claim he was calling for similar protests in Ladakh,” she said.Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike for Sixth Schedule safeguards and statehood on Sept 9, accusing Centre of delaying talks on Ladakh’s democratic rights. The home ministry had announced a new round of talks for Oct 6, but violence broke out on Sept 24, prompting him to break his fast. Authorities later arrested more than 70 people, including Wangchuk, who was subsequently moved to Jodhpur jail.Angmo said her husband’s case “is not about law and order but about silencing a voice that speaks for Ladakh’s people”.“NSA is meant for terrorists and smugglers,” Angmo said. “We have clearly stated that Sonam poses no threat, has never been a threat, and his arrest is an attempt to silence his voice and the peaceful movement for Ladakh’s statehood.”She questioned the timing and relevance of the charges. “The FIRs mentioned are old, and the videos are one year old. How can such videos incite a protest now?” she asked.She said 11 videos were listed, including unrelated ones. “For instance, during last year’s long march, Sonam was held briefly in New Delhi. When some youths in Ladakh observed a spontaneous bandh, it was attributed to him and his supporters. People love him — their actions were voluntary,” she said.According to Angmo, officials also misread Wangchuk’s remarks on the Ladakh Scouts. “They allege he demotivated the force in case of war with Pakistan or China. What he actually said was that border residents should be kept content so they can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Army,” she said.Angmo said another video was misquoted to suggest Wangchuk urged confrontation with China. “In reality, he was quoting a comedian and rejecting that view. He clarified that while one may differ with any political party, we will always stand with India and its Army,” she said.The representation was drafted by senior lawyer and Congress RS MP Vivek Tankha and others. He later wrote on X: “How can Govt even conceive detaining @Wangchuk66 (a Gandhian) under NSA after the kind of exemplary work he has done in Ladhak…. My appeal to Govt order his release…”","Jailed climate activist sonam wangchuk ’s wife dr gitanjali j angmo submitted a detailed representation to ladakh administration and national security act advisory board.

Double delight as 2 comets captured over Indian skies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/double-delight-as-2-comets-captured-over-indian-skies/articleshow/124731183.cms,"In the season of the festival of lights, two rare comets are illuminating the skies over India (and the rest of the world). Both comets — C/2025 R2 (SWAN) and C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) — can currently be seen through binoculars from dark sky locations and are expected to be at their brightest this week.TOI captured both these icy outer-space visitors on camera on the trekking route to Dayara bugyal near Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand last week. These are among the first wide-angle visuals of the comets clicked from India. While both have a characteristic tail, its currently more prominent in comet Lemmon.SWAN isn’t expected to return to our solar system in 20,000 years while the next chance for observers on Earth to catch a glimpse of Lemmon will be in the year 3175. This is a double delight for stargazers as it’s rare for two large comets to appear in the sky at the same time. Both comets had their closest flyby of Earth over the past two days, SWAN on Monday and Lemmon on Tuesday.There’s uncertainty over whether these dusty snowballs will get bright enough to be seen with naked eyes. Some estimates suggest that Lemmon may brighten further.Lemmon is the brighter of the two with a current visibility of magnitude 4.5, as per SpaceWeather.com, which technically puts it in visual range.In the -1 to 10 apparent magnitude scale, any celestial object of a magnitude below 6.5 should be visible to the eye. However, as per most accounts, the comet can currently be only seen through a pair of binoculars or a telescope. However, both show up in long-exposure camera shots.The best time to view the comets this week is an hour after sunset, around 7pm. Lemmon appears in the northwest horizon in the Bootes constellation, close to the ‘handle’ of Big Dipper (Saptrishi). It sets around 7.45pm.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he spoke with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the two leaders talked about trade and Pakistan situation. The conversation came on the occasion of Diwali , as he went on to light lamps at the White House.""Let me extend our warmest wishes to the people of India. I just spoke to your Prime Minister today. Had a great conversation. We talked about trade... He's very interested in that. Although we did talk a little while ago about let's have no wars with Pakistan.

The trade talks between the two nations are on.Talking about the China tariff situation, he said, ""... Right now, as of November 1st, China will have about 155% tariffs put on it. I don't think it's sustainable for them. I want to be nice to China. But China has been very rough with us over the years because we had presidents that weren't smart from a business standpoint.""He also addressed the Middle East situation and said, ""We are forging peace all over the world... We're getting everybody to get along. I just got a call from the Middle East. We're doing very well there. We have many countries signed on to peace in the Middle East, and nobody thought they'd ever see that happening.""The Hamas situation, they're pretty violent people. We could put that out in two minutes. We're giving them a chance. They agreed that they'd be very good and straight. They wouldn't be killing people. If they don't honour the deal, they'll be taken care of very quickly. It is total peace in the Middle East; we have levels of friendship with everybody.

SC: Expenditure for exploring business in India part of IT deduction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-expenditure-for-exploring-business-in-india-part-of-it-deduction/articleshow/124729344.cms,"NEW DELHI: More than 25 years after a French oil exploration company was denied business expenditure deductions in income tax assessment, Supreme Court has ruled that even if the efforts of the foreign company failed to materialise into a contract, it cannot be denied expenditure deductions from IT assessment.Pride Foramer SA, incorporated in France and engaged in oil drilling activities, was awarded a 10-year contract by ONGC in 1983 till 1993. Thereafter, it failed to procure another contract till Oct 1998. It produced before IT officials relevant material to show that between 1993-98, it had continuous business correspondences with ONGC regarding hiring of manpower services in respect of expert key personnel for drilling in deep waters and had unsuccessfully submitted a bid in 1996.Between 1993-98, the company claimed business expenditure deductions. This was allowed by the commissioner of income tax but Uttarakhand HC in 2009 reversed the decision. The company appealed against this before SC.A bench of Justices Manoj Misra and Joymalya Bagchi faulted the HC’s view that since the appellant did not have an office in India, it could not claim to have carried out business in India.SC said, “This view is wholly fallacious and contrary to the very scheme of the IT Act.”Writing the judgment, Justice Bagchi said, “The issue of ‘permanent establishment’ may be relevant for the purposes of availing the beneficial provisions of Double Tax Avoidance Agreement ... which is not a relevant consideration.”“In an era of globalisation whose life blood is trans-national trade and commerce, the HC’s restrictive interpretation that a non-resident company making business communications with an Indian entity from its foreign office cannot be construed to be carrying on business in India is wholly anachronistic with India’s commitment to Sustainable Development Goal relating to ‘ease of doing business’ across national borders,” SC said.","Pride foramer sa, incorporated in france and engaged in oil drilling activities, was awarded a 10-year contract by ongc in 1983 till 1993.

What Trump said?





Will the president decide his own payout?





Trump filed multimillion-dollar claims against DOJ before reelection





The New York Times





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that his Justice Department might owe $230 million — and he’d be the one to decide whether to cut himself a check.Trump is seeking $230 million as compensation for past investigations into him, though he professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.“It could be,” Trump responded when asked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins about a New York Times report that he was seeking the money in connection with complaints he had filed about past DOJ investigations.“I don’t know about the numbers. I don’t even talk to them about it. All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I’m not looking for money. I’d give it to charity or something,” Trump said in the Oval Office.Though many of the details remain unclear, Trump acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the situation in which he would be potentially “paying myself” damages to resolve claims that the DOJ under his predecessor had wronged him.""That decision would have to go across my desk. And it's awfully strange to make a decision where I'm paying myself. In other words, did you ever have one of those cases where you have to decide how much you’re paying yourself in damages?"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the report.""But I was damaged very greatly.""As a private citizen, President claimed he was entitled to money from the government.As president, he could now, in effect, order that government to pay him. If the payment came in the form of a settlement, the White House might be under no legal obligation to disclose it to the public, the Washington Post reported.The New York Times reported Tuesday on that Trump was seeking $230 million in compensation and that any settlement might be approved by Justice Department officials who defended Trump, or those around him, during the investigations.Trump first lodged the complaints in 2023 and 2024 — before his reelection — alleging that he was wronged by past federal investigations,reported.The first claim centers on alleged violations of his rights during the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The second focuses on the classified documents case, which was dismissed after his return to office, and accuses the FBI of breaching his privacy during the 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago estate. That filing reportedly sought $100 million in damages, as per CNN.“President Trump continues to fight back against all Democrat-led witch hunts,” his legal spokesperson said, calling the investigations part of the “weaponization of our justice system by Crooked Joe Biden and his handlers.”The Times noted it remains unclear whether Trump or his lawyers have taken new steps to pursue payment. Both filings were made under an administrative process that allows citizens to seek compensation from federal agencies — a procedure separate from a court lawsuit.Complicating matters, two senior Justice Department officials who could now review Trump’s claims previously defended him or his associates. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche served as Trump’s criminal defense attorney, while Civil Division chief Stanley Woodward represented one of Trump’s co-defendants in the classified documents case.","Trump is seeking $230 million as compensation for past investigations into him, though he professed to have little knowledge of the specifics.

Who is Paul Ingrassia?





Recent setbacks for high profile government nominations





After the ""racist and pro Nazi"" chats leaked, US President Donald Trump ’s pick to lead a federal watchdog agency withdrew from consideration Tuesday evening.Paul Ingrassia had been scheduled to attend his confirmation hearing with the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) during the week. However, on Monday, Politico reported a text conversation in which Ingrassia said some racist comments.Politico revealed that Ingrassia said that the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell and referring to former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy , said: “Never trust a chinaman or Indian."" The texts also showed Ingrassia describing himself in the chat as having “a Nazi streak” at times.After the texts were made public, several Republican senators, including some of President Trump’s most conservative allies in the Senate, announced they would not support his nomination.“I will be withdrawing myself from Thursday’s HSGAC hearing to lead the Office of Special Counsel because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time,” Ingrassia posted in an online message.“I appreciate the overwhelming support that I have received throughout the process and will continue to serve President Trump and the administration to Make America Great Again!”Ingrassia’s withdrawal followed remarks from Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who expressed hope that the White House would retract his nomination.While Republicans have generally succeeded in advancing the majority of President Trump’s nominees in roll call votes despite strong Democratic opposition, there have been occasional instances of internal resistance, typically behind the scenes, indicating limits to their support.Paul Joseph Ingrassia is an American attorney and political commentator who, as of 2025, served as White House liaison to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).He also briefly served as liaison to the Department of Justice earlier that year.Ingrassia studied mathematics and economics at Fordham University before attending Cornell Law School, where he served as senior online editor for the Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy.He is known for his conservative political views and has contributed writings to outlets like National Review and The Daily Caller. Ingrassia co-hosted a podcast and gained attention for controversial political commentary frequently cited and shared by former President Donald Trump.In May-2025, Trump nominated Ingrassia to lead the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency responsible for protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service laws.The White House indefinitely paused the judicial nomination of former Florida Deputy Attorney General John Guard due to his involvement with a charity under criminal investigation, Axios reported on Monday.Trump also withdrew economist E.J. Antoni's nomination to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics late last month amid concerns he was viewed as unqualified and too partisan.Earlier this year, the White House pulled Dave Weldon's nomination to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","'never trust an indian': racist revelations threaten trump pick paul ingrassia's senate confirmation hearing.

'Hope properly investigated': Kramnik suggests substance abuse



How Kramnik and Naroditsky’s relationship evolved — from public glasses







American chess Grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky took his last breath on Sunday, at the age of 29, his family confirmed on Monday.Naroditsky, known as “Danya” in the chess community, was among the world’s top-ranked blitz players and a well-known chess commentator, author, and content creator.Till now there has no news on the reason behind the death, however, former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik has alleged a foul play, hinting at possible drug use and alleging that signs of distress were ignored by those close to Naroditsky.Vladimir Kramnik, who previously accused Naroditsky of cheating in 2024, shared screenshots on social media from a private message sent by a viewer who had watched Naroditsky’s final stream.The message expressed concern over Naroditsky’s condition and questioned whether he was under the influence of drugs.Sharing the screenshot, Kramnik tweeted, ""What exactly happened? Because I received this two days ago from a friend of mine, chess fan, and at least did what I could to warn people to do something urgently in my posts. To those who prefer blaming and shaming instead of helping. Awful tragedy, hope properly investigated.""Before Naroditsky’s death was confirmed, Kramnik had posted several tweets suggesting the streamer was “on something else than sleeping pills.”After the news broke, he continued to criticize those close to Naroditsky, alleging they ignored signs of serious problems.In another tweet, he wrote, ""Too high price paid, but if I was the only person shouting about obvious long-term problems of Danya becoming alarming, requiring urgent measures from people around, while 'friends' only cared about hiding it and erase evidence, it’s rotten to the core.""The controversy that cast a long shadow over Daniel Naroditsky's final year commenced when Vladimir Kramnik publicly accused him of cheating through a series of online posts in early 2024.Kramnik alleged that Naroditsky used a second screen to consult chess engines, a serious accusation undermining the integrity of a professional player. Naroditsky, ranked among the world's top 75 in Rapid and top 25 in Blitz, had to defend himself in the court of public opinion.He strongly denied the allegations, stating that his streaming setup had been misinterpreted by Kramnik. In a raw and emotional response, Naroditsky described the former world champion as 'worse than dirt' for making such damaging claims without concrete evidence.The allegations compelled Naroditsky to release detailed videos defending his setup and playing style, an ordeal that visibly affected the popular streamer, International Business Times UK reported.","Chess grandmaster daniel naroditsky died on sunday, at the age of 29.

“You know, we’re building right behind us, we’re building a ballroom. They wanted a ballroom for 150 years, and I’m giving that honor to this wonderful place,” he said. “I didn’t know I’d be standing here right now, because right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically.”

Funding and donor support for the White House Ballroom





“It will be in keeping with the White House architecture,” Trump said. “It will be appropriate in color and in window shape. There won’t be anything like it actually. … You know, a new thing is you build a super modern building next to an old-fashioned building, and I think that’s good, but I don’t have the courage to do that with the White House.”?

“I said, ‘How long will it take me?’ ‘Sir, you can start tonight, you have no approvals.’ I said, ‘You gotta be kidding.’ They said, ‘Sir, this is the White House, you’re the president of the United States, you can do anything you want.’”

Construction has officially begun on President Donald J. Trump’s long-anticipated White House ballroom, a sprawling $250 million project that marks one of the most ambitious structural changes to the presidential residence in over a century. The move, confirmed through a statement posted by the White House on Truth Social, coincides with visible demolition activity on parts of the East Wing, where excavators and construction crews have been working since Monday.For the first time in the history of the White House, a permanent ballroom is being constructed on the grounds, a dream Trump said had been shared by every U.S. president for more than 150 years.“I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom,” the president announced in a post shared on Truth Social and reposted by the official White House account. “Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete! For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc.I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway, with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly. This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!”The ballroom, spanning approximately 90,000 square feet (8,300 square meters), is being built over the area that currently houses the East Wing. Renderings released by the White House depict a vast, neoclassical-style interior with gold and crystal chandeliers, gilded Corinthian columns, a coffered ceiling with gold inlays, marble floors, and three walls of arched windows overlooking the South Grounds.Demolition began on October 20, 2025, when construction crews and excavators were seen tearing down sections of the East Wing façade, including parts of the roof, entryway, and windows. Photos obtained by multiple outlets, includingand, showed visible demolition activity and portions of the structure’s interior being removed.The East Wing, which was constructed in 1902 and last modified in 1942 during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, has long served as the location of the First Lady’s offices. Under Trump’s modernization plan, this wing will be “fully modernized” as part of the ballroom development. According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the state ballroom will accommodate up to 650 seated guests, more than triple the capacity of the current East Room, which has historically been the largest event space in the White House.At a ceremony honoring Louisiana State University’s NCAA baseball champions in the East Room earlier Monday, Trump spoke about the construction:The president has emphasized that the ballroom’s construction will come at “zero cost to the American taxpayer,” financed entirely by private donors, major U.S. corporations, and Trump himself.During a recent White House donor dinner attended by representatives from Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Palantir, and Lockheed Martin, Trump unveiled further design plans and confirmed that the new venue will feature bulletproof glass, a 1,000-person capacity, and the ability to host a future presidential inauguration.He assured guests that the structure would align with the mansion’s historic architecture:When asked about regulatory procedures, Trump recalled:The ballroom project, estimated between $200 million and $250 million, is expected to be completed before the end of Trump’s second term in January 2029.The White House stated that the ballroom will maintain the “theme and architectural heritage” of the neoclassical executive mansion. Plans call for a separate structure, adjacent but “not touching” the existing White House.“It won’t interfere with the current building,” Trump said in July. “It’ll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of. It’s my favorite place. I love it.”Still, images of the demolition sparked controversy across social media, with some critics, including one former lawmaker, calling the project an “utter desecration.” Despite the criticism, Trump’s supporters and donors have lauded the expansion as a “historic upgrade” to one of America’s most iconic buildings.The East Wing renovation marks the largest physical modification to the White House in over 80 years, rivaling the 1948 Truman reconstruction and the 1990s West Wing refurbishments.The ballroom is part of a broader effort by Trump to reimagine Washington’s landmarks and leave a symbolic architectural legacy.At a fundraiser for ballroom donors earlier this month, Trump also unveiled a 3D model of a monument called the “Arc de Trump,” designed to resemble Paris’s Arc de Triomphe. He said the arch, topped with a gold statue, will be located across from the Lincoln Memorial and will “serve as a gateway to Washington while entering via the Arlington Memorial Bridge from Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.”The Arc de Trump is proposed to commemorate the United States’ 250th anniversary in 2026 and, like the ballroom, will be privately funded by supporters.Throughout his presidency, Trump, a former real estate developer, has personally overseen numerous aesthetic and structural updates to the White House, including:","The white house ballroom construction is expected to be completed before the end of president trump’s second term, in january 2029.
