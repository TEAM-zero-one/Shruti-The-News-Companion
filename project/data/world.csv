No, I disagree with him. Yes, I completely agree.

Let the worms and skeletons be in public domain: Dhankhar on discovery of cash at high court judge's house

NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday criticised the Supreme Court’s recent judgment that set a timeline for the President to decide on bills forwarded by governors, saying such a directive undermines the constitutional role of the country’s highest office.Speaking to the sixth batch of Rajya Sabha interns at the Vice-President’s Enclave, Dhankhar questioned, “We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India and on what basis?”""There is a directive to the President by a recent judgement. Where are we heading? What is happening in the country? We have to be extremely sensitive. It is not a question of someone filing a review or not. We never bargained for democracy for this day. President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, becomes law,"" Dhankhar added.""President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super Parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because law of the land does not apply to them,"" he further added.Also read: In a first, SC sets 3-month deadline for President to decide on bills referred by governors He added that the Constitution gives the judiciary the power to interpret the law under Article 145(3), but it does not authorise courts to issue directives to the President.""The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3). There it has to be five judges or more,"" the VP said.His comments come in response to an April 8 judgment by the Supreme Court, which for the first time imposed a three-month deadline for the President to act on bills reserved by state governors. The apex court held that any delay beyond this period must be justified, and urged state governments to cooperate with the Centre on such matters. The ruling followed a constitutional standoff in Tamil Nadu, where Governor RN Ravi had withheld assent to several bills for extended periods, prompting the state to seek judicial intervention.Speaking on the alleged discovery of cash at former Delhi high court judge Yashwant Verma's house, Dhankhar said the President and Governors enjoy constitutional immunity from prosecution, a privilege not extended to other public figures, including judges.Dhankhar said it has been over a month since the issue came to light and “let the worms and skeletons be in public domain”.""It is now over a month. Even if it is can of worms. Even if there are skeletons in the cupboard, time to blow up the can. Time for its lid to go out. And time for the cupboard to collapse. Let the worms and skeletons be in public domain so that cleansing takes place,"" VP Jagdeep Dhankhar said.The Supreme Court, in its ruling, had set aside the Tamil Nadu Governor ’s second round of referring ten bills to the President, calling it legally flawed. The justices clarified that if the President withholds assent, the state government has the right to challenge the decision in court.","Vice president jagdeep dhankhar criticised the supreme court's recent judgment that set a timeline for the president to decide on bills forwarded by governors.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affiars on Thursday called on Pakistan to take action against the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, following the extradition of Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a key accused and close associate of David Coleman Headley.Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal during his weekly briefing said, “Pakistan may try very hard, but its reputation as the epicentre of global terrorism will not diminish. The extradition of Rana is a reminder yet again to Pakistan that it needs to act to bring to justice other perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks, whom it continues to shield.”Also read: Will trial be over in a year, asked Rana. Lawyers’ reply changed his demeanour Rana, a Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman, was brought to India after the US Supreme Court rejected his final plea against extradition on April 4. He is believed to have helped plot the 2008 attacks, which left 166 people dead after a group of ten Pakistani terrorists stormed Mumbai’s landmarks, including CST station, the Taj and Oberoi hotels, and the Chabad House. The attacks, which lasted nearly 60 hours, were planned and executed with support from individuals operating out of Pakistan.The statement came just days after a Delhi court sent Rana to 18-day custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), stating that there was sufficient material on record to justify custodial interrogation.Special NIA judge Chander Jit Singh observed that the conspiracy involving Rana extended beyond India’s borders and included targets in multiple Indian cities, including the national capital.“The material produced on record reflect that the conspiracy in question travels beyond the geographical borders of India and multiple targets in the form of various places in multiple cities in India, including the national capital, were sought to be identified,” the judge observed.He further said Rana needed to be confronted with witnesses and forensic and documentary evidence seized during the investigation. This included material related to reconnaissance visits conducted by the accused and his accomplices.“This exercise indicates the necessity of custodial interrogation for which time is required,” the court said, adding that a thorough investigation was vital to ensuring national security. The court also noted that the NIA must be given a fair opportunity to uncover the complete picture. “The investigating agency should get a fair chance to thoroughly investigate the matter so as to present before the court complete facts in a holistic manner.”","26/11 mumbai terror attack plotter tahawwur rana was brought to india after the us supreme court rejected his final plea against extradition on april 4.

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday responded firmly to the ""two-nation"" comment made by Pakistan saying that the only relationship the neighbouring nation had was ""vacation of the illegally occupied territories by that country.""""How can anything foreign be in a jugular vein? This is a Union Territory of India. Its only relationship with Pakistan is the vacation of illegally occupied territories by that country,"" ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.Pakistan’s army chief, General Asim Munir, on Wednesday had voiced support for the "" two-nation theory "" that underpinned the creation of Pakistan, highlighting what he described as fundamental differences between Hindus and Muslims in all facets of life.“You have to narrate Pakistan’s story to your children so that they don’t forget it when our forefathers thought we were different from Hindus in every possible aspect of life,"" Munir said.The comment attracted strong reactions from India with Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma saying, ''The delineation is clear; our paths are divergent.

He called Article 142 a “nuclear missile” in the judiciary’s arsenal which is ""available to the judiciary 24 x 7.""The Vice President also raised concerns over the handling of the case involving Justice Yashwant Varma , following reports of semi-burnt sacks of cash discovered at the judge’s official residence in Delhi.“You cannot direct the President. The only authority under the Constitution to interpret the law lies with a bench of five or more judges under Article 145(3),” he said.Also read: VP takes on SC over deadline for President to decide on Bills ""President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law.

Any encroachment by one risks destabilising the entire system.”""Time has come for our three institutions, Legislature, Judiciary, and Executive, to blossom. And they blossom best when they operate in their own area. Any incursion by one in the domain of the other poses a challenge, which is not good. It can upset the balance,"" Dhankhar said.Speaking at the valedictory event of the 6th Rajya Sabha Internship Programme, Dhankhar questioned the absence of a formal investigation in the Justice Verma case, saying that the rule of law must prevail irrespective of an individual's position.""Let me take the incidents that are most recent. They are dominating our minds. An event happened on the night of the 14th and 15th of March in New Delhi, at the residence of a judge. For seven days, no one knew about it. We have to ask questions to ourselves: Is the delay explainable? Condonable? Does it not raise certain fundamental questions? In any ordinary situation--and ordinary situations define rule of law--things would have been different. It was only on 21st March, disclosed by a newspaper, that people of the country were shocked as never before. They were in some kind of limbo, deeply concerned and worried at this explosive, alarming expose,"" he said.Dhankhar criticised the lack of a First Information Report (FIR) in the case, noting that while anyone in India can be booked without prior approval, special permission is required to initiate proceedings against judges.He pointed out that this is not a constitutional safeguard, stating that immunity under the Constitution is reserved only for the President and Governors.""An FIR in this country can be registered against anyone--any constitutional functionary, including the one before you. One has only to activate the rule of law. No permission is required. But if it is judges--FIR cannot be straightaway registered. It has to be approved by the concerned in judiciary. But that is not given in the Constitution. The Constitution of India has accorded immunity from prosecution only to the Hon'ble President and the Hon'ble Governors. So how come a category beyond law has secured this immunity? Because the ill-effects of this are being felt in the mind of one and all. Every Indian, young and old, is deeply concerned.

US Visa Denial: Indian national’s US visa denied in 40 seconds. What went wrong in 3 questions?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-nationals-us-visa-denied-in-40-seconds-what-went-wrong-in-3-questions/articleshow/120376052.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

NEW DELHI: An Indian national shared their disappointing experience on Reddit of being denied a US B1/B2 tourist visa within 40 seconds of their interview, despite having a steady job and a clear travel plan. The post has since drawn widespread attention, sparking a discussion on common pitfalls in the US visa application process.The user, who planned a two-week vacation in Florida to visit popular attractions like Disney World and Universal Studios, said their visa interview at the US Embassy was cut short after just three questions.“Why do you want to travel to the US?”, “Have you travelled outside of India?”, and “Do you have family or friends in the US?”, these were the only questions asked before the consular officer handed over a 214(b) refusal slip.In response, the user admitted they had no prior international travel experience and that their girlfriend resides in Florida. “I said yes, my girlfriend lives in Florida whom I plan to visit,” they explained. Immediately after this, the officer declared them ineligible.A fellow Reddit user summed up the situation bluntly: “You’re a textbook denial, unfortunately for you. You have zero travel history, and a girlfriend in the US. That’s a strong tie to America and no strong reason to return to India.”Failure to demonstrate strong ties to one's home country is among the most common reasons for visa rejection. These ties can include stable employment, property, or family commitments.In this case, despite the applicant having a steady job in India, the lack of international travel history combined with the mention of a romantic partner in the US may have raised red flags regarding the risk of overstaying.Visa applicants are also advised to ensure clarity and consistency in presenting their travel purpose. Providing incorrect or inconsistent information about travel plans, or failing to adequately explain the purpose of the visit, can raise doubts and lead to denial.While the Redditor was honest about their reasons, others on the thread suggested a more cautious approach. One user advised, “You could have just said, ‘I have a friend.’ There was no need to say girlfriend.” Another recommended building a stronger travel record by first visiting countries in Europe or Asia.Before applying for a US visa, applicants must prepare thoroughly for the interview by familiarising themselves with the purpose of their trip and being able to articulate their travel plans clearly.","An indian national shared their disappointing experience on reddit of being denied a us b1/b2 tourist visa.

Relief on cards for those flying nonstop to US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/relief-on-cards-for-those-flying-nonstop-to-us/articleshow/120354584.cms,"NEW DELHI: Travellers taking nonstop flights to the US from Indira Gandhi International Airport may soon arrive there as domestic passengers, with their customs and immigration inspections done at IGI Airport itself before boarding the aircraft.The GMR-backed Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) has asked central govt for a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) pre-clearance facility at IGIA from where Air India currently operates over 33 weekly direct flights to America, apart from United and American having a daily each to New York — Newark and JFK, respectively.This direct connectivity is all set to grow as AI will increase its frequencies and American destinations, and IndiGo is also eyeing these long hauls. Delhi is the hub for both these airlines. US carriers will also increase nonstops once the Russia overflying restrictions they face are removed.GMR Airports executive director (south) SGK Kishore said on Wednesday, ""We are looking at a pre-clearance facility for the US.""An airport source said, ""We have asked govt for a US CBP pre-clearance facility at IGIA. This is a govt-to-govt process that will take some time."" He added, ""Given the number of nonstops Delhi will soon have to the US, a CBP at IGIA will offer great convenience as pre-cleared passengers will arrive as domestic passengers in the US. They will just take their bags on arrival and quickly walk out of the airport.""Landing into the busiest US airports like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles or Chicago at peak arrival times means long queues at immigration, especially for the wide majority of passengers in coach. So running out of planes — something seen in India regularly — is common to avoid being too far back in those queues. Just to skip this, many travellers from India fly Etihad via Abu Dhabi, which has a CBP.A CBP at IGIA could see many travellers skip their one-stop connecting flights on foreign airlines with their hubs in the Gulf, Europe or Southeast Asia. It will also help the govt aim of establishing IGIA as a global hub, with US-bound passengers from some nearby countries also opting to fly via Delhi.The US CBP website says pre-clearance is the ""strategic stationing of CBP personnel at designated foreign airports to inspect travellers prior to boarding US-bound flights. With pre-clearance, travellers then bypass CBP and Transportation Security Administration inspections upon US arrival and proceed directly to their connecting flight or destination.""CBP currently has over 600 officers at 15 pre-clearance locations in six countries. For Indian travellers, the closest pre-clearance is at Abu Dhabi and Etihad has been adding US nonstops with an eye on India. ""In 2019, CBP personnel stationed abroad pre-cleared 2.2 crore travellers, representing over 16% of all commercial air travellers to the US,"" the website says.","Gmr-backed delhi international airport ltd (dial) has asked central govt for a us customs and border protection (cbp) pre-clearance facility at igia.

Poll Should neighbouring countries prioritize trade ties over political tensions? No, political stance should lead decisions Yes, economic stability comes first

NEW DELHI: India has no intention of getting itself embroiled in a trade war with Bangladesh even though the signalling from Dhaka on trade issues remains far from positive. While Bangladesh has been reported to have blocked yarn imports through land borders from India, Indian government sources maintain that India’s recent withdrawal of the trans-shipment facility extended to Bangladesh in 2020 was meant to ease congestion at Indian ports and airports.India has ensured that this action does not impact Bangladesh's exports to Nepal and Bhutan transiting through Indian territory.Amid a series of anti-India statements and also actions by Dhaka that bordered on trade hostilities, PM Narendra Modi had urged Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus in their recent meeting in Bangkok to avoid rhetoric that could vitiate the atmosphere. The Indian side believes that even before the transshipment facility was blocked, the interim government in Bangladesh had taken steps that threatened to disrupt trade ties.The decisions to shut 3 land ports with India and also to block yarn imports were all taken in March. Dhaka’s decision to “tighten vigilance” at the Benapole Customs House in January was also seen as a restrictive move. Bangladesh knitwear manufacturers have already warned the government that the decision to block yarn imports will prove to be suicidal for apparel exporters.While looking to restrict trade with India, the interim government has also resumed direct trade with Pakistan. Bangladesh agreed in February to purchase 50,000 tonnes of Pakistani rice through the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP).Amid reports of increasing radicalisation in Bangladesh, the revival of Dhaka’s ties with Pakistan, which India sees as the fountainhead of global terrorism, has been of particular concern to Indian authorities. To start with, Pakistan is reported to be looking for opportunities to boost its exports to Bangladesh. There has been a dramatic renewal of high-level contacts between the 2 countries after decades with Pakistan foreign secretary Amna Baloch set to visit Dhaka on Thursday and foreign minister Ishaq Dar next week.","India has no intention of getting itself embroiled in a trade war with bangladesh.

The court had invoked the article while pronouncing its judgement against Tamil Nadu governor R N Ravi. Referring to the SC judgment of Apr 8, the VP said, “The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3).

Government points to Dhaka's role in disrupting trade ties with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-points-to-dhakas-role-in-disrupting-trade-ties-with-india/articleshow/120394347.cms,"Professor Mohammad Yunus and PM Modi

NEW DELHI: India has no intention of getting itself embroiled in a trade war with Bangladesh even though the signalling from Dhaka on trade issues remains far from positive. The Indian govt reiterated on Thursday that India's recent withdrawal of the trans-shipment facility extended to Bangladesh in 2020 was meant to ease congestion at Indian ports and airports.India has ensured that this action does not impact Bangladesh's exports to Nepal and Bhutan transiting through Indian territory. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said it's important to look at the developments that have happened on the Bangladeshi side prior to India announcing these measures.The Indian side believes that even before the trans-shipment facility was blocked by India, the interim government in Bangladesh had taken several steps that threatened to disrupt trade ties. The decisions to shut the three land ports with India and also to block yarn imports were all taken in March. Dhaka's decision to ""tighten vigilance"" at the Benapole Customs House in January was also seen as a restrictive move. Bangladesh knitwear manufacturers have already warned govt that the decision to block yarn imports will prove to be suicidal for apparel exporters.""Our announcement regarding trans-shipment in no manner impacts Bangladesh's exports to Nepal and Bhutan. We do have in mind that regional trade needs to be promoted. We have continued to call for constructive and positive engagement in our relationship with Bangladesh,"" the ministry of external affairs spokesperson added.Amid a series of anti-India statements and actions by Dhaka that bordered on trade hostilities, PM Narendra Modi had urged Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus in their recent meet in Bangkok to avoid rhetoric that could vitiate the atmosphere.While looking to restrict trade with India, the interim govt has also resumed direct trade with Pakistan. Bangladesh agreed in Feb to purchase 50,000 tonnes of Pakistani rice through the Trading Corporation of Pakistan.Amid reports of increasing radicalisation in Bangladesh, the revival of Dhaka's ties with Pakistan, which India sees as the fountainhead of global terrorism, has been of particular concern to Indian authorities. To start with, Pakistan is reported to be looking for opportunities to boost its exports to Bangladesh. There has been a dramatic renewal of high-level contacts between the two countries after decades with Pakistan foreign secretary Amna Baloch set to visit the Bangladesh capital on Thursday and foreign minister Ishaq Dar the next week.","India has ensured that this action does not impact bangladesh's exports to nepal and bhutan transiting through indian territory.

A US citizen hijacked a domestic flight in Belize on Friday, stabbing two passengers and the pilot in a mid-air attack.One of the victims, who despite suffering critical injuries, managed to fatally shoot the attacker mid-flight, officials in Belize and the United States confirmed.The plane eventually landed safely, averting what authorities said could have been a mass casualty event.The Tropic Air flight, carrying 14 passengers and two crew members, had departed from Corozal, a small town near Belize’s northern border with Mexico, and was en route to the popular tourist destination of San Pedro when the hijacking occurred, reported NYT.The aircraft veered off course and flew erratically for nearly two hours before eventually landing in the coastal town of Ladyville, escorted by a police helicopter.Authorities said the full emergency was declared shortly after the incident began, around 8:30 am local time, according to a statement from the Belize Airport Concession Company.“In the face of incomprehensible pressure, our pilot acted with extraordinary courage and calm, guiding the aircraft to a safe landing. His actions were nothing short of heroic,” said Maximillian Greif, CEO of Tropic Air.The pilot and the two passengers who were stabbed were transported to a hospital. Their injuries were described as serious but survivable, with one of the passengers in critical condition.Belize Police Commissioner Chester Williams identified the hijacker as Akinyela Sawa Taylor, a US citizen whom he described as a military veteran. US officials said they could not confirm Taylor’s veteran status.According to Williams, Taylor demanded that the plane divert course, at times asking to be flown to Mexico, and at one point insisting the plane land to refuel. During the struggle, he stabbed the pilot and two passengers. One of the passengers, Fitzgerald Brown, managed to pull out a licensed firearm despite having been stabbed in the back and suffering a punctured lung. Brown shot and killed Taylor inside the aircraft. He later handed over the weapon to authorities.“We are praying for him,” Williams told reporters. “He’s our hero.”The other injured passenger was identified as Jair Castañeda, and the wounded pilot as Howell Grange, according to a Tropic Air official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The nationalities of Brown and Castañeda have not yet been released.At a press briefing in Washington, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce described the hijacking as “horrifying” and praised the passengers and crew.“We are grateful, I think all of us are, that that did not turn into a mass casualty event with I believe over a dozen people on the plane,” Bruce said. “Clearly we know a few details. We don’t know much more.”Luke Martin, spokesperson for the US Embassy in Belize, confirmed that Taylor had demanded to be flown back to the United States during the ordeal. “We don’t know why he wanted to go back to the United States,” Martin said.Authorities in both countries said the motive for the hijacking remains unclear, and investigations are ongoing.","A us citizen hijacked a domestic flight in belize on friday, stabbing two passengers and the pilot in a mid-air attack.

Hailee Steinfeld opens up about tough decision to step away from music and why she’s finally returning

Hailee Steinfeld’s unexpected break from music has left fans puzzled, especially given her early success in the industry. While she claims it was a personal choice to focus on acting, her recent comments have stirred speculation about whether deeper industry pressures or behind-the-scenes conflicts influenced her decision.Hailee Steinfeld, known for balancing an impressive dual career in acting and music, is finally shedding light on why she pressed pause on her musical journey—and what brought her back.The actress and singer made waves in 2015 with her hit debut single Love Myself, which quickly propelled her into pop stardom. Followed by fan favorites like Starving and Most Girls, Steinfeld's music career looked destined for long-term success. However, after the release of her 2020 EP Half Written Story, she seemingly stepped back from the spotlight—at least musically.In a recent interview with Collider, Steinfeld reflected on that turning point and revealed how hard it was to put her music on hold. “I had taken a bit of a break from music, which was a very difficult decision to make, but I wanted to focus on my acting and was happy to be doing that,” she explained.While fans may have missed her voice on the charts, Steinfeld’s film and television work continued to soar. From starring in major roles to voicing Gwen Stacy in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, her acting career demanded attention—and energy.But despite the shift in priorities, music never stopped being part of her life. “Music is a love of mine and a huge passion and something that has played a very strong role in my life in more ways than one, and having had the opportunity to make music through the years of my own is something I will never take for granted,” Steinfeld shared.Now, the 28-year-old is reuniting her two creative loves with her latest project, Sinners, a film where music plays a central role. Not only is she starring in the movie, but she also performs Dangerous, a powerful track on the film’s soundtrack.“I felt so, so lucky to be a part of a movie like Sinners where music is such a huge part of it,” she said. “This is the dream—for me to be acting in a film that is so driven and moved by music. I was able to open the door again to work on something that I'm very, very, very excited about and can't wait to share more with people. It's been a long time, and I didn't realise how much I missed it.”Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld makes emotional musical comeback with new song featured in her upcoming horror film ‘Sinners’ Steinfeld’s return to music may not be a full comeback just yet—but for fans, it’s a promising sign that the best of both worlds could soon be back.","Hailee steinfeld opens up about tough decision to step away from music.

Joe Alwyn’s post-breakup conduct earns industry-wide respect

Taylor Swift has also moved on from Joe Alwyn—gracefully

In the high-stakes world of celebrity breakups, Joe Alwyn is emerging not just unscathed—but even more respected. Following his quiet split from global pop icon Taylor Swift in April 2023, Alwyn has kept a dignified silence, which insiders say has only helped his career and personal reputation flourish.The 34-year-old Brutalist actor, Joe Alwyn made headlines earlier this year for his poised presence while presenting at the Oscars, but according to industry insiders, that was only a glimpse of his rising profile. “Joe was very wise during their breakup. He kept his head down and his mouth closed and focused strictly on his work,” a source revealed to Life & Style. “He didn’t give interviews about Taylor or do any social media rants, he didn’t even hit the like button on snarky posts.”That kind of maturity, especially in the era of viral drama, hasn't gone unnoticed. Insiders describe Joe Alwyn as “uber professional and respectful,” a demeanor that’s only helped him earn more credibility within Hollywood. “He’s got proven talent and he’s proven he’s a class act, that goes a long way with the decision makers,” the source added.Taylor Swift, now in a very public relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce since late 2023, appears to harbor no ill feelings. “Taylor has no bones to pick with him, she’s happily moved on, and he’s kept it classy the whole time,” the insider noted. Even her friends and industry peers have taken notice of Joe’s graceful handling of the split.Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn’s six-year relationship was notably low-key. “For me, I just don’t feel it’s something I want to offer up to be picked apart by people who don’t know about it,” Alwyn said in a 2018 interview with Total Film. Swift echoed the sentiment in a 2019 Guardian interview: “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we'd be talking about it—but it's just that it goes out into the world.”Also Read: “Pathetic”: Travis Kelce faces backlash from Swifties over podcast survey, accused of clout-chasing Taylor Swift Since their breakup, Joe Alwyn has remained grounded. “I have tried just to focus on controlling what I can control,” he told The Guardian in January 2025.

Who is Phoenix Ikner? Gunman accused in Florida state university campus shooting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-phoenix-ikner-gunman-accused-in-florida-state-university-campus-shooting/articleshow/120395946.cms,"A shooting at Florida State University on Thursday left two people dead and at least six others injured after a 20-year-old student opened fire near the campus Student Union, authorities said. The shooter, identified as Phoenix Ikner , was wounded by police after refusing to comply with commands.FSU Police Chief Jason Trumbower confirmed that the two people who died were not university students. Ikner, the suspected gunman, is believed to be enrolled at FSU. Five other victims were being treated at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, with one reported in critical condition. Ikner is also receiving medical attention.Authorities revealed that Ikner is the son of Leon County Sheriff’s Deputy Jessica Ikner and used one of her former service weapons in the attack. “Unfortunately, her son had access to one of her weapons, and that was one of the weapons that was found at the scene,” Sheriff Walter McNeil said, adding that the investigation would look into how he obtained it.McNeil also said Ikner had been a member of the sheriff’s Youth Advisory Council and had participated in multiple training programmes. “It’s not a surprise to us that he had access to weapons,” he said. A motive for the shooting has not yet been disclosed.The incident began around 11:50 a.m. when Ikner allegedly began shooting outside the Student Union. “Needless to say we have multiple crime scenes,” said Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence Revell. “They challenged him and they ended up shooting him. He did not comply with commands and was shot. I do not believe he fired at all [toward police].”University officials cancelled all classes through Friday and advised students and staff to avoid the Student Union and surrounding areas, which remain active crime scenes. FSU's finals week is scheduled to begin on April 28, with commencement ceremonies slated for May 2–3.Eyewitnesses described moments of chaos. “I always hang out in the Student Union. So the second I found out that the threat was there, my heart sank and I was scared,” said student Andres Perez, who barricaded a classroom door with classmates before police escorted them to safety.Others echoed similar fears. “In that moment, it was survival,” said Ryan Cedergren, a communications student who hid in the bowling alley beneath the Union. Another student, Jake Nair, called the experience “surreal” after seeing officers escort students with their hands up.The FBI has opened a full investigation and is asking the public to submit any photos or videos from the scene. Florida A&M University, located nearby, also cancelled classes on Thursday.This is not the first time FSU has seen campus gun violence. In 2014, a gunman shot three people at the Strozier Library before being fatally shot by police.President Donald Trump responded to the incident from the Oval Office, saying, “It’s a shame,” but ruled out pushing for new gun legislation. “The gun doesn’t do the shooting, the people do,” he said, reaffirming his support for the Second Amendment. “I have an obligation to protect the Second Amendment.”","Shooting at florida state university left two people dead and at least six others injured.

Sharing his experience on Reddit, the user recounted how his B1/B2 visa application was denied in just 40 seconds after answering three questions honestly.The applicant, who goes by the username 'nobody01810' on Reddit, detailed his brief interaction at the US Embassy in New Delhi. When asked about the purpose of his visit, he explained that he planned a two-week vacation in Florida, intending to visit attractions like Disney World, Universal Studios, and the Kennedy Space Center. The second question pertained to his travel history, to which he responded that he had no prior international travel experience. The final question was whether he had any friends or family in the US, and he mentioned that his girlfriend resides in Florida.Following these responses, the consular officer promptly informed him that he was not eligible for the visa and handed him a 214(b) refusal slip, a common form of rejection indicating the applicant failed to demonstrate strong ties to their home country.See more: Overnight US Visa slot vanishing act leaves Indian students in uncertainty Overnight US Visa slot vanishing act leaves Indian students in uncertaintyThis swift denial has sparked discussions on Reddit and other social media platforms about the challenges faced by visa applicants.

India withdrew transhipment facility for Bangladesh due to Dhaka's actions: MEA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-withdrew-transhipment-facility-for-bangladesh-due-to-dhakas-actions-mea/articleshow/120389301.cms,"MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday explained the reason behind its decision to withdraw the transhipment facility for Bangladeshi exports and said that it was a response to Dhaka's actions affecting bilateral trade.The decision seems to came after Bangladesh's interim government stopped Indian yarn imports and closed three land ports.""We stand for a democratic, for an inclusive, and for a prosperous Bangladesh. As far as trade issues are concerned, last week we had made an announcement regarding trans-shipment facility,"" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said during weekly media briefing when asked about India-Bangladesh trade relations.""We had taken that measure because of the congestion that we see on our Ports and our Airports. But I would also remind you, please do have a look at the developments that have happened on the Bangladeshi side prior to us announcing these measures,"" he added.India has disallowed transshipment of cargo from Bangladesh to third countries, dealing a blow to Dhaka exporting apparel through air freighters, largely from Delhi.Global brands such as Zara, which use the route to meet their international need, will have to rework their sourcing strategy. The customs circular, issued Tuesday, said cargo that had already entered India would be allowed to be shipped out. Confirming the development that comes amid the strife in India-Bangladesh ties, MEA said the transshipment used to cause congestion at Indian airports and ports, but added the order won't hit Dhaka's exports to Nepal and Bhutan passing through India.The transhipment arrangement, established in 2020 to enhance trade relations, has been affected by recent developments.Jaiswal mentioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's message to Muhammad Yunus during their initial meeting in Thailand at a BIMSTEC Summit, expressing India's desire for ""positive and constructive"" relations with Bangladesh.Bangladesh suspended Indian yarn imports through land ports in March. Additionally, a committee under Bangladesh's interim government suggested closing Chilahati, Daulatganj and Tegamukh land ports along the Indian border, while recommending suspension of Balla land port operations.India-Bangladesh relations deteriorated significantly after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's departure from Dhaka in August last year amid large-scale anti-government protests.Relations worsened further when the interim government led by Yunus proved unable to prevent attacks against minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh.",India has disallowed transshipment of cargo from bangladesh to third countries.

S&P 500 gains even as Dow drops on healthcare and chip sector woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-sp-500-dow-jones-unitedhealth-scrutiny-nasdaq/articleshow/120383334.cms,"Photo- AP

Wall Street is drifting between gains and losses Thursday as UnitedHealth Group’s stock plunges toward its worst drop in more than a quarter century, while most of the rest of the US stock market ticks higher.The S&P 500 was up 0.7% in its final day of trading in a holiday-shortened week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 287 points, or 0.7%, as of 1:02 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher.UnitedHealth was the heaviest force dragging on the market, and its stock tumbled 21.9% toward its worst day since 1998.The health care giant reported profit and revenue for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations, and it also slashed its forecast for financial results this year. It was surprised by how much care its Medicare Advantage customers were getting from doctors and outpatient services, which was above the company’s expectations.Another high-profile stock, Nvidia, also dragged on the market after sinking a second straight day following its disclosure that new export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. It sank 2.8% and was the second-heaviest weight on the S&P 500.But a wide majority of stocks across Wall Street were nevertheless rising, including more than four out of every five within the S&P 500 index. Technology stocks held steadier following their sell-off from the day before after global heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a profit for the latest quarter that matched analysts’ expectations.Perhaps more importantly, it also said it hasn’t seen a drop-off in activity from its customers because of President Donald Trump ’s trade war, as some other companies have suggested.Still, the company known as TSMC was cautious. “While we have not seen any changes in our customers’ behavior so far, uncertainties and risks from the potential impact from tariff policies exist,” Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said. TSMC’s stock that trades in the United States rose 1.1%.Eli Lilly was another winner after the drugmaker reported encouraging results for a once-daily pill that could help treat people with obesity and diabetes. Its stock jumped 15.9%.Exxon Mobil rose 3.7%, and ConocoPhillips rallied 4.2% as oil prices rose to recover some of their sharp losses taken this month amid worries that the trade war could hurt the global economy.Meanwhile, the US bond market remained relatively calm after last week’s volatility, which had stirred fears over waning global confidence in US assets amid escalating trade tensions. Global stock markets moved in divergent directions on Thursday as investors weighed a looming interest rate cut by the European Central Bank against escalating tensions between US President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell European indices declined in midday trading, pulling back from earlier gains in Asia. London’s FTSE 100 was down 0.7 percent at 8,218.19, Paris' CAC 40 slipped 0.8 percent to 7,268.90, and Frankfurt’s DAX dropped 0.6 percent to 21,178.14.In contrast, Asian markets closed mostly higher, buoyed by optimism surrounding Japan-US trade talks. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 surged 1.4 percent to 34,377.60, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rose 1.6 percent to 21,395.14, and Shanghai's Composite Index edged up 0.1 percent to 3,280.34.Meanwhile, safe-haven gold hit a new record above $3,357.78 an ounce, while oil prices and the US dollar posted modest gains. Brent crude rose 1.0 percent to $66.51 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate increased 1.2 percent to $62.55.Market sentiment remained cautious as President Trump renewed criticism of Fed Chairman Powell , accusing him of failing to match the ECB’s monetary easing and calling for his dismissal. Trump's comments followed Powell's warning that the administration’s broad-based tariffs could leave the central bank with difficult choices between curbing inflation and preserving employment.The warning, along with chipmaker Nvidia's disclosure of mounting costs from the ongoing US-China trade war, triggered a sharp selloff on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.7 percent at 39,669.39.Trump responded Thursday by slamming Powell's leadership, stating his “termination cannot come fast enough.”Attention is now firmly on the ECB, which is widely expected to lower interest rates in response to economic uncertainty stoked by protectionist trade policies and slowing global growth.Investors are also monitoring developments in Washington, where governments are scrambling to secure trade agreements before Trump's recently announced tariffs — delayed for 90 days — come into effect. On social media, the president said there had been “Big Progress!” in talks with Japanese officials, a sentiment echoed by Tokyo’s envoy Ryosei Akazawa.Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged the complexity of the negotiations but reaffirmed both sides' urgency to reach a resolution.","The dow jones industrial average was down 287 points, or 0.7%, as of 1:02 p.m. eastern time.
