Army wants anti-drone systems integrated on its Russian tank fleets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-wants-anti-drone-systems-integrated-on-its-russian-tank-fleets/articleshow/120297070.cms,"Army is seeking advanced counter-drone systems for its T-90S and T-72 tanks

NEW DELHI: With Ukrainian drones destroying thousands of Russian tanks in the ongoing war, the Indian Army now wants new advanced counter-drone systems with both “soft and hard kill options” to be integrated on their Russian-origin T-90S and T-72 main-battle tanks.In just the last one year, Russia is estimated to have lost around 3,000 tanks and 9,000 armoured vehicles to drones, artillery and anti-tank guided missiles fielded by Ukraine, some its own and others provided by western countries.Ukraine, of course, has also suffered huge military losses in the debilitating war underway since Feb 2022, which has led a few experts to even sound the death knell for the lumbering tanks in modern-day warfare.The over 11.5-lakh strong Indian Army is obviously worried about its fleets of the old 2,400 T-72 `Ajeya’ tanks and the relatively newer T-90S `Bhishma’ tanks (around 1,300 inducted of 1,657 being produced by the Heavy Vehicles Factory under licence from Russia), which are primarily meant for swift multiple thrusts into Pakistan during a conflict.Consequently, the force is looking for “platform-based” counter-unmanned aircraft systems (C-UAS), which can detect and neutralize FPV (first-person view) drones, swarm drones, loitering UAVs and kamikaze drones.Towards this end, a RFI (request for information) was recently issued for the preliminary acquisition of 75 C-UAS, with active and passive detection measures, and soft kill options like the capability to jam satellite-based navigational systems and RF (radio frequency) communication links of the hostile drones.For the hard kill, the C-UAS should provide requisite inputs to the anti-aircraft machine guns already mounted on T-90S and T-72 tanks. “The modular C-UAS will have to be integrated with the tanks without affecting their mobility. The sealing of tanks for deep fording and NBC (nuclear, chemical, biological) warfare protection should also not be affected,” an officer said.The design of tanks is based on the “equilateral triangle” of lethality, mobility and survivability, which leaves little scope for adding more armour protection. “Therefore, the need for integration of light-weight C-UAS,” he added.On the China front, the Army had managed to deploy some of the heavy T-90S and T-72 tanks (40 to 50 tonne each) in eastern Ladakh after the confrontation erupted in April 2020. The plan now is to induct 354 indigenous light tanks (25-tonne each) for high-altitude warfare under Project Zorawar for around Rs 17,500 crore.“The light tanks will come with integral counter-drone systems. All our future tank projects are being planned with enhanced survivability, especially against aerial threats, as well as connectivity. Requisite anti-drone safeguards will ensure both individual tank protection as well as area protection for force survivability,” another officer said.","Army is seeking advanced counter-drone systems for its t-90s and t-72 tanks.

Belgium authorities say India has filed for extradition of fugitive Mehul Choksi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/belgium-authorites-say-india-has-filed-for-extradition-of-fugitive-mehul-choksi/articleshow/120277712.cms,"Undated photo of Mehul Choksi

'Choksi's arrest is a

very big

achievement': India

'Choksi's human rights will be affected if extradited,' says his lawyer

NEW DELHI: The Belgian federal public service of justice on Monday confirmed that India has filed an extradition request for fugitive Mehul Choksi , who has been arrested in Belgium for his involvement in the Rs 13,000 crore PNB bank loan ""fraud"" case.The Belgian federal public service of justice said, ""Mehul Choksi was arrested on Saturday, April 12, 2025. He is being detained in anticipation of further judicial proceedings. Access to his legal counsel has been assured. The Belgian Federal Public Service of Justice can confirm that the Indian authorities have introduced an extradition request for Choksi.""Choksi, 65, was taken into custody by Belgian authorities on Saturday (April 12) after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) requested his extradition. He had been living in Antigua since fleeing India in 2018, and was recently traced to Belgium, where he had reportedly gone for medical treatment.Choksi is the second main accused in the PNB scam after his nephew, Nirav Modi, who is currently in a London prison and is also fighting extradition to India.Sources said that although the Interpol Red Notice against Choksi was deleted some time ago, Indian agencies have been actively pursuing his extradition. Two arrest warrants issued by a Mumbai special court in 2018 and 2021 were shared with Belgian authorities as part of the request.Formal extradition procedures are currently underway, and Choksi may seek bail on health grounds. His lawyer, Vijay Agarwal, confirmed the arrest and said that Choksi is currently in a Belgian prison.""At the moment, he is in prison and there (Belgium), the procedure is not to apply for bail but file an appeal. During that appeal, request is made that he should not be kept in detention and he should be permitted to defend himself and oppose the extradition request while not being in custody,"" Agarwal said, adding that their legal defense will also highlight concerns about prison conditions in India and claim the case is politically motivated.Choksi, his company Gitanjali Gems, Nirav Modi, their associates, and some PNB officials were booked by the CBI and ED in 2018 for allegedly cheating the bank. The scam involved the fraudulent issuance of Letters of Undertaking (LOUs) and Foreign Letters of Credit (FLCs), causing massive financial losses.The CBI has filed two charge sheets against Choksi, while the ED has submitted three prosecution complaints in connection with the case.Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal on Monday called the arrest of Choksi a ""success"" for India's diplomatic efforts.""Look, our external affairs minister has said clearly, and I will also repeat it. The government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had successful diplomacy, which is part of the foreign policy. Because of successful diplomacy only we can do this work (extradition). This is a proud moment for India,"" Meghwal said during a program paying tribute to BR Ambedkar.Following Choksi's arrest, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary lauded the move, calling it a ""very big achievement.""""Prime Minister Narendra Modi had already said that those who have looted the money of the poor will have to return it. And action is being taken against such people in the country. Mehul Choksi has been arrested; it is definitely a very big achievement,"" Chaudhrary said.Meanwhile, Choksi's lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, said that his ""human rights"" will be ""greatly affected"" if he is extradited back to the country.""His human rights will be greatly affected,"" Aggarwal said. ""That's a procedure. Basically, we will be defending it on two grounds. It is a political case and, secondly, because of the human condition in India,"" he added.","Fugitive mehul choksi has been arrested in belgium for his involvement in the rs 13,000 crore pnb bank loan ""fraud"" case.

Details of the alleged plot



NEW DELHI: Fugitive jeweller Mehul Choksi made arrested in Belgium had made headlines four years ago when he had claimed abduction from the Caribbean island in May 2021. Later a detailed police report from Antigua supported his statement, identifying Hungarian national Barbara Jarabik and Gurdip Bath as prime conspirators in the plot. The report, accessed by TOI, provided a chilling account of the events that led to Choksi’s sudden appearance in Dominica .According to the report, Choksi was lured to a rented villa in Jolly Harbour by Barbara Jarabik under the pretense of a dinner invitation on May 23, 2021. Upon arrival, he was ambushed by a group of around 10 men, believed to be of Indian and local origin. He was reportedly gagged, bound to a wheelchair, and assaulted before being transported by boat to a yacht named Calliope of Arne and later taken to Dominica.Gurdip Bath, traveling on a Kittitian diplomatic passport, checked into Cocobay Hotel on May 19, 2021. Hotel staff later reported seeing him with a woman resembling Barbara Jarabik. Bath reportedly visited Jolly Harbour multiple times and was picked up by a man in a white Hyundai Creta shortly before Choksi’s alleged abduction.That same evening, Bath, Jarabik, and British national Leslie Farrow-Guy boarded a private flight to Dominica. Notably, the aircraft had arrived in Antigua with only its pilots and was scheduled to leave earlier but delayed its departure — a fact flagged by investigators.Bath had previously traveled to Antigua in April 2021, along with Jarabik, allegedly on a reconnaissance trip. They checked into the Blue Waters Hotel together.Barbara Jarabik, whose travel records show frequent visits to Antigua since 2019, had reportedly grown close to Choksi during her stays. She rented the villa in question a few days before the incident and had requested access to a private dock — which was used during the escape.Leslie Farrow-Guy, identified as a British national, had rented the same white Hyundai Creta used during the operation and had arrived in Antigua around the same time as the other suspects.","Fugitive jeweller mehul choksi made headlines four years ago when he had claimed abduction from the caribbean island in may 2021.

No, stick with lasers for now Yes, diversify technologies

India has successfully demonstrated its capability to neutralise fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system, marking a significant milestone in the nation's defense technology.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) developed this directed-energy weapon (DEW), which is now ready for production and deployment across various military platforms.With this achievement, India joins an elite group of countries, including the United States, China, and Russia, that possess advanced laser weapon capabilities.DRDO chairman Dr Samir V Kamat said: ""This is just the beginning of the journey. The synergy that this lab has achieved with other DRDO labs, industry and academia, I am sure we will reach our destination soon... We are also working on other high energy systems like high energy microwaves, electromagnetic pulse. So we are working on a number of technologies that will give us Star Wars capability. What you saw today was one of the components of Star Wars technologies.""""As far as I know, it is the United States, Russia and China that have demonstrated this capability. Israel is also working on similar capabilities, I would say we are the fourth or fifth country in the world to demonstrate this system,"" he added.The 30-kilowatt laser weapon system is designed to counter aerial threats such as drones and helicopters within a range of 5 kilometers.It features advanced electronic warfare capabilities, including jamming communication and satellite signals.Its versatility allows it to be adapted for both ground-based and shipborne applications, enhancing India's defense readiness across multiple domains. The system is equipped with a 360-degree Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor for precise targeting and can be rapidly deployed via air, rail, road, or sea.Dr BK Das, Director General (Electronics & Communication System) DRDO, said: ""For the first time, we are showing a technology in use and its devastation. This shows how far we are going in our technology maturity... What you saw is a completely indigenous product of many DRDO laboratories working in synergy with startups, academic institutions and industries. We are confident that we are going to reach high power very soon... We are planning to deploy similar systems with slight modifications on ships to prove the capability.""Dr Jagannath Nayak, director of the Centre for High Energy System, and Sciences (CHESS), DRDO said: ""Whatever we have achieved today is a great success, and we have seen that we have neutralised fixed-wing aircraft at long range and then we have also seen that we have neutralised swarm drone... with the laser weapon, we can neutralise multiple targets. So, this is one of the new and emerging weapon systems. It is a massless weapon and the concentration of laser light falls on the target and neutralises it. So this is an achievement for our country and DRDO.""India's efforts in directed-energy weapons extend beyond the 30-kilowatt system.The DRDO is also developing more powerful systems, such as the 300-kilowatt "" Surya "" laser weapon, which boasts an operational range of 20 kilometers.This system is designed to target high-speed aerial threats like missiles and unmanned aerial systems (UAS), further strengthening India's position in modern warfare. These advancements align with global trends emphasizing high-power lasers for missile defense and counter-drone operations.","The 30-kilowatt laser weapon system is designed to counter aerial threats such as drones and helicopters within a range of 5 kilometers.

2008 Mumbai Terror Attacks Plotter Tahawwur Rana Extradited To India To Face Trial | Watch

NEW DELHI: 26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana is currently being interrogated daily for up to ten hours by National Investigation Agency (NIA) over his alleged role in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks , news agency PTI reported citing sources. Rana arrived in New Delhi on Thursday following his extradition from the United States.The NIA aims to uncover a wider conspiracy behind the attacks, which killed 166 people and injured over 230.Rana is being held in a high-security cell at the NIA headquarters in Delhi's CGO Complex. According to PTI sources, he has been cooperating with investigators led by Chief Investigating Officer Jaya Roy. So far, Rana has requested a pen, some paper or a notepad, and a Quran—all of which have been provided.He has raised no special food demands and is being given standard meals as per protocol.As per PTI sources, the 64-year-old Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman, is being held in a high-security cell at the anti-terror agency’s CGO Complex office. He is under constant guard and is being interrogated based on evidence collected during the agency's investigation, including a large number of phone calls with co-conspirator David Coleman Headley.The Delhi court granted the NIA 18 days of custody, stressing the gravity of the charges and the national security threat they pose. The court also directed medical check-ups every 48 hours and permitted Rana to meet his lawyer, following due legal process and the conditions outlined in the extradition agreement.Rana faces multiple charges including conspiracy to commit murder, waging war against India, and planning terrorist acts under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). These charges stem from his alleged involvement with David Coleman Headley, a key figure in the Mumbai attacks who is currently imprisoned in the US.The NIA believes Rana may provide crucial information about reconnaissance visits to various Indian cities before the 2008 attacks and about his communication with operatives of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group. Investigators are also examining potential links between Rana and senior figures in terror outfits such as LeT and Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami (HuJI), along with suspected involvement of Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI officers.The court said that the case has international dimensions, with multiple Indian cities identified as potential targets. It also pointed out the need to confront Rana with key witnesses, documents, and forensic evidence.","Tahawwur rana arrived in new delhi on thursday following his extradition from the united states.

Can President be forced to seek Supreme Court opinion on a bill?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-president-be-forced-to-seek-supreme-court-opinion-on-a-bill/articleshow/120290271.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: Can Supreme Court force the President to approach SC under Article 143 of the Constitution seeking its opinion on constitutionality of a bill ? This is one of the key questions that has emerged on a closer study of the SC's recent judgment on the President's powers regarding bills passed by state legislatures.Article 201 of the Constitution does not prescribe a time limit or warrant the President to provide a reason for withholding assent to a bill reserved for her by governors. But a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan asked the President to do what is not mandated by the Constitution - to specify elaborate reasons for withholding assent to a bill or returning it to the state legislature.SC also appeared to have stepped into the legislative process, that includes assent of the President, when it said, ""We are also of the view that a bill appearing to be unconstitutional must be assessed by a judicial mind. The President is not just precluded but constitutionally expected to refer the question of vires of a bill to this court as the apex judicial institution to ascertain the constitutionality thereof and accordingly enable President to act in respect of the said bill under Article 201."" This has raised eyebrows as there is no concept of 'advance ruling' in constitutional litigation, as is available under the GST and income tax laws. ""We are of the considered view that constitutional courts are not precluded from making suggestions or giving opinion about constitutional validity of a bill before the same becomes a law,"" the court said, inserting itself into a process that is hardly its domain.Teaching prudence to the President, SC said she ought to ""seek an opinion under the said provision in respect of bills that have been reserved for consideration of the President on grounds of perceived unconstitutionality...President's recourse to Art 143 also palliates any apprehensions of bias or mala fides in the central govt's approach to bills reserved under Article 200"".Article 143 makes no mention of bills or the question of constitutionality. It provides: ""If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law or fact has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of SC upon it, he may refer the question to that court for consideration and the court may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its opinion thereon."" SC judgment said ""where the bill upon becoming law would be a peril to democracy, the decision of the President must be guided by the fact that it is the constitutional courts that have been conferred with the ultimate authority of interpretation of the Constitution and the laws"", its remarks seemingly reflecting the assumption that the Union, its law ministry and top law officers lacked understanding of the intricacies of the Constitution and were incompetent to tender proper advice in a matter involving intricate play of constitutional provisions.""It is expected that the Union executive should not assume the role of the courts in determining the vires of a bill and should, as a matter of practice, refer such a question to the Supreme Court under Article 143. We have no qualms in stating that the hands of the executive are tied when engaging with purely legal issues in a bill and only the constitutional courts have the prerogative to study and provide recommendations as regards the constitutionality of a bill,"" the bench said, knowing full well that the SC's opinion under Article 143 is not binding on the govt.There are 28 states and if five bills passed every year by each state legislature are reserved for the President by the governor on grounds of its constitutionality, then going by the court's reasoning, President ought to seek the opinion of SC on all 140 bills, a law ministry source said.For the record, the President had sought SC's opinion in 2004 on the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act which annulled water sharing agreements with neighbouring states. SC gave its opinion 12 years later in 2016.","Supreme court of india asked the president to provide a reason for withholding assent to a bill reserved for her by governors.

30kW DEW Targets Drones & Missiles at 3.5 km,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tests-laser-system-to-destroy-aerial-targets/articleshow/120266057.cms,"NEW Delhi: India for the first time on Sunday demonstrated the capability to use a potent 30-kilowatt laser-based system to disable, degrade or destroy small remotely-piloted aircraft, swarm drones, missiles and sensors, joining a select group of countries like the US, Russia, China, UK and Israel in the quest for effective Star Wars-like directed energy weapons (DEWs).The multiple tests of the Laser-DEW Mark-II(A) to destroy a small fixed-wing aircraft and a swarm of seven drones as well as “blind” surveillance cameras and sensors mounted on drones and deployed on the ground, at ranges up to 3.5-km, were conducted at the national open air range at Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh.“It is a very powerful and reusable weapon for 'beam kills’, instead of ‘kinetic kills’ with expensive missiles and ammunition. With low cost per kill, it’s much more economical, especially for extended wars like we are now seeing. This is the technology of the future,” DRDO director-general (electronics and communication systems) Dr B K Das told TOI.The 30-kilowatt vehicle-based integrated drone detection and interdiction system (IDD&IS) marks a significant breakthrough for India, which has lagged far behind other countries in developing such cost-effective counter-drone systems.The challenge will be to miniaturise the system for deployment on airborne platforms and warships as well. The armed forces have so far inducted 23 IDD&IS systems, with 2-kilowatt lasers, for around Rs 400 crore, with DRDO also completing the development of 10-kilowatt lasers. But their kill ranges are just about 1 to 2-km, as reported by TOI earlier.“The Laser-DEW Mark-II(A) was tested for a 3.5-km range in hot weather or extreme conditions on Sunday. User trials can take place in 1-1.5 years, with technology being transferred by DRDO to companies for production,” Dr Das said.With the proliferation of unmanned aerial systems and the fast emergence of deadly drone swarms as asymmetric threats, DRDO is now also working on DEWs with power levels of 50 to 100-kilowatt as well as high-energy microwaves, as per a roadmap laid down with short, medium and long-term goals.“Cost-effective defence solutions to tackle low-cost drone attacks is driving the adoption of DEWs by militaries worldwide. The cost of firing a DEW for a few seconds is equivalent to the cost of a couple of litres of petrol. Therefore, it has the potential to be a long-term and low-cost alternative to defeat a variety of targets,” another DRDO official said.Some countries are far ahead in this arena. The US, for instance, has already deployed Helios’ (high energy laser with integrated optical-dazzler and surveillance), with a 60-kilowatt laser that can be scaled up to 120-kilowatt, on some of its frontline warships to intercept armed drones, missiles and fast-attack craft.Israel, in turn, is getting set to deploy a 100-kilowatt Iron Beam’ laser weapon system with a 10-km range, while the UK is developing Dragon Fire’ for its warships.While firing focussed beams of concentrated electromagnetic energy at the speed of light at targets may be much cheaper than conventional kinetic weapons, DEWs are still to enter large-scale operational use.The kill ranges of DEWs are still far less than conventional weapons, and bad weather can adversely impact their performance. “Advancements in technology will lead to more powerful and versatile weapons. One such advancement is the development of more powerful and efficient lasers, allowing for greater range and precision. Additionally, advancements in beam-steering technology and adaptive optics may enhance the DEW’s ability to maintain focus and accuracy at longer ranges,” a DRDO scientist said.","India for the first time on sunday demonstrated the capability to use a potent 30-kilowatt laser-based system to disable, degrade or destroy small remotely-piloted aircraft, swarm drones, missiles and sensors. Multiple tests of the laser-dew mark-ii(a) to destroy a small fixed-wing aircraft and a swarm of seven drones were conducted at the national open air range at kurnool in andhra pradesh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120266711,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1395059,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Trade war: How India could be Trump’s trump card in 'encircling' China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-trade-war-trump-tariff-on-china-trump-vs-xi-jinping-india-us-trade-deal/articleshow/120283898.cms,"“They’ve been good military allies, not perfect economic allies. At the end of the day, we can probably reach an agreement with them. Then we can approach China as a group,” Bessent said.

Why it matters

This isn’t just about economics - It’s geopolitics in disguise. Trump’s escalating tariffs on China (some over 140%) are the stick. His 90-day tariff pause on other nations, is the carrot - a window to strike deals that would redirect trade, realign allies, and squeeze Beijing. And India may be the crucial swing partner in that vision.

India’s rejection of Chinese firms like BYD, alongside its courting of Tesla and the US, underscores this quiet but calculated alignment.

India’s moment: With Europe waffling and Southeast Asia wary, India could emerge as the indispensable nation for Trump’s trade doctrine. It’s the only major economy large enough, skeptical enough of China, and independent enough from the US to act as both a partner and a pivot.

Zoom in: India’s pivotal role

It has rejected multiple Chinese investment proposals, including a $1B EV plant by BYD, a Bloomberg report said.

It maintains 100% import duties on fully built cars — among the highest globally — shielding local players like Tata and Mahindra.

It’s tightening checks on trade routes from Sri Lanka, Oman, and UAE to stop Chinese goods sneaking in through back doors.

“India has a lot of elbow room for trade deals with developed nations,” commerce minister

said. “But we must be cautious about dumping from China.”

What they’re saying

“India has to be cautious about its strategic interests, who we allow to invest,” Goyal told Bloomberg, directly referencing Chinese firms.

Meanwhile, White House insiders say deals with India are progressing faster than with other countries, thanks in part to shared concerns over China and India’s relatively low exposure to US tariffs.

“Everybody wants to come and make a deal,” Trump said last week. “The biggest problem [my aides] have is they don’t have enough time in the day.”

Between the lines

The European wrinkle

The challenge

US President Donald Trump’s economic team is rapidly advancing a new global strategy to box in China - not just with tariffs, but with alliances. At the center of this plan? India.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent , emerging as Trump’s surprise lead negotiator, has outlined what insiders are calling a “grand encirclement” - a diplomatic and economic coalition with India, Japan, Vietnam, and South Korea to isolate Beijing and weaken its grip on global trade, a Bloomberg report said.India’s posture is shifting from transactional to strategic.Officials in New Delhi confirmed they’re working on a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the US — one that spans digital trade, goods, labor mobility, and more.But don’t expect a “zero-for-zero” tariff deal - Indian negotiators insist that kind of parity is only realistic between developed economies, a report in the Economic Times said.Instead, India is exploring a “package deal” approach, offering sector-specific concessions on textiles, gems, chemicals, and agriculture in exchange for US market access and tech collaboration.India’s domestic policy aligns well with Trump’s goals:India isn’t acting purely out of goodwill - it’s hedging.While aligning with the US, India remains deeply interwoven with Chinese supply chains. Roughly 40% of Vietnam’s imports, for example, come from China - a number similar to India’s for electronics and machinery.India also seeks to replace Chinese e-commerce exports to the US, particularly as Washington slaps over 120% duties on low-value shipments from China starting May.A report by Delhi-based think tank GTRI calls this a ""massive opportunity"" for India’s small businesses, handicraft exporters, and fashion sellers - if the government can streamline red tape.The EU is not on board - at least not yet. President Trump’s blanket tariffs, even on allies, have deeply alienated European leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron says the EU faces $59 billion in annual tariffs from Washington — nearly equal to three years of US military aid to Ukraine.Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has publicly flirted with a China pivot, prompting a rebuke from Bessent. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is pushing for a mechanism to monitor Chinese trade diversions, but Brussels still appears hesitant to side fully with Washington.“Friends and foes are being treated the same,” said Jeppe Kofod, Denmark’s former foreign minister. “It’s crazy time.”Trump’s allies aren’t exactly on the same page. Bessent is pitching a unified front. But other top officials, like Peter Navarro and Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick , are focused less on long-term strategy and more on short-term manufacturing wins and tariff cash flow.“The key question is if they start making performative deals to help some particular company, or if they focus on meaningful commitments to rebalance trade,” Lori Wallach of Rethink Trade told the Washington Post.Trump’s White House often struggles to speak with one voice. In private, even administration officials admit they don’t always know what the president is aiming for.“There’s no idea what they want from other countries, and worse is that other countries don’t know what Trump wants from them,” said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist and policy veteran.As per the WaPo report, behind closed doors, trade envoys from around the world have described a kind of diplomatic group therapy-texting and calling one another to compare notes, hoping to divine meaning from the chaos. In many cases, foreign diplomats don’t even know which US official to talk to.That tension could limit how effective the ""grand encirclement"" becomes.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump’s escalating tariffs on china (some over 140%) are the stick.

'What about Palm Sunday?': Canadian PM Mark Carney accused of 'pandering' to Sikhs on Vaishaki,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-about-palm-sunday-canadian-pm-mark-carney-accused-of-pandering-to-sikhs-on-vaishaki/articleshow/120164887.cms,"Sikh-Canadian Influence and the Political Battleground



The Conservative Counter-Strategy



A Delicate Balancing Act



Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing online criticism after taking part in Vaisakhi celebrations in Ottawa this weekend without publicly recognising Palm Sunday , which fell on the same day.Photographed wearing a yellow turban and serving food at a Sikh langar, Carney’s presence at the festival drew praise from members of the Sikh community—but also sparked backlash from some Christian commentators and right-leaning influencers who accused him of selective outreach. Notably, social media figure Oli London criticised Carney on X (formerly Twitter) for participating in Sikh festivities while failing to acknowledge Palm Sunday, a key Christian holiday marking the beginning of Holy Week.“This is the Prime Minister of Canada celebrating Vaisakhi in a Sikh temple—but not even mentioning Palm Sunday,” London wrote, igniting a polarised debate online. Critics accused Carney of “pandering” to minority communities while ignoring the Christian majority, with one user calling him “a shell of a person.” Others pointed out his silence on Passover as well.Yet many defended the prime minister’s participation. “Langar is inclusive—it’s for everyone, regardless of religion,” said one supporter. “That’s the spirit of Vaisakhi.”The incident shines a light on the growing influence of Sikh-Canadians in the political landscape. With over 800,000 Sikhs—roughly 2% of the population—Canada is home to the largest Sikh diaspora outside India. The community has become a potent political force, with visible representation in Parliament, provincial legislatures, and local councils.Both the Liberal and Conservative parties have actively courted the Sikh vote in recent years. The Liberals have long benefited from support in urban Sikh strongholds, especially in British Columbia and Ontario, but the Conservatives are making inroads—particularly as tensions grow over issues like the Khalistan movement and Indo-Canadian security concerns.This broader context is key to understanding the political sensitivity of Carney’s appearance. While the Liberal Party emphasises multicultural engagement, critics argue that its support for Sikh causes, particularly amid the fallout of the Hardeep Singh Nijjar assassination and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s explosive allegation against India, has alienated sections of the Hindu-Canadian and Indo-Caribbean communities.Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has been cultivating ties with Hindu-Canadians and right-leaning members of the Indo-Canadian community—many of whom now feel disillusioned with Trudeau’s Liberals. In 2022, Poilievre attended a gathering hosted by Aditya Tawatia, a former organiser of the Overseas Friends of BJP Canada, a diaspora group originally set up to support Narendra Modi's rise to power in India. Though no longer active, some of its members continue to engage in Canadian politics—now often aligned with Poilievre’s Conservatives.These connections have sparked controversy, especially as some attendees of Poilievre’s events have raised concerns about perceived bias in favour of Sikh activists and a lack of action on threats to Hindu places of worship. “Hindu-Canadians don’t feel safe,” said Shiv Bhasker, a Poilievre supporter and former OFBJP official, citing incidents of intimidation at temples and rallies.Meanwhile, Sikh groups accuse the Conservatives of cosying up to Indian nationalist figures and using diaspora politics for electoral gain. “It is really concerning if those are the individuals now promoting candidates,” said a spokesperson for the Sikh Federation of Canada .The debate over community outreach took a sharper turn earlier this year when the Conservatives dropped their candidate in Etobicoke North, Don Patel, over controversial social media activity involving Khalistan. While Patel’s defenders insisted the reaction was overblown, the episode highlighted the tightrope both parties walk in managing their Indo-Canadian base—a group increasingly caught between diplomatic crossfire and domestic political ambition.Carney, who took over the Liberal leadership in early 2025, has styled himself as a bridge-builder and pragmatic centrist. His appearance at the Vaisakhi event was meant to reinforce that image. But in a multicultural democracy where overlapping religious calendars are the norm, even symbolic gestures can be politically loaded.With elections looming, both parties are jostling for the loyalty of Canada’s diverse ethnic communities. For Liberals, that means doubling down on inclusive symbolism and minority representation. For Conservatives, it means reorienting outreach efforts to tap into communities frustrated with Liberal identity politics and foreign policy.In this atmosphere, Carney’s turban and tray of dal may have said more than any speech could. Whether that symbolism resonates or backfires will depend on how Canadians interpret the balance—or imbalance—of their leaders’ cultural diplomacy .",Prime minister mark carney is facing online criticism after taking part in vaisakhi celebrations in ottawa this weekend.

The Blue Origin rocket carrying pop superstar Katy Perry , journalist Gayle King, and Jeff Bezos’ fiancee Lauren Sanchez successfully launched from West Texas, marking the company’s 11th human flight. The all-female crew also included former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights advocate Amanda Nguyn, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.The sub-orbital flight lifted off from West Texas just after 8:30am (local time) and lasted around 10 minutes. The fully automated mission took the crew more than 100km above Earth, past the Karman line—the internationally recognised boundary of space—where the women experienced a few moments of weightlessness.This marks Blue Origin’s 11th human spaceflight and the first all-woman space mission since Valentina Tereshkova’s solo flight in 1963. The mission adds Perry to the list of high-profile Blue Origin passengers, including Star Trek actor William Shatner.Ahead of the flight, Perry spoke about how she had been preparing mentally by reading works by Carl Sagan and diving into astrophysics. “I've always been interested in the stars. We’re all made of stardust,” she said. She added that the mission was about more than space travel — it was about breaking boundaries and inspiring young girls to dream big. “You're brave, you're bold… No limitations,” she said, reflecting on her internal pep talks before training.The pop icon, known for space-themed songs like E.T. and Firework, said the mission aligns with her interest in STEM and women’s empowerment. “Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she added, referring to her daughter Daisy.Blue Origin described the flight as a historic moment for women in space , with the mission patch reflecting each woman’s contributions and symbols of their legacies. The New Shepard astronauts soar toward space at speeds exceeding three times the speed of sound.","Blue origin rocket carrying katy perry and all-female crew reaches edge of space, returns safely jeff bezos with his fiancée lauren sánchez; new shepherd 31 capsule; katy perry on board.

The troops blocked the only exit and fired for about ten minutes, killing over 1,000 people and injuring many more.The massacre, which took place on the festival of Baisakhi, shocked the nation, leading to widespread outrage, the resignation of key Indian figures from British honors (like Rabindranath Tagore), and a significant boost to the Indian independence movement. It remains one of the darkest chapters in colonial history and is commemorated at the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial in Amritsar.","Pm modi hails kerala-born sankaran nair for his legal battle against the british empire after the 1919 jallianwala bagh massacre.
