MEA Calls For Firm Action As India Flags Disturbing Pattern Of Attacks On Minorities In Bangladesh

LONDON: UK shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel has called on the British government to intervene in the ""increase in violence"" in Bangladesh that has involved murders of Hindus and use its influence to bring about stability in the country.The British Indian Opposition Conservative MP posted her letter to Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on social media on Friday, which also calls upon the Labour Party government to make a statement on the issue in the House of Commons.""The situation in Bangladesh is very concerning. Religious freedoms should be protected and the murders of Hindus and persecution taking place are wrong and must stop,"" said Patel.""The UK government must use its influence and convening powers to work to bring about stability in Bangladesh and a future where religious freedoms are protected and Hindus as safe,"" she said.In her letter to Cooper, the shadow minister points to reports of at least six Hindus being killed within an 18-day period in recent weeks.""This level of persecution and violence is unacceptable... Given the increase in violence, can you advise what steps have been taken over the last year to monitor and make representations?""Given the wider political situation in Bangladesh, what work is underway with partners in the region to use our diplomatic influence and convening powers to bring about stability in Bangladesh and respect and protections for minorities,"" she questions in her letter.Meanwhile, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has condemned a ""disturbing pattern"" of recurring attacks on minorities in Bangladesh.""We continue to witness a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities as well as their homes and businesses by extremists. Such communal incidents need to be dealt with swiftly and firmly,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.""We have observed a troubling tendency to attribute such incidents to personal rivalries, political differences, or extraneous reasons. Such disregard only emboldens the perpetrators, and deepens the sense of fear and insecurity among minorities,"" he said.British Hindu groups led by the Bengali Hindu Adarsha Sangha (BHAS) UK have been coordinating protests in London against the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh.""The minority communities of Bangladesh are facing long-standing concerns over discrimination, violence, murder and demographic decline,"" BHAS UK said at a protest recently.The protesters condemned the ""unethical arrest of interfaith voice Chinmaya Prabhu and public lynching of Dipu Das by Islamic extremists"".Chinmoy Krishna Das is a Hindu monk who was arrested in Bangladesh in 2024 on sedition charges.Das, a 25-year-old garment factory worker, was lynched to death by a mob over alleged blasphemy in Mymensingh city on December 18 last year.

US Supreme Court ruling: Treasury has enough funds if Trump’s tariffs are struck down; when refunds could begin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-supreme-court-ruling-treasury-has-enough-funds-if-trumps-tariffs-are-struck-down-when-refunds-could-begin/articleshow/126448985.cms,"'No Call From PM Modi': Trump Aide Lutnick's Shocker On India-US Trade Deal Amid Tariff Threats

If the US Supreme Court rules against President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs, the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for the tariff refunds, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said. The timeline of payments, however, might extend to weeks or even a year, he told Reuters.In an interview, Bessent said he doubted the court would rule against Trump's tariffs, but suggested that any refunds could become a “corporate boondoggle” for companies that passed on the costs to their customers.""It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,"" he said.""Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?""Bessent added that, in general, companies had not been passing tariffs on to consumers, stating there was ""very, very little, if any, pass-through,"" and disputed that Trump's tariffs had contributed to inflation. He noted that goods inflation had remained below headline inflation.Importers and trade lawyers had expected a Supreme Court ruling on Friday, but the court issued a decision on a different matter instead.It remains unclear when the court will rule on the tariff case, which challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner.Bessent said he believed that the longer the decision is delayed, the more likely the Supreme Court will rule in Trump's favour.With nearly $774 billion in cash as of Thursday, the treasury has more than enough to cover any refunds. Treasury borrowing estimates for January-March 2026 project an end-March cash balance of around $850 billion.""We're not talking about the money all goes out in a day. Probably over weeks, months, may take over a year, right?"" Bessent told Reuters.He also indicated that Treasury budget data for calendar year 2025 would likely show a deficit reduction of $300 billion to $400 billion from 2024, providing additional capacity. The government reported a fiscal-year deficit of $1.775 trillion for 2025, which ended on 30 September.Importers have warned that recouping any tariffs paid could be difficult if the Supreme Court finds Trump's IEEPA-based duties illegal. According to Customs and Border Protection data, $133.5 billion in such tariffs had been assessed through 14 December, with the total likely approaching $150 billion, based on Reuters calculations.Bessent disputed this estimate, saying it was ""not the number"" for tariffs potentially subject to refunds. He noted that revenues from tariffs imposed under other legal authorities also existed, but did not provide a specific figure for IEEPA-based tariffs.","Treasury secretary scott bessent says the treasury has more than enough funds to pay for tariff refunds.

In Fiery UK Conclave Speech, Suhel Seth Says India Has Evolved Beyond 1947, Now Shapes Global Power

NEW DELHI: In a move to shed yet another colonial relic, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj — black prince coats (bandhgala coats) — saying that “we have to find every trace of colonialism and banish them”.TOI has learnt that govt is carrying out a larger exercise across the board to identify similar colonial hangovers — attire and ceremonial rites — such as convocation gowns and caps (robe and mortarboard) which are de rigueur at university conovations and bandhgalas officers have to mandatorily wear at formal receptions. In some states personnel attached to district collectors and mayors in some states are required to wear a certain pattern of dress.Speaking at an event to honour railway officials and the zone for their exemplary works, Vaishnaw said, “We have to get rid of all colonial mindset. We need to find each of them and remove them whether it’s in our working style or dressing style. Today (Friday) I am making the first announcement. Humare jo band gale ka kala suit angrezon chalu kiya tha, aaj se yeh railway mein formal dress nehin rahegi. (From today onwards, the black prince coats that the British introduced will no longer be a part of formal dress in railways).Officials said that PM Narendra Modi has asked ministers and top bureaucrats to identify the colonial practices and to suggest alternatives that are of Indian origins and reflect the country's culture.While the practice of convocation gowns and caps has been fading, some institutions have held on to it despite the ceremonial gear not being suited for India’s hot and humid conditions and despite protests from students and faculty. Officials said that more practices, which are not commonly known to many, may be identified during consultations.Sources did not rule out the possibility of a nudge to do away with black coats and gowns that lawyers are required to wear as per Advocates Act, 1961 continuing a tradition inherited from the British legal system where it symbolised authority, dignity, and a commitment to justice. This law formalised the British-era custom, requiring advocates to wear the black robe with a white neckband for uniformity and gravity in court.",Railway minister ashwini vaishnaw announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the british raj.

Only 1 in 5 deaths in India medically certified: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-1-in-5-deaths-in-india-medically-certified-study/articleshow/126458125.cms,".

NEW DELHI: India records one of the highest numbers of deaths globally, yet the country still does not know what most people die of - a gap most pronounced in north India and even the national capital. A nationwide study published in Scientific Reports has found that only 22.5% of deaths in India are medically certified, leaving nearly four out of five deaths without a doctor-confirmed cause in official records.The findings are particularly significant for Delhi and north Indian states, which together account for a large share of the population. North India has the poorest medical certification of deaths, averaging just 13%, while Delhi's rate has remained stagnant at around 57-59% for years - far from universal coverage despite its dense network of hospitals and medical colleges.The consequences extend well beyond record-keeping. ""Without knowing the cause of death, it becomes difficult to assess disease prevalence nationally or regionally, which in turn affects health delivery, especially in remote areas,"" said Dr Vinay Aggarwal, former national president of Indian Medical Association. He added that poor death documentation also affected processes such as electoral roll revision, underlining the wider administrative fallout.Public health experts warn that unreliable cause-of-death data means govts are effectively planning health policy without knowing which diseases are killing people. Deaths from heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, infections, maternal causes, injuries and suicides cannot be accurately tracked, distorting disease burden estimates and skewing health spending. Weak certification also delays outbreak detection and undermines surveillance at a time when non-communicable diseases account for a growing share of adult deaths.The study tracked death certification patterns across India over 15 years, from 2006 to 2020.Regional disparities are stark. Large parts of north and east India continue to report single-digit or low double-digit certification rates, pulling down national averages and leaving millions of deaths each year without medical explanation.In contrast, southern and western states perform far better, reflecting stronger hospital reporting and administrative compliance. Some Union Territories are close to universal coverage - Lakshadweep reports over 94% medical certification, while Goa has near-complete coverage.The study challenges the assumption that doctor shortages alone explain the gap. While poorly performing states have fewer physicians, the strongest determinant is whether hospitals actually report deaths. In low-performing states, only about half of registered hospitals submit cause-of-death data, compared with over 90% reporting in high-performing states and UTs.The scale of the problem is stark. In 2020, India recorded around 8.8 million deaths. While about 80% were registered, only around 2 million had a medically certified cause. Progress has been slow, with certification improving by just 2.5 percentage points over a decade, despite expanded health infrastructure.Researchers warn that unless medical certification becomes routine and enforceable - particularly in north India and large urban centres like Delhi - India will continue to underestimate major killers, knowing far more about how many people die than why they die.","Only 22.5% of deaths in india are medically certified.

US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made a big statement over why the India-US trade deal is not sealed yet, claiming that it was due to PM Modi not calling Trump. Speaking at the All-In Podcast, hosted by Chamath Palihapitiya, Lutnick said, ""Let's be clear, it's his deal. He's the closer. He does the deal. So I said, you got to have Modi. It's all set up. You have to have Modi...they were uncomfortable doing it.""""So Modi didn't call,"" he claimed.This statement comes after US President Donald Trump, on Thursday, approved a bill that can impose at least 500% tariffs for countries buying Russian oil, aiming to ""punish them."" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill would give US tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil.In February, leaders from both countries directed officials to begin negotiations, setting an initial goal of completing the first phase by autumn 2025. However the deal still remains stalled with India's trade with Russia remaining a major flashpoint.Back in August, US imposed additional tariffs on Indian imports to the country alleging that New Delhi's purchase of Russian oil was fueling Moscow's 'war machine' in Ukraine.Since then total tariffs on Indian goods stand at 50%, including 25% of additional tariffs and 25% of Trump's reciprocal tariffs.Since then, two nations have held many rounds of trade talks with the meeting back from December 10 to December 12, when US officials visited New Delhi. India and the US are engaged in parallel negotiations, aiming to develop a framework trade deal to address tariff issues, and focus on a comprehensive trade agreement.The proposed agreement aims to more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 from the current $191 billion.The US remained India’s largest trading partner for the fourth consecutive year in 2024–25, with bilateral trade standing at $131.84 billion, of which $86.5 billion came from Indian exports. The American market accounts for roughly 18% of India’s total goods exports, 6.22% of its imports, and 10.73% of overall merchandise trade.Exporters have highlighted the need to finalise the agreement, noting that India’s merchandise exports to the US fell for a second straight month in October, declining 8.58% to $6.3 billion, largely due to the steep tariffs imposed by Washington.","Us commerce secretary howard lutnick made a big statement over why the india-us trade deal is not sealed yet.

NEW DELHI: Indian military retaliation against the terror attack in Pahalgam led Pakistan to frantically seek US mediation to make New Delhi pause the strikes deep inside its territory.Disclosures from US FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) filings reveal that between May 7, when IAF struck headquarters of JeM, LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen, and May 10, when Pakistan director general of military operations Major General Kashif Abdullah rang up his Indian counterpart Lt General Rajiv Ghai, Islamabad had launched an urgent lobbying campaign in Washington. Pakistani diplomats, including its ambassador and defence attache, initiated over 60 points of contact - comprising meetings, calls and emails - with high-ranking US officials and media outlets to solicit international intervention. The details are part of the filings by Squire Patton Boggs, hired by Pakistan for lobbying and which, like other US lobbying firms, are mandated to share with the US Department of Justice, the details and nature of their dealings.A majority of meetings were sought between the onset of Operation Sindoor and the eventual suspension of India's military operations with requests to secure American mediation to ""somehow halt"" India's retaliatory military operations.While Pakistan tried to dismiss the impact of India's strikes, the records confirm a high-level of behind-the-scenes panic.Pakistan had hired lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs originally to help it steer away from FATF grey list.

Gold February futures on MCX are trading near ₹1,37,800 after a sharp pullback from higher levels. The recent recovery attempt appears corrective in nature, with price facing strong resistance near the previous breakdown zone. Technical indicators suggest that upside momentum is losing steam, making higher levels vulnerable to fresh selling pressure.

'Security issue': Bangladesh halts visa services in India; tensions high amid violence against minorities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/security-issue-bangladesh-halts-visa-services-in-india-tensions-high-amid-violence-against-minorities/articleshow/126417947.cms,"(Photo credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday announced that it has asked its key diplomatic missions in India, including the High Commission in New Delhi, to temporarily suspend visa services citing ""security concerns"".""What I have done is that I have asked our three missions (in India) to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It's a security issue,"" Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain told reporters at a media briefing.The remarks came after Bangladesh's Deputy High Commission in Kolkata overnight restricted visa services, following similar steps taken earlier in New Delhi and Agartala.However, business and work visas have been kept outside the scope of the restrictions. Bangladesh also has diplomatic missions in Mumbai and Chennai, where visa services continue to operate normally.Hossain also said Bangladesh has approached the United States seeking a reversal of a recently imposed visa bond requirement. Dhaka will pursue diplomatic channels to seek an exemption, calling the move ""certainly unfortunate and painful for us,"" PTI reported.At the same time, he noted that the US decision was ""not abnormal"", as it was not applied only to Bangladesh and several other countries were facing similar immigration-related measures.Ties between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained since the Awami League government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in violent, student-led protests in July–August 2024.Relations have since hit another roadblock following the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka, which triggered anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year's July uprising, was killed amid rising political tensions, sparking widespread unrest.Protests also broke out after the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu factory worker who was lynched in Mymensingh after being falsely accused of religious defamation.Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a protest outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday, describing the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.India too raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions and what it calls ""misleading narratives"" emerging from Bangladesh. New Delhi further urged Dhaka to bring those responsible for the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained ""vigilant about the safety of minorities.""From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus for Bangladesh's instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities and undermining ties with India.","Bangladesh has asked its key diplomatic missions in india to temporarily suspend visa services.

No More Stopovers: Etihad Launches Direct UAE–Luxembourg Flights

Etihad’s network strategy: Global reach, local focus







In a major expansion of international air links, Etihad Airways has announced the launch of direct flights between Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and Luxembourg in Europe. This will mark the first time a Middle Eastern airline will serve the small but economically pivotal European country that is bordered by France, Germany and Belgium.Etihad is slated to operate three weekly flights on this route starting from October 29, 2026, using its newest Airbus A321LR aircraft, a long-range single-aisle jet designed for efficient medium-haul services. The move has been welcomed by business leaders, travel professionals and diplomatic circles as a strategic boost to connectivity between the UAE and the European Union According to Etihad CEO Antonualdo Neves, this is not merely a new flight route; it is the first direct air link between Luxembourg and the Middle East and it opens new horizons for business, tourism and cultural exchange.Initially, Luxembourg may appear to be a peaceful European capital city but due to its geographical position, it serves as a hub connecting France, Germany and Belgium, which are among the most prominent European markets.Etihad’s new air service aims to establish Abu Dhabi as a global hub that effortlessly connects the Gulf to Western Europe and other parts of the world.The move strengthens Etihad’s footprint in Europe at a time when airlines are pivoting toward efficient, sustainable connectivity and travellers are demanding more direct options. Luxembourg’s central location within the EU makes it especially attractive for corporate travellers, multi-city holiday planners and even transit passengers connecting onward across the continent.The new Luxembourg–Abu Dhabi service is expected to appeal to a wide range of passengers:With three flights a week, the service offers flexibility without overwhelming frequency, ideal for both short trips and longer itineraries. By using the fuel-efficient A321LR, Etihad aligns with broader airline industry efforts to cut carbon emissions while maintaining route profitability.In announcing the service, Neves emphasised that this new route is not just about moving passengers, it is about deepening economic and cultural ties between two regions that play outsized roles in the global economy. Luxembourg, home to major EU institutions and financial giants, has long been a crossroads of European commerce and diplomacy.Direct air connectivity to the UAE, a key investment destination and global logistics hub, is expected to unlock fresh opportunities for trade delegations, start-ups, investors and creatives alike.Cultural exchange is another key benefit. Students, artists and professionals from both regions will now find it easier to travel without the time and cost penalties associated with multi-stop itineraries. For the UAE, this means strengthening its soft power and tourism appeal in a cluster of countries that have traditionally relied on indirect connections through other European gateways.The Luxembourg route is part of a broader strategy by Etihad to expand its global network while reinforcing Abu Dhabi’s role as a premier aviation hub. In recent years, Etihad has launched and expanded direct services to North America, Africa, Asia and Australasia, always with a focus on linking passengers via the UAE to new, under-served city pairs.Travel industry analysts view this announcement as a calculated move that leverages Luxembourg’s high-value business traffic while offering leisure travellers greater convenience.According to aviation market experts, the world increasingly demands direct, efficient travel and Etihad’s decision to connect Abu Dhabi with Luxembourg directly positions the airline to capture both business and premium leisure traffic that might otherwise fly via other Gulf or European hubs.The introduction of this service has implications beyond air travel. It signals continued confidence in post-pandemic global mobility, underscores the UAE’s strategic aviation ambitions and strengthens Europe–Middle East linkages at a time of shifting geopolitics and economic interdependence.For the UAE, the added connection to Luxembourg enhances tourism appeal at a time when the country continues to diversify its economy. For Europe, it offers travellers and businesses a more seamless path to one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. Etihad’s Luxembourg launch is a historic win for both sides of the route: it connects two dynamic economic regions, expands travel options for business and leisure passengers and reinforces Abu Dhabi’s ambition to be a center of global travel and exchange.",Etihad airways has announced the launch of direct flights between abu dhabi in the united arab emirates and luxembourg in europe.

UAE excludes UK universities from scholarship list





The Times UK

Sharp decline in emirati students going to UK





Radicalisation concerns and the Muslim brotherhood





Broader diplomatic strains









The United Arab Emirates has taken a decisive step to limit government funding for emirati students who want to study at British universities, reflecting rising tensions over the UK’s stance on the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood. The move signals deeper strains in a historically close relationship and raises questions about the future of UK-UAE educational ties.According to The Financial Times report, the UAE’s Ministry of Higher Education published a revised list of international universities eligible for state scholarships in June 2025. While institutions in the United States, Australia, France, and Israel were included, British universities were notably absent.Officials told UK representatives that the exclusion was intentional, not an oversight. Sources familiar with the discussions explained that Abu Dhabi’s primary concern was preventing Emirati students from exposure to what it views as potential Islamist radicalisation on UK campuses. A person with direct knowledge said, “They don’t want their kids to be radicalised on campus.” UK officials responded by emphasising the importance of academic freedom.Officials with knowledge of the policy also toldthat federal funding was being limited for citizens hoping to study in the UK, but that the government was not imposing a blanket ban on enrolments. Wealthier families can still send their children to British universities if they cover the costs themselves, while state funding continues to be available for students studying in other countries.The decision comes after federal funding for Emiratis pursuing UK studies had already declined prior to June. Students who had already enrolled in British universities continue to receive support, but the new rules mean that Emirati students starting courses in the UK will face limited or no government funding.The impact has been tangible. In the year ending September 2025, only 213 Emirati students were granted visas to study at UK universities, marking a 27 percent decrease from the previous year and a 55 percent decline from 2022.Beyond scholarship restrictions, the UAE has also stated that qualifications from universities not on the approved list, including most British institutions, will not be recognised domestically. This diminishes the value of UK degrees for Emirati students seeking employment or further study in the UAE.The UAE’s move is closely tied to its long-standing concerns about Islamist movements, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood. Since the Arab uprisings of 2011, Abu Dhabi has imposed strict controls on domestic Islamist activity and sought to limit political Islam regionally. Under President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE has repeatedly questioned the UK’s decision not to proscribe the Brotherhood.Official UK data shows that during the 2023-24 academic year, 70 students at UK universities were referred for possible participation in the government’s Prevent deradicalisation programme for signs of “Islamist radicalisation,” nearly double the previous year, out of a total higher education population of almost three million students. While one UK academic downplayed the scale of Islamist activity on campuses, they noted that events such as the Israel-Gaza conflict have contributed to heightened tensions and protests on campus.The UK government’s 2015 review concluded that the Muslim Brotherhood had not been linked to terrorist activities in or against Britain. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s administration stated last year that the matter remained under “close review.”Separately, Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party, has pledged to ban the Muslim Brotherhood if he becomes prime minister. The UAE government funded Farage’s visit to the country in 2025.The scholarship restrictions are part of wider strains in UK-UAE relations. Past disagreements have included Abu Dhabi-backed attempts to acquire The Daily Telegraph in November 2023, allegations of UAE support for paramilitary groups in Sudan, which the UAE denies, and a legal dispute in the English Premier League involving Emirati-owned Manchester City football club.Despite these tensions, the UK continues to expand its educational footprint in the UAE. Several British universities, including the University of Manchester and Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, operate campuses in Dubai. Nevertheless, the exclusion of UK institutions from government scholarships highlights the challenges faced by Emirati students seeking to study in the UK.","The uae halted scholarships for uk studies, citing muslim brotherhood concerns, sharply reducing emirati student enrolment.

Iran In ‘LOCKDOWN’: Muslim Nations Cut Air Links As Deadly Protests Shake Khamenei Regime

Call for strikes and street mobilisation

Message to protesters and security forces

Who is Reza Pahlavi?

Protests grip Iran





Iran’s former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi on Saturday said that he is preparing to return home. He linked the possible move to the ongoing mass protests against the country’s clerical leadership.Pahlavi, who has lived in exile in the United States for five decades, announced the move in a video message and a post on X, as demonstrations continued across Tehran and other cities.“I, too, am preparing to return to the homeland so that at the time of our national revolution’s victory, I can be beside you, the great nation of Iran. I believe that day is very near,” he wrote.His remarks came amid widespread unrest that has disrupted daily life in parts of Iran and posed one of the most serious challenges to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in years.Many demonstrators have openly called for the return of Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, who was overthrown during the 1979 Islamic Revolution.In his message, Pahlavi urged Iranians to intensify pressure on the state by targeting the economy and reclaiming public spaces. He called on workers in key sectors to stop work and join the protests.“I call upon the workers and employees of key economic sectors—especially transportation, oil, gas, and energy—to begin the process of nationwide strikes,” he said.Also Read: 1 USD = 1,400,000 IRR: Iran on edge - why this is the most dangerous uprising yet He also appealed for coordinated street action over the weekend, asking people to gather from 6 pm with national symbols and move towards the central areas of cities.“Our goal is no longer merely to be present in the streets; the goal is to prepare for the capture and holding of city centres,” Pahlavi said.Pahlavi praised those who have continued to demonstrate despite threats and crackdowns, describing recent protests as a major blow to the leadership.“My dear compatriots, through your courage and resilience, you have earned the admiration of the world,” he said. Pahlavi added that the protests were “a crushing response to the threats of the treacherous and criminal leader of the Islamic Republic.”He also addressed members of Iran’s armed and security forces who have expressed sympathy with protesters.“To the youth of Iran's Immortal Guard, and all armed and security forces who have joined the national cooperation platform, I say: Slow down and disrupt the repression machine even more so that on the appointed day, we can completely disable it,” he said.Reza Pahlavi was groomed from birth to inherit Iran’s Peacock Throne and was undergoing fighter pilot training in the United States when the 1979 revolution ended his father Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi’s rule.Forced into exile, he has since lived mainly in the US, becoming a symbolic figure for monarchists and some opposition groups, according to BBC.Now 65, Pahlavi said he does not seek to restore the monarchy by force, insisting instead on a peaceful transition and a national referendum to decide Iran’s future system of governance.“This is not about restoring the past. It’s about securing a democratic future for all Iranians,” he has said previously.Iran has been witnessing widespread protests for nearly two weeks, initially triggered by rising living costs but rapidly expanding into broader demonstrations against the clerical establishment.Large crowds have taken to the streets in Tehran and several other cities, chanting slogans against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Several human rights groups said that dozens of protesters have been killed and hundreds injured in clashes with security forces.Authorities have responded with a sweeping internet shutdown, which activists say is aimed at limiting the spread of protest footage and masking the scale of the crackdown.The unrest has drawn international attention, with Iran accusing the United States and Israel of inciting instability. Tehran has approached the United Nations Security Council, blaming foreign interference for the escalation of protests into violent acts.",Iran's former crown prince reza pahlavi says he is preparing to return home.

Maxim Naumov honors Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova with emotional performance

Maxim Naumov stood on the ice Thursday night with tears in his eyes and a photo in his hands. The 24-year-old figure skater had just finished his routine at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in St. Louis, Missouri. But this moment was bigger than scores.
