US Tariffs on India : What did Trump announce?

What India Has Said About the 25% tariff

How will the 25% tariffs hit India?

India’s Exports Uncompetitive?

But is the 25% tariff rate all bad?

25% Trump Tariffs temporary in nature?

US President Donald Trump has hit India with a 25% tariff rate ahead of his August 1 reciprocal tariff deadline. India and the US are working on a trade deal but no interim agreement has been finalised. With this India has become the latest addition to the list of countries subjected to higher tariffs under Trump's ""Liberation Day"" trade strategy, which seeks to restructure American trade partnerships through enhanced reciprocal arrangements.The revised US tariffs will affect India's export of goods to America, projected at approximately $87 billion in 2024. This includes labour-intensive sectors including apparel, medicines, gems and jeweler, and petrochemical products.The trade imbalance between the United States and India is at $45.7 billion, favouring India.Vijay Chauhan, Executive Director, Deloitte India said, “Indian negotiators have done well to remain steadfast in securing national interest. We are watching the situation as the US negotiators are scheduled to visit New Delhi on 25th August.""Taking to social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD! INDIA WILL THEREFORE BE PAYING A TARIFF OF 25%, PLUS A PENALTY FOR THE ABOVE, STARTING ON AUGUST FIRST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. MAGA!The additional penalty for trade with Russia remains unclear for now.Also Read | Donald Trump imposes 25% tariffs on India! How does India compare to other economies like China, Japan, Vietnam on the rate list? Check details In a statement, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said, ""The Government has taken note of a statement by the US President on bilateral trade. The Government is studying its implications.""""India and the US have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months. We remain committed to that objective. The Government attaches the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of our farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs. The Government will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest, as has been the case with other trade agreements including the latest Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the UK,"" India has said.Agneshwar Sen, Trade Policy Leader, EY India says, “The decision to raise the US tariff to 25% on Indian exports is an unfortunate development, particularly given the strong strategic partnership that has been steadily built between India and the USA in recent years.If this tariff is sustained, this move may directly affect key sectors such as marine products, pharmaceuticals, textiles, leather, and automobiles, where bilateral trade has been especially robust. However, it’s important to note that both countries remain positively engaged in active negotiations with the US team expected in India later in August to finalize a comprehensive trade agreement,” he said.“I am confident that, considering our shared interests and history of cooperation, the two sides will be able to address these contentious issues constructively and arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement in the very near term,” he added.Garima Kapoor, Economist and Executive Vice President at Elara Capital sees the 25% tariff as a negative development, and one that may shave off 20 basis points from India’s GDP growth if the tariff rate stays at that level.“The exact details of the tariffs on the exempted items such as pharma and the ones that were charged at a differential rate such as iron, steel and auto is unknown as of now, but inclusion of pharma into tariffs should be incremental negative for India’s exports as US accounts for more than 30% of India’s pharma exports. If no deal is signed by Sept-October, we see a downside to the full year GDP growth estimate for India by 20 basis points,” she said.Also Read | India-US trade deal: Donald Trump announces 25% tariff on India, plus penalty for buying energy and arms from Russia Following the US tariff announcement in April, ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar had initially revised India's GDP growth projection to 6.2 per cent for FY26, considering sluggish export growth and delayed private capital expenditure.""The tariff (and penalty) now proposed by the US is higher than what we had anticipated, and is therefore likely to pose a headwind to India's GDP growth. The extent of the downside will depend on the size of the penalties imposed,"" Nayar added.Agricultural economist Ashok Gulati is of the view that the tariff will significantly affect India's seafood exports, particularly shrimps.The decision by US President Donald Trump to levy higher tariffs on Indian products is ""very bad"" and ""shocking"", noted Gulati, who had anticipated a more modest increase of 10-15 per cent.""This clearly shows Trump is unpredictable and punitive,"" he told PTI.The economist indicated that this development will substantially affect India's shrimp trade, whilst Ecuador stands to benefit due to its reduced tariffs and closer proximity to the United States.The impact of increased US tariffs will extend beyond shrimps to affect India's textile sector as well.Gulati further added that the benefits acquired through the India-UK free trade agreement would be offset by these elevated US tariffs.Earlier this month, an SBI Research report said that even if India is unable to secure a trade deal as per its desire, the impact is likely to be limited. “With India’s service exports reaching a new high each year, a record $387.5 bn in 2024-25 driven by sectors like IT, financial and business services, our total exports are not likely to get significantly impacted,” the report said.The most worrying bit about the 25% tariff is not the figure itself, but the fact that India’s Asian peers have managed to secure deals with the Trump administration that have lower duties. Japan will pay 15%, Vietnam will pay 20% and Indonesia has a tariff of 19%. This will hit India’s competitive advantage for US exports.India is actually looking to secure a trade deal that will give it preferential access to US markets compared to peers.Talking about the India-US trade deal negotiations Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal recently said, “...what is important is to get preferential market access over our competitors, our peers.”Garima Kapoor of Elara Capital says, “The 25% tariff rate is certainly a negative development as it compares to lower rates for peers such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines which compete with India in a similar category of labour-intensive products and electronic goods.”Ajay Srivastava from Global Trade Research Initiative explains, “Some sectors like our top exports to the US are pharmaceuticals, medicines, so Europe will be paying 15%, but European medicines are expensive, high-end proprietary medicines. We are into generics. So if we are paying 25%, I don't think much of the generic market exports to India, exports to the US from India will be impacted.”Regarding smartphone exports, particularly iPhones, he noted that with only China and India being major exporters to the US market, the 5% duty differential (China at 30% and India at 25%) would not significantly affect trade patterns.Garima Kapoor believes a hasty deal would have not helped. “On the positive side, it is pertinent to note that any hotchpotch deal which would have compelled India to give concessions to its agriculture and dairy sector may have had much deeper ramifications politically, socially, and eventually on livelihoods,” she says.“A well negotiated deal that addresses all aspects of trade, investment and tariff and non- tariff barriers by September October 2025 is likely to yield long term benefits than a hurried deal. The India-UK deal template which gave concessions to auto and opened public procurement sector has shown that India is willing to shed its protectionist tag in sectors where it doesn’t impact the marginal producer, which is a huge departure from its earlier stance,” she adds.As trade deal talks appeared to have hit a stalemate with the next round expected in August-end, it appears that India was already bracing for 20-25% tariffs from the Trump administration.""Talks are progressing well,"" a government official had been quoted as saying by Reuters, adding Trump could issue a tariff order in a ""worst-case scenario"".""But, we assume it would be a temporary measure, considering the five rounds of trade talks that have taken place. A deal will soon be worked out,” the official had said.As US officials visit India for the sixth round of talks in August-end, there are hopes that a trade deal will be finalised in the coming months.","India has become the latest addition to the list of countries subjected to higher tariffs under trump's ""liberation day"" trade strategy.

India Reacts To Trump’s Tariffs

India-US Trade Deal Stalemate

NEW DELHI: US president Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that India will have to pay 25 per cent tariff from August 1. Trump also said that India will have to pay an additional penalty for buying energy and arms from Russia. The 25% tariff rate announced for India is 1% less than the 26% declared by Trump in his April 2 'Liberation Day' conference.""Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.""Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!

Trump posted on Truth Social, ""THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE — IT STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED. A BIG DAY FOR AMERICA!!!"".India has made it clear that it will put national interest first in finalising any trade agreement. “The Government attaches the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of our farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs. The Government will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest, as has been the case with other trade agreements including the latest Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the UK,” a statement from the Ministry of Commerce & Industry reads.The government has said that it is assessing the impact of the 25% tariffs and also added that trade deal negotiations have been ongoing with US. “Over recent months, both India and the United States have participated in discussions aimed at establishing an equitable and reciprocally advantageous trade agreement. The commitment towards achieving this goal remains steadfast,” it said.Despite announcing the intent for a bilateral trade agreement during PM Narendra Modi's visit to the US, the two countries have not been able to work out an interim trade deal. Five rounds of talks have taken place between officials of the two countries and a sixth round is slated to take place in August end when a US team will visit India.Yesterday Trump had hinted that India could face tariffs between 20-25% since a trade deal had not been finalized. According to a Reuters report, Indian government officials have said that any tariffs the US may impose from August 1 are likely to be temporary in nature since talks are on to finalise a bilateral trade agreement by fall.Trump has repeatedly called for India to open its market to US goods, but the sticky points in the trade deal talks have been agriculture and dairy sectors.

He had also suggested that India would get a good deal for its compliance.Trump's outburst on Truth Social on Wednesday conflicted with his claim of having frog marched India to cease Operation Sindoor by dangling the threat of stopping trade.Interestingly, the 'all things not good' admission from the US president, who has earned the reputation of being the global scold because of his petulance and pugnacity, came on a day when the two Houses of Parliament concluded a debate on Operation Sindoor that was dominated by Trump's claim of having mediated the suspension of hostilities.Also read: India-US trade deal: Donald Trump imposes 25% tariffs on India - top developments On Tuesday, PM Modi had refuted Trump's claim, saying no global leader had asked him to cease the offensive, and that it was the sheer ferocity of the IAF strikes on Pakistan's airbases that led Islamabad to sue for peace on May 10.

Senior BJP leader and former union minister Uma Bharti on Thursday hailed the court’s verdict on 2008 Malegaon blast in which all seven accused have been acquitted, including former BJP MP Pragya Thakur, emphasising that terror has no colour.She added that Congress and especially former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh, must apologise for peddling the fake narrative of “ Hindu terror” and defaming “saints”.While talking to reporters after the verdict Bharti responded to the allegations of 'bhagwa aatankwaad (Saffron terrorism)' saying, “terrorism has no colour”.“Assigning colours to terrorism was the doing of those who claimed to speak for minorities. In doing so, they coined terms that politicised and distorted the nature of terrorism. Terrorism, in truth, has no colour. Yet the way some spoke about it was misleading,” as quoted by news agency PTI.She went on to say saffron is a sacred colour worn by freedom fighters of the country and to equate it to terrorism is a sin.“The Rajputs of our country, our kings, and all those who fought against the Mughal rulers and the British, wore saffron turbans and laid down their lives for the country's freedom.To associate that sacred colour with terrorism is a sin.” said former Madhya Pradesh chief minister.The BJP veteran while speaking to ANI broke down in tears, remembering Pragya Thakur.She said that the way Pragya was tortured in jail, it is very difficult for any woman to bear that. Bharti blamed several political parties for labelling her and others under the term 'Bhagwa terror'.Bharti went on to suggest propagators of these falsehoods and which caused such suffering must be held accountable and face consequences. Adding innocents were falsely implicated to support that narrative.“And to prove such a narrative, innocent people were framed. It saddens me to recall how a colonel, honoured with great distinction, and a saint, revered by many, were subjected to unimaginable physical torture. Countless others, whose names never even surfaced, suffered in silence. Swami Aseemanand, too, was tortured...No, we should not even ask for forgiveness for speaking the truth. Those who fabricated these lies and inflicted such pain should be held accountable and punished,” she told reporters.Nearly 17 years after the Malegaon blast in north Maharashtra that killed six people, a special Mumbai court on Thursday acquitted all seven accused, including Pragya Singh Thakur and Lt Col Prasad Purohit.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's 25% tariff announcement has ignited a political storm, with opposition leaders lashing out at the Centre and questioning its silence.Several opposition leaders questioned about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's silence over Trump's tariff and some of them are as follows.Rahul Gandhi launched a sharp attack on the Centre, claiming that India’s economy is dead — a fact recognised by everyone except Prime Minister Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. He accused the BJP-led government of systematically weakening the country’s economic foundation, defence preparedness, and foreign policy standing.During his interaction with journalists at the Parliament House complex, Gandhi stated that a trade agreement with the US is inevitable, with Trump setting the terms while Prime Minister Modi would follow the American President's directives.When questioned about Trump's assessment of the Indian economy, Gandhi responded, ""He is right, everybody knows this except the prime minister and the finance minister, Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact.""""The External Affairs Minister gives a speech that we have a genius foreign policy.

They promised good days, and what days they're showing us!""Shashi Tharoor, a Congress MP, ditched Congress view and opted to attack Trump. He expressed concerns about the significant implications of the 25 per cent tariff announced by Trump, describing it as a grave situation that could severely impact Indo-American trade relations.Speaking to ANI regarding President Trump's comments on economic matters, Tharoor explained that the situation is critical. He highlighted that beyond the 25 per cent tariff, additional penalties for India's purchase of Russian oil and gas could raise the total to 35-45 per cent. He mentioned discussions of potential 100 per cent penalties, which would severely affect trade relations. Tharoor noted ongoing trade negotiations might reduce these figures, whilst emphasising America's significance as a crucial market for Indian exports.Tharoor emphasised that the American administration needs to consider the requirements of the Indian government in these negotiations.He further stated that if American demands prove excessive, Indian negotiators should maintain their position. He stressed that America must understand India's perspective, pointing out that India's average tariff of 17 per cent on American goods is reasonable. He concluded by noting that American products currently lack competitive pricing for the Indian market.Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra criticised the PM and questioned the effectiveness of the Prime Minister's international diplomatic efforts.During her interaction with journalists, Vadra stated, ""Everybody has seen what the American President has said about tariffs, and he repeated that he stopped the war between India and Pakistan. India will have to respond to both issues. PM Modi goes everywhere, makes friends, and then this is what we get.""Lok Sabha MP and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav expressed concerns about the government's foreign policy management, suggesting that recent developments indicate challenging times ahead.""For the last 11 years, this government has kept making claims of friendship, and today we are seeing the results.

NEW DELHI: In a significant judgment, the Supreme Court on Thursday said to protect foundations of democracy, Parliament must take a call on the effectiveness of the anti-defection law mechanism, which has been virtually blunted due to the widely-perceived partisanship of speakers, leading to delays in deciding disqualification petitions against political turncoats.Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih gave this ruling while directing the Telangana assembly speaker to decide within three months the disqualification petitions filed against 10 BRS MLAs who defected to Congress after it formed govt in the state following the Nov 2023 elections.The verdict marks a departure from the restraint that courts have shown in setting deadlines for speakers and could well be a precedent in settling defection-related cases in the future.The CJI-led bench also directed the speaker not to allow the 10 MLAs, facing disqualification proceedings, to protract proceedings.""In the event any of such MLAs attempt to protract the proceedings, the speaker would draw an adverse inference against him,"" the bench said.Constitutional courts have generally refrained from fastening speakers with a timeline to decide pending disqualification petitions. However, SC said since the Telangana speaker has delayed adjudication of disqualification petitions by more than a year, it warranted issuance of directions to him.The bench was critical of the way the speaker issued notice on the disqualification petitions seven months after they were filed, and said such a delay breached the trust Parliament reposed in presiding officers to adjudicate defection cases fearlessly and expeditiously. In the 2023 elections to the 119-member assembly, Congress had won 64 seats, BRS 39, BJP eight, AIMM seven and CPI one. However, Congress's numbers rose after the defection of the 10 BRS MLAs.Writing the 74-page judgment recording numerous instances of speakers' deliberate inaction in speedy adjudication of disqualification petitions against MLAs, CJI Gavai said, ""It is for Parliament to consider whether the mechanism of entrusting speakers the important task of deciding the issue of disqualification on the ground of defection is serving the purpose of effectively combating political defections or not?"" ""If the very foundation of our democracy and the principles that sustain it are to be safeguarded, it will have to be examined whether the present mechanism is sufficient or not. ..it is for Parliament to take a call on that,"" the CJI said.SC reiterated the settled law that speakers/chairman of assemblies, Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha function as tribunals while deciding disqualification petitions under the anti-defection law, and that their decisions can be scrutinised by the HCs and the apex court. CJI Gavai examined the purpose behind enactment of the anti-defection law in 1985 through a constitutional amendment and said the only purpose of entrusting the work of adjudicating the disqualification petitions to the speaker/chairman was to avoid dilly-dallying and resultant delay in the courts of law or the Election Commission's office.He said, ""Parliament decided to entrust the important question of adjudication of disqualification petitions, on account of defection, to the speaker/chairman expecting him to decide them fearlessly and expeditiously."" CJI Gavai and Justice Masih said, ""With the experience of over 30 years of working of the 10th Schedule to the Constitution, the question that we will have to ask ourselves is as to whether the trust which Parliament entrusted in high office of the speaker or the chairman of avoiding delays in deciding the issue with regard to disqualification has been adhered to by the incumbents in the high office of speaker and the chairman or not?""Referring to a chain of cases under the anti-defection law marred by inordinate delay in adjudication by speakers across states, already frowned upon by SC in as many cases, the bench said, ""We need not answer this question, since the facts of the various cases themselves provide answer.""",Telangana speaker breached parliament trust: sc.

The verdict in the Bhushan Steel and Power Ltd case appears to be in the teeth of SC rulings.Mehta said IBC proceedings were followed to the T and it was the decision of the CoC to approve the revival plan of successful resolution professional, which was concurrently upheld by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the appellate tribunal (NCLAT) leaving little scope for SC interference.""Liquidating a viable and profit-making entity will be in the interest of none and would create many difficulties for the creditors as well as the successful resolution applicant,"" he argued.Kaul said JSW has infused an additional Rs 8,000 crore apart from the Rs 20,000 crore, and the company is now in robust health nearly tripling its productions. It now employs 25,000 people in the revived plant.On May 26, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Sharma had stayed the liquidation process and ordered status quo after learning that petitions seeking review of the May 2 judgment are pending consideration.","The supreme court thursday annulled its may 2 judgment ordering liquidation of bhushan power and steel ltd.

It was issued without judicious application of mind, and the mandatory twin test safeguard required by law was not scrupulously followed, the court said.The judge analysed Section 45 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), which outlines procedural safeguards. Section 45(1) requires valid sanction from the Centre or state govt to prosecute any terror offence under the Act. Section 45(2) mandates an independent review of the evidence by an authority appointed by the govt.Lt Col Prasad Purohit, through his counsel Shrikant Shivade (who passed away in 2022) and later advocate Viral Babar, had consistently argued that the UAPA sanction was flawed. Other accused also challenged the validity of the Jan 2009 sanction and another issued in 2011 by the additional chief secretary (home). The trial court held both sanctions to be ""defective.""While the prosecution claimed it had followed the twin test, the court said there was no evidence it was done as mandated under Section 45(2).""The sanction is not a curable defect. So, all the provisions of UAPA will not be invoked,"" the judge ruled.Advocates Ranjeet Sangle (for Sudhakar Dwivedi) and J P Mishra (for Sadhvi Pragya Singh) also argued that the first sanction bypassed the statutory safeguard under Section 45(2), and that the absence of such review invalidated the trial court's cognisance of UAPA charges.Special public prosecutor Avinash Rasal had contended that the sanction's validity could only be decided during the trial, a view echoed by the Supreme Court in 2018.However, the special judge reviewed the sanctioning procedure and found that UAPA charges could not be sustained due to the faulty sanction. Shivade had also pointed out that the authority did not comply with the mandatory safeguard of an additional review committee required under law since Dec 31, 2008.The prosecution argued that since the crime occurred in Sept 2008, the earlier 2004 provision-without the second review-was applicable. But the Supreme Court clarified in 2023 that the UAPA's procedural safeguards during sanction are mandatory.","Special trial judge a k lahoti held that the prior sanction under the anti-terror law uapa against the accused was ""invalid"" it was issued without judicious application of mind, and the mandatory twin test safeguard required by law was not scrupulously followed, the court said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123029934,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-744366,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Another indigenous warship joins Navy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-indigenous-warship-joins-navy/articleshow/123029921.cms,"NEW DELHI: Another indigenous multi-role stealth frigate, Himgiri, was delivered to the Navy Thursday that will boost country's blue-water combat capabilities. This is the second such stealth warship to be handed over to the force this month.The 6,670-tonne Himgiri has been built by the Kolkata-based Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), while her predecessor Udaygiri was handed over by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) on July 1. Both the warships are slated to be commissioned together towards end-August.The 149-metre long Himgiri is the third of the seven frigates being constructed under Project-17A, four at MDL in Mumbai and three at GRSE in Kolkata, at an overall cost of Rs 45,000 crore. The first was commissioned as INS Nilgiri in Jan, while the remaining four are to be progressively delivered by end-2026.All these multi-mission frigates are packed with advanced sensors and weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic precision-strike cruise missiles whose range has been extended to 450-km from the original 290-km, and ""designed to address current and future challenges in the maritime domain"", an officer said.For air defence, the frigates are equipped with Israeli-origin Barak-8 surface-to-air missile system, with an interception range of 70km against fighters, helicopters, drones and cruise missiles, among other weapons.""These frigates reflect a quantum leap in naval design, stealth, firepower, automation and survivability, and are an admirable symbol of aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) in warship building,"" the officer said.Overall, the 140-warship Navy has 58 ships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards for over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while another 31 warships are in the planning stage. This naval expansion is crucial to tackle the maritime collusiveness between Pakistan and China, which is making major strategic inroads into the Indian Ocean Region with the world's largest naval force of 370 warships.","The 6,670-tonne himgiri has been built by the kolkata-based garden reach shipbuilders & engineers.
