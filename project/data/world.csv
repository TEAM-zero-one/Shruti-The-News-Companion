‘Trump’s Team In Serious Discussions With India’: White House As India-US Trade Talks Continue

United States President Donald Trump on Thursday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he may travel to India next year as the two countries continue discussions on trade.Speaking to reporters at the White House after announcing a move to reduce the prices of weight loss drugs, Trump said his conversations with PM Modi were progressing smoothly. He also reiterated his personal rapport with the prime minister.""He (PM Modi) largely stopped buying from Russia. And he is a friend of mine, and we speak. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a great man. He is a friend of mine, and we speak and he wants me to go there. We will figure that out, I will go... Prime Minister Modi is a great man and I will be going,"" Trump said.When asked if he planned to visit India next year, Trump responded, ""It could be, yes.""The statement comes while trade talks continue between New Delhi and Washington after the United States imposed a 50 per cent tariff, including an additional 25 per cent duty, over India's purchase of Russian oil.Earlier on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""The President is positive and feels very strongly about the India-US relationship.A few weeks ago, he spoke to the Prime Minister directly when he celebrated Diwali in the Oval Office with many high-ranking Indian-American officials here at the White House.""Her comments followed Trump’s recent claim that India reduced its import of Russian oil. During his Asia tour, he said New Delhi was ""very good"" on the issue and that Prime Minister Modi assured him India would reduce or stop crude imports from Moscow.Earlier this month, ministry of external affairs (MEA) issued a response to Trump's comments, reiterating that the country's energy sourcing decisions are based on national interests and consumer welfare.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""India is a significant importer of oil and gas. It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.""","Us president donald trump praised prime minister narendra modi and said he may travel to india next year.

"2025 set to be second or third warmest year on record, driven by the highest ever atmospheric concentrations of GHG: WMO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2025-set-to-be-second-or-third-warmest-year-on-record-driven-by-the-highest-ever-atmospheric-concentrations-of-ghg-wmo/articleshow/125137938.cms,"AI-generate image

NEW DELHI: Year 2025 is set to be either the second or third warmest year on record as an alarming streak of exceptional temperatures continues, driven by record heat-trapping greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said on Thursday.So far, 2024 was the warmest year on record followed by 2023, the previous warmest. Both these years alongwith 2025 may, therefore, now be the three warmest years on record.Releasing its latest update on the state of global climate ahead of the annual UN climate summit (COP30) in Belem, Brazil, the global met body noted that the global mean near-surface temperature from Jan to Aug 2025 was 1.42 degree Celsius (± 0.12 degree C) above the pre-industrial (1850-1900) average, which was lower compared to 1.55 degree C (± 0.13 degree C) for the year 2024. The average temperature rise was 1.45 degree C in 2023.The update, based on six international datasets, showed that the 26-month period from June 2023 to Aug 2025 saw an extended streak of monthly record-breaking temperatures (apart from Feb 2025), and 2015 to 2025 will be the warmest 11 years on record in the 176-year observational history.Flagging record-high observed concentrations of the three key GHG in the atmosphere – carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – in 2024, the WMO said that the measurements to date from individual locations suggest that the levels of such concentrations will be even higher in 2025.“This unprecedented streak of high temperatures, combined with last year’s record increase in GHG levels, makes it clear that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degree C in the next few years without temporarily overshooting this target,” said WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo.She, however, said the science is equally clear that it’s still entirely possible and essential to bring temperatures back down to 1.5 degree C by the end of the century — the Paris Agreement’s goal of making efforts to limit global warming within that level.Though the year 2024 breached the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degree c above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels for the first time, one or more individual years exceeding 1.5 degree C does not necessarily mean that pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degree C is out of reach. Exceedance of warming levels, as referred to in the Paris deal, can be measured over an extended period, typically decades or longer.Referring to the average temperature rise in 2025, the WMO also flagged that the Arctic sea ice extent after the winter freeze was the lowest on record, Antarctic sea ice extent tracked well below average throughout the year, and long-term sea level rise trend continued.“Each year above 1.5 degree C will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and inflict irreversible damage. We must act now, at great speed and scale, to make the overshoot as small, as short, and as safe as possible – and bring temperatures back below 1.5 degree C before the end of the century,” said UN secretary-general António Guterres.","So far, 2024 was the warmest year on record followed by 2023, the previous warmest. Both these years alongwith 2025 may, therefore, now be the three warmest years on record. The global mean near-surface temperature from jan to aug 2025 was 1.42 degree celsius.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125138251,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-84717,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Antonio Brown’s Net Worth in 2025: From NFL millions to bankruptcy and legal trouble

More NFL News:

The name Antonio Brown once stood for brilliance on the football field, but today, it’s a symbol of a superstar’s dramatic fall from grace. The former NFL wide receiver, who dazzled fans with his unmatched speed and agility, is now facing serious legal trouble after being arrested for attempted homicide. Authorities confirmed that Brown, extradited from Dubai to Miami, is currently in custody over a May shooting incident outside a boxing event. It marks yet another dark turn in a career that has spiraled from record-breaking seasons to bankruptcy court.At his peak, Brown was among the most electrifying players in the NFL. With the Pittsburgh Steelers, he recorded multiple 1,000-yard seasons and earned seven Pro Bowl selections. His career earnings exceeded $80 million through lucrative contracts, but suspensions, fines, and abrupt team exits eroded much of that fortune. Once set to earn $30 million guaranteed with the Raiders, he ultimately collected only a fraction — about $138,000 that year. His most productive years came with the Steelers, where he earned nearly $69 million and cemented his legacy as one of the league’s elite.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Antonio Brown’s net worth in 2025 stands at approximately -$3 million.In May 2024, the former Super Bowl champion filed for bankruptcy in Florida, declaring $50,000 in assets against roughly $3 million in debt. The filings, cited by multiple outlets, reveal that Brown owes money to former agents, marketing firms, and unpaid child support.However, one major asset remains untouched — his $9 million Fort Lauderdale mansion. Purchased for $6.6 million in 2016, the luxury property is protected under Florida’s homestead law, which prevents a filer’s primary residence from being seized during bankruptcy proceedings.Brown’s post-football ventures, including a brief foray into rap music, failed to revive his financial standing. Legal disputes and unpaid obligations further compounded his problems. He’s faced lawsuits from promoters, allegations of unpaid wages, and a series of arrests that have overshadowed his athletic achievements.Now, at 37, the man who once stood at the pinnacle of professional sports finds himself battling criminal charges and mounting debts. Antonio Brown’s downfall serves as a sobering reminder of how quickly fame and fortune can vanish — and how difficult it is to reclaim them once they’re gone.","Antonio brown, 37, is facing attempted homicide charges in miami.

JD Vance's Hindu Wife Usha To Convert After Vice President's Pitch? US Expert’s Big Reveal

From victim to villian









FBI director Kash Patel 's girlfriend Alexis Wilkins raised her voice in support of Second Lady Usha Vance amid a heightened scrutiny on Usha's religion, her relationship with the Vice President etc. The row started with JD Vance asserting that he hopes his wife converts to Christianity, but did not end with JD clarifying that he is well aware that Usha is not inclined to leave her Hindu faith and embrace Christianity. Usha Vance was slammed for not issuing any statement amid the row and instead appearing in public on the occasion of Halloween with her family.Democratic commentator Kaivan Shroff, in a blog, opined that while Usha Vance is being considered as a victim, in reality, she is not. Calling Vance the villain, Shroff wrote: ""The second lady deserves to be held accountable for what she’s chosen to represent and the role she has willingly played in an admin whose values run counter to her very existence.""Country music singer and political commentator Alexis Wilkin, who is also Kash Patel's girlfriend, reacted to the vilification of Usha Vance and condemned it, calling it 'insane and dangerous'.Wilkins also supported Democratic politician Ro Khanna who said that while JD Vance should be criticized for his policies, his family and children should not bear the brunt.Alexis herself faces a lot of trolling because of her relationship with FBI director Kash Patel as MAGA commentators call Alexis an Israeli spy who 'honeytrapped' Patel. Patel was at the center of a major row after former FBI agent Kyle Seraphin pointed out that Patel attended an event where Alexis performed on his government plane. Seraphin also claimed that Patel fired a senior FBI staff member who was in charge of aviation records after it got leaked, and also blocked public viewing of his flight data.Usha Vance was initially portrayed as a victim of MAGA politics as MAGA won't accept a non-Christian first lady. In his ambition to run for the presidency in 2028, JD Vance was distancing from his wife's Hindu religion -- this was the narrative, But within a few days, the narrative changed making Usha Vance the villain. Donald Trump's biographer Michael Wolff commented that JD Vance and Usha Vance are in it together and they are plotting every day to achieve the presidency.","Kash patel's girlfriend condemned the vilification of usha vance amid the hindu-christian row.

“You know what? You can throw Lara Trump in there. Yeah!

Are Buffalo Sabres planning to trade Alex Georgiev amid goalie logjam?

The Buffalo Sabres are currently dealing with a potentially problematic goalie logjam throughout the upper levels of the organization, which may force general manager Kevyn Adams to make an early trade. Therefore, reports are suggesting, according to hockey insider Elliotte Friedman, the Buffalo Sabres are actively exploring options to trade veteran goaltender Alexandar Georgiev.As of Georgiev’s performance, he has emerged as a promising goaltender in the league. Earlier, Georgiev was traded to the San Jose Sharks by the Colorado Avalanche on December 9, 2024, three seasons after he was acquired from the New York Rangers. However, after some years, he signed a one-year, $825,000 contract with the Buffalo Sabres on September 11, 2025, after playing for the Avalanche and San Jose Sharks. The Buffalo Sabres are reportedly shopping veteran goaltender Alexandar Georgiev , as revealed by NHL insider Elliotte Friedman. According to Friedman, the Sabres have initiated discussions with other teams, signaling their intent to move the former All-Star amid a crowded goaltending situation.He stated, “The Sabres have made it clear Colten Ellis is staying. Someone asked me if Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen could be moved, but I'd be surprised. He's still their most-experienced and best option, assuming he is healthy.""Later, he added, “They are trying to find a new home for Alexandar Georgiev.” Friedman reported that Buffalo’s front office has been active in exploring potential trade scenarios.Meanwhile, Alex Lyon, who's seized the Sabres' No. 1 goalie job with a terrific start to the 2025-26 season, and prized prospect Devon Levi are the other goaltenders in the picture for Buffalo.Georgiev, 29, actually joined the Sabres as a short-term stabilizer, but his inconsistent play and his recent performances have been uneven this season. Once regarded as one of the NHL’s most reliable backups, his save percentage has dipped below .900 this season. That decline, coupled with Buffalo’s defensive inconsistencies, has hurt his market value.Although General Manager Kevyn Adams has not publicly commented on the situation, insiders suggest that trade talks could progress quickly, especially as the NHL season nears the midpoint and teams reassess their rosters ahead of the trade deadline.","The buffalo sabres are reportedly shopping veteran goaltender alexandar georgiev.

Former NFL superstar Antonio Brown has once again found himself in the center of a serious legal storm. The 37-year-old ex-wide receiver has been extradited from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, back to the United States to face an attempted murder charge in connection with a shooting that occurred outside a boxing event in South Florida earlier this year. According to the Miami Herald, Brown is expected to stand trial after a warrant was issued for his arrest in June.“Brown’s Instagram posts show he has been in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, for the last few months. When the warrant was issued for the Miami native’s arrest in June, he had an attorney who secured him a $10,000 bond, including house arrest. But Brown never turned himself in.”The charges stem from a violent altercation in May during a celebrity boxing event hosted by streamer Adin Ross in Miami. Videos circulated online appearing to show Brown engaged in a heated confrontation with several people outside the venue. In one clip, the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers receiver was allegedly seen holding a black pistol and chasing someone before a gunshot rang out, sending bystanders fleeing.According to the arrest warrant obtained by The Washington Post, police reviewed surveillance footage showing Brown punching a man, which “sparked a melee.”The report also stated that Brown allegedly took a gun from a security guard before running after the same individual. The victim was later identified as Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, who gained attention earlier this year for waving a Palestinian flag during Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime performance.Authorities charged Brown with attempted second-degree murder with a firearm—a felony that could carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $10,000 fine under Florida law. Legal experts note that while sentencing can vary based on intent and prior offenses, prosecutors may push for a tougher penalty given Brown’s history of legal troubles.The former NFL star’s career once glittered with achievements. During his prime with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brown twice led the league in receptions and receiving yards. But his success was overshadowed by off-field controversies, including sexual misconduct lawsuits, battery charges, and multiple arrests.Now, Brown’s latest case could mark a defining moment in a tumultuous post-football life. If convicted on the top charge, the once-celebrated Super Bowl champion may spend more than a decade behind bars—an ending few could have imagined for one of the NFL’s most electrifying talents.","Antonio brown extradited to the u.s. to face attempted murder charge.

Donald Trump’s Trade Weapon Tested: US Supreme Court Weighs Limits of Emergency Powers, Authority





In a marathon 2½-hour session that exposed fissures in the Trump administration's trade agenda, the US Supreme Court on Wednesday grilled lawyers over Trump tariffs imposed under a 1977 emergency powers law, with even conservative justices expressing skepticism over presidential powers in the matter.Neal Katyal, the Indian-American litigator leading the case for small businesses, delivered a forceful defence of congressional primacy, earning praise from legal scholars even as justices from both ideological flanks voiced doubts about the policy's legality. The case, consolidated as Trump vs VOS Selections Inc. and Learning Resources, Inc. vs Trump, could redefine executive authority in an era of economic nationalism.President Trump has warned several times that the case is a “matter of life and death” for the US and if the court ruled against his powers to tariff, “we could end up being a third-world country.” Countries and businesses across the world, not to speak of American business and industry, are watching the case -- many in person -- given its enormous import on global trade and commerce.“If our country was not able to protect itself by using tariffs against tariffs, we would be ‘dead,’ with no chance of survival or success,” Trump said in one of several posts on the case which he once intended to attend personally but dropped the idea because it would be a distraction.Katyal, a Yale Law School alum with over 50 Supreme Court arguments under his belt, opened with a stark declaration before the court: ""Tariffs are taxes,"" and only the Congress is constitutionally empowered to impose them. Representing importers like VOS Selections, a family-run wine and spirits firm, and educational toy makers battered by rates up to 145% on Chinese goods, he argued the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorises embargoes and quotas, not revenue-raising levies.""The founders gave that taxing power to Congress alone,"" Katyal said, invoking Article I of the Constitution and the nondelegation doctrine. He dismissed the administration's claim that IEEPA's ""regulate importation"" clause covers tariffs as ""fanciful,"" noting no president from Reagan to Obama had ever wielded it in that manner.The bench's reaction was a bipartisan fusillade, as it came down much harder on the government lawyer, solicitor general John Sauer, than on Katyal. Chief justice John Roberts, an institutionalist, zeroed in on IEEPA's silence on ""tariff,"" observing Congress has spelled out such powers elsewhere. Justice Neil Gorsuch, a textualist skeptic of executive overreach, also pressed Sauer on a ""one-way ratchet"" where Congress couldn't reclaim authority, musing it ""could swallow the Constitution. "" Both Roberts and Gorsuch are conservatives in a 6-3 supermajority that Trump has engineered.Legal luminaries hailed Katyal's performance as a masterclass, with Yale's Akhil Amar, Katyal's mentor and constitutional giant, saying, ""Neal channeled Madison – brilliant reclamation of Article I,"" while critics, including treasury secretary Scott Bessent, slammed it as ""foundational misunderstandings"" of trade goals.Several business leaders were present in the packed courtroom with lines forming before proceedings opened. A ruling is expected in December or January. A Katyal win could void many 2025 tariffs, triggering refunds – a ""logistical nightmare"" that conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett reflected on. Administration boffins have warned that even if the court rules against Trump they have a “plan b” to impose tariffs.The IEEPA duties, dubbed ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, have netted the US Treasury more than $ 100 billion, but critics say it is costing the average American household $ 1200 per year in increased prices. President Trump has rejected the estimates and insists that prices of essential goods and groceries have actually come down.On Thursday, he pointed to WalMart lowering its packaged Thanksgiving dinner for ten by 25 percent (to $ 40) to make his point.","Neal katyal, the indian-american litigator leading the case for small businesses, delivered a forceful defence of congressional primacy.

“Musk will get richer and a lot of people will get unemployed…”: Geoffrey Hinton warns on AI’s dark future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/musk-will-get-richer-and-a-lot-of-people-will-get-unemployed-geoffrey-hinton-warns-on-ais-dark-future/articleshow/125075257.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Geoffrey Hinton warns AI risks extend beyond technology



Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

Tech giants push AI growth, not safety



Automation and AI threaten employment



Potential benefits of AI



Need for regulation and careful planning in AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving rapidly, offering transformative possibilities across industries while simultaneously raising significant societal concerns. Geoffrey Hinton, widely known as the “Godfather of AI” and a Nobel Prize-winning expert in machine learning, has warned about the profound economic and ethical implications of this technology. Hinton cautions that, as AI adoption accelerates, tech billionaires like Elon Musk could see substantial financial gains, while millions of workers risk losing their jobs to automation. He emphasises that the challenges lie not only in the technology itself but in how society is structured, highlighting the urgent need to address the social and economic impact of AI alongside its technological development, urging global leaders to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in its integration.In an interview with Bloomberg Wall Street , Hinton has repeatedly highlighted that AI is not inherently harmful, but its unchecked development can lead to major societal disruption. He compares the potential dangers of AI to a “Chernobyl moment,” referring to the 1986 nuclear disaster in Ukraine that released lethal radiation and caused massive casualties. For Hinton, this analogy illustrates how technological progress, if not properly regulated, can create sudden and devastating consequences for society.He warns that the risks of AI extend beyond the technology itself and are deeply connected to the structure of society. “The reason it’s bad is because of the way society’s organised,” Hinton explained. “Musk will get richer, and a lot of people will get unemployed, and Musk won’t care. I’m using Musk as a stand-in. This isn’t an AI problem; it’s a societal organisation problem.”One of Hinton’s primary concerns is that the rapid development of AI is being driven by corporate greed rather than public interest or safety. Tech giants are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to gain a competitive edge, often prioritising profits over ethical considerations.The four major AI hyperscalers: Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon are projected to increase their combined capital expenditure from $360 billion this fiscal year to $420 billion next year. OpenAI alone has announced partnerships and infrastructure deals valued at $1 trillion with companies such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Oracle. These figures highlight the immense financial stakes tied to AI, which Hinton believes incentivise job replacement over societal well-being.Hinton predicts that large-scale AI adoption will inevitably lead to widespread job losses. He argues that corporations cannot achieve maximum profit without replacing human labour with AI-driven systems. Recent evidence supports this concern. For example, job openings have dropped by approximately 30% since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, especially in entry-level positions.Amazon’s announcement of 14,000 layoffs, predominantly in middle management, further illustrates this trend. While CEO Andy Jassy attributed the decision to “culture,” an internal memo predicted a leaner workforce as the company implements efficiency gains through extensive AI deployment. Hinton’s warnings suggest that this pattern of AI-driven unemployment is likely to accelerate as corporations continue investing in automation technologies.Despite the risks, Hinton acknowledges that AI has the potential to deliver significant societal benefits. In healthcare, AI can enhance diagnostic accuracy, accelerate drug discovery, and improve patient outcomes. In education, AI-driven platforms can personalise learning experiences and broaden access to quality instruction.Hinton stresses that the challenge lies in balancing these benefits against the risks of social inequality and mass unemployment. “It’s a difficult decision because it can do tremendous good too,” he said. “Increasing productivity in many industries should be beneficial, but society must manage these changes to prevent vast numbers of people from being left behind.”When asked whether he would halt AI development altogether if possible, Hinton expressed uncertainty. “I don’t know… it’s not like nuclear weapons, which are only good for bad things,” he remarked. This highlights the complex ethical considerations surrounding AI: it is neither entirely harmful nor entirely beneficial. Policymakers, industry leaders, and society must navigate a delicate balance between innovation and safety.Hinton’s insights underscore the need for thoughtful regulation and societal planning to ensure that AI technologies enhance human well-being rather than exacerbate inequality and unemployment. The rise of AI presents both extraordinary opportunities and serious risks. While billionaires like Elon Musk may see unprecedented financial gains, millions of workers risk displacement.","Geoffrey hinton warns that the risks of ai extend beyond the technology itself and are deeply connected to the structure of society.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) said that trade talks with India are “going good” and signalled that he might visit the country next year.Addressing reporters at the White House, Trump again shifted focus to the issue of Moscow’s crude oil, stating, ""They are going good, he stopped buying oil from Russia largely. He is a friend of mine, and we speak and he wants me to go there. ”When further questioned about plans to travel to India in 2026, he added, ""It could be, yes.""Trump's tariffs are now facing a trial in the US Supreme Court, which he has been using as a key tool in both economic and diplomatic strategy. According to a Reuters report, the US Supreme Court justices on Wednesday appeared doubtful about the legality of his sweeping tariff approach a case that carries implications for global trade and represents a major test of Trump’s executive powers.Trump’s remarks come at a time when India and the United States are negotiating a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), which aims to scale up trade volumes from $191 billion to $500 billion by 2030. The ongoing talks have gained increased attention due to the 50% tariffs currently imposed by the United States on Indian goods.Earlier this week, Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal also provided an update on the negotiations, admitting that although progress is being made, key challenges remain.“Talks are going on very well. There are many sensitive and serious issues, so naturally, it takes some time,” Goyal told ANI, when asked about the status of the ongoing trade discussions.His comments came after a similar update from the White House just hours earlier, which stated that the US President continues to prioritise strengthening ties with India and remains in regular contact with PM Modi, despite unresolved differences over tariffs and Russian oil imports.The White House update followed Trump’s recent acknowledgment of India’s reduced purchase of Russian oil. During his five-day Asia tour, he praised India for cutting back on Russian crude, describing the country as “very good” on the matter.Negotiations over the trade agreement have been active for months. Since March, five rounds of talks have taken place on the first phase of the deal, initially expected to be completed by the “fall of 2025.” On October 23, both sides held virtual consultations. In mid-September, US officials, led by Brendan Lynch, Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, met Indian officials in New Delhi, where both sides agreed to accelerate discussions.The bilateral trade agreement, formally introduced in February following leadership directives, is positioned as a key step towards expanding opportunities for both economies.Indian goods currently face a 50% tariff from the US.

Sex markers on passports and changes to gender marker policies during Biden reign





What it means for transgender?









The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed US President Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers that aligned with their gender identity.The decision, issued on the court’s emergency docket, permits the policy to remain in effect while a lawsuit over it proceeds.A lower-court order had required the government to continue letting applicants select male, female, or X on new or renewed passports to correspond with their gender identity. The Supreme Court’s three liberal justices dissented from the unsigned, conservative-majority order, AP news agency reported.“Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth,” the unsigned order stated. “In both cases, the government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment.”In dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the policy made transgender people vulnerable to “increased violence, harassment, and discrimination”.She added, “This court has once again paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate (or, really, any) justification,” and noted the policy derived directly from Trump’s executive order that described transgender identity as “false” and “corrosive”.The Supreme Court majority held that preventing enforcement of the policy would harm the govt because passports fall within foreign affairs, a domain of executive-branch control. The dissenting justices countered that it was unclear how individual identification documents affected national foreign policy.The State Department altered its passport rules after Trump issued an executive order in January declaring the United States would “recognise two sexes, male and female” based on birth certificates and “biological classification”.Sex markers began appearing on passports in the mid-1970s and the federal govt started allowing them to be changed with medical documentation in the early 1990s, the plaintiffs said in court documents.A 2021 change under then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, removed documentation requirements and allowed nonbinary people to choose an X gender marker after years of litigation.A judge blocked the Trump administration policy in June after a lawsuit from nonbinary and transgender people, some of whom said they were afraid to submit applications.An appeals court left the judge’s order in place. Solicitor General D John Sauer then turned to the Supreme Court, pointing to its recent ruling upholding a ban on transition-related healthcare for transgender minors and calling the Biden-era policy inaccurate.The plaintiffs, who challenged the policy, argue these passports are inaccurate and can be unsafe for those whose gender expression does not match the documents.“Forcing transgender people to carry passports that out them against their will increases the risk that they will face harassment and violence,” Jon Davidson, senior counsel for the ACLU’s LGBTQ and HIV Project, said.“This is a heartbreaking setback for the freedom of all people to be themselves, and fuel on the fire the Trump administration is stoking against transgender people and their constitutional rights.”Transgender actor Hunter Schafer said in February that her new passport had been issued with a male gender marker, despite her having been marked female on her driver’s licence and previous passports.","Us president donald trump’s administration can enforce a policy blocking transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers that aligned with their gender identity.

Pelosi’s Viral ‘No Kings’ Crown-Smashing Act Triggers Uproar Across Political Circles





SAN FRANCISCO: Rep. Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday that she will retire when her term concludes in early 2027, ending a remarkable career in which she rose to become one of the most powerful women in American history.Pelosi, 85, was the nation's first and only female House speaker, and she will have represented San Francisco in Congress for 39 years when she leaves office. She has served during an era of seismic change for American society and her own city, from the throes of the AIDS crisis to the legalization of same-sex marriage, and through the meteoric rise of the tech sector and the nation's extreme polarization.She entered political office later in life and became a hero to Democrats for the way she wielded immense power to push the Affordable Care Act, climate change legislation and infrastructure programs through Congress.""With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative,"" she told her constituents in a nearly six-minute video posted on X early Thursday, with clips of San Francisco's iconic cable cars and colorful Victorian homes flashing in the background.""My message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,"" she continued. ""We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.""Pelosi, who likes to use the phrase ""resting is rusting,"" led the House Democrats for 20 years, eight of which she spent as speaker. She has also been a prodigious fundraiser and raised more than $1.3 billion for Democratic campaigns, according to her aides.But she was reviled by conservatives, who painted her as the scary embodiment of liberal San Francisco values and blamed her for what they considered the nation's decline.She has been a chief irritant to President Donald Trump, even to this day, calling him ""a vile creature"" in a CNN interview that aired this week. She presided over two of his impeachment votes in the House. And he has called her ""Crazy Nancy,"" with no sense of fondness for his foe.Her Democratic colleagues said she was unlike any other politician with whom they had worked. Jackie Speier, a Bay Area Democrat who served in the House for 15 years, said that Pelosi would go down in history ""as the most consequential speaker ever.""""She has a command, a presence. All eyes turn to her,"" Speier said.Her retirement had been grist for the local and national political rumor mill for several years, and younger Democrats grew increasingly eager to run for her seat. They feared, however, that it would be folly to challenge one of the most powerful politicians in modern history.Pelosi, for her part, told CNN days ago that she had no doubt she would win reelection if she were to run for another term.Still, the overwhelming defeat Democrats suffered last year in the congressional and presidential races has prompted soul-searching within the party -- and louder calls for older Democrats to step down and make way for new politicians with fresh ideas.The race to succeed Pelosi was already shaping up to be a fierce one before she announced her retirement. Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who is a champion of housing construction, and Saikat Chakrabarti, who worked as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, have already announced they were running for the seat -- with or without Pelosi on the ballot.In recent months, Pelosi has refused to discuss her career plans, insisting she was focused solely on the passage of California's Proposition 50, a ballot measure to approve newly drawn House districts. She worked behind the scenes to help Gov. Gavin Newsom craft the measure, which passed Tuesday, and to raise money for the effort.It was considered one of her final achievements, both a blow to Trump, who had sought more Republican seats in the House by gerrymandering in conservative states, and a parting gift to the next generation of California Democrats who could benefit from as many as five additional seats in the state.Trump still has strong contempt for Pelosi.""The retirement of Nancy Pelosi is a great thing for America,"" he said Thursday in a response to Fox News. ""She was evil, corrupt and only focused on bad things for our country.""At a packed union hall in San Francisco on Monday morning, Pelosi was the emcee for a Proposition 50 rally that included Newsom and labor leader Dolores Huerta.""This is a moment of truth for America,"" Pelosi told the crowd. ""It's self-defense for our democracy.""In the audience, union workers wore T-shirts that Pelosi had autographed for them and pins with drawings of six tiny Nancy Pelosis standing side by side, each wearing a suit in a different color of the rainbow.At the rally, the ever-stylish Pelosi was sporting a green corduroy suit and green stilettos, never mind the fall she took in December on a marble staircase in Luxembourg that forced her to get a hip replacement and remain stuck for several months in dreaded flats.Pelosi's career in elected office has been a long one, but it did not span even half her life. Born into a politically powerful family of Democrats in Baltimore -- her father and brother each served as the city's mayor -- Pelosi went the more traditional route for women of her age.At first, anyway.She met her husband, Paul Pelosi, at Georgetown University, and the couple moved to his hometown, San Francisco, where she stayed home to raise their five children. During that time, Pelosi grew his career as a venture capitalist.As a young mother, Nancy Pelosi found a way to support the Democratic Party by opening up the family's large home for fundraisers. That led to friendships with a host of prominent San Francisco Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s, including Willie Brown, Jerry Brown and Phil and John Burton, brothers who served in Congress.Her connections and fundraising prowess helped her get elected as the first woman to chair the California Democratic Party.When Rep. Phil Burton died in office, his wife, Sala Burton, replaced him. Sala Burton was soon after diagnosed with cancer and told Pelosi she wanted her to run for the seat. Pelosi, who had shrugged off other suggestions to run for elected office, finally agreed.A special election was held in June 1987, and Pelosi, then 47, edged out Harry Britt, a gay socialist who had worked as an aide to Harvey Milk, the San Francisco supervisor who was assassinated at City Hall in 1978.Cleve Jones, who also worked for Milk and who created the AIDS Memorial Quilt, had backed Britt. Jones recalled in an interview that he initially had dismissed Pelosi as ""a society lady.""""I had the most wrong first impression of Nancy Pelosi,"" he said. ""I just didn't take her very seriously.""But he said his view changed when Pelosi used her first floor speech in the House to talk about the AIDS crisis as the Reagan administration largely ignored it. That same year, she helped Jones get his quilt installed on the National Mall in Washington.In 1990, she fought for the passage of an act named after Ryan White , a teenager who contracted HIV from a blood transfusion and was banned from his school after his diagnosis. The program paid for health care for HIV/AIDS patients who lacked medical coverage.""She's just always been there,"" Jones said. ""She's more than an ally. She's family.""Barbara Boxer, who represented a different part of San Francisco in the House and later became a U.S. senator, said in an interview that she and Pelosi were constantly confused for each other and lumped together as ""the two women from San Francisco.""They bonded by sitting next to each other during countless flights home. Boxer praised her friend's unique combination of her social justice values, driven by her Catholic faith, and her tactical ability to know every facet of every bill and exactly where each member stood on it.Together, they persuaded the federal government to dump a plan to turn San Francisco's military base, the Presidio, into condominiums.
