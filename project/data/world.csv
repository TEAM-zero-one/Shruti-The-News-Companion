NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party MP Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday slammed Pakistani nationals who demonstrated against India outside a venue in Copenhagen hosting an Indian parliamentary delegation and said that Pakistan is a desperate country, and they protest out of desperation.Addressing the Indian diaspora in Copenhagen, the BJP MP said that the Pakistanis who are protesting here are doing so because their ""handlers"" have told them to do so.""We have come here carrying hopes and aspirations of the people — the blessings, emotions, compassion, 1.4 billions Indians, we have come. I was very surprised to see the great Pakistanis shouting slogans there. When ambassador called me and asked, 'What's going on?' — we had gone to France, we had gone to Rome, we were here yesterday, and today too,"" the BJP MP, one of the leaders of 7 all party delegation who are going around the world to give details about Operation Sindoor, said.""The program is going very well — whether in France, Rome or Copenhagen — we are getting wide coverage in the local media, international media, on the radio, television, and social media. Then their handlers in Pakistan must have told them, ""What are you doing? Do something!"" So out of desperation, they came here. Pakistan is a desperate country — it acts out of desperation, and continues to ignore things with impunity.That is the whole point,"" he added.The visiting Indian delegation comprises BJP MPs Ravi Shankar Prasad and Daggubati Purandeswari, Samik Bhattacharya, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi, Congress MPs Ghulam Ali Khatana and Amar Singh, former Union Minister MJ Akbar, and Ambassador Pankaj Saran.Samik Bhattacharya emphasised their mission to alert the world about terrorism , noting that Pakistani businesses abroad often operate under Indian names.Former minister MJ Akbar described Pakistan as having a ""double face"" and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership in addressing Pakistan's behaviour.Priyanka Chaturvedi emphasised cross-party unity against Pakistan, referencing Shiv Sena's historical stance. She also questioned the IMF's decision to provide loans to Pakistan, suggesting the funds were being misused for anti-India activities.""As we were coming here, we saw some flags, and you all would know what those flags are. And I thought to myself, the IMF loan is coming in handy, and I hope those who are giving them the IMF loan realise what it's being used for. So, just two minutes ago, I walked outside to check if they'd left, and I was told they'd gone. And while we Indians continue to be resolutely strong in our backing for mother India,"" Chaturvedi said.","Ravi shankar prasad: pakistanis who are protesting here are doing so because their ""handlers"" have told them to do so.

"After Shashi Tharoor's delegation expresses disappointment, Colombia withdraws statement for Pakistan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-shashi-tharoors-delegation-expresses-disappointment-colombia-withdraws-statement-for-pakistan/articleshow/121528268.cms,"NEW DELHI: After the Shashi Tharoor-led delegation to the US expressed disagreement over Colombia 's statement supporting Pakistan , the state withdrew its statement and ""will issue a statement of strong support for our position and understanding of our position,"" the Congress MP said.""We met with the Foreign Ministry - the Senior Vice Minister received us. We had some good news: They have withdrawn their statement that disappointed us earlier and will issue a statement of strong support for our position and understanding of our position. Finally, here we are before this beautiful bust of Mahatma Gandhi on the campus of the main university,"" Tharoor said.Speaking to the reporters later, he said, ""There is no equivalence between those who attack our country and those who defend their own country, and our only disappointment with the earlier statement by Colombia was that it seemed to have overlooked this difference. We're very pleased to learn that that statement has been withdrawn as you've also mentioned, and we are also very pleased that you, as representatives of the people of Colombia, are determined to stand with us for our sovereignty, for peace in the world, for peace in the subcontinent of India and that you are very, very happy that this kind of dialogue will continue between our peoples and our representatives. ""Taranjit Singh Sandhu, former Indian ambassador to the United States and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, said that the delegation's comprehensive briefing was instrumental in prompting Colombia to reverse its stance.""This morning we had a detailed interaction with the acting Foreign Minister and our leader and the entire team made specific points to them explaining to them the timeline which perhaps to an extent they might have missed out. The end result was that they are withdrawing one of the other statements which had come out and have promised and stated, actually quite clearly, on terrorism and the issue. The importance of Colombia, apart from other reasons, is also that it will be a member of the Security Council soon,"" he said.Noting that Colombia understood India's position as it was once plagued by terrorism, BJP MP Shashank Mani said, ""It is notable that terrorism has affected Colombia as well. However, after a long struggle, Colombia is now a peaceful country. We have come here with a message of peace. We have clearly stated that we will give a fitting response to every terrorist attack, and when it is over, we want nothing but peace.""Tharoor voiced disappointment during a press conference in Bogotá on Thursday over Colombia’s stance. He noted that India was disheartened by the Colombian government’s decision to offer condolences for the casualties in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, instead of expressing solidarity with the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.""We were a little disappointed in the reaction of the Colombian government, which apparently expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of lives in Pakistan after the Indian strikes, rather than sympathising with the victims of terrorism,"" said Tharoor.""We will say to our friends in Colombia, there can be no equivalence between those who dispatch terrorists and those who resist them. There can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend. We are only exercising our right of self-defence, and if there is any misunderstanding here, on this core, we are here to dispel any such misunderstanding"", he added.Tharoor is heading the multi-party delegation on a tour across the Americas as part of India’s global outreach to emphasize its zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism. Following visits to Panama and Guyana, the delegation arrived in Colombia on Thursday. After wrapping up their engagements there, they are scheduled to continue to Brazil and the United States on Saturday.","Congress mp shashi tharoor-led delegation to the us expressed disagreement over colombia's statement supporting pakistan.

There is nothing like wealth that

Brings the insignificant to prominence.

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.A friend and co-speaker, Raja, has often shared a deeply personal episode from his youth. He was then unknown, and without means. A wedding in the family required financial help, and he turned to a wealthy relative with a humble request for Rs. 5,000.He was told to wait outside the house. And so, he waited—from 11 in the morning—under the harsh sun, parched, hesitant to step away for a sip of water. Hours passed. Finally, at 5pm, household help emerged—not with help, but with a verdict: “You are not lucky enough to receive support.” That day, Raja said, the truth struck him with greater force than the sun above—This truth does not apply to individuals alone but in the fate of nations as well.After nearly two centuries of British rule and another seven decades of struggles, India is now poised to become the world’s fourth-largest economy. According to IMF reports, India’s nominal GDP is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by the end of the year, slightly ahead of Japan’s $4.18 trillion. If this momentum continues, India may overtake Germany and claim the third spot by 2028.This ascent has not been easy. For generations, India has been a cautionary tale of lost wealth and squandered dignity. When the British arrived, India held 23% of the global economy which reduced to less than 4% when they left. The famed Industrial Revolution of England was built on the ruins of Indian craftsmanship. India’s wealth funded the British empire, its taxes paying the British officials, its famine feeding their fortunes. Historians estimate that between 15 and 29 million Indians died from starvation during British rule, much of it linked directly to exploitative policies.Even in the 1960s, we were staggering under the weight of poverty. Food shortage forced us to seek grain aid from countries like the United States. Former CIA official Bruce Riedel’s book cites letters written in 1962 from Indian leadership to John F Kennedy pleading for advanced fighter jets, transport aircraft, and supersonic air forces, as India was losing ground to China in a border war. Kennedy refused the request—gently, but firmly.From seeking food and defence aid to now becoming the world’s fourth economic power is a journey steeped in struggle and silent grit.Economists may credit reforms and policies but the efforts of its people—especially the young—should also be credited. With a median age in the early 30s, India is more open to adopting change and new technology than societies like Japan, with a much older population.Among the new revolutions in technology, the UPI remains my favourite. Nearly a decade ago, I attended a meeting with the creators of UPI—then a nascent idea under the Reserve Bank of India. It felt like science fiction when they spoke of a future where every payment will happen via mobile phones.Today, it’s part of everyday life. Last year alone, India saw over a billion UPI transactions. On a street corner,, a 72-year-old idli vendor, refuses to extend credit when customers say they have no change. “You can GPay, RuPay or PhonePe—but please pay,” she says. She never went to school. That is the India we are becoming.There is still a long way to go. The per capita GDP of Japan is over $33,000, while India’s still hovers below $3,000.Saint poet Valluvar did not limit his wisdom to spiritual wealth but also material wealth, and gave the most prudent advice about earning prosperity.","After nearly two centuries of british rule and another seven decades of struggles, india is now poised to become the world’s fourth-largest economy.

Donald Trump, US Lied About India-Pak Ceasefire Role, Trade Deal During Op Sindoor: Ex-US Official

Pakistan's Strategic Bitcoin reserve plans

Pakistan’s scramble to please US President Donald Trump by establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve seems to have landed it in a soup! According to a report in the Dawn, senior officials in Islamabad have said that cryptocurrency remains banned in Pakistan. The State Bank of Pakistan and the Ministry of Finance both clarified that cryptocurrency transactions remain prohibited in Pakistan, with all such dealings considered unlawful under existing regulations.At a session of the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal explained that despite the recent establishment of a Crypto Council by the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif through executive order to explore digital asset policies, the prohibition on cryptocurrency remains enforced under SBP and SECP guidelines.According to the Dawn report, Bosal said, ""There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan."" He emphasised that formal legislation would be necessary to alter the current status.Also Read | Donald Trump’s trade policy thrown into turmoil!

India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the UK, France, and Japan to co-develop fighter jet engines, broadening its defense ties beyond the US as it faces mounting security challenges and looks to shore up its indigenous aerospace capabilities, a Bloomberg report said. Senior officials told Bloomberg that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will evaluate these proposals, with the aim to start the project swiftly.The countries in talks-UK’s Rolls-Royce, France’s Safran, and an undisclosed Japanese partner-are all offering technology transfers and potential co-production arrangements, according to people familiar with the matter. Rolls-Royce offered to jointly produce and transfer technology to India during a visit by senior defense ministry officials to the UK in April, while Safran is reportedly open to sharing intellectual property rights, the Bloomberg report said.India’s push to diversify its fighter jet engine partnerships signals a strategic rebalancing in its defense policy. For decades, India’s defense ties leaned heavily on Russian suppliers, with growing partnerships with the US in the past decade. However, India’s decision to explore new partners highlights a shift: an urgent focus on reliability, supply chain security, and technological self-sufficiency amid global uncertainties.Air Chief Marshal A P Singh warned at an industry event on Thursday that delays in acquiring critical weapons “pose a serious challenge to national defense readiness,” adding bluntly, “Not for a single project that I can think of that has been completed on time.” His remarks underscore why India is moving beyond a single-source approach, especially after penalties were imposed on General Electric for delivery delays on engines that power India’s locally-made Tejas light combat jets.India’s military modernization push has been a long time coming, with delays plaguing every step of the way. Singh’s remarks-“once a timeline is given… not a single project that I can think of has been completed on time”-reflect growing impatience within India’s defense establishment.State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) has faced flak for delays in delivering Tejas Mark-1A jets, forcing the government to pivot to private sector involvement to speed things up. The new execution model for the AMCA is a radical shift, designed to harness private innovation and global expertise while ending HAL’s monopoly on fighter production.India’s ambition is to power its twin-engine fifth-generation fighter jets-currently under the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) project-with engines co-developed or built domestically in collaboration with global partners. The AMCA program is part of India’s larger vision to modernize its aging, largely Russian-made air force fleet and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers.Defense minister Rajnath Singh has approved a new “execution model” for the AMCA, which for the first time allows private sector firms to bid for the project alongside the HAL. Officials say the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), which is leading the project, will soon issue an expression of interest to domestic and international players.The project’s significance is clear: China’s rapidly advancing J-20 and rumored sixth-generation jets have raised alarm bells in Delhi. Meanwhile, Pakistan is set to acquire at least 40 Chinese J-35A fifth-generation fighters. With only 30 active fighter squadrons against an authorized strength of 42, India needs to catch up-and quickly.Michael Rubin, a South Asia analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, described India’s drive as part of a “broader effort to secure the supply chain for critical defense equipment.” He noted that the “military lesson from Ukraine’s war has been clear: self-sufficiency and reliable partnerships are paramount.”Meanwhile, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh emphasized in his CII Business Summit remarks, “We need to quickly get our act together… while design in India continues to produce results in the near future or maybe later, what is required today is required today.”India’s defense collaborations are moving from traditional vendor relationships to true joint development. Rolls-Royce, for example, offered to share cutting-edge engine technology, while Safran has expressed willingness to co-create intellectual property within India-key for India’s ambitions to be more than just an assembly hub.Japan, too, has signaled openness to deeper defense industrial ties, aligning with India’s vision of a broader Indo-Pacific security network. Defence minister Rajnath Singh held talks in May with his Japanese counterpart, exploring potential collaborations in tank and aero engine development.These moves do not indicate a cooling of India-US ties-joint manufacturing of GE’s F414 engines is still a cornerstone of Indo-US defense cooperation. But delays in that deal have prompted India to cast a wider net, underscoring that while Washington remains a top partner, India wants alternatives to hedge against risks.Indeed, India’s engagement with the UK, France, and Japan is about more than just hardware-it’s about building strategic resilience in the defense sector. A senior official involved in the negotiations said the goal is not to sideline US defense ties but “to ensure we have multiple options, as this is about national security.”India aims to finalize the AMCA’s prototype phase by developing five aircraft before moving to series production.For the first two AMCA squadrons, India will rely on the US-made GE F414 engines. But for the remaining five squadrons-over 100 jets-it wants more powerful 110-kilonewton engines built with technology partners outside the US, according to officials.India’s broader defense transformation, its AMCA program, and its engagement with multiple global players highlight a fundamental truth: for New Delhi, defense self-reliance and resilient supply chains are no longer optional-they are non-negotiable in a rapidly changing world.","India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the uk, france, and japan to co-develop fighter jet engines.

What’s at stake for Turkey

What’s next

(With inputs from agencies)

Turkey’s much-hyped Bayraktar TB2 drones, hailed as revolutionary weapons in conflicts from Ukraine to Libya, have suffered a devastating reputational blow after Pakistan’s Turkish-origin drone fleet failed spectacularly during Operation Sindoor. Indian forces, using indigenous Akashteer air defense systems, shot down every single Turkish-origin drone in the May conflict, leaving the Turkish defense industry scrambling to defend its once-prized exports.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long touted Turkish-made drones as a symbol of his “Islamist vision” and a centerpiece of Turkey’s defense ambitions. The drones were not only instruments of hard power but also a diplomatic tool for Turkish influence in Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. But as India’s Akashteer system intercepted Pakistani drones with 100% accuracy, Turkey’s arms export ambitions took a direct hit.Also read: Turkish drones to Chinese missiles, India beat them all This collapse of performance-described by a senior Indian officer as “not a single drone achieving its objective”-has raised fresh doubts about Turkish drones’ battlefield credibility and the broader promise of Turkey’s defense industry.Pakistan’s military imported hundreds of Turkish drones, hoping to overwhelm Indian air defenses and showcase Turkish technology as a regional power equalizer.Instead, the attack ended in humiliating defeat. Indian Air Defence officers confirmed that 300-400 Turkish drones, including Byker YIHA III kamikaze drones and Turkish-origin micro-drones like Songatri and eYatri, were neutralized in mid-air before they could even scratch Indian defenses.A Pakistani source told Reuters that Turkish drones were meant to provide cover for manned aircraft and artillery strikes, but “the drones failed to reach targets” as India’s integrated air defenses, from legacy L70 guns to cutting-edge Akashteer radars, kicked in.Michael Rubin, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, minced no words: “Erdogan may offer a hard sale to promote his Islamist vision or simply to enrich his family, but the product he is selling is now subpar. Just as socialism stymies development as bureaucrats fail to adjust for competition, so too does nepotism ruin industries. Baykar, knowing it had full state support, simply stopped innovating effectively. ”Pakistani officials have tried to downplay the losses, insisting they are re-evaluating drone deployment strategies. But the magnitude of the failure is hard to hide: Indian Air Defence sources say they recovered hundreds of drone parts along the border-clear evidence of Turkey’s failure to deliver.The real star of this clash? India’s homegrown Akashteer system. Developed by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Akashteer integrates seamlessly with Indian Army and Air Force radars. It automates threat detection, tracks targets, and assigns weapons in real time-a feature that proved decisive in the face of Pakistan’s drone swarm.“It didn’t roar or flash - it listened, calculated and struck with precision,” an official told PTI. “Every threat was intercepted, every target neutralised.”This level of precision is no fluke. Indian officers compared Akashteer’s performance to Israel’s Iron Dome, noting that while Iron Dome specializes in missile defense, Akashteer has shown exceptional versatility against low-flying drones and loitering munitions.For Turkey, the reputational hit goes beyond this one conflict. The Bayraktar TB2 had become the face of Turkish defense sales, with celebrated success stories in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and early phases of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But cracks were already showing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky noted last year that “those or other drones can help, but do not affect the result,” as Russia’s electronic warfare systems jammed Bayraktar drones.The India-Pakistan clash has underscored these vulnerabilities, exposing Turkish drones as poorly adapted to modern electronic and radar-dense battlefields.This is not the first time that battlefield performance has shattered weapons myths. In 1982, Israeli Air Force F-15s and F-16s downed over 80 Soviet-built Syrian MiGs without losing a single plane-an outcome that punctured the myth of Soviet invincibility in Arab states. Analysts say Turkey is facing a similar reckoning now.“Any African despot or Central Asian country still purchasing Turkish hardware should recognize they risk wasting hundreds of millions of dollars,” Rubin warned.For President Erdogan and his son-in-law’s company Baykar, the India-Pakistan conflict is more than just a marketing setback. It’s a blow to Turkey’s entire narrative of self-sufficiency and regional influence.Analysts are already warning that countries in Africa and Central Asia that relied on Turkish drones may now look elsewhere. China and the US remain key players in the global drone market, and Turkey’s stumble has opened the door for rivals to push their systems as more reliable and battle-proven.As Pakistan rebuilds its airfields and grapples with the aftermath of this clash, Turkey’s defense industry is facing questions that go well beyond the battlefield. In Africa, Somali and Libyan leaders had turned to Turkish drones to prop up their regimes. In Ethiopia, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed used Bayraktar drones to devastating effect against Tigray forces. But after this fiasco, prospective buyers may pause-fearing that the Turkish drones they once saw as cost-effective alternatives to Western systems may be little more than paper tigers.Meanwhile, India’s success with Akashteer has emboldened its push for indigenous defense technology. Smit Shah of the Drone Federation India said that India plans to triple its drone investments in the next two years-leveraging the lessons of Operation Sindoor to build a robust domestic drone and counter-drone ecosystem.","Turkey's much-hyped bayraktar tb2 drones have suffered a devastating reputational blow.

There's an elected government in Kashmir today, and therefore, for people who want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir,"" he added.This comes after Tharoor faced criticism from party colleagues over his recent remarks on surgical strikes.Tharoor, currently leading a multi-party delegation to countries including Panama and the US, had said that India conducted its first cross-border surgical strike in 2016, a claim seen by many in the party as undermining similar operations during the UPA era.Facing flak from Congress leaders such as Pawan Khera and Udit Raj, Tharoor defended himself in a strongly worded post on X from Panama City, clarifying that his remarks specifically referred to responses to terrorist attacks, not to prior wars or conflicts.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.Tharoor's ""India breached the LoC for the first time during the 2016 surgical strike"" remark prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of denigrating Congress's legacy. ""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed the LoC and the International border?"" Raj questioned.He went so far as to suggest Tharoor be made a ""super spokesperson of the BJP.""Pawan Khera also weighed in, posting a screenshot from Tharoor’s book, where the MP had previously criticised the Modi government for politicising the 2016 strikes while acknowledging that the Congress had authorised several such operations in the past without publicising them.","Bjp it cell chief amit malviya, in a post on x, pointed to khurshid’s remarks during the ongoing multi-party mps delegation tour. He said they signaled cross-party support for the government's actions in jammu & kashmir. This comes after tharoor faced criticism from party colleagues over his recent remarks on surgical strikes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121520005,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-970302,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'No Active Mediation': Shashi Tharoor Echoes Govt, Denies Trump or US Role in Op Sindoor Ceasefire

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , one of the leaders of seven all-party delegations, on Thursday (local time) expressed disappointment over Colombia's condolences for the people who lost their lives in Pakistan when India launched a counterstrike on May 7, and said that there can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend. He added that India was only exercising its right of self-defence.Tharoor, who is in Columbia as part of the Centre's move, has also shown the picture of Pakistani Army officials attending the funerals of terrorists after India's strike on their terror bases and said that if there is any misunderstanding the delegation is here to clear that.""We were a little disappointed in the reaction of the Colombian government, which apparently expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of lives in Pakistan after the Indian strikes, rather than sympathising with the victims of terrorism. We will say to our friends in Columbia there can be no equivalence between those who dispatch terrorists and those who resist them. There can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend,"" Tharoor said while addressing media in Bagota.""We are only exercising our right of self-defence, and if there is any misunderstanding here on this core, we are here to dispel any such misunderstanding. We're very happy to talk to Colombia about the circumstances in detail.We have, as I said, very concrete proof. In fact, when this terrorist attack occurred, it was immediately claimed by an organisation called The Resistance Front, which is a unit of the Lashkar-e-Taiba base in Muridke, Pakistan,"" he added.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and PoK, after the Pahalgam attack which claimed the lives of 26 people.The Indian Air Force also destroyed 11 Pakistani airbases in response to Pakistan's failed attempts to strike Indian military positions on May 8, 9, and 10.Tharoor emphasised India's resolute position against terrorism, explaining how the nation responded to the Pahalgam terror attack with Operation Sindoor strikes against terrorist infrastructure.""India suffered a grievous terrorist attack on the 22nd of April... When this happened, of course, the world rose up to condemn the terrorist attack, but that was as far as it went. There was no action taken, not even by the country where these people had emerged from, Pakistan. Nobody was arrested, and there was no attempt at any prosecution. India decided that this kind of outrage could not go unpunished. On May 7, India chose to strike against known terror bases and launch pads. ""He highlighted Pakistan's role in providing terrorists with sanctuary and support.""There (in Pakistan) was a well-publicised funeral of one of the terrorists on the sanctions list. That funeral was attended by uniformed senior military and police personnel from Pakistan. That is the extent of complicity that we are seeing between the terrorists who perpetrate crimes of this nature and those who finance, guide, train, arm, and equip them and do provide them safe haven to continue their training and their other awful deeds,"" he stated.",Congress mp shashi tharoor expressed disappointment over colombia's condolences for the people who lost their lives in pakistan when india launched a counterstrike on may 7.

DGCA gives 'last & final' 3-month extension to IndiGo for 2 Boeing 777s wet leased from Turkish Airlines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-gives-last-final-3-month-extension-to-indigo-for-2-boeing-777s-wet-leased-from-turkish-airlines/articleshow/121519413.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has given “one time last and final three-month extension” to IndiGo for the two wide body Boeing 777s it has wet leased (hired with operating crew) from Turkish Airlines. The airline can use them till Aug 31, instead of Nov 30, 2025, as it had applied for. The DGCA gave this final extension “in order to avoid passenger inconvenience due to immediate flight disruption” after getting an “undertaking from the airline that they will terminate the damp lease with Turkish Airline within this extension period, and not seek any further extension for these operations,” said a senior aviation official.“Indigo is currently operating two Boeing 777-300 extended range aircraft under damp lease from Turkish Airline, which was permitted upto May 31, 2025. IndiGo requested for a further extension of the same for another six months, which was not agreed to. However, in order to avoid passenger inconvenience due to immediate flight disruption, IndiGo has been granted a one-time last and final extension of three months,” said the official.Turkey’s steadfast supported to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, apart from Pakistan using Turkish drones to attack Indian cities near the western border, has led to a rethink in New Delhi. India had a fortnight back revoked the security clearance of Turkish ground handling company Celebi which led it from being barred at the nine Indiana airports where it used to operate. DGCA’s Friday ruling comes in that backdrop.IndiGo had requested Indian aviation authorities to extend the lease period by another six months for two Turkish Airlines’ wide body Boeing 777 which the budget carrier uses on routes between Delhi/Mumbai and Istanbul. IndiGo has since early 2023 used these wet leased (hired with operating crew) Turkish planes to operate a daily direct between Delhi & Istanbul and Mumbai & Istanbul. Turkish has the same two daily routes, with no more room for any more flights between the two countries under current bilaterals that Turkey has unsuccessfully tried with the Modi govt to be revised upwards for some years now.IndiGo since 2018 has a code share with Turkish. A significant number of passengers on Turkish and IndiGo flights fly between India and rest of the world via Istanbul on Turkish network — something that hurts Air India’s multi billion dollar plan for providing direct connectivity to & from India. In the past, AI has frowned at the long term wet lease of wide body aircraft done by IndiGo.On the Turkish wet lease issue, IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said Friday: “We operate under the ambit of the air service agreement between India and Turkey. A large number of passengers, mostly Indians, are booked on these flights (to & from Istanbul) to travel between India and other countries (via Istanbul). The (wet lease) is as per regulatory approvals and we will be in conformity with those requirements.”",Indigo had requested indian aviation authorities to extend the lease period by another six months for two turkish airlines’ wide body boeing 777.

JAMMU/NEW DELHI: BSF dismantled 118 Pakistani forward posts and surveillance networks along the Jammu frontier that will take years to be repaired, Union home minister Amit Shah said Friday, lauding the force for its tenacious response to Islamabad’s aggression in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor Shah was speaking while meeting BSF troopers in Jammu’s Poonch, his first visit after Operation Sindoor to J&K, where he also vowed to leave “no stone unturned” for Amarnath Yatra from July 3 to Aug 9 with full security measures and facilities.“When Pakistan responded to our anti-terror operations by attacking our borders and civilian areas, it was the BSF jawans of Jammu frontier who retaliated,” Shah said, referring to the May 7 strikes on terror hubs in Pakistan after terrorists killed 26 people, mostly tourists, on April 22 in Pahalgam.Commending the “(border sentinels)” for “knocking down Pakistan’s surveillance systems one by one” and which the adversary may take at least 4-5 years to reinstall”, Shah highlighted that this done in “just three days (May 7 to 10)”. He attributed this to information BSF had discreetly gathered through keen observation of Pakistani border posts during peacetime.“Pakistan has suffered the biggest blow to its communication systems and surveillance equipment.This proves that even during peacetime, you (BSF) kept a vigilant eye... Based on your accurate intelligence, a precise counter-strategy was prepared well in advance. When the opportunity arose, you implemented it with success,” Shah said amid cheers from the jawans.Lauding BSF personnel deployed in Jammu, Rajouri and Kutch for “guarding the border with utmost alertness, dedication and valour”, Shah said he was among them to convey the gratitude of the country’s 140 crore citizens. “When the enemy commits any type of aggression on the international border, BSF, being the first line of defence, is the first to take it on its chin,” Shah said.The home minister was accompanied by J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, Union home secretary Govind Mohan and other top officials. “In any situation -- be it snow-clad areas, desert, deep forests, swamps or mountains, for 365 days a year and 24 hours a day, BSF personnel remain in position, vigilant, and dedicated. No attack can cause much damage within the hinterland, as the first line of defence is always the chest of a BSF soldier,” Shah said.Shah also addressed a gathering in Poonch town after distributing appointment letters to family members of those killed in recent Pakistani shelling. At least 13 civilians, including three minors, died in Poonch alone. The govt will soon unveil a separate package for shelling-affected families, Shah said, adding 90,000 bunkers have been built along LoC and more will be set up to protect civilians.“I admire the courage of the people of Poonch and its administration for the way they responded to Pakistani shelling,” Shah said. The minister contrasted the Pakistani shelling on civilian areas in J&K, including religious sites, with India’s precise and targeted strikes on terror hubs in Pakistan when Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7.Referring to last month’s Pahalgam attack, Shah lauded the J&K people’s unity against terror. “India under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi has sent a clear message that any attack on civilians will not be tolerated and will be responded to more effectively and with accuracy. Terror and trade cannot go together. Blood and water cannot flow together. This is our policy and we will fight every terrorist activity on our soil,” Shah said.Chairing a security review meeting in Jammu late Thursday in the presence of LG Sinha, Shah reaffirmed enhanced security for the 38-day-long Amarnath Yatra. Union home secretary Mohan, Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, J&K chief secretary Atal Dulloo and J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat were among top officials who attended the meeting.“Evaluated security arrangements and preparedness meant for the pilgrims.

'Not A Single Project Completed On Time': Air Chief's Angry Outburst Over Defence Deals | Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday once again reiterated that dialogue with Pakistan will not resume until Islamabad takes concrete and effective action against terrorism. Regarding the Indus Waters Treaty , which was suspended following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, India said that the treaty will remain on hold until Pakistan ""irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.""""As far as our engagement with Pakistan is concerned, our stand has been clear. Any engagement has to be bilateral. We would like to reiterate that terrorism and talks cannot go together. They need to hand over to India, noted terrorists, whose records and list we submitted to them some years ago. Talks on J&K will be held only on the vacating of PoK and when Pakistan hands over the territory to us,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said at his weekly press briefing.""As far as the Indus Water Treaty is concerned, it will remain in abeyance till the time Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support to cross-border terrorism. Just like PM Narendra Modi says, terror and talks cannot go together, terror and trade cannot go together, and water and blood cannot flow together,"" Jaiswal added.The MEA's strong rebuke came a day after Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed Islamabad's readiness to engage in talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism.“There cannot be a bigger commitment and intention to beat this menace (terrorism) for all times to come, and in that, if India wants in all sincerity honest cooperation, Pakistan would be willing, along with the promotion of trade with India. All these issues need to be discussed on the table,” he said.“I think this is most unfortunate that India tried to threaten to stop our flow of water to Pakistan. This is not possible, was never possible, and will not be possible, God-willing. We are making proper arrangements to ensure that India never ever does it,” the Pakistani PM said.In the early hours of May 7, India had launched precision strikes on terrorist infrastructure in response to the Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists. The government had vowed harsh retribution, and over 100 terrorists were eliminated in 'Operation Sindoor'.Following the strikes, the Indian Armed Forces successfully repelled Pakistan’s retaliatory military aggression, targeting several of its airbases. Subsequently, both nations agreed to cease military actions and firing after the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) of Pakistan reached out to his Indian counterpart.In the immediate aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 until Pakistan verifiably renounces its support for cross-border terrorism.The Treaty had allocated the waters of the Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas rivers—around 33 million acre feet (MAF)—to India for exclusive use. Pakistan received the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab, averaging 135 MAF, except for certain limited uses allowed for India.India has also developed hydroelectric projects on Western rivers, within treaty limits. Major dams like Bhakra, Pong, Pandoh, and Thein, along with infrastructure such as the Beas-Sutlej and Madhopur-Beas links, enable full utilisation of Eastern river waters.","India reiterates that dialogue with pakistan will not resume until islamabad takes concrete and effective action against terrorism.

Poll What is more important for strengthening India's defence sector? Timely delivery of defence projects Focus on indigenous design and development

Ek baar jo humne commit kiya hain, fir mein apne aap ki bhi nahi sunta

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh on Thursday issued a strong call for accountability and urgency within India’s defence procurement and manufacturing ecosystem, citing constant delays in project timelines.Speaking at an event in Delhi, Air Chief expressed deep concern over the consistent failure of defence projects to meet delivery deadlines. ""Many times, we know while signing contracts that those systems will never come. Not a single project that I can think of has been completed on time,"" he said, questioning why unrealistic timelines are promised at the time of contract signing. ""Why should we promise something which cannot be achieved?"" he said.He highlighted the detrimental effects such practices have on capacity-building and the broader strategic posture of the armed forces. ""The process gets vitiated,” Singh noted, urging all stakeholders to reflect seriously on the credibility of their commitments.Air Chief called for a stronger partnership between the armed forces and Indian industry, stressing the need to move beyond manufacturing and focus on indigenous design and development in defence.“We must begin designing and developing defence systems in India, not just producing them,” he said. “Once we reach the stage of mass production, capacity naturally follows. But the foundation must be trust, between the forces and industry, to make this possible.”Quoting famous Salman Khan dialogue to underline the seriousness of commitment, he added: “.” (Once we’ve made a commitment, we don’t even listen to ourselves.)Singh also emphasised the enduring centrality of air power in military operations. “Whether it’s land or naval warfare, air power remains indispensable. Any kind of operation, as demonstrated in Operation Sindoor, is incomplete without it,” he said.In a rare moment of candour, the Air Chief also touched upon the culture of restraint within the defence forces, saying the services have often refrained from calling out underperformance explicitly. “Even defence forces have been keeping this restraint of not calling, you know, a black sheep, a black sheep,” he said, warning that such restraint cannot continue indefinitely.The Chief’s remarks come as India increasingly looks to the private sector to shoulder a greater role in defence production under the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative. Quoting Winston Churchill, Singh urged the private sector to seize this pivotal moment.“Each day comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered a chance to do something special,” he said. “What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared for that which could have been their finest hour.”In a passionate appeal, he challenged Indian industry leaders to rise above short-term profits and contribute meaningfully to the country’s defence preparedness. “If today somebody is manufacturing world-class cars, world-class electronics, world-class equipment in the civil domain, why can't that industry or some of the industry join together and say we will make world-class military equipment?” he said.“This is your tap on the shoulder. Please rise to the occasion,” he said.“We must now focus on becoming future-ready—that is the real concern,” Singh said. He noted that while the Indian industry and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) may deliver more over the next decade, the immediate needs of today cannot be postponed.Earlier, the Air Chief had said his confidence in defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) continues to erode over its failure to fix delays in delivery and upgrades to the light combat aircraft Tejas. ""You have to alleviate (our) worries and make us more confident. At the moment, I am just not confident of HAL, which is a very wrong thing to happen,"" Singh had said in February.""I can tell you (HAL) what our requirements and worries are,"" he was heard saying in a video, purportedly referring to the PSU.",Air chief marshal amar preet singh issues a strong call for accountability and urgency within india’s defence procurement and manufacturing ecosystem.

No country called Pakistan a terrorist state; this is the result of your failed foreign policy. Then you launched Operation Sindoor and no country gave a statement in your favour. Now, after Operation Sindoor, Kuwait has lifted visa restrictions on Pakistan. Iran, UAE, and Gulf countries are signing MoUs with Pakistan, and the most shocking thing is that yesterday, Russia signed an MoU with Pakistan to revive its very old steel mill, under which Pakistan will get $2.6 billion from Russia. .. This is the result of your failed foreign policy...""Meanwhile, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , part of an all-party delegation to Colombia, expressed disappointment over the Colombian government’s condolences for those killed in Pakistan after India’s May 7 counterstrike, saying, “There can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend.” He said India acted in self-defence following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.“We were only exercising our right of self-defence,” he added.Tharoor also highlighted Pakistan’s support for terrorists and showed images of uniformed Pakistani officials attending terrorist funerals. “That is the extent of complicity…,” he said, stressing India's resolve through Operation Sindoor targeting terror bases in Pakistan and PoK.The opposition’s criticism comes amid a series of political confrontations following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s public address in Gujarat, where he said Operation Sindoor was documented on camera to ensure ""no one at home asks for proof.""Also read: 'Iss baar camera ke samne kiya': PM Modi takes 'proof' jibe at opposition; Congress hits back PM Modi declared, ""Until now, what we used to call a proxy war, after the scenes witnessed post-May 6, we can no longer make the mistake of calling it a proxy war."" He added that the terrorists targeted in the strikes were given military honours in Pakistan, indicating direct state involvement.Responding to the Prime Minister's remarks, Congress questioned why top terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar were not neutralised.""To date, we have not received an answer to that – What happened to the terrorists of Poonch, Ganderbal, Gulmarg and Pahalgam?...

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday initiated criminal contempt proceedings against YouTube journalist Ajay Shukla for his contemptuous, scandalous and defamatory remarks casting aspersions on senior-most judge of SC, Justice Surya Kant, for the way a bench led by him dealt with Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for his ""crass comments"" on Col Sofiya Qureshi.A bench of Justices Kant and N Kotiswar Singh had rejected Shah's apology terming it a facade, and ordered an SIT to probe his comments, but stayed his arrest. The same bench had enforced a similar process against Ashoka University professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad for his ""objectionable"" comments on Op Sindoor.On Friday, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices A G Masih and A S Chandurkar took suo motu cognisance of a 150-second YouTube video in which Shukla, who claims to be editor-in-chief of a digital media organisation, was heard attributing motives while making unfounded defamatory allegations against Justice Kant, who is next in line to become the CJI. Terming Shukla's remarks ""scathingly scandalous"", the bench said, ""No doubt the Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of speech, but at the same time, this right is subject to reasonable restrictions specified under Article 19(2) of the Constitution.A person cannot be permitted to make allegations defamatory and contemptuous in nature which brings the highest institution in judiciary to disrepute.""SC directed its registry to lodge a suo motu criminal contempt case against Shukla and the YouTube channel. SC sought Shukla's response and posted further hearing in July.SC sought the assistance of attorney general R Venkataramani and solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who said Shukla's comments were defamatory and contemptuous. The bench directed the YouTube channel to take down the video and restrained social media platforms from exhibiting the clip.In SC's judgment punishing advocate Prashant Bhushan for contempt in 2020, a three-judge bench, of which Justice Gavai was a part, had said, ""If a scathing attack is made on judges, it would become difficult for them to work fearlessly and with the objectivity of approach to the issues. The judgment can be criticised. However, motives to the judges need not be attributed, as it brings administration of justice into disrepute.

We are determined that we're going to work to change that. Our strengths, from food and beverage products to agriculture, forestry, horticulture, education and tourism, are world-class. And our innovation in areas like outer space and renewable energy will find a welcome partner in India,"" said Peters, describing India as an emerging geopolitical giant.

'Time For Revival...': Russia's Big Unity Call To Rivals India & China | 'RIC Troika Will...'

With India having resolved its 2020 border standoff with China in Ladakh, Russia is pushing India to restart the Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral mechanism. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said an understanding had been reached between India and China on how to ease the situation on the border and it's time now for the revival of the RIC troika.""I would like to confirm our genuine interest in earliest resumption of the work within the format of troika - Russia, India, China - which was established many years ago on the initiative of Yevgeny Primakov (former Russian PM), and which has organised meetings over 20 times at the ministerial level since then, not only at level of foreign policy chiefs, but also heads of other economic, trade and financial agencies of three countries,"" said Lavrov, speaking at a conference, as per Russia's TASS agency.Lavrov is likely to take up the issue with Indian authorities during his upcoming visit to India. As TOI had reported on May 26, the Russian minister is likely to travel to India in June to finalise the agenda for the upcoming India-Russia summit that will see President Vladimir Putin visiting India for the first time since the Russia-Ukraine war started in Feb 2022.The Russian agency also quoted Lavrov as saying that Nato is blatantly trying to lure India into anti-China intrigues.""I have no doubts whatsoever that our Indian friends, and I say this based on confidential conversations with them, obviously see this trend that can be actually deemed as a large provocation,"" Lavrov said.India last hosted a meeting of RIC foreign ministers in a virtual mode in Nov 2021. The minister had then pledged to strengthen cooperation under the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) saying the group played a constructive role in securing peace and sustainable development, advancing regional cooperation and consolidating ties of good-neighbourliness and mutual trust.

'Supporting one simple idea called India': Salman Khurshid's message amid Centre vs opposition over all-party outreach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supporting-one-simple-idea-called-india-salman-khurshids-message-amid-centre-vs-opposition-over-all-party-outreach/articleshow/121525421.cms,"Salman Khurshid

NEW DELHI: Former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid on Friday showed his displeasure over opposition's remarks on MPs supporting the Centre with his statements on Operation Sindoor While interacting with the Indian community in Indonesia's Jakarta, Khurshid said that all-party MP delegations are not supporting each other's parties but a ""simple idea called India. """"India is waiting to be great. Nobody can distract us or interfere with that passage of ours. That is why it is important for us to show our strength. If there is any sense in Pakistan, they will understand our only demand: give up terrorism,"" the Congress leader said.""Some of my colleagues are not from the ruling party. The ruling party could have come alone to bring this message, but they came with us to give India's message... However, sadly, this is not what we hear from India. Somebody is saying that he is supporting the BJP or the Congress, but I am proud that we are here together because we are not supporting , we are supporting one simple idea called India,"" he added.This comes after Shahshi Tharoor and Khurshid found themselves in crosshairs with Congress for their remarks during the trip.Earlier in the day, Khurshid, who is in one of the 7 all-party delegations to expose Pakistan post Pahalgam terror attack, said that prosperity and normalcy have returned to Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 ""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave an impression that it was separate from the rest of the country. But Article 370 was abrogated and it was finally put to an end,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think Tanks and Academia""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation.There's an elected government in Kashmir today and therefore for people to want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir,"" he added.Earlier, Tharoor, currently leading a multi-party delegation to countries including Panama and the US, had said that India conducted its first cross-border surgical strike in 2016, a claim seen by many in the party as undermining similar operations during the UPA era.Facing flak from Congress leaders such as Pawan Khera and Udit Raj, Tharoor defended himself in a strongly worded post on X from Panama City, clarifying that his remarks specifically referred to responses to terrorist attacks—not to prior wars or conflicts.""After a long and successful day in Panama, I have to wind up at midnight here with departure for Bogota, Colombia in six hours, so I don’t really have time for this — but anyway: For those zealots fulminating about my supposed ignorance of Indian valour across the LoC: in the past,"" Tharoor said in a post on X.""I was clearly and explicitly speaking only about reprisals for terrorist attacks and not about previous wars and my remarks were preceded by a reference to the several attacks that have taken place in recent years alone, during which previous Indian responses were both restrained and constrained by our responsible respect for the LoC and the IB,"" he added.The controversy erupted after Tharoor reportedly stated in Panama that India breached the LoC ""for the first time"" during the 2016 surgical strike. This prompted a sharp response from his party colleague Udit Raj, who accused Tharoor of denigrating Congress's legacy. ""How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed LoC and International border?"" Raj questioned.He went so far as to suggest Tharoor be made a ""super spokesperson of the BJP.""Pawan Khera also weighed in, posting a screenshot from Tharoor’s book, where the MP had previously criticised the Modi government for politicising the 2016 strikes while acknowledging that the Congress had authorised several such operations in the past without publicising them.","Khurshid said that all-party mp delegations are not supporting each other's parties but a ""simple idea called india"" this comes after shahshi tharoor found himself in crosshairs with congress for his remarks during the trip.
