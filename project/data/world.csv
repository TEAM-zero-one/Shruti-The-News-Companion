NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday refused to comment on Rahul Gandhi ’s endorsement of US President Donald Trump ’s remark calling the Indian economy ""dead."" Tharoor said the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha may have had his ""own reasons"" for saying so, but stressed that maintaining economic ties with the US is vital for India.When asked about Rahul Gandhi's statement, Tharoor said, ""I don't want to comment on what my party leader has said. He has his reasons for saying so. My concern is that our relationship with the US, as a strategic partnership and economic relationship, is important for us. We are exporting around 90 billion worth of goods to America. We can't be in a position to lose that or have it diminish significantly.""He added, ""We must wish our negotiators strength to get a fair deal for India. We should also be talking to other regions for exporting our goods. Then we could make up for some of what we might lose in the US. We have to support our negotiators.""Tharoor’s response came after Rahul Gandhi, on Thursday, agreed with Trump’s description of the Indian economy. Gandhi had said, ""Yes, he is right. Everybody knows this except the prime minister and the finance minister. Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact. The entire world knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. BJP has finished the economy to help Adani. ""Trump had made the comment on Wednesday through his social media platform, Truth Social. In that post, he announced a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods and warned of additional penalties in response to India importing oil from Russia.","Congress mp shashi tharoor refused to comment on rahul gandhi’s endorsement of us president donald trump ’s remark calling the indian economy ""dead"" gandhi had said, ""yes, he is right.

US Tariffs on India : What did Trump announce?

What India Has Said About the 25% tariff

How will the 25% tariffs hit India?

India’s Exports Uncompetitive?

But is the 25% tariff rate all bad?

25% Trump Tariffs temporary in nature?

US President Donald Trump has hit India with a 25% tariff rate ahead of his August 1 reciprocal tariff deadline. India and the US are working on a trade deal but no interim agreement has been finalised. With this India has become the latest addition to the list of countries subjected to higher tariffs under Trump's ""Liberation Day"" trade strategy, which seeks to restructure American trade partnerships through enhanced reciprocal arrangements.The revised US tariffs will affect India's export of goods to America, projected at approximately $87 billion in 2024. This includes labour-intensive sectors including apparel, medicines, gems and jeweler, and petrochemical products.The trade imbalance between the United States and India is at $45.7 billion, favouring India.Vijay Chauhan, Executive Director, Deloitte India said, “Indian negotiators have done well to remain steadfast in securing national interest. We are watching the situation as the US negotiators are scheduled to visit New Delhi on 25th August.""Taking to social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD! INDIA WILL THEREFORE BE PAYING A TARIFF OF 25%, PLUS A PENALTY FOR THE ABOVE, STARTING ON AUGUST FIRST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. MAGA!The additional penalty for trade with Russia remains unclear for now.Also Read | Donald Trump imposes 25% tariffs on India! How does India compare to other economies like China, Japan, Vietnam on the rate list? Check details In a statement, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said, ""The Government has taken note of a statement by the US President on bilateral trade. The Government is studying its implications.""""India and the US have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months. We remain committed to that objective. The Government attaches the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of our farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs. The Government will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest, as has been the case with other trade agreements including the latest Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the UK,"" India has said.Agneshwar Sen, Trade Policy Leader, EY India says, “The decision to raise the US tariff to 25% on Indian exports is an unfortunate development, particularly given the strong strategic partnership that has been steadily built between India and the USA in recent years.If this tariff is sustained, this move may directly affect key sectors such as marine products, pharmaceuticals, textiles, leather, and automobiles, where bilateral trade has been especially robust. However, it’s important to note that both countries remain positively engaged in active negotiations with the US team expected in India later in August to finalize a comprehensive trade agreement,” he said.“I am confident that, considering our shared interests and history of cooperation, the two sides will be able to address these contentious issues constructively and arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement in the very near term,” he added.Garima Kapoor, Economist and Executive Vice President at Elara Capital sees the 25% tariff as a negative development, and one that may shave off 20 basis points from India’s GDP growth if the tariff rate stays at that level.“The exact details of the tariffs on the exempted items such as pharma and the ones that were charged at a differential rate such as iron, steel and auto is unknown as of now, but inclusion of pharma into tariffs should be incremental negative for India’s exports as US accounts for more than 30% of India’s pharma exports. If no deal is signed by Sept-October, we see a downside to the full year GDP growth estimate for India by 20 basis points,” she said.Also Read | India-US trade deal: Donald Trump announces 25% tariff on India, plus penalty for buying energy and arms from Russia Following the US tariff announcement in April, ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar had initially revised India's GDP growth projection to 6.2 per cent for FY26, considering sluggish export growth and delayed private capital expenditure.""The tariff (and penalty) now proposed by the US is higher than what we had anticipated, and is therefore likely to pose a headwind to India's GDP growth. The extent of the downside will depend on the size of the penalties imposed,"" Nayar added.Agricultural economist Ashok Gulati is of the view that the tariff will significantly affect India's seafood exports, particularly shrimps.The decision by US President Donald Trump to levy higher tariffs on Indian products is ""very bad"" and ""shocking"", noted Gulati, who had anticipated a more modest increase of 10-15 per cent.""This clearly shows Trump is unpredictable and punitive,"" he told PTI.The economist indicated that this development will substantially affect India's shrimp trade, whilst Ecuador stands to benefit due to its reduced tariffs and closer proximity to the United States.The impact of increased US tariffs will extend beyond shrimps to affect India's textile sector as well.Gulati further added that the benefits acquired through the India-UK free trade agreement would be offset by these elevated US tariffs.Earlier this month, an SBI Research report said that even if India is unable to secure a trade deal as per its desire, the impact is likely to be limited. “With India’s service exports reaching a new high each year, a record $387.5 bn in 2024-25 driven by sectors like IT, financial and business services, our total exports are not likely to get significantly impacted,” the report said.The most worrying bit about the 25% tariff is not the figure itself, but the fact that India’s Asian peers have managed to secure deals with the Trump administration that have lower duties. Japan will pay 15%, Vietnam will pay 20% and Indonesia has a tariff of 19%. This will hit India’s competitive advantage for US exports.India is actually looking to secure a trade deal that will give it preferential access to US markets compared to peers.Talking about the India-US trade deal negotiations Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal recently said, “...what is important is to get preferential market access over our competitors, our peers.”Garima Kapoor of Elara Capital says, “The 25% tariff rate is certainly a negative development as it compares to lower rates for peers such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines which compete with India in a similar category of labour-intensive products and electronic goods.”Ajay Srivastava from Global Trade Research Initiative explains, “Some sectors like our top exports to the US are pharmaceuticals, medicines, so Europe will be paying 15%, but European medicines are expensive, high-end proprietary medicines. We are into generics. So if we are paying 25%, I don't think much of the generic market exports to India, exports to the US from India will be impacted.”Regarding smartphone exports, particularly iPhones, he noted that with only China and India being major exporters to the US market, the 5% duty differential (China at 30% and India at 25%) would not significantly affect trade patterns.Garima Kapoor believes a hasty deal would have not helped. “On the positive side, it is pertinent to note that any hotchpotch deal which would have compelled India to give concessions to its agriculture and dairy sector may have had much deeper ramifications politically, socially, and eventually on livelihoods,” she says.“A well negotiated deal that addresses all aspects of trade, investment and tariff and non- tariff barriers by September October 2025 is likely to yield long term benefits than a hurried deal. The India-UK deal template which gave concessions to auto and opened public procurement sector has shown that India is willing to shed its protectionist tag in sectors where it doesn’t impact the marginal producer, which is a huge departure from its earlier stance,” she adds.As trade deal talks appeared to have hit a stalemate with the next round expected in August-end, it appears that India was already bracing for 20-25% tariffs from the Trump administration.""Talks are progressing well,"" a government official had been quoted as saying by Reuters, adding Trump could issue a tariff order in a ""worst-case scenario"".""But, we assume it would be a temporary measure, considering the five rounds of trade talks that have taken place. A deal will soon be worked out,” the official had said.As US officials visit India for the sixth round of talks in August-end, there are hopes that a trade deal will be finalised in the coming months.","India has become the latest addition to the list of countries subjected to higher tariffs under trump's ""liberation day"" trade strategy. The revised us tariffs will affect india's export of goods to america, projected at approximately $87 billion in 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123001443,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76396,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'India Will...': PM Modi's BIG Message Amid U.S. Tariffs & Trump's 'Dead Economy' Jibe

Swadeshi

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday made a strong appeal for reviving the spirit of, urging Indians to prioritise locally-made products and stand united in the face of growing global economic uncertainty.Speaking at a public meeting in his Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency, PM Modi warned that the world economy is entering a phase of instability and unpredictability.His remarks followed a controversial decision by US President Donald Trump to impose 25 per cent tariffs on exports from nearly 70 countries, including India, echoing his inward-looking and hostile trade stance to impress his MAGA votebank.Also read: India continuing to buy oil from Russia, report rebuts Donald Trump's 'good steps' claim - decision guided by national interest and global energy stability Trump's order is expected to deal a blow, even if not fatal, to Indian exporters, making goods costlier in American markets and threatening key sectors like engineering, textiles, and pharmaceuticals.Without naming the US directly, Modi cautioned that India must stay focused on its own economic interests as it moves toward becoming the world's third-largest economy.""As we talk about economic progress, I want to draw your attention to the current global scenario. The world economy is facing instability and uncertainty. In such times, countries are focusing solely on their own interests. India, too, is on the path to becoming the world's third-largest economy and must remain alert to its own economic priorities,"" PM Modi said.Calling for a nationwide movement to support indigenous industry, the Prime Minister said the time had come for every Indian, across political lines, to rise above partisanship and back the local economy.""This is not just about Modi saying it, every Indian should say this, if we want India to become the third-largest economy, every political party and every leader, keeping aside their hesitations, must work in the nation's interest and awaken the spirit ofamong the people,"" he said.Also read: Trade war, tariffs notified, government hardens its position on no-go areas PM Modi also said that the government is doing its part to support farmers, small industries, and youth employment, but stressed that national transformation cannot happen without citizen participation.""The government is doing everything possible in this direction. But as citizens, we too have responsibilities,"" he added.Making a direct appeal to shopkeepers and traders, PM Modi urged them to take a pledge to sell only Indian-made goods, especially with the festive and wedding seasons around the corner.""At a time when the world is going through uncertainty, let us take a pledge to sell only Swadeshi goods from our shops and markets. Promoting made in India goods will be the truest service to the country,"" he said.PM Modi futher urged people to be conscious consumers, asking them to reflect on the origins of every purchase.""Whatever we buy, we should ask ourselves, has an Indian toiled to make this? If it has been made by the sweat of our people, with their skills, that product is Swadeshi for us. We must adopt the mantra of 'Vocal for Local',"" the PM said.Recalling earlier instances when families shifted wedding plans from abroad to India following his appeal, PM Modi said Swadeshi is not just an economic choice but a cultural and national statement.""The feeling of Swadeshi in every action will define our future. This will also be a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. Only through collective effort can we fulfil the dream of a developed India,"" PM Modi said.","Pm modi urges indians to prioritise locally-made products and stand united in the face of growing global economic uncertainty.

Trade standoff continues



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday sent a clear message to the United States amid an escalating trade standoff, saying the welfare of farmers, small industries and youth remains the government’s “top priority. ”“India is set to become the world’s third largest economy... therefore, India must remain vigilant about its economic interests. Our farmers, our small industries, employment for our youth... their welfare is our top priority. The government is making every effort in this direction,” PM Modi said in Varanasi.""I earnestly request my brothers and sisters in the business community today that, when the world is going through such an atmosphere of instability, we too should sell only indigenous goods. This resolve will also be a true service to the nation. Every moment, we will now buy only indigenous goods. This will be a great tribute to Mahatma Gandhi,"" he added.The remark came as US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods, alongside a warning of further penalties over India’s continued purchases of Russian oil and military equipment.On his first visit to Varanasi following the deadly Pahalgam terrorist attack in April, PM Modi also sent a message to Pakistan, declaring that those who attack India “will not survive even in hell”.Also read: PM Modi flags off Rs 2,200 crore projects in Varanasi; releases 20th instalment of PM-Kisan scheme PM Modi said the success of Operation Sindoor had not only avenged the victims but also showcased India’s “fierce form” to the world. He dedicated the operation to “Mahadev” and the sindoor of the daughters who were killed in Pahalgam, linking the retaliation to divine justice and national pride. “I fulfilled it with the blessings of Mahadev,” he said, referring to his vow of revenge.“This is the first time I have come to Kashi after Operation Sindoor... I had pledged to take revenge for my daughters' sindoor, and I fulfilled it with the blessings of Mahadev,” Modi said. “Operation Sindoor showed the world India’s fierce form. Whoever attacks India won't survive even in hell.”He accused Congress and the Samajwadi Party of “crying along with Pakistan” and undermining the armed forces. “Congress has called Operation Sindoor a 'tamasha'... Should I call and ask them before taking any action?” he said.Calling for an economic resolve to match military strength, Modi urged Indians to reject foreign goods. “I earnestly request my brothers and sisters in the business community... we too should sell only indigenous goods. Every moment, we will now buy only indigenous goods. This will be a great tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.”PM Modi also inaugurated and laid the foundation stone for 52 development projects worth over Rs 2,180 crore, transferred Rs 20,500 crore to farmers under PM-Kisan, and launched initiatives in healthcare, education, tourism, infrastructure and rural development.Trump’s remarks came a day after the White House confirmed sweeping new trade measures affecting 70 countries, including India. “India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25 per cent, plus a penalty for the above,” Trump said, criticising India’s high tariffs and its “vast” military and energy ties with Russia.“I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” he added in a post on Truth Social.In response, ministry of external affairs (MEA) defended its position, stressing that the country’s energy policy is driven by national interest. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We take decisions based on the price at which oil is available in the international market and depending on the global situation at that time.”","Pm modi says welfare of farmers, small industries and youth remains government's 'top priority' pm modi: 'whoever attacks india won’t survive even in hell' us president donald trump announced 25% tariff on indian goods, warning of further penalties over india’s continued purchases of russian oil and military equipment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123058367,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-938591,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: As part of the Navy’s ongoing operational deployment to Southeast Asia with an eye firmly on China’s aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific, three Indian warships have now reached the Philippines while another is exercising with the Singapore Navy.The deployments of stealth frigate INS Satpura for the bilateral “Simbex” exercise with the Singapore Navy as well as guided-missile destroyer INS Delhi, anti-submarine warfare corvette INS Kiltan and fleet tanker INS Shakti to Manila “is a testimony to the Indian Navy’s commitment to strengthen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific”, officers said.Leading the three warships in Manila, Eastern Fleet commander Rear Admiral Susheel Menon said India and the Philippines shared the commitment towards maintaining stability and enhancing maritime security in the region, emphasizing the importance of such deployments in promoting understanding, trust and cooperation among friendly maritime forces.The warships will undertake a bilateral naval exercise with the Philippines, which will focus on joint manoeuvres and communication protocols to improve preparedness, build mutual trust and strengthen operational synergy in the maritime domain.INS Satpura, in turn, is participating in the 32nd edition of the Simbex exercise, marking yet another chapter in the strong and enduring maritime partnership between the Indian Navy and the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN).“The exercise involves execution of a comprehensive array of advanced naval operations. These include air defence exercises, sross-deck helicopter operations, precision targeting with surface and aerial platforms, complex maneuvering drills and VBSS (visit, board, search, and seizure) operations,” an officer said.After the $375 million contract to supply three anti-ship coastal batteries of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to the Philippines in Jan 2022, India has also stepped-up discussions on arms exports to other Asean countries like Indonesia and Vietnam.Apart from the Brahmos missiles, which have been developed jointly with Russia, India also plans to sell the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a range of 25-km, to countries like Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.","Three indian warships have now reached the philippines while another is exercising with the singapore navy.

Rahul Gandhi's EXPLOSIVE ‘Rigging’ Allegation Against ECI Ahead Of Bihar Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday criticised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his comments on late union minister and senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley , calling them “irresponsible” and stating such remarks ultimately damage the Congress.Sitharaman responded to Gandhi's comments made earlier in the day where he had claimed that former finance minister Jaitley “threatened” him on behalf of the government when he was fighting against the farm laws.In a post on X, Sitharaman said, ""If irresponsibility has a face, it is Rahul Gandhi, Leader of Opposition in LS. To throw baseless allegations at people in public life, even those who are no longer with us, is becoming a personality trait for him. His remarks on the late Shri. Arun Jaitley is despicable. India needs a strong opposition party. An irresponsible leadership hurts his party @INCIndia and the country. But does he care?""Speaking at the Congress-organised Annual Legal Conclave 2025, the leader of opposition alleged in his address that the NDA government had deployed the late minister to ""threaten"" him for opposing the farm laws introduced by the Modi government in 2020.""I remember when I was fighting the farm laws, Arun Jaitley was sent to me to threaten me. He told me, 'If you carry on opposing the government, fighting the farm laws, we will have to act against you. ' I looked at him and said 'I don't think you have an idea who you are talking to,'"" Rahul Gandhi said.Earlier Gandhi’s claim drew a sharp rebuke from Jatley’s son Rohan Jaitely, who accused the Congress MP of misrepresenting the facts and politicising the memory of the late leader.He called his claims factually incorrect and in bad taste.“Rahul Gandhi now claims my late father, Arun Jaitley, threatened him over the farm laws. Let me remind him, my father passed away in 2019. The farm laws were introduced in 2020,” Rohan Jaitley said in a post on X.The Congress leader also criticised the election commission of India, accusing it of being complicit in widespread voter fraud.","Sitharaman responded to gandhi's comments made earlier in the day where he had claimed that former finance minister jaitley “threatened” him when he was fighting against the farm laws.

'Mai Raja Nahi Hoon': Rahul Gandhi Responds To Congress Workers' Slogans At Legal Conclave

Nahi... Nahi... Main raja nahi hoon. Raja banna bhi nahi chahta hoon. Main raja ke concept ke against hoon

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was greeted with an unexpected chant at the party’s high-profile Legal Conclave in New Delhi on Saturday: “.” But the Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha was quick to shut it down.As Rahul took the stage to speak at the event titled “Constitutional Challenges: Perspectives and Pathways”, party workers broke into chants of “” (“What kind of king should the country have? One like Rahul Gandhi!”).In response, Rahul said, “.” (“No, no… I am not a king. I do not want to become a king. I am against the concept of kingship.”)The Congress leader used the platform to launch a scathing attack on the Election Commission of India (ECI), alleging that the 2024 Lok Sabha elections were “rigged” and that India’s electoral system is “already dead”.""The truth is that the election system in India is already dead. The Prime Minister of India holds office with a very slim majority. If 15 seats were rigged—and we suspect that the number is over 70 to 80—he would not have been the Prime Minister of India,"" Rahul claimed.He also alleged that the Congress had undertaken a six-month investigation which revealed large-scale electoral fraud. Citing one Assembly seat in Karnataka, the congress leader claimed that out of 6.5 lakh voters, 1.5 lakh were “fake”. “You will see the shockwave that is going to go through the electoral system when we release this data. It is literally like an atom bomb,” he said.Rahul further alleged that the ECI has been ""obliterated and taken over"". “We have such proof that will show the whole country that the institution of the Election Commission does not exist. It has disappeared,” he said.Reiterating that he had suspected electoral wrongdoing since 2014, the LoP recalled the BJP’s sweeping wins in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, where Congress failed to win even a single seat. He cited the case of Maharashtra, where he said one crore new voters appeared in the run-up to the Assembly elections—most of whom backed the BJP.He concluded by asserting, “I say with absolutely no doubt that we have proof. And whoever I have shown it to has fallen off the chair. They literally said how can it be possible. But it is possible. It’s happening. Literally.”The conclave was hosted by the AICC’s Department of Law, Human Rights and RTI.",Rahul gandhi was greeted with an unexpected chant at the party’s high-profile legal conclave in new delhi on saturday: “.” (“what kind of king should the country have?

'Farm laws introduced in 2020': Arun Jaitley's son reacts to Rahul Gandhi's accusations of his father,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farm-laws-introduced-in-2020-arun-jaitleys-son-reacts-to-rahul-gandhis-accusations-of-his-father/articleshow/123059377.cms,"'Mai Raja Nahi Hoon': Rahul Gandhi Responds To Congress Workers' Slogans At Legal Conclave

NEW DELHI: Arun Jaitley’s son, Rohan Jaitley, on Saturday rebutted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s claim that the late Finance Minister had been sent to “threaten” him for opposing the Modi government’s now-repealed farm laws.Speaking at the Congress-organised Annual Legal Conclave 2025, Gandhi recalled a tense exchange, saying, “I remember when I was fighting against the farm laws, Arun Jaitley was sent to threaten me. He said, ‘If you continue down this path, opposing the government and fighting us on the farm laws, we’ll have to take action against you.’ I replied, ‘I think you don’t know who you’re talking to. We’re Congress people, we’re not cowards. We never bend. The British couldn’t bend us.’”Gandhi’s remark quickly drew a sharp rebuttal from Jaitley’s son, Rohan Jaitley, who accused the Congress MP of misrepresenting facts and politicising the memory of the deceased. “Rahul Gandhi now claims my late father, Arun Jaitley, threatened him over the farm laws. Let me remind him, my father passed away in 2019. The farm laws were introduced in 2020,” Rohan Jaitley said in a statement.Calling the claim factually incorrect and in poor taste, Rohan further added, “More importantly, it was not in my father’s nature to threaten anyone over an opposing view. He was a staunch democrat and always believed in building consensus.” He described his father’s approach to politics as one that welcomed open discussion rather than confrontation. “If at all such a situation was to occur, as it often does in politics, he would invite free and open discussions to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution to all. That was simply who he was and that remains his legacy today.”Rohan Jaitley also urged Gandhi to exercise caution while speaking about deceased public figures. “I would appreciate Rahul Gandhi being mindful while speaking of those not with us,” he said, recalling a previous instance where Gandhi had allegedly politicised the final days of former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. “He attempted something similar with Manohar Parrikar ji, politicising his final days, which was in equally poor taste. Let the departed rest in peace,” he added.Gandhi’s broader speech at the conclave included allegations of voter fraud in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, criticism of the Election Commission of India, and remarks about constitutional decline under the current government.",Rohan jaitley rebuts rahul gandhi's claim that his late father was sent to threaten him for opposing the modi government’s now-repealed farm laws. He accuses gandhi of misrepresenting facts and politicising the memory of the deceased.

NEW DELHI: As part of the Navy's ongoing operational deployment to Southeast Asia with an eye firmly on China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific, three Indian warships have reached the Philippines while another is exercising with the Singapore Navy.The deployments of stealth frigate INS Satpura for the bilateral ""Simbex"" exercise with the Singapore Navy as well as guided-missile destroyer INS Delhi, anti-submarine warfare corvette INS Kiltan and fleet tanker INS Shakti to Manila ""is a testimony to the Indian Navy's commitment to strengthen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific"", according to officers.Leading the three warships in Manila, Eastern Fleet commander Rear Admiral Susheel Menon said India and the Philippines shared the commitment towards maintaining stability and enhancing maritime security in the region, emphasizing the importance of such deployments in promoting understanding, trust and cooperation among friendly maritime forces.The warships will undertake a bilateral naval exercise with the Philippines, which will focus on joint manoeuvres and communication protocols to improve preparedness, build mutual trust and strengthen operational synergy in the maritime domain.INS Satpura, in turn, is participating in the 32nd edition of the Simbex exercise, marking yet another chapter in the strong and enduring maritime partnership between the Indian Navy and the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN).""The exercise involves execution of a comprehensive array of advanced naval operations. These include air defence exercises, cross-deck helicopter operations, precision targeting with surface and aerial platforms, complex manoeuvring drills and VBSS (visit, board, search, and seizure) operations,"" an officer said.After the $375 million contract to supply three anti-ship coastal batteries of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to the Philippines in Jan 2022, India has also stepped up discussions on arms exports to other Asean countries like Indonesia and Vietnam. Apart from Brahmos missiles, which have been developed jointly with Russia, India also plans to sell the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a range of 25 km, to countries like Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.","Three indian warships have reached the philippines while another is exercising with the singapore navy.

Operation Akhal: Indian Forces Gun Down Terrorist In Kulgam Amid Rising Infiltration Attempts

NEW DELHI: The 'Janaza-Ghaib (funeral in absentia)' of Tahir Habib, one of the Pahalgam terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev in J&K, has been performed in his village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir - a second confirmation that Pakistan was involved in the April 22 incident in which 26 civilians were killed.Videos and pictures posted on Telegram channels show the elderly of Khai Gala in Rawalkote gathering for the final prayers for the former Pakistan Army soldier and Lashkar-e-Taiba operative. But the funeral took an unexpected turn when local LeT commander Rizwan Hanif tried to be part of it. Tahir's family explicitly barred LeT members from attending the funeral but Hanif insisted, leading to a confrontation.Tahir's association with LeT and his role in the Pahalgam attack had made him a wanted category 'A' terrorist. His killing during Operation Mahadev in Srinagar last week along with two others was a major breakthrough for Indian security forces.During the funeral, a source said, ""Lashkar operatives threatened mourners with a gun, sparking outrage among villagers. The residents of Khai Gala, who have long been wary of radicalisation, are now planning a public boycott to oppose terror recruitment.""This development is significant as it not only highlights the growing resistance among POK residents against Pakistan's state-sponsored terror machine but also confirms that the impact of Operation Sindoor - conducted as a response to the Pahalgam attack - is being felt across the border.""A Lashkar commander facing public backlash and being forced to flee is a testament to the changing dynamics in the region,"" the source added.Tahir's past includes his association with the Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT) and the Student Liberation Front (SLF) before joining the Pakistan army. The Sadozai Pathan community, to which Tahir belonged, has a rich history of resistance, having migrated from Afghanistan in the 18th century and playing a key role in the Poonch Rebellion. This also led to Tahir getting the alias of 'Afghani' with which he was known in intelligence records.","Tahir habib, one of the pahalgam terrorists killed in operation mahadev in j&k, has been performed in his village in pakistan-occupied kashmir.

He said Dhankhar opted to resign.Speaking at Congress's annual legal conclave, Kharge recounted the ""harassment"" of the opposition at the hands of Dhankhar. He mentioned that Dhankhar had suspended a record number of MPs from Rajya Sabha, while Congress MP Rajni Patil was suspended for seven months, lamenting ""this is their democracy"".But then, he said, Dhankhar one day woke up to his constitutional role because he realised that his tenure would be remembered in history if he worked as per rules, rubbing the PM and BJP the wrong way.The Congress brass, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, attended the conclave themed ""Constitutional Challenges: Perspectives & Pathways"". A message from Congress parliamentary party chairperson Sonia Gandhi was read out by senior leader Salman Khurshid.""Today, the Constitution is under siege. BJP-RSS, which never fought for freedom or upheld equality, now uses its power to dismantle the very framework it long opposed,"" Sonia Gandhi said. ""Now, they seek to erase socialism and secularism, pillars of Ambedkar's vision of equal citizenship. This is not reform but an ideological coup replacing our democratic republic with a theocratic corporate state serving the powerful few,"" she added. ""We will oppose every attempt to undermine the Constitution, in Parliament, in courts, and on the streets. Our mission is clear - to reclaim the republic and protect the rights of each and every person,"" Sonia Gandhi said.Kharge alleged that when Dhankhar started asserting that he was independent and allowed a notice for the opposition's motion to remove Varma, he was ""threatened and pressured"" by the govt.This is the first time that the Congress brass linked Dhankhar's resignation, which it called sacking, to govt pressure on constitutional offices. Earlier, whenever Kharge was asked about the reason for Dhankhar's resignation he would respond saying he had no information and it was for Dhankhar to tell what happened since it was a matter between him and Prime Minister Modi.","Congress president mallikarjun kharge claims former vice-president jagdeep dhankhar was forced out by the modi govt.
