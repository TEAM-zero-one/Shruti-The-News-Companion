Social media response:

Yet you fired a ton of people who took care of that land and want to destroy it for oil.

Sounds like another grift as you kill tourism -- great f****g work!





Are you guys really that stupid to think that tourists will opt to go? You’re going to leave the NPS with a funding shortfall. More stupidity like firing the majority of park workers





So Americans get discounted access, foreigners pay more, and everything’s going digital.

BTW stop tracking us, we don't appreciate it. When you show your American The Beautiful Pass at the gate - they scan BOTH your pass AND your ID. That is a violation of our civil rights.





America really said “tourists pay, patriots play free” and called it progress





A row erupted after the US Department of the Interior announced sweeping changes to national park access, including higher fees for nonresidents and expanded digital passes. Starting January 1, 2026, US residents will pay $80 for an Annual Pass, while nonresidents will be charged $250.Nonresidents without a pass will also face a $100 per person fee to enter 11 of the most visited parks.“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”""The Department of @Interior is making it easier for AMERICANS to enjoy our National Parks: U.S. residents enjoy affordable pricing, while foreigners pay a high rate,"" the White House said in a post on X.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, ""patriotic fee-free"" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before, reported BBC .The Department has also announced a set of resident-only patriotic fee-free days for 2026. These include President’s Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and President Trump’s birthday, the Independence Day weekend, the 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday and Veteran’s Day.Revenue from the revised fee structure will be invested directly back into the national parks, supporting upgrades to visitor facilities, essential maintenance work and improved services across the system. Critics have urged the Department to take a closer look at how the higher nonresident rates affect H-1B and F-1 visa holders. The new charges could disproportionately burden international visitors.","Starting january 1, 2026, us residents will pay $80 for an annual pass, while nonresidents will be charged $250.

BJP slams Mahmood Madani

NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind president Maulana Mahmood Madani on Saturday said the term “jihad” is being deliberately misused to malign the Muslim community, stressing that it actually means a “struggle against oppression. ”He alleged that “enemies of Islam” are responsible for distorting the term.“Enemies of Islam and Muslims have turned the word ‘jihad’ into a synonym for abuse, conflict and violence. Phrases like ‘love jihad,’ ‘land jihad,’ ‘taleem (education) jihad’ and ‘thook (spit) jihad’ are used to insult the faith of Muslims. Sadly, even responsible people in the government and the media use such terms without shame,” he remarked.“In Islam, ‘jihad’ appears in the Quran in several contexts — as a call to one’s duties, to the welfare of society and humanity, and, when referring to war, as a struggle to end oppression and violence.(whenever there is oppression, there will be jihad),” the cleric added.Madani further alleged that the minorities' constitutional rights are being “undermined” and they are being “targeted.”Citing the Babri Masjid verdict and the criminalisation of triple talaq, he argued that the Supreme Court can be considered “supreme” only when it upholds the Constitution and the law.“After the judgments on Babri Masjid, triple talaq and several other matters, it appears that courts have been functioning under government pressure for the past few years… We have earlier instances too that raise questions about the courts’ character. The Supreme Court deserves to be called ‘Supreme’ only when it follows the Constitution and upholds the law. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t merit that title,” Madani remarked.The Jamiat chief also flagged bulldozer actions, mob lynching, and the takeover of Waqf properties, arguing that these developments have left Muslims feeling “unsafe.”Mentioining on the national song Vande Mataram, Madani contended that communities that surrender under pressure are “murda qaum (lifeless people),” while those that stay firm and confront challenges are “zinda qaum (living people).”“‘Murda qaum’ do not engage with difficulties — they surrender. They will be asked to recite Vande Mataram and they will comply immediately. That is the sign of a ‘murda qaum’. A ‘zinda qaum,’ however, must lift its morale and face situations head-on,” he observed.Hitting out at Madani, the BJP accused him of attempting to ""vitiate"" communal harmony.“He is a completely political person. I heard his speech. He was describing ‘jihad’ in an Islamic context… but he contradicted himself and said, ‘agar hum pe zulm hoga, toh jihad hoga’ (there will be jihad if we are oppressed). Who is he threatening — the Government of India?” Delhi BJP spokesperson Yaser Jilani told news agency ANI.Jilani warned Madani against issuing “threats.”“Don’t threaten like this. The Government of India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi think for everyone. Mahmood Madani is trying to vitiate harmony,” he stated.","Jamaat ulama-i-hind president maulana mahmood madani said the term ‘jihad’ is being deliberately misused to malign the muslim community.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on his wedding. He shared a post from his official handle, which quoted the post by Albanese sharing his wedding video.""Congratulations to my good friend, PM Anthony Albanese and Ms Jodie Haydon on their wedding. Wishing them a happy married life,"" the Prime Minister wrote.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese married his partner, Jodie Haydon, on Saturday in an intimate ceremony held at The Lodge, his official Canberra residence. The occasion marked a historic first, as no serving Australian prime minister had previously married while in office during the country’s 124 years of federation.The wedding concludes a remarkable year for Albanese, following only months after he guided the Labour Party to a sweeping election win, securing a record 94 seats in the lower house.Earlier in the day, the Australian Prime Minister revealed that he had married his partner Jodie Haydon in a private ceremony at The Lodge in Canberra, becoming the first sitting Australian leader to marry while in office.“We are truly thrilled to share our love and our commitment to spending our lives together, surrounded by our family and closest friends,” Albanese and Haydon said in a joint statement released Saturday morning.Local media reported that numerous leaders, including several senior ministers such as Penny Wong, Mark Butler, Katy Gallagher, Don Farrell, Tony Burke, Richard Marles, Jim Chalmers, Tim Ayres and Jenny McAllister, along with New South Wales MPs John Graham and Jo Haylen, were present at the ceremony.Australian Opposition Leader Sussan Ley also extended her congratulations on the marriage.“Congratulations to Anthony and Jodie!

Untold Bravery in Operation Sindoor: CISF Reveals It Foiled Pakistan Attack on Uri Hydro Power Plant

NEW DELHI: India has secured third rank in the Asia Power Index, gaining the status of 'major power.' India secured this ranking in the Lowy Institute study based on its performance in Operation Sindoor The first two ranks of 'superpowers' were retained by the United States and China, respectively.In 2024, India was ranked among the 'middle powers,' with a comprehensive score of 38.1, whereas in this year's reports, India scored 40 out of 100. It stands ahead of Japan and Russia, which hold the fourth and fifth positions, scoring 38.8 and 32.1, respectively. However, the nation still sees a large aspirational gap as compared to China, which has 73.7 points on the index. The US topped the rankings with 80.5 points.As per the detailed assessments, India's rank is backed by its growth in terms of economic and military capabilities. Notably, India rose to ninth place in economic relationships, driven by increases in inward investment.The Lowy Institute said the modest advances in India’s geopolitical relevance were measured through international connectivity, leverage, and technological development.It also highlighted India's military capabilities to have grown steadily.""For the most part, these gains were from improved expert appraisals of its capability, which were likely influenced by India's performance in Operation Sindoor, launched in May 2025, which added to India's recent combat experience,"" the institute said.India saw its sharpest decline in terms of defence networks, dropping its rank to 11th position. It dropped two ranks lower as compared to the 2024 rankings, which were overtaken by the Philippines and Thailand.According to the index, India overtook China as the country attracting the most inward investment after the United States, an indicator capturing 10-year cumulative flows.Overall, the institute concludes that India’s recent military experience and economic momentum have strengthened its regional standing, even as challenges persist in building defence partnerships.The Australia-based think tank study assesses a nation's ability to influence its external environment among the power states in Asia.","India has secured third rank in the asia power index, gaining the status of'major power' india secured this ranking in the lowy institute study based on its performance in operation sindoor.

Grounding for upgrade: Airbus A320 planes hit by software glitch globally; 350 of IndiGo & AI impacted in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/grounding-for-upgrade-airbus-a320-planes-hit-by-software-glitch-globally-350-of-indigo-ai-impacted-in-india/articleshow/125645449.cms,"IndiGo And Air India Warn Of Delays As Airbus Solar Radiation Snag Hits 350 A320 Jets In India

NEW DELHI: Air travel will get every impacted in India and across the globe with the world’s largest selling single aisle — Airbus A320 family of planes — going to be grounded this weekend for a software upgrade. In India, over 350 A320 family planes of IndiGo and Air India Group will be grounded for this upgrade that is expected to be over in 2-3 days. They are expected to resume flying by next Monday or Tuesday. Globally about 6,000 aircraft are likely to be impacted.The upgrade is in wake of an American low cost carrier JetBlue’s A320 operating from Cancun to Newark on Oct 30, 2025, “unexpectedly pitch(ing) downward without pilot input.” The uncontrolled descent “likely occurred during an ELAC (flight control computer) switch change,” according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The aircraft diverted to Tampa, where some passengers were hospitalised.Tackling this issue requires a software upgrade. For the new A320 family planes, the work requires about half an hour on each plane through “loading facility.” On older A320s, some hardware upgrade will also be required and hence the overall work will take longer.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has issued an emergency airworthiness directive (EAD) for Airbus A320 family of planes which “may unfortunately cause disruption to flight schedules and inconvenience to passengers. As is always the case in aviation, safety is paramount.”In India, almost all IndiGo A320 family planes are the new variants. The older A320s are in single digits. So IndiGo, which has over 350 A320 family planes in its fleet, upgrade on the required 250 aircraft should be over by Monday or Tuesday, said sources. Air India, which has about 120-125 A320 family planes, should also have the same situation, with over 100 impacted.Air India said on X early Saturday morning: “We are aware of a directive from Airbus related to its A320 family aircraft currently in-service across airline operators. This will result in a software/hardware realignment on a part of our fleet, leading to longer turnaround time and delays to our scheduled operations. Air India regrets any inconvenience this may cause to passengers till the reset is carried out across the fleet. ”Airbus said in a statement: “Analysis of a recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls. Airbus has consequently identified a significant number of A320 family aircraft currently in-service which may be impacted. Airbus has worked proactively with the aviation authorities to request immediate precautionary action from operators via an alert operators transmission (AOT) in order to implement the available software and/or hardware protection, and ensure the fleet is safe to fly. This AOT will be reflected in an emergency airworthiness directive from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).”Airbus “acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers” and apologised “for the inconvenience caused”. The European airspace major said it “will work closely with operators, while keeping safety as our number one and overriding priority.”In its emergency airworthiness directive regarding the issue, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) gave the reason for the same: “An Airbus A320 aeroplane recently experienced an uncommanded and limited pitch down event. The autopilot remained engaged throughout the event, with a brief and limited loss of altitude, and the rest of the flight was uneventful. Preliminary technical assessment done by Airbus identified a malfunction of the affected ELAC as possible contributing factor. This condition, if not corrected, could lead in the worst-case scenario to an uncommanded elevator movement that may result in exceeding the aircraft’s structural capability. To address this potential unsafe condition, Airbus issued the alert operators transmission, providing instructions to install a serviceable ELAC.”","Indigo and air india warn of delays as airbus solar radiation snag hits 350 a320 jets in india. Globally about 6,000 aircraft are likely to be impacted. The upgrade is in wake of an american low cost carrier jetblue’s a320 operating from cancun to newark.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125649376,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-503489,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Only a legitimate and organised state authority can determine it under Islamic jurisprudence.""He added, ""India, being a democratic and secular nation, is not an Islamic state; hence any debate about physical jihad here has no relevance.Muslims are constitutionally bound citizens, and govt is responsible for protecting the rights of all.""Madani also reiterated Muslims' opposition to the singing of national song Vande Mataram.BJP's response was swift and furious. ""'Whenever there is oppression, jihad will be waged' is an extremely inappropriate remark as terror and violence have been inflicted not only on India but across the world in the name of jihad,"" said party spokesperson Sambit Patra.""His statement that Supreme Court has no right to call itself supreme is extremely unfortunate and completely unacceptable,"" the BJP spokesperson further said, adding the apex court can take suo motu cognizance of his comments.On Madani's stand against Vande Mataram, Patra said that such a mindset hurts the country's unity and constitutional values. ""He should remember that Vande Mataram is not a symbol of any religion but the fragrance of India's soil and the voice of its soul. In the 150th year of Vande Mataram, Madani's provocative comments expose his divisive agenda.""Govt has celebrated the anniversary of Vande Mataram with several events, with there being talk that it may seek a discussion on India's national song in the upcoming session of Parliament.Madani's remarks come close on the heels of his uncle Arshad, head of the rival faction of the Deobandi outfit, alleging that Muslims were being persecuted. Speaking in the immediate aftermath of the Red Fort blast and the arrest of the promoter of Al-Falah University, which has been under spotlight after the arrests of its doctors and employees in connection with the attack, Madani senior said Muslim institutions were facing persecution.","Maulana mahmood madani, head of jamiat-ulama-hind, accused supreme court and govt of undermining minority rights.

Has the COP30 come up to the expectations of India?

What more could have been done in Belém?

What was India’s stand on two critical issues -

roadmap

on transitioning away from

fossil fuels

and ending deforestation - during the negotiation? Both these issues could not make it to the final decision text.

Did India articulate its points on the EU’s unilateral trade measure such as CBAM? Will it still be implemented by the EU from next year as per its plan?

Did the absence of the US make any difference on the overall outcome of COP30?

The 30th session of the UN climate change conference (COP30) concluded in Belem, Brazil on Nov 22, keeping alive the hope of multilateral processes to find answers to global problems. India was led by the country’s environment and climate change ministerduring the crucial round of negotiations that finally ended with adopting the political outcome – Global Mutirao: Uniting humanity in a global mobilization against climate change – of the annual summit.Consensus on tripling adaptation finance by 2035, establishment of the Just Transition Mechanism, setting up a Global Implementation Accelerator - a two-year process to close the gap between current national climate plans and what is required to keep the global warming within 1.5 degree Celsius – and establishing a two-year work programme for delivery of climate finance are among the key outcomes of COP30.explained towhat these outcomes meant for India and what would be the fate of other critical issues which could not make it to the final decision document. Excerpts:COP30 has fully met India’s expectations and stands as a strong affirmation of our leadership and commitment to climate multilateralism. The 29 decisions adopted by consensus clearly reflect India’s priorities across critical areas such as climate finance including adaptation finance, adaptation, unilateral trade measures, technology, and just transition, etc.India played a central role in shaping the ‘Mutirão’ Decision, which reinforces that multilateralism is working and must remain the backbone of global climate action.Driven by PM Narendra Modi’s leadership, India steered the group of like-minded developing countries. We were able to secure a dedicated two-year work programme on Article 9.1 of the Paris Agreement that will bring renewed focus to the legally binding finance obligations of developed countries. Our persistent efforts also ensured that concerns on Unilateral Trade Measures were advanced.India’s expectations on the Global Goal on Adaptation namely flexibility, voluntary nature of indicators, nationally determined indicators, no additional reporting burdens, and continued technical refinement, are all embedded in the COP30 outcome.We also ensured the setting up of Technology Implementation Programme to facilitate implementation of technology needs of developing countries. Importantly, COP 30 has established an institutional arrangement for just transition, reflecting the needs and priorities of developing nations.Overall, India’s core objectives of upholding inclusivity, safeguarding interests of developing countries, and strengthening trust in the multilateral process, have been fully realized at COP30.In line with the positions, we advanced throughout COP30. India firmly and confidently articulated its priorities, especially on matters of vital importance to developing countries. We are satisfied with the outcomes, notably the creation of the dedicated work programme on Article 9.1, which places renewed emphasis on the finance obligations of developed nations. COP30 marks an important step forward in strengthening equity and reinforcing climate justice within the multilateral process.The COP 30 Presidency’s Belém Roadmaps on ‘Forest and Climate’ and ‘Transitioning Away from Fossil Fuels Roadmap’ have been developed outside the formal UNFCCC processes. The Roadmap on Forest and Climate seeks to bring together Parties and stakeholders to deliberate on strategies to halt and reverse deforestation.The Transitioning Away from Fossil Fuels Roadmap aims to address the fiscal, economic, and social dimensions of the global energy transition, outlining credible pathways for scaling up zero- and low-carbon solutions, while fully recognising national and regional circumstances.India welcomes the Forest and Climate Roadmap. We take note of the Roadmap on Transitioning Away from Fossil Fuels in the context of our national priorities and our long-standing commitment to ensuring energy security for our people.COP30 also witnessed the launch of the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), a mechanism designed to provide long-term, results-based payments to tropical forest countries for verified conservation of standing forests. The facility aims to mobilise more than $6.7 billion in its first phase and has received endorsement from 63 countries, thereby establishing a permanent capital base for global forest protection. India is among the countries endorsing the TFFF as an observer.With unilateral measures such as the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) already taking effect, and similar initiatives being considered by the United Kingdom and Canada, it was critical for India that this issue be taken up formally on the COP 30 agenda. India, together with the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), tabled a proposal on “promoting international cooperation and addressing concerns arising from climate-change–related unilateral trade-restrictive measures. ” Despite strong and unified opposition from developed countries, India pushed for substantive engagement. Intense negotiations followed, and although the matter did not enter the formal agenda, India secured a meaningful outcome.The COP30 decision reaffirmed that all Parties must cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system, one that advances sustainable economic growth and development, especially for developing countries, enabling them to more effectively address climate change. The decision also reiterated that climate-related measures including unilateral actions must not become tools for arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination, nor serve as disguised restrictions on international trade.Under the adopted decision, Parties will now begin structured dialogues from June 2027 to examine opportunities, challenges, and barriers related to strengthening international cooperation on the role of trade in climate action. A high-level event will be convened in 2028 to exchange experiences and perspectives, with a summary report to be presented later that year.This outcome ensures that the issue of unilateral trade measures such as CBAM is duly highlighted as impediment to an open and fair economic system and as barriers that constrain the ability of developing economies to pursue ambitious climate action.India emphasized that a rules-based multilateral framework remains indispensable for ensuring equity, trust, and predictability in global climate action. Consistent with this approach, Country Parties at COP 30 demonstrated a clear and united commitment to strengthen multilateral climate cooperation, reaffirming that only global collective actions can effectively address the challenge of climate change. The absence of a country did not make any difference on the overall outcome of COP30.Parties at COP30 collectively acknowledged that the Paris Agreement continues to deliver substantive progress towards its temperature goals. Scientific assessments highlighted that, without the Framework Convention and the Paris Agreement architecture, the world would have been on a trajectory toward 3.5 - 4 degree Celsius of warming. Instead, current commitments and cooperative mechanisms have meaningfully bent the curve downward, demonstrating the value and effectiveness of sustained global climate governance.","The 30th session of the un climate change conference (cop30) concluded in belem, brazil on nov 22. India was led by the country’s environment and climate change ministerduring the crucial round of negotiations. Cop30 witnessed the launch of the tropical forests forever facility (tfff), a mechanism designed to provide long-term, results-based payments to tropical forest countries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125655749,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-723105,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday announced that a C-130J aircraft carrying around 12 tonnes of humanitarian aid has landed in Colombo. The delivery is part of India’s Operation Sagar Bandhu, launched on Friday to assist Sri Lanka in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, which has so far claimed 80 lives.Sharing the update on X, Jaishankar wrote, “#OperationSagarBandhu unfolds. @IAF_MCC C-130J plane carrying approximately 12 tons of humanitarian aid, including tents, tarpaulins, blankets, hygiene kits, and ready-to-eat food items, lands in Colombo.”India initiated Operation Sagar Bandhu as part of its immediate response to assist cyclone-affected areas. The first relief consignments were transported by the Indian Navy’s aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and frontline warship INS Udaigiri, which arrived in Colombo on Friday and handed over supplies to Sri Lankan authorities.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, conveyed his condolences to the people of Sri Lanka, expressing grief over the lives lost in the cyclone and extending solidarity with India’s “closest maritime neighbour.” He noted that India had swiftly dispatched relief supplies and critical Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) equipment under the operation.“We stand ready to provide more aid and assistance as the situation evolves,” said PM Modi, adding that the support was guided by India’s Neighbourhood First policy and Vision MAHASAGAR.This comes as India bids to offer help Sri Lanka has been reeling from floods and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah.

Rainfall above 150 mm is also likely in parts of Trincomalee, Badulla, Galle and Matara. The DMC reported four homes destroyed and more than 600 partially damaged in the ongoing deluge.(With inputs from agencies)","India flies c-130 j plane carrying approx 12 tons of humanitarian aid to cylcone-hit sri lanka.

The ex-boyfriend of National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom has said she felt her deployment to Washington DC was “pointless,” just days before she was fatally shot by an Afghan national.In an interview with CNN, Adam Carr described how his 20-year-old girlfriend grew frustrated with the restrictions placed on her and other Guardsmen. “It was mixed,” Carr said. “She got deputized in there, and they gave them no rights to do anything.”Carr said Beckstrom often told him about some really bad confrontations with residents. “People spit towards us, cuss at us, throw things at us, and we can’t do nothing,” he recalled and said. “She couldn’t detain nobody. She couldn’t stop them from doing wrong. It was—they told them to call the cops.”Despite her frustration, Beckstrom believed in the mission to combat crime in the city. “She wanted to make the difference. She wanted to extremely. She was happy with it. And she just was also like, ‘Why am I here if I can’t do nothing? Where they limited them so much.’ She’s like, ‘It’s pointless.’ She’s like, ‘I get why we’re here.Crime is bad, but it’s pointless if we can’t do anything.’”Beckstrom and fellow National Guard member Andrew Wolfe were shot near White House on Thanksgiving Eve. Beckstrom died the following night with her parents at her side, while Wolfe remains in critical condition. A 29-year-old Afghan immigrant, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been arrested in connection with the shootings.President Donald Trump announced Beckstrom’s death and called her a “highly respected, young, magnificent person” and was “outstanding in every way.”Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi noted that Beckstrom, who started service in June 2023, had volunteered for the DC deployment over the Thanksgiving period.","Sarah beckstrom and andrew wolfe were shot near white house on thanksgiving eve.

US Attorney ‘Gently Pushes’ FBI’s Kash Patel, BLASTS Reporter Over Trump’s National Guard Deployment





US president Donald Trump on Thursday claimed that it was “not allowed” to use the word ""Indian"" anymore.Speaking to a reporter, he said: “You’re not allowed to use the word ‘Indian’ anymore. The only ones that want you to do it are the Indians. I will never tell you to change.”The word “Indian” is used to describe Native American communities. While some tribal members continue to use the term, others argue it is outdated or rooted in racism.The term ""Indian"" stems from Christopher Columbus's error in believing he had reached India, leading to its historical application to Native Americans.Trump has a long and uneasy history with Native American tribes. He often positions himself as their defender, despite long-running disputes with them.In April this year, organisations condemned Trump's threat to block a new stadium in Washington, DC, unless the local NFL team returned to its old name, the Redskins. The name was dropped in 2020 after years of complaints that it was a racial slur.“I may put a restriction on them that if they don’t change the name back to the original ‘Washington Redskins,’ and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, ‘Washington Commanders,’ I won’t make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington.The team would be much more valuable, and the deal would be more exciting for everyone,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Trump also put the pressure on the Cleveland Guardians to change their name back to the “Indians,” claiming that the “Indian people” want the Guardians to be the “Indians” yet again.Several native groups rejected his claim. The Association on American Indian Affairs said such mascots reduce indigenous people to caricatures and ignore their living cultures. ""These mascots and names do not honor native people; they reduce us to caricatures. Our diverse people and cultures are not relics of the past or mascots for entertainment,"" the Association on American Indian Affairs said in a statement, as quoted by Reuters.While some groups oppose the Commanders returning to the former name, the Native American Guardians Association said, ""The Native American Guardians Association stands with the president of the United States in the call to return common sense and sanity back to our nation.""In 1993, Trump testified before Congress against Native American gaming. During that hearing, he said some tribes “don’t look like Indians to me,” and questioned their identity and their role in running casinos. He later added that he might have “more Indian blood than a lot of the so-called Indians” operating reservations, as quoted by Time.","Donald trump claims it is 'not allowed' to use the word 'indian' anymore.

Hong Kong high-rise fire





Hong Kong political activist Finn Lau posted a long analysis on social media after a massive fire killed 128, pushing back against officials who blamed the disaster on bamboo scaffolding that was used in the tall buildings. Lau said that bamboo is fire-resistant and has been used safely for decades, so he believes it could not be the main cause. Instead, he accused authorities of using bamboo as a convenient excuse to avoid answering tougher questions about safety rules, inspections, and emergency planning.In his post, Lau said that government departments were too slow to respond and had ignored earlier warnings about overcrowded construction sites and poor fire-prevention measures. He also criticised officials for shifting responsibility instead of explaining why safety standards were not enforced and why the blaze spread so quickly in a modern city like Hong Kong. According to Lau, the real issue was long-term government negligence, not bamboo materials.He blamed the mesh netting, saying its highly flammable nature had been overlooked, and accused the government of pushing metal scaffolding before completing a proper investigation.He claimed that the government ignored earlier reports and whistleblower complaints about the widespread use of non-compliant, flammable mesh nets on Hong Kong construction sites over the past year.A devastating fire ripped through a high-rise residential block, Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po in Hong Kong, earlier this week, enveloping multiple floors in thick smoke. Firefighters raced to the scene, evacuating hundreds of residents as flames spread rapidly across the building’s exterior. The blaze burned for several hours before crews finally brought it under control. Several people have been treated for smoke inhalation, and emergency services continue to check for other potential casualties. The disaster killed hundreds with many more still missing.Authorities said the fire began on construction scaffolding wrapped in protective netting and foam-like panels during renovation. Fire alarms reportedly failed and many residents had to alert neighbours manually.",Hong kong political activist finn lau posted a long analysis on social media after a massive fire killed 128.

Arrest of Rahmanullah Lakanwal in DC shooting





A second Afghan national brought to the United States under Operation Allies Welcome was arrested on Saturday, only days after a separate case of a shooting in Washington DC.This latest arrest involves a man accused of posting a TikTok video that appeared to show him constructing a bomb and naming the Fort Worth area in Texas as his target, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).According to Fox News, Mohammad Dawood Alokozay was taken into custody. Court records show he has been charged at the state level with making a terroristic threat.DHS confirmed that Alokozay entered the country through Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden-era resettlement effort launched after the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, when the Taliban took over. Alokozay was admitted on September 7, 2022, as a lawful permanent resident. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has now issued a detainer following his arrest.Texas authorities worked with the FBI in a Joint Terrorism Task Force and detained Alokozay on Tuesday.His arrest came only one day before a separate shooting in Washington DC involving another Afghan named Rahmanullah Lakanwal.Lakanwal is accused of shooting two National Guard soldiers near the White House, in which one died, and one remains in critical condition.Lakanwal also arrived in the US under Operation Allies Welcome. He lived in Washington state and, according to a Trump administration official, applied for asylum in December last year and received approval in April. Investigators said he had no known criminal history before the attack.Later, CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed that the Lakanwal had previously worked “with the US Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.”These back-to-back incidents have raised questions about the Operation Allies Welcome.A report from the DHS Inspector General last year found serious data errors in the Biden-era programme, saying some arrivals were issued multiple identification numbers or had names recorded incorrectly. The review warned that such problems made it harder to track “biographic or criminal history data” and said DHS did not have a clear system to monitor when parole for evacuees expired.In the aftermath of the DC shooting, President Trump said his administration would “re-examine” all Afghans who entered the country during Biden’s presidency. The MAGA chief said the attack exposed “lax migration policies” and announced a sweeping freeze on immigration: all immigration requests from Afghan nationals have been suspended indefinitely. The US has also paused issuing visas to individuals travelling on Afghan passports.The POTUS also ordered a sweeping pause on immigration from “Third World countries,” a category that includes several nations in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. This aligns with his hardline stance on foreigners, supported by his MAGA base.Earlier this month, Trump also signalled a softening stance on H1-B visas.",Mohammad dawood alokozay was arrested in texas on tuesday.

Perez Hilton defends Meghan Markle in new “Green Gown-gate” talk

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry join Thanksgiving service event





Pop culture podcaster Perez Hilton has reacted to a new rumor about Meghan Markle and a green gown. This rumor started again after the trailer for Meghan Markle’s upcoming Netflix holiday special came out. In the trailer, Meghan is seen wearing a green dress. Soon, many people online began to say that this dress looked like the same $1,695 gown she wore for a Variety 2022 photoshoot. Some people online claimed she took the dress home “without asking.”These new talks grew bigger after Page Six posted a report on November 24. The outlet wrote that one source claimed Meghan “took the emerald green gown from the shoot without permission.” Another source told Page Six that Meghan was “required to archive all her looks” because of royal rules. But Page Six also added that a different source said there was no such royal rule.The rumor became huge on social media, and many people began to argue about Meghan again. So, Perez Hilton decided to speak about it. He wrote about it in his November 26 blog, saying the scandal was now called “Green Gown-gate.” He also spoke about an interview with journalist Vanessa Grigoriadis, who said the Sussexes took “a lot of stuff” after a past photoshoot.Perez Hilton reacted strongly to the dress rumor. He said the whole story sounded silly and wrote:“This sounds like a bunch of nonsense. We really doubt Meghan would steal a dress, and then wear it for her Netflix show!”Perez Hilton also said that many stars take home outfits after shoots and that Meghan Markle likely had an agreement with the designer. He added that this happens “all the time” in Hollywood. Soon after, Meghan Markle’s representative spoke to E! News and denied all the claims. The rep said:“The idea that anything was taken without the full knowledge or agreement of the stylists or their teams is false and highly defamatory. Anything kept was done with transparency and followed all contracts.”Prince Harry and Meghan Markle also made news for a good reason this week. On November 26, they spent Thanksgiving week helping the group Our Big Kitchen Los Angeles through their charity, the Archewell Foundation. The couple cooked and packed meals with their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.In a press release, the Archewell team said they wanted to support people who are struggling with food insecurity during the holiday season.Meghan Markle also shared a warm Thanksgiving note in her As Ever brand newsletter, thanking her family and wishing everyone a happy holiday.

Donald Trump and his love for golf

The current President of the USA is known for his love of golf. In fact, he loves it so much that since he started on his second term, he has golfed 75 out of 313 days of his presidency. Which is basically about 25% of his second term. And that did not come without costing a pretty buck, as latest reports suggest that President Trump has spent more than 70 million taxpayer dollars to continue his hobby.He travels not just all around the United States, but the world to feed his obsession with the sport. From New Jersey to Scotland to Dubai, he will travel anywhere as long as it means he gets to play golf, and while it's a fun time for the president, it does cost the average American citizen a pretty penny they pay in the form of taxes.Before he became the president of the United States, Donald Trump was invested in the real estate business, and owns about 17 golf courses worldwide. And he travels all around to play golf in whichever course he pleases. Sometimes it's close to home, in Washington D.C., sometimes it's a little far away in Indonesia, but golfing hasn't stopped. On Thanksgiving Day, Trump was asked about his handicap, to which he said,""I’ve won 38 club championships and I don't get to practice....SoI'm a very low handicap, and I've won 38…everyone legitimately. So I guess I got to be around scratch or better. I beat a plus three.""Having spent 75 out of 313 days of his second presidency golfing, the president has cost American taxpayers more than $70 million, and if the numbers stay the same, by the end of his tenure, he will have spent about $300 million. He frequently travels to Florida and New Jersey by air, as well as frequents his local course in Washington, D.C. to keep his love for the sport alive. He has spent a pretty penny designing these high-end golf courses and providing every amenity possible. But the cost in comparison seems a little too much.Also Read: Donald Trump brags about golf achievements after announcing National Guard Sarah Beckstrom’s death in DC shooting","The current president of the usa is known for his love of golf.

"US couple under fire for housing DC shooter Rahmanullah Lakanwal, wife, 5 children; raised fund for 'truly genuine people'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-couple-under-fire-for-housing-dc-shooter-rahmanullah-lakanwal-wife-5-children-raised-fund-for-truly-genuine-people/articleshow/125640638.cms,"What did Rahmanullah do in the US?





US couple Stanley Creighton and Valerie Creighton came under fire after the DC National Guard shooter was identified as Afghan-origin Rahmanullah Lakanwal, as the rich couple once vouched for the Lakanwal family when they hosted them in their $2.7 million home in Bellingham, Washington. This was just after the Lakanwal family came to the US in 2021 and had no place to live.The Creightons even started a fundraiser for the Afghan family and called them truly genuine and kind people. The old fundraiser page was deleted after Lakanwal went rogue and shot two National Guard members.""Hi, this is Stan and Val and we are fundraising for an Afghan refugee family who stayed at outr home for 2 months before finding permanent rental housing in Bellingham, WA. Rahmanullah and Khamila have 5 wonderful boys ages 11 to 2. Before being evacuated to the US in September 2021, Rahmanullah served for 11 years as a member of the Afghan Special Forces alongside US service members fighting the Taliban,"" the now-deleted fundraiser said.""This is an opportunity for you to help a truly wonderful family. They left Afghanistan with nothing and they need household and kitchen items of all kinds.please give whatever you can to help them start a new life in the US. They are truly genuine, kind people,"" the fundraiser added.As the screenshot of this fundraiser surfaced, social media users dug up the whereabouts of the US couple. ""The Creightons sponsored Lakanwal & his family in 2021 as part of Biden's Operation Allies Welcome program. They appear to be serial profiteers of the ""refugee industry"" and have sponsored other Afghani families and Syrian refugees too. Who's paying for all this?"" one wrote.Laura Loomer revealed that the Creightons supported Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton. Loomer said they are extremely wealthy but still they ""virtue signaled"" to the community for raising money for the ""jihadist"".According to reports, Rahmanullah was working as a driver for Amazon Flex, delivering packages as an independent contractor. But his last delivery was in August. The apartment complex where Lakhanwal lived most recently is a rent-subsidized home for people with disabilities, recovery etc.A relative spoke up and saod he had no idea why Lakanwal did this. “I need your help to know why this happened.” A childhood friend of Lakanwal's told the NYT that he suffered mental problems from what he saw in Afghanistan. “When he saw blood, bodies, and the wounded, he could not tolerate it,” the friend told the New York Times. “It put a lot of pressure on his mind.”A neighbor in the US told NYT that the Lakanwal family kept to themselves, but he once discussed Afghan food with Lakanwal's wife. Their apartment was mostly empty with no bed and furniture; there were only cushions to sleep. Lakanwal was often seen playing video games.",Us couple stanley creighton and valerie creighton came under fire after the dc national guard shooter was identified as afghan-origin rahmanullah lakanwal.
