NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke on Wednesday about Kashmir and actions taken by the Union government, including the removal of Article 370 , economic measures, and elections with high voter turnout. He also discussed Brics countries' views on the use of the dollar in the international economy.He made these remarks during a session titled ""India’s Rise and Role in the World"" at the Chatham House think tank in London.When asked about Kashmir, Jaishankar said, ""In Kashmir, we have done a good job solving most of it. I think removing Article 370 was one step. Then, restoring growth, economic activity and social justice in Kashmir was step number two. Holding elections, which were done with a very high turnout, was step number three. I think the part we are waiting for is the return of the stolen part of Kashmir, which is on the illegal Pakistani occupation. When that's done, I assure you, Kashmir solved.""Jaishankar also said that the US administration under President Donald Trump is moving towards multipolarity, which aligns with India's interests. He said that both countries have agreed on the need for a bilateral trade agreement .""We see a president and an administration which, in our parlance, is moving towards multipolarity and that is something that suits India,"" he said.Referring to the Quad alliance of the US, India, Australia, and Japan, he said, ""From President Trump’s perspective, the one big shared enterprise that we have is the Quad, which is an understanding where everybody pays their fair share… There are no free riders involved. So that’s a good model which works.""Regarding tariffs, Jaishankar said that commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal is in Washington for discussions on a bilateral trade pact following talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump at the White House last month.""We had a very open conversation about it (tariffs) and the result of that conversation was that we agreed on the need for a bilateral trade agreement,"" he said.Jaishankar also addressed topics such as India’s relationship with China, the internationalisation of the Rupee, and the role of the dollar in the global economy.On China, he noted some developments since October 2024, including the opening of the Mount Kailash pilgrimage route in Tibet.""We have a very, very unique relationship with China as the only two billion plus populated countries in the world… we want a relationship where our interests are respected, sensitivities are recognised and works for both of us,"" he said.Jaishankar is on an official visit to the United Kingdom and Ireland from March 4 to 9 to strengthen India's ties with both countries.","External affairs minister s jaishankar spoke on wednesday about kashmir and actions taken by the union government.

I studied with him at Cambridge, where he had failed. Failing at Cambridge University is very difficult because the university tries to ensure that everyone at least passes. But despite that, Rajiv Gandhi failed,"" Aiyar said.""After that, he went to Imperial College in London, and he failed there as well. Then I thought, how can such a person become the Prime Minister of the country?” he added.Meanwhile, reacting to the remarks, Congress termed Aiyar as a frustrated individual and claimed that Rajiv Gandhi gave the country a modern outlook""I don't want to comment on someone who is frustrated individual. I knew Rajiv Gandhi, who gave the country a modern outlook. He took concrete steps for the liberalisation of the economy as well,"" Congress leader Harish Rawat said.""It is unfortunate that a section of the party (Congress) did not stand with him, or else the country's history would have been something else. His speeches as LoP still guide leaders."" he added.This comes after Aiyar had claimed that his career was both made and unmade by the Gandhis.During an interview with PTI, he mentioned that aside from one occasion, he had limited meaningful interactions with Rahul Gandhi, and he had only spent time with Priyanka Gandhi on two occasions.“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi. And I have not spent time with Priyanka except on one occasion, no, two occasions. She comes on the phone to me, so I’m in touch with them. So, the irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis,"" he told PTI.Aiyar was a close aide of Rajiv Gandhi when he entered politics. His inner circle also included his cousin Arun Nehru, friend Arun Singh and Sam Pitroda.This is not the first time that Mani Shankar Aiyar's remarks have led to controversy.Aiyar triggered a row when he said that the Chinese in 1962 ""allegedly invaded India"".In 2017, during campaign for the Gujarat assembly elections, Aiyar had stoked a major controversy and caused considerable damage to the electoral prospects of the grand old party after he used objectionable words against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Congress reacted by suspending Aiyar from the party. Two years later in 2019, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, Aiyar defiantly recalled his remarks against Modi and tried to justify it.Earlier in 2014, Aiyar had made a chaiwala jibe at Narendra Modi, who was then the BJP's prime ministerial candidate.","Bjp it cell head amit malviya shared an excerpt of aiyar's interview on x, and said: ""let the veil be stripped"" in the video, the congress leader said that rajiv gandhi struggled academically and many questioned his competency to become prime minister.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118732791,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39554,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India-UK ties contribute to stability and prosperity in an uncertain and volatile world, said foreign minister S Jaishankar after ""wide-ranging and productive"" talks with his counterpart David Lammy during which they discussed major regional and global issues including the Ukraine conflict , West Asia situation and also developments in Bangladesh and the Commonwealth.Before his meeting with Lammy, Jaishankar had also called on UK PM Keir Starmer and held talks with UK's home and trade secretaries, Yvette Cooper and Jonathan Reynolds respectively, focusing on issues like extremism and the ongoing FTA talks.""We discussed the entire gamut of bilateral ties, especially our focus on strategic coordination, political cooperation, trade deal negotiation, education, technology, mobility and people-to-people exchanges.

In his meeting with Starmer, Jaishankar had discussed taking forward bilateral, economic ties and enhancing people to people exchanges.Starmer also shared the UK's perspective on the Ukraine conflict in the meeting. The UK PM this week proposed a four-step plan that included development of a ""coalition of the willing"" in Europe to guarantee peace for Ukraine. He also committed to ""boots on the ground, and planes in the air"", saying Europe must do the heavy lifting. India, however, has continued to maintain that enduring peace is possible only through dialogue and diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine.For India, Bangladesh continues to pose a big challenge because of increasing radicalisation and the threat to regional stability. Jaishankar has remained in touch with Lammy about developments in Dhaka right from the time Hasina was deposed.","India-uk ties contribute to stability and prosperity in an uncertain and volatile world.

Texas tornado hits home; Erin Bradshaw mourns heartbreaking loss



The Truth About Terry Bradshaw's Daughters Revealed

Tornado warning strikes. But where is Terry Bradshaw?



As severe storms and tornado warnings grip North Texas, concerns rise for residents—including Terry Bradshaw ’s family. While the NFL legend sold his ranch and reportedly moved into a smaller Texas home, recent sightings suggest he might not even be in the state. With Mansfield, Burleson, and Rendo under a tornado watch, fans are left wondering; where is Bradshaw amid the chaos, and is his family safe?Texas is no stranger to tornadoes. In 2020, NWS meteorologist Tom Bradshaw noted the state sees around 150 annually. Five years later, a powerful storm is once again wreaking havoc, and this time, it has hit close to home for Terry Bradshaw’s daughter, Erin.The world-champion equestrian took to Instagram, sharing heartbreaking images of the destruction on her property. “It got a little western at 5 a.m. here,” she wrote.“It got a little western at 5 am here. Two of our loafing sheds got tossed like golf balls. Sadly one loafing shed was in our mare and baby pasture. We lost one baby and have one mare with a severe cut to her back leg that is due any day with her baby at the vet clinic.”Born and raised in Texas, Erin experienced the chaos firsthand. While the storm’s impact was mild compared to major disasters, the damage was deeply personal.“Not what anyone wants to wake up too and we are heartbroken to lose a baby but things could have been worse. I’m glad our home is okay. I have no idea what hit us but it had a little path through our property and down our road like a small tornado.”She also shared a photo of an “uprooted” shed and thanked those who rushed to help. “Thank you Steve Owens for coming first thing and cleaning with his crew and doing a total clean up. And thank you Weems and Stephens for the emergency vet care early this morning. Texas you can kiss my a*s today. And now we have a dust storm.” (Via: EssentiallySports)Though not catastrophic, the storm left a painful mark claiming a life on Erin’s ranch and turning her world upside down.Also Read: Kelly Stafford, wife of Matthew Stafford, reveals longstanding health battles as Rams QB supports noble cause Amid challenging times, Erin is busy tending to her ranch, mares, and home in Texas. As for Terry Bradshaw, he no longer has a ranch to manage his Thackerville, Oklahoma property, listed at $22.5 million, was sold in November 2023. While the final sale price remains undisclosed, reports suggest he downsized to a smaller home in Texas.Now, with a tornado warning in effect, his family faces the same concerns as thousands of others. Severe storms slammed North Texas early Tuesday, impacting his daughter and triggering multiple alerts. The National Weather Service placed Mansfield, Burleson, and Rendo under a tornado watch until 11 a.m.Bradshaw may have left Mansfield long ago, but fans are still worried.

A ‘rising star’ takes the stage

What to expect from Slotkin’s response

The stakes are high

Senator Elissa Slotkin , a former CIA analyst and rising Democratic star, will deliver her party’s response to President Donald Trump ’s address to Congress on Tuesday. Slotkin, who won Michigan’s Senate seat last year in a fiercely contested race, is set to present the Democratic vision in a speech that aims to counter Trump’s expected rhetoric.Slotkin, 48, made history as the youngest Democratic woman elected to the Senate and now represents a key swing state that former Vice-President Kamala Harris lost in the 2024 election. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called her ""great on both economic and national security issues,"" touting her as the ideal choice to take on Trump in primetime.""From our economic security to our national security, we've got to chart a way forward that actually improves people's lives in the country we all love,"" Slotkin said in a statement ahead of her speech.Slotkin’s rebuttal is expected to hammer home the Democrats’ key message: protecting working-class Americans while Republicans ""cut taxes for their billionaire donors and Elon Musk ,"" as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries put it. She will focus on lowering the cost of living, defending Social Security and Medicaid , and presenting a stark contrast to Trump’s economic policies.Her selection signals the Democratic Party’s intent to showcase moderate voices with strong national security credentials. Before entering politics, Slotkin served as a CIA analyst and held key roles in both the Bush and Obama administrations. She was deployed to Iraq three times before moving to the National Security Council and the Pentagon.Slotkin’s speech comes at a pivotal moment, with Trump’s return to Washington reigniting fierce political battles. As one of the Senate’s newest faces, she will need to balance Democratic priorities while appealing to the swing voters who helped her secure Michigan.With her intelligence background and centrist credentials, Slotkin may prove to be one of the Democrats’ strongest voices against Trump—both on Tuesday night and in the battles ahead.","Elissa slotkin will deliver the democrats' response to president donald trump's address to congress on tuesday.

Donald Trump's tariffs: India may be among least vulnerable Asian economies in trade war with US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/donald-trumps-tariffs-india-may-be-among-least-vulnerable-asian-economies-in-trade-war-with-us-but-theres-a-catch/articleshow/118733998.cms,"Donald Trump has criticised India and other nations, including China, for their ""very unfair"" tariff practices.

As is evident from the chart, India’s exports to the US as a percentage of the former’s GDP is just 2.2%, compared to 25.1% for Vietnam, hence indicating relatively lesser exposure.

Which countries are more vulnerable to US tariffs?

What Donald Trump has said:

Trade Relations between Asia and United States

Vietnamese shipments to the United States constitute 25% of its GDP, primarily comprising textiles and electronic goods.

Electronics make up over 60% of both Taiwanese and Malaysian exports to the United States.

Thailand faces broader vulnerability across electronics, rubber-based products and machinery exports.

Other Asian nations show varied export portfolios to the US market. Singapore sends approximately 14% in chemicals and pharmaceutical products, whilst India's primary exports include precious stones, textiles and pharmaceutical items.

What Trump’s Tariffs may mean for Asia

1. Regional Effect:

Amongst the top 11 nations with US trade deficits, seven are Asian: China (1), Vietnam (3), Taiwan (6), Japan (7), South Korea (8), India (10) and Thailand (11).

US' goods trade balances

2. Reciprocal Tariffs:

3. Sector-specific Duties:

4. Semiconductor tariffs:

5. Third country risk:

Since India’s share of China value added in their goods exports to the US is relatively less, there is lower expected impact.

6. Indirect effects:

Role of Reciprocal Tariffs

Asian developing economies, particularly India and Thailand, apply elevated comparative tariff rates on American exports, making them vulnerable to increased reciprocal tariffs.

Asian countries' tariffs on the US minus US tariffs on Asian countries

How India is prepping for Trump 2.0

According to the Nomura report, India intends to secure a comprehensive trade and investment agreement with the United States, as India stands ready to reduce tariffs on select items (e.g. pork, high-end medical devices, luxury motorcycles) and extend substantial benefits including production-linked incentives for shipping and backing for logistics enterprises.

India seeks to enhance procurement of defence equipment, aircraft, oil & gas, technology and medical & diagnostic equipment from the United States.

The aim is to position India as a viable manufacturing alternative to China, offering enhanced benefits such as tax reductions and land accessibility in states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu across sectors including semiconductors, electronics, aircraft components, and renewables.

India aims to become part of US global supply networks by providing concessions to American companies utilising India as a production centre for basic/intermediate goods (e.g. low-end chips, solar panels, machinery, pharmaceuticals).

India proposes to increase foreign direct investment limit in insurance to 100% (currently at 74%), potentially benefiting major US insurance companies like AIG.

Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs impact on India: US President Donald Trump has announced that on April 2, 2025, America would impose reciprocal tariffs on countries that levy higher duties on American goods. During his address to Congress, Trump criticised India and other nations, including China, for their ""very unfair"" tariff practices.So what will be the impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India? According to a recent report by Nomura, India is among the least vulnerable Asian countries in this trade war.Also read: Trump again rails at India over tariffs, announcing reciprocal duties from April 2 The economies of Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia, which maintain comparatively unrestricted trade policies, face significant vulnerability to increased US customs duties. Among Asian nations, Vietnam stands particularly susceptible, as its US-bound exports constitute 25% of its gross domestic product.Analysis of Asia's value addition in global exports to the United States by Nomura reveals Vietnam as the most vulnerable to comprehensive US tariffs (8.9% of its GDP). This is followed by Taiwan (6.3%), Thailand (5.6%), Malaysia (4.6%), Singapore (4.5%) and South Korea (4.5%). The computer & electronics industry faces the highest risk from supply-chain disruptions caused by tariffs.Trump's proposed tariff measures include various sectors including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, steel, aluminium, lumber and forest products, with copper potentially being added to the list.The impact on Asian exports to the United States is substantial, with 20.6% of the region's US-bound shipments facing potential disruption. Several Asian economies show significant vulnerability, as more than 25% of US-directed exports from South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan could face these sectoral tariffs.In terms of sectoral analysis, Asian economies demonstrate highest exposure to automotive tariffs, whilst semiconductor and steel sectors rank as the second and third most vulnerable areas respectively.""Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, - Mexico and Canada - Have you heard of them - and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair,"" Trump stated in his longest speech to the Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday evening.He specifically highlighted that ""India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100 per cent.""The implementation of increased tariffs on Indian exports (including pharmaceuticals, textiles, and IT services) would increase their costs in the US market, potentially reducing demand. This could negatively impact Indian manufacturers and exporters whilst increasing prices for US consumers.As a counter-measure to US tariffs, India might seek to enhance its economic relationships with alternative global partners such as the European Union, China, or Russia to offset reduced US market access. This development could diminish American economic influence.Analysing sector-wise exposure, electronic components, machinery, automobiles and other manufactured items face elevated US customs duties.China stands as the primary focus of America First Trade Policy (AFTP), whilst other Asian nations face significant risks. The US tariff strategy encompasses trade deficits, reciprocal and sectoral duties, alongside potential penalties for nations involved in tariff evasion. Regarding trade imbalances, Asia maintains a substantial surplus with the US.The implementation of reciprocal tariffs considers tariff differentials, VAT and non-tariff obstacles. Developing Asian nations, particularly India and Thailand, maintain higher comparative tariff rates on US exports, notably in agricultural and transport sectors. Including non-tariff barriers in assessment criteria increases the possibility of reciprocal taxation across various Asian economies, both emerging and developed.The proposed tariffs target semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, steel, aluminium, lumber and forest products (potentially copper), comprising 20.6% of Asian exports to the US. For Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan, these sectoral tariffs could affect over 25% of their US exports. Asian exposure is highest in automobiles, followed by semiconductors and steel.Detailed analysis indicates minimal direct consequences of increased chip tariffs on Asia, considering limited US substitution options. However, indirect effects present greater concerns, as reduced US consumer demand would affect Asian economies across various electronics supply chain stages. Taiwan shows the highest vulnerability, followed by Malaysia, Singapore, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.Should the US administration implement tariffs on imports from countries potentially circumventing existing duties, specific products from Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand could face scrutiny, as these nations show higher Chinese value addition in their US-bound exports.Asian nations are deeply integrated into global supply networks, encompassing both backward linkages (where foreign value is incorporated into domestic exports) and forward linkages (where domestic value is incorporated into foreign exports). As a result, Asia's actual exposure to the United States - considering both direct and indirect value addition through third countries - is substantially higher.Retaliatory or reciprocal tariffs shall be determined by considering multiple elements including tariff differentials, value-added tax and non-tariff restrictions.Across industries, Asian nations levy steeper duties on farm products and transport items. Whilst reducing agricultural tariffs remains politically challenging for Asian countries, they could consider lowering duties in the transport sector, including automobiles.","Donald trump has criticised india and other nations, including china, for their ""very unfair"" tariff practices.

Market sees growth after Trump grants one month exemption

United States President Donald Trump is granting a month exemption on his new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for the American automakers, worrying that the newly launched trade war could crush domestic manufacturing .The announcement followed Trump's discussions with executives from Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis on Wednesday.""We spoke with the big three auto dealers,"" Trump said in a statement read by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. ""We are going to give a one month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,"" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.After the Trump administration announced one month exemption, the stocks surged on Wednesday during a turbulent trading session, NBC News reported.The S&P 500 index rose by 1.1%, whilst the technology-focused Nasdaq advanced 1.5%.

Elon Musk meets Republican senators to explore turning DOGE budget cuts into law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-meets-republican-senators-to-explore-turning-doge-budget-cuts-into-law/articleshow/118747805.cms,"Elon Musk leaves after meeting with Senate Republicans, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, March 5, 2025. (AP Photo )

Billionaire Elon Musk visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday for a meeting with Republican senators , where he was introduced to budget rescissions—an obscure legislative tool that could help formalise his aggressive federal budget-cutting efforts. The meeting took place just hours after the Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration’s attempt to freeze $2 billion in foreign aid funds.During the lunch gathering, senators explained how the White House could package the billions in savings Musk has identified into a budget rescissions proposal and send it to Congress for a vote. The idea appeared to excite Musk.""He was so happy,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee . ""He didn't know.""The discussion marked a potential next step for Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, as Republicans look to solidify the spending cuts and counter legal challenges. The Trump administration is currently battling in courts and public opinion over its cost-cutting measures, which have led to mass layoffs of federal workers.Republicans are eager to frame DOGE's actions as more than just widespread job losses, instead portraying them as an effort to curb waste, fraud, and inefficiency in government spending. The administration is also seeking ways to navigate legal hurdles, as courts have shown skepticism toward its budget-cutting methods.Despite enthusiasm for budget reductions, some senators acknowledged concerns over how the cuts are being implemented. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., noted that lawmakers are looking for ""just better communication, wanting to know what's going to happen next."" However, he admitted that even the White House might not have clear answers, adding, ""I don't know that anyone at the White House knows what's going to happen next.""Senate Majority Leader John Thune joked that Musk may have underestimated the flood of inquiries from lawmakers after sharing his personal cellphone number. ""I thought, OK, his phone's going to start blowing up,"" Thune said on Fox News. ""He might want to change his number."" To manage communication, Musk aide Katie Miller is expected to set up a direct line for senators to raise questions about the cuts.Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky., was the one to introduce the idea of rescissions during the meeting, emphasizing the need for a formalized approach to make the budget cuts permanent.""I love what Elon is doing. I love the cutting into waste. I love finding all the crazy crap that we're spending overseas,"" Paul said. ""But to make it real, to make it go beyond the moment of the day, it needs to come back in the form of a rescission package.""Paul, a staunch fiscal conservative, suggested multiple rescission packages totaling at least $100 billion in federal cuts. He also advised Musk to abandon the administration’s approach of using impoundments to withhold funds, given the Supreme Court’s recent ruling. ""My message to Elon was, let's get over the impoundment idea and let's send it back as a rescission.""While rescission packages could pass the Senate with a simple majority vote, bypassing a Democratic filibuster, the process faces political obstacles. Senators on the Appropriations Committee may resist cuts that override previously approved funding, and lawmakers representing key constituencies may push to protect federal programs tied to their home states. Even within the Republican Party, achieving unity on such votes could prove difficult.Despite these challenges, Graham framed the initiative as a way for the White House to regain control of the budget debate. ""We're losing altitude,"" he said. ""We need to get back in the game, on offense, and the way you can regain altitude is to take the work product—get away from the personalities and the drama—take the work product and vote on it.""Notably absent from much of the discussion was the impact of DOGE’s cuts on federal workers who have lost their jobs. Paul acknowledged the difficulty of transitions but emphasized that the focus should be on eliminating waste.""Any time there's a transition, it's difficult,"" he said. However, he added that some lawmakers raised concerns to ensure ""we're not just getting rid of people that we actually need, and that we are not overdoing it.""Musk has previously estimated that DOGE could generate $1 trillion in savings for the federal government this year alone. While the path to turning those cuts into law remains uncertain, Tuesday’s meeting signaled an important step in the effort to formalize his budget-slashing agenda.","Billionaire elon musk met with republican senators on tuesday.

President Donald Trump issued a ""last warning"" to Hamas on Wednesday, demanding the immediate release of all hostages still held in Gaza.In a post on X, Trump described the situation as urgent, saying that Hamas should not delay the release of the hostages or the bodies of those killed. He condemned their actions, calling them ""sick and twisted"" for holding on to the bodies of victims.""To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are dead! Make a smart decision. Release the hostages now, or there will be hell to pay later! "" he wrote.This message came shortly after Trump met with eight former hostages at the White House.In the statement, Trump made it clear that he was sending Israel all the support it needed to “finish the job,” referring to the ongoing conflict with Hamas. ""I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say,"" he wrote.His remarks followed confirmation from the White House that US officials had engaged in direct talks with Hamas representatives, breaking with the long-standing US policy of not negotiating with the group. These talks, which took place in Qatar, are the first known direct engagement between the US and Hamas since the group was designated a foreign terrorist organisation in 1997.According to Associated Press, the White House has not disclosed the details of the discussions but emphasised that the US is working in the best interest of its people. Israeli officials were reportedly consulted, and their position on the talks has been made clear.Israeli officials report that approximately 24 hostages, including American citizen Edan Alexander, are still alive in Gaza, while the bodies of at least 35 others are also believed to be held there.Trump's envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, led the talks. He is known for his role in the Abraham Accords, which aimed to strengthen Israel’s ties with Arab nations.","President donald trump issued a ""last warning"" to hamas on wednesday.

"Trump administration plans to cut 80,000 Veterans Affairs jobs, Democrats call it a ‘shameful betrayal’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-plans-to-cut-80000-veterans-affairs-jobs-democrats-call-it-a-shameful-betrayal/articleshow/118746524.cms,"AP photo

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is planning a large-scale restructuring, which includes cutting more than 80,000 jobs, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press.The plan, set for implementation in August, aims to bring the agency’s workforce back to 2019 levels.Christopher Syrek, the VA’s chief of staff, instructed agency officials to prepare for the changes, saying that the reorganisation will “resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure.”The initiative is part of a broader government downsizing effort led by the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk.Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins defended the move and said, “This administration is finally going to give veterans what they want. President Trump has a mandate for generational change in Washington, and that’s exactly what we’re going to deliver at the VA.” He assured that the cuts would not impact healthcare or benefits, but many veterans remain skeptical.The VA, which serves over 9 million veterans, has been growing in recent years due to expansions under the Biden administration and the 2022 PACT Act, which provides healthcare to those affected by toxic burn pits.The plan has sparked strong reactions in Congress. Republican lawmakers have expressed concern over the lack of communication from the VA, with Senator Lindsey Graham calling it “political malpractice not to consult Congress.” Democratic leaders, including Senator Richard Blumenthal , have condemned the move as a betrayal of veterans, arguing that it prioritises cost-cutting over essential services.","Department of veterans affairs (va) is planning a large-scale restructuring.

Trump declares English as US official language—What it means for Indian professionals and students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-declares-english-as-us-national-languagewhat-it-means-for-india/articleshow/118712955.cms,"File photo

How this benefits Indians

Potential challenges for some

What this means for Indian students and professionals

Easier adaptation: Indians, already proficient in English, will find it easier to navigate education and work environments in the US.

Stronger job prospects: Employers may favor fluent English speakers, further boosting India’s standing in skilled migration.

Potential reduction in services: Multilingual support in legal, healthcare, and administrative areas may decrease, impacting those with limited English skills.

The United States has officially declared English as its official language, a move that could have significant implications for Indian professionals and students. President Donald Trump signed the executive order on March 1, 2025, making English the sole official language of the country.While the US has long functioned primarily in English, this marks the first time the language has been given official status.“It is long past time that English is declared as the official language of the United States,” Trump said while announcing the decision. The order allows government agencies and federally funded organizations to decide whether to provide documents and services in languages other than English. It also reverses a 2000 policy by former President Bill Clinton that required federal bodies to offer language assistance to non-English speakers.Immigration experts believe the order could be advantageous for Indian professionals and students, who generally have a stronger command of English compared to many other immigrant groups. With English proficiency being a key factor in securing jobs and university admissions in the US, Indian applicants may find themselves at an advantage.The move is expected to make it easier for Indians to integrate into American education and work environments. Since top US universities already require English proficiency tests, Indian students and professionals are likely to adapt more seamlessly than those from non-English-speaking countries.The policy could also strengthen India's position in global mobility. Given that Indian professionals are already valued for their English skills, this order may further reinforce their competitiveness in the US job market.While many Indians stand to benefit, some could face hurdles if language assistance services are reduced. Even skilled Indian workers rely on multilingual support for legal and administrative matters. If translation services are cut back, it could create obstacles, experts noted.Additionally, immigration experts warn that employers may prioritize candidates with stronger English skills, potentially disadvantaging those from India’s non-English-speaking regions. The policy could also limit the accessibility of services for Indian immigrants who rely on assistance in regional languages.The executive order emphasizes that “Speaking English not only opens doors economically but helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and contribute to society.” For India, this shift may solidify its position as a key supplier of skilled professionals to the US. However, for those less proficient in English, navigating the system could be more challenging.","The united states has officially declared english as its official language.
