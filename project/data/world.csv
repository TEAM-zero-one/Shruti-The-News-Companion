Hafiz plotting India attacks using Bangladesh as launchpad: Intel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hafiz-plotting-india-attacks-using-bangladesh-as-launchpad-intel/articleshow/125212841.cms,"Hafiz Saeed

NEW DELHI: Alarming new intelligence suggests that Pakistan-based terrorists, led by designated global terrorist Hafiz Saeed, are actively plotting to open new fronts for attacks on India, with Bangladesh being cultivated as a new launchpad.The revelation comes directly from a video recording of a rally held in Khairpur Tamewali, Pakistan, on Oct 30, where senior LeT commander Saifullah Saif made a dangerous disclosure. Saifullah explicitly said that “Hafiz Saeed was not sitting idle; he was preparing to attack India through Bangladesh”.He claimed that Laskar-e-Taiba operatives were already active in “East Pakistan (ie Bangladesh)” and were prepared to “answer India (for Operation Sindoor)”.Further information indicates that Saeed has dispatched a close associate to Bangladesh to radicalise local youth under the pretext of ‘jihad’ and provide them with terrorist training.The video also shows Saif openly instigating people to wage war against India. Disturbingly, the event was attended by children, clearly demonstrating that terrorist organisations are attempting to exploit and indoctrinate minors for the purpose of ‘jihad’ against India.The inflammatory rhetoric and visible presence of children highlight the profound threat of radicalisation being orchestrated from Pakistani soil.Adding a geopolitical dimension to his dangerous claims, Saif also falsely praised the Pakistani military, mentioning an alleged response after what he termed “India’s Operation Sindoor” on the night of May 9-10.He further claimed a shift in international alignments, saying, “Now, America is with us, and Bangladesh is also getting closer to Pakistan again.” These claims of shifting alliances appeared intended to boost morale among the attendees while confirming the concerted efforts by LeT to activate and utilise a new operational theatre right on India’s eastern border.Security agencies are now on alert regarding this new, complex threat emanating from the Bangladesh-Pakistan nexus, sources said. Surveillance has been intensified on infiltration from Bangladesh.","Revelation comes directly from a video recording of a rally held in khairpur tamewali, pakistan, on oct 30.

From Terror To Progress: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Signals End Of Left-Wing Extremism In India

DHAKA: Bangladesh on Sunday sharply reacted to defence minister Rajnath Singh ’s remarks accusing chief adviser Muhammad Yunus of making provocative statements, saying they were “incorrect” and “not respectful of propriety and diplomatic nicety”.During an interview, Singh was asked about Yunus’s recent “provocative statements” and gifting a book to a senior Pakistani military official that showed “some areas of northeast India as part of Bangladesh”. “It is very unfortunate. He should be careful. As far as neighbours are concerned, we want to maintain ties. We do not seek tense relations with our neighbours,” Singh had said.Bangladesh foreign ministry spokesperson S M Mahbubul Alam told reporters, “We consider Singh’s comments incorrect and unhelpful and not respectful of propriety and diplomatic nicety.” He added, “Bangladesh also believes that differences in perspectives are best addressed through constructive and respectful engagement.”Hardliners here have been claiming that chunks of India’s northeastern states and West Bengal are parts of Bangladesh and have justified the illegal migration of Bangladeshis there. Yunus, who gifted the coffee table book to Pakistan joint chiefs of staff committee chairman General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, had earlier this year pitched for the “extension of the Chinese economy to encompass India’s northeast”.",Rajnath singh accused chief adviser muhammad yunus of making provocative statements.

Experts: Deaths due to chronic diseases can be prevented,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-deaths-due-to-chronic-diseases-can-be-prevented/articleshow/125211894.cms,".

Chronic diseases account for nearly three-fourths of all global deaths. Experts say many of these deaths can be prevented, with lifestyle changes, timely diagnosis and management, and in many cases, preventive vaccination.While childhood vaccination has increased significantly, experts say, there are still few takers for adult vaccination.According to Lauriane Harrington, medical director, global medical affairs of GSK - one of the world's leading biopharma companies - vaccines are available to prevent diseases like influenza, RSV, shingles and pneumococcal pneumonia but their uptake is low.RSV or Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a common respiratory virus that typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms. However, Harrington said, it can lead to serious lung infections, especially in infants and older adults, whereas shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful condition caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus - the same virus that causes chickenpox.""Prevention is the best investment - for people, health systems, societies, and economies,"" Kristina Ostertag, head of global communications and govt affairs, commercial vaccines at GSK, added.She was speaking at GSK's Global Media Days at Wavre site in Belgium.""Vaccination is one of the most effective tools we have to protect older adults, yet adult immunisation remains under-prioritised,"" Otavio Cintra, regional medical affairs Lead at GSK, said.He added that govts and health systems needed to integrate adult vaccination into broader public health strategies. GSK, he said, is also investing in next-generation vaccine technologies, including mRNA and MAPS platforms, to address evolving health threats.","Chronic diseases account for nearly three-fourths of all global deaths.

Hundreds of cops resign ahead of Zohran Mamdani’s term in NYC: ‘How do you work for a mayor who wants to defund police?’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hundreds-of-cops-resign-ahead-of-zohran-mamdanis-term-in-nyc-how-do-you-work-for-a-mayor-who-wants-to-defund-police/articleshow/125193007.cms,"‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED

Workforce in numbers







New York City police officers are leaving the force in growing numbers, with morale sinking ahead of socialist Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral inauguration, according to the New York Post.NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year, according to Police Pension Fund data.“Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro. “You have a person who is supposed to be running New York City that does not believe in law enforcement. What’s coming out of everyone’s mouth is, ‘We’re in trouble.’”The Police Benevolent Association warned that attrition could worsen. “Every single month, we’re losing enough cops to staff an entire precinct,” PBA President Patrick Hendry said. “It will certainly get worse if our city leaders don’t work with us to fix our unsustainable workload, our expired contract and the constant second-guessing that is driving good cops away from the job.”New hires have helped cover up some losses. The NYPD has recruited 2,911 new officers this year, the highest in a single year since 2006, with the next class scheduled for December. The department currently has 33,745 uniformed officers, down slightly from 33,812 in 2024. Peak staffing was 40,285 in 2000, according to Independent Budget Office data.Concerns are mounting that Mamdani’s proposed reforms could further strain the force. The mayor-elect wants to create a Department of Community Safety to dispatch mental health professionals to crisis calls and shift disciplinary power to the Civilian Complaint Review Board.“How’s that going to work when the person pulls out a gun or a knife?” a Bronx cop asked.Former and current officers voiced frustration at Mamdani’s past comments calling cops racist and homophobic. “How do you work for somebody who considers you racist and anti-queer and wants to defund the police? Things are hard enough already. If you’re eligible to leave, why would you want to stay in that situation?” said a retired officer.A police union consultant warned recruitment could become increasingly difficult. “Nobody wants to be a New York City cop. It’s not worth the money, the stress, the danger, especially working for a mayor who wants to take the department apart,” the source told the New York Post.","Nypd figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in october, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year.

""We will announce the start date for the DV-2027 registration period as soon as practicable, as well as the date that DV-2027 selection results may become available through the Entry Status Check (ESC).

We are aware of reports of fraudulent claims that DV-2027 entry is open and of individuals and services falsely claiming they can increase your chances of selection. This is not true.

Applicants must meet statutory eligibility requirements, including a high school education or two years of qualifying work experience, among other criteria.The DV Program’s 2026 cycle excluded applicants from the following countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China (mainland and Hong Kong), Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Venezuela and Vietnam.",Us state department said they will announce the changes to green card lottery 2027 and the registration has not yet begun.

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

: Foreign nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States could now be denied visas and green cards based on pre-existing chronic health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, under new guidance issued by the Trump administration.The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.A cable sent by the State Department to visa officers instructs them to flag applicants whose medical conditions could require ""hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care."" The list of conditions cited includes, but is not limited to cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases; cancers; diabetes; metabolic diseases; neurological diseases; and mental health conditions.The guidance also specifically advises officers to consider conditions like obesity, noting that it can lead to costly complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure. All these chronic illnesses are now being assessed as potential indicators that an individual might become a future financial burden on the United States.The policy shift, revealed on Thursday, is one of the most aggressive moves in the administration’s broader immigration crackdown, effectively linking an applicant’s health status to their eligibility for entry.It was not immediately clear if the directive applies to tourist and student visas. While it technically applies to all visa applicants, including those seeking non-immigrant visas for tourism (B-1/B-2) and studies (F1), it is expected to be primarily used for those seeking to permanently reside in the US.As things stand, tourist visa applicants are required to demonstrate they have sufficient financial means for their trip; they intend to leave the US at the end of their authorized stay; and they will not become a ""public charge"" during their temporary visit.At the heart of the new guidance is a stricter interpretation of the ""public charge"" rule—a century-old immigration provision designed to exclude those likely to become primarily dependent on government assistance. While health screenings have always been part of the visa process, traditionally focusing on communicable diseases like tuberculosis, the new directive vastly expands the list of conditions to be considered.Immigration advocates warn that the new rules grant consular officers, who lack medical expertise, sweeping authority to make subjective judgments about an applicant's long-term health since no one is expected to disclose their ailments in visa applications.Also read: Getting US visa could soon be harder for many – Who's affected? Under the new framework, visa officers are explicitly instructed to determine whether applicants have the financial resources to cover the costs of such long-term medical care ""over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.""Immigration experts contend that this policy will dramatically reduce legal immigration for older applicants and those with common chronic illnesses. Effectively, the policy will favor the wealthiest and healthiest applicants.","The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the state department on to us embassies and consular offices worldwide.

AHMEDABAD: A 35-year-old Hyderabad doctor arrested in Gujarat with drone-smuggled weapons from Pakistan and materials to produce the deadly toxin ricin was identified Sunday as the central figure in an IS-sponsored terrorist plot to strike multiple Indian cities.Two other suspects in the conspiracy, a tailor from Uttar Pradesh's Shamli and a student from Lakhimpur Kheri, were traced to Banaskantha.Gujarat Police's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) caught Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed on Nov 8 with two Glock pistols, a Beretta, 30 live cartridges and 4 kg of castor-bean mash, from which ricin is extracted.He was on the move when investigators intercepted his silver hatchback at Adalaj toll plaza on Ahmedabad-Mehsana Road.Saiyed's call records led to the arrest of UP natives Azad Suleman Sheikh, 20, and Mohammad Suhail Mohammad Saleem Khan, 23. Both had been allegedly supplying firearms and cartridges to the doctor, who has an MBBS from China, officials said.Ricin is a highly toxic poison derived from castor beans after the oil has been extracted. The substance has no known antidote if ingested, inhaled or injected. Castor oil, which is used for skincare and in various commercial products, does not contain the toxin.ATS officers said Saiyed had been in contact with Abu Khadija, an Afghanistan-based operative linked to Islamic State-Khorasan Province. The doctor had been allegedly producing ricin in large quantities, possibly for mass poisoning, he said.The suspect conducted reconnaissance of unspecified security-sensitive sites in Lucknow, Delhi and Ahmedabad. The weapons came from Hanumangarh in Rajasthan. Saiyed and the other arrested men told interrogators that their handler used drones from Pakistan to deliver arms across the border.Deputy SP SL Chaudhary led the operation to bust the module based on initial intelligence about Saiyed's movements in Ahmedabad.An FIR was registered at the ATS police station against all three arrested men and Abu Khadija, who is on the run, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Arms Act. A local court gave ATS custody of Saiyed until Nov 17. The other two suspects will be produced in court separately. ATS officials said investigations were continuing to identify and arrest other operatives involved in the conspiracy.","Gujarat police's anti-terrorism squad caught ahmed mohiyuddin saiyed on nov 8 with two glock pistols, a beretta, 30 live cartridges and 4 kg of castor-bean mash.

NEW DELHI: The Quad leaders’ summit to be hosted by India may no longer be taking place this year but navies of the four countries are all set to kick off their top-notch Malabar exercise off Guam in the western Pacific Ocean from Monday.Indian guided-missile stealth frigate INS Sahyadri has now joined the American Aegis guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald, Australian Anzac-class frigate HMAS Ballarat and Japanese helicopter destroyer JS Hyuga at Guam, a strategic US military base, for the intense combat manoeuvres from Nov 10 to 18.The `Cope India’ air combat exercise between India and the US that was slated in Gwalior from Monday, with Japan and Australia as observers, however, has been deferred as of now. The US was supposed to deploy F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighters and B-1 Lancer supersonic heavy bombers for the exercise. Instead, it has sent a solitary B-1 aircraft for “bomber integration sorties” with the IAF.On the maritime front, it will be the 29th edition of the Malabar exercise, which began as a bilateral endeavour between India and the US in 1992 but includes all the Quad countries now.“INS Sahyadri’s participation in the Malabar exercise reaffirms India's enduring partnership and its commitment to strengthening coordination, enhancing interoperability, and demonstrating a collective resolve to safeguard regional security,” the Indian Navy said on Sunday.The exercise, however, comes amid the Trump administration indicating that his country’s long-standing Indo-Pacific strategy to counter an aggressive and expansionist China is no longer a top priority.India, Australia and Japan, however, remain extremely concerned about China’s continuing `Grey Zone’ tactics to push its vexatious territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific, be it against its neighbours in the South and East China Seas or the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with India.Though India and the US inked an expansive new 10-year defence framework on Oct 31, overall bilateral ties have been in atailspin since President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on New Delhi,including 25% over its purchase of Russian oil, earlier this year.India, however, decided to go ahead with the Malabar exercise in the belief that the bilateral strategic partnership with the US built over the last two decades, with defence cooperation being its cornerstone, was in no danger of unravelling, as was first reported by TOI.Parallelly, India is cranking up its defence ties with the other Quad countries, Australia and Japan, as well as other regional players like South Korea and the Philippines, all of whom are deeply concerned about China’s muscle-flexing in the Indo-Pacific.The `harbour phase’ of the Malabar on Nov 10-12 will feature operational planning and discussions, alignment on communication protocols, familiarisation visits between participating nations, and sports fixtures, the Navy said.The `sea phase’ from Nov 13 to 17, in turn, will see the warships and aircraft taking part in drills focusing on joint fleet operations, anti-submarine warfare, gunnery serials and flying operations, it added.",The quad leaders’ summit to be hosted by india may no longer be taking place this year.

Every Indian Shares Ancestral Roots, No ‘Ahindu’ Exists: Mohan Bhagwat

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said the Sangh welcomes people from all faiths, including Muslims and Christians, as long as they see themselves as sons of Bharat Mata and part of the broader Hindu society.Speaking at a two-day lecture series titled ""100 Years of Sangh Journey: New Horizons"" in Bengaluru, Bhagwat clarified that the RSS does not divide its members by caste or religion and that its approach is rooted in unity and a shared national identity.Asked whether Muslims are allowed to join the RSS, Bhagwat said, ""No Brahmin is allowed in Sangh. No other caste is allowed in the Sangh. No Muslim is allowed, no Christian is allowed in the Sangha. Only Hindus are allowed. So people with different denominations, Muslims, Christians, any denomination, can come to the Sangha but keep your separateness out.""He explained that the Sangh works on the principle of inclusivity, saying, ""Muslims come to Shakha, Christians come to Shakha, as all other castes from the routinely called Hindu society, they also come to Shakha. But we don't take their count, and we don't ask who they are.We are all sons of Bharat Mata. That is how Sangha works.""Bhagwat also defended the organisation’s legal standing, saying, ""Sangha started in 1925. Do you expect us to register with the British government? Against whom?... We were banned thrice. So, the government has recognised. If we were not there, who would they ban? And each time courts resolved the ban, they dismissed the ban and made RSS a legal organisation."" He added, ""Legally, factually, we are an organisation. We are not unconstitutional. We are within that constitution. So we need not register. Many things are there which are not registered. Even Hindu Dharma is not registered.""Outlining the Sangh’s broader vision, Bhagwat said its mission is to unite and empower Hindu society to build a strong and prosperous India capable of guiding the world through the principles of Dharma. ""We want to unite, organise, impart qualities to the entire Hindu society so that they will create a prosperous and strong Bharat which will impart the Dharma knowledge to the world. Our mission, our vision is an organised, strong Hindu society,"" he said.He also reaffirmed the Sangh’s respect for the national flag, saying, “Since its creation, Sangha has always stood by, respected, offered tributes and protected this Tiranga Dhwaj... There is no question of Bhagwa vis-a-vis Bhagwa and Tiranga.”","Mohan bhagwat: sangh welcomes people from all faiths, including muslims and christians.

NEW DELHI: India has seen its highest foreign tourist arrival (FTA) growth in percentage terms from Somalia between pre-Covid 2019 and 2024. At over 144%, the poor east African country is the only one to register a triple digit growth rate, surging from 5,044 in 2019 to 12,320 in 2024, according to Union tourism ministry data.Besides this surprise entry, the other countries in the top five by growth rate are Cambodia (81%), Kazakhstan (72%), Vietnam (61%) and Bhutan (47%). Somalia's growth rate would have been higher had it not seen its tourists dip from 16,607 in 2023 to 12,320 in 2024.India had 99.5 lakh FTAs in CY (calendar year) 2024, less than the pre-Covid all-time high of almost 1.1 crore. The travel industry expects to breach pre-Covid numbers either this year or latest by early next year with ""continued focus on visas, infrastructure, and global promotion"", according to Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) president Ravi Gosain.""India's inbound tourism is witnessing a better rebound this season. Most of our member operators are reporting 10%-15% higher arrivals than last year, driven by renewed interest from North America, Europe, West Asia and Southeast Asia. The encouraging part is the quality of travel with longer stays, higher per-capita spending, and growing preference for experiential and sustainable tourism products,"" Gosain said.Preliminary data and trade feedback indicate that CY 2025 could see 1-1.05 crore FTS compared to 1.09 crore in 2019. With ""continued policy support, especially easier e-visas and India's global positioning, we are on track to surpass 2019 inbound volume by 2026,"" Gosain added.While India is slowly inching up to pre-pandemic levels, the ministry data show FTA recovery is different across regions. Only the Americas (US and Canada) have surpassed 2019 levels.""Asia and the Pacific remained the largest source region, accounting for 43% of total FTAs in 2024 (42.8 lakh arrivals), according to the data. However, this represents a 22.6% decline from 2019, mainly due to continued decline from South Asia (minus 28.6%) and North-East Asia (minus 49.4%). Oceania surpassed its 2019 level by 38.2%, reflecting strong recovery led by countries like Australia and New Zealand, the ministry said.Europe contributed 26.7% to FTAs in 2024 (26.6 lakh) and was just 3.2% lower than 2019 levels. The Americas showed impressive recovery and growth with 23.7 lakh arrivals in 2024. The region recorded a 20.8% growth over 2019 and constituted 23.8% of total FTAs, the ministry said.Africa accounted for 3.4% of FTAs in 2024, with near-complete recovery to 2019 levels. West Asia, contributing 2.97% to India's FTAs in 2024, witnessed a decline of 14.1% over 2019, the ministry said.","India has seen its highest foreign tourist arrival (fta) growth in percentage terms from somalia.

United States President Donald Trump on Thursday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he may travel to India next year as the two countries continue discussions on trade.Speaking to reporters at the White House after announcing a move to reduce the prices of weight loss drugs, Trump said his conversations with PM Modi were progressing smoothly. He also reiterated his personal rapport with the prime minister.""He (PM Modi) largely stopped buying from Russia. And he is a friend of mine, and we speak. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a great man. He is a friend of mine, and we speak and he wants me to go there. We will figure that out, I will go... Prime Minister Modi is a great man and I will be going,"" Trump said.When asked if he planned to visit India next year, Trump responded, ""It could be, yes.""The statement comes while trade talks continue between New Delhi and Washington after the United States imposed a 50 per cent tariff, including an additional 25 per cent duty, over India's purchase of Russian oil.Earlier on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""The President is positive and feels very strongly about the India-US relationship.A few weeks ago, he spoke to the Prime Minister directly when he celebrated Diwali in the Oval Office with many high-ranking Indian-American officials here at the White House.""Her comments followed Trump’s recent claim that India reduced its import of Russian oil. During his Asia tour, he said New Delhi was ""very good"" on the issue and that Prime Minister Modi assured him India would reduce or stop crude imports from Moscow.Earlier this month, ministry of external affairs (MEA) issued a response to Trump's comments, reiterating that the country's energy sourcing decisions are based on national interests and consumer welfare.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""India is a significant importer of oil and gas. It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.""","Donald trump calls pm modi a 'great friend', says india visit 'could be' next year amid talks on trade.

Klay Thompson apologizes to Megan Thee Stallion after airport mishap





Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson





Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions. Their recent viral moment only serves to extend a genuine connection between two stars from different worlds. The duo has been very active on social media to share their personal moments of joy and love. Megan has over 32.7 million followers on Instagram, while Thomson has 16.8 million fans on the platform.Stallion is fully embracing her lover girl era — and fans are loving it.

"Gisele Bündchen implied that prioritizing Tom Brady for years took a personal toll: “When you love someone, you don’t put them in jail”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-implied-that-prioritizing-tom-brady-for-years-took-a-personal-toll-when-you-love-someone-you-dont-put-them-in-jail/articleshow/125033119.cms,"Supermodel Gisele Bündchen, in a candid interview, shared insights into her marriage with Tom Brady, describing their split as a 'death and rebirth.' She detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success. Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter.

The shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building..Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed.Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining what a chapter ends and a new one begins.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?",Supermodel gisele bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former nfl quarterback tom brady.

Ben Shapiro accuses Candace Owens of serious claims about Erika Kirk





New leaked text messages between Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens have shocked many online. The screenshots, posted by AF Post on X, show that before his death, Kirk believed Ben Shapiro was trying to “kill” both his and Owens’ careers as they got more famous. In the messages, Candace Owens sent Charlie Kirk an article titled “LEAK: Ben Shapiro’s YAF Launches Smear Campaign Against Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens – DANGEROUS.”Charlie Kirk replied with a laugh, then said Owens had become “bigger than Ben,” and that Shapiro wanted her to “punch down to him.” In another text, Kirk told Owens, “He views you as my slave. 100%. ‘Control her’ is what he was really saying when he called.” The texts do not show any date or time, so it’s unclear when the conversation took place. The messages were shared by AF Post, but their authenticity hasn’t been confirmed by any official source.While these leaked texts spread online, Ben Shapiro spoke about Candace Owens on The Megyn Kelly Show. During his talk, Shapiro said Owens had done “vile” things and that Kelly should have called her out. He then said, “If this were on the Left, and somebody was accusing Charlie Kirk’s wife of having murdered him, I assume you’d be talking about it.”When Kelly asked if Candace Owens had really accused Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow, of killing her husband, Shapiro replied, “She’s accusing TPUSA insiders and other members of the right wing, including Seth Dillon, of being involved in the murder of Charlie Kirk.”Owens quickly reacted on X, posting Ben Shapiro’s clip and calling him a liar. She wrote that he was “lying through his teeth” and called him “completely deranged.” Candace Owens said Shapiro was trying to pressure Kelly into speaking badly about her using false claims.After Ben Shapiro’s comments, Erika Kirk appeared on Fox News with Jesse Watters and spoke about the rumors. She said people should “pray and think” before posting things online about her late husband because it could hurt their kids in the future.Also Read: YouTuber Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro After He Claims She Accused Erika Kirk Of Killing Charlie Kirk Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was shot dead on September 10, 2025.

How Trump reacted?

Thune says 'the deal is coming together'



What is in the deal?



What would be next step if vote succeeds





US senators on Sunday reached an agreement to reopen the government after 40 days, signaling an end to the lengthy shutdown.A group of at least eight Senate Democrats, in consultation with Senate GOP leaders and the White House, reportedly reached a deal on Sunday to end the 40-day US government shutdown in exchange for a future vote on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.The Senate is expected to vote on the proposal between 8:30 and 9 pm ET (7:30 am IST Monday).President Donald Trump, who arrived at the White House from the Commander’s game, told reporters that the shutdown will end soon.""Looks like we're getting very close to the shutdown. We'll never agree to give any substantial money or any money to really prisoners, illegals that come into our country,"" Trump said."" And I think the Democrats understand that. And it looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending. You'll know very soon,"" he added.Senate Republican Leader John Thune said a test vote was “coming together” as he prepared to put forward a narrow spending package. He cautioned, “We’ll see kind of where the votes are. This kind of stuff can drag on indefinitely if you allow it to.” He told reporters earlier that the chamber planned to vote on the House-passed funding measure to reopen the govt, along with a handful of year-long funding bills.The procedural motion has fallen short of the 60-vote threshold 14 times.According to CNN and CBS News, the deal was led by Sens Angus King of Maine, and Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, in coordination with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House.Under its terms, the Senate would vote on a Democrats’ bill concerning the Affordable Care Act by the end of the second week of December. The agreement also calls for the reversal of all shutdown-related layoff notices and extends the stopgap funding measure through January, among other provisions.Meanwhile, NBC news reported that the agreement contains a package of bills, known as a “minibus” — three full-year appropriations bills that will fund certain departments like Agriculture through the end of the fiscal year next fall — and a continuing resolution to fund the rest of the govt at existing spending levels through January 30.It also fully funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as food stamps, through next September, a major flashpoint in the shutdown, according to sources. The sources said the deal also reverses Trump’s attempted layoffs of federal workers during the shutdown through RIFs, or “reduction in force” notifications.As per NBC, in a major concession from Democrats, it does not include an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Allowing the funds to lapse would raise insurance premiums for millions of Americans unless they are extended. Instead, the Democrats settled for a promise that the Senate will vote on a bill to extend the subsidies by the end of the second week of December, with the outcome uncertain, two of the sources said.Even if Sunday’s vote succeeds, the shutdown may not end immediately. House Democrats would need to approve the package, and their support was not assured. The Associated Press reported that necessary Democratic backing remained uncertain, in part because many Democrats continue to demand a one-year extension of the ‘Obamacare’ subsidies for low-income Americans in return for reopening the govt.Republicans need only five Democratic votes to clear the Senate threshold, and around 10 to 12 Democrats have been involved in the talks. Critics within their ranks have said the emerging deal falls short. If the Senate passes the amended package, it must still clear the House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump, a process that could take several days.","Us senators on sunday reached an agreement to reopen the government after 40 days, signaling an end to the lengthy shutdown.

'You Dispute, But...': Justice Alito Grills Dem Attorney On Trump Emergency Powers In Tariffs Case

How to get the tariff dividend? Who will get it?







President Donald Trump Sunday again promised tariff dividend to Americans which will possibly be a payout to every American straight from the money America will be raising from its tariffs. This is not the first time that Trump floated the idea but this time he specified the amount and also spelt out the condition that high-income people will not get it. “A dividend of at $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” the president said on his Truth Social platform. He added that those against the tariffs are “FOOLS!”Such a proposal would likely need to be passed by Congress. This summer, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) introduced legislation to give $600 tariff rebates to nearly all Americans and their dependent children.""We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place,"" Trump posted.The doubling down on tariffs from the President came as the Supreme Court, earlier this week, heard arguments on tariffs, whether they were legally imposed.Judges were concerned that tariffs acted as a revenue-raising tax as opposed to a mechanism to solve any emergency caused by a trade imbalance. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the tariff case.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday, said the tariffs were not about ""taking in the revenue,"" but rather were intended to re-balance trade.This is the first time that Trump specified the amount of $2000 as a tariff dividend. Earlier, he suggested that Americans may get an amount between $1000 and $2000 as the dividend. It is not yet clear how the administration will give it.The proposal sounds like stimulus checks, which are direct payments from the government to taxpayers during an economic slowdown to encourage taxpayers to spend money.Though most of the details are unclear, one clarity that Trump's Truth Social post offered was that high-income people would not receive it.","Trump said every american, excluding high-income people, will get $2k as tariff dividend.

Sam Reinhart’s heartwarming journey from lockdown romance to wedding bells

How Jessica Reinhart built her own path outside the NHL spotlight

Sam Reinhart’s net worth

When you catch a glimpse of Sam Reinhart taking his ice skating to perfection, cool even when facing the hardest situations and getting the most important goals, you can easily forget that there is a completely different side of him—a side that has been formed through love, patience, and slowly but surely winning struggles off the rink. The Florida Panthers’ hero during the Stanley Cup may be the one who will always be in the news of the NHL for his performances, but at home, he is just Jessica’s husband—and they have created together a life that is as harmonious as his gaming style.Hockey is the sport that makes Sam Reinhart famous on ice, but his story away from the rink is about family ties, silent strength, and everlasting love. From being a child in a hockey dynasty to becoming the man who brought Florida its first-ever Stanley Cup, Reinhart’s journey is characterized by both elegance and toughness. His calmness and unyielding drive resemble the life he is living off the rink—firmly rooted, unpretentious, and motivated by a clear sense of direction.Every athlete has such a base, and for Sam, it is his wife Jessica Reinhart. Their love story began in January 2020 when the world was in lockdown (COVID-19 ). The short visit for two weeks turned into eight months of living together. Jessica even joked in an interview that “I ended up moving in with Sam’s family for two weeks, which turned into eight months!”The time spent together was not expected at all, and it was what made their love stronger.On December 25, 2021, Sam popped the question on a Christmas Eve— this was a moment right out of a Hallmark movie. Two years later, on July 7, 2023, they got married at the beautiful Hummingbird Nest Ranch in Santa Susana, California. The wedding was timeless, elegant, and very personal, with 150 guests, Jessica in a flowing Ines Di Santo gown, and soft white florals, much like the couple themselves.Even though the majority of the NHL wives go for the glitzy and glamorous path, Jessica’s life is quite the opposite— healthcare. She is a medical assistant in Vancouver, Canada, and also has a degree in Human Ecology from Western University— she has established her own professional image far from the spotlight. Her work experience, which includes medical clinics and brand development, has been nothing but the same focus and determination that have been the hallmark of her husband’s success on ice.In the year 2025, Sam Reinhart’s value is estimated at $69 million, which is the result of several astute contract negotiations and a stunning performance with the Florida Panthers. His recent eight-year contract, worth $69 million, which comes along with a large signing bonus, places him among the top-paid forwards in the NHL. However, despite the figures, Reinhart's lifestyle is still very simple — he divides his time between South Florida and West Vancouver, where he enjoys the offseason with Jessica and family.Sam and Jessica Reinhart’s life is not solely defined by luxury or fame; rather, it revolves around balance, thankfulness, and partnership. Whether he’s scoring the game-winning goal or she’s taking care of patients at the hospital, both are subtly demonstrating that success is sweetest when shared.More coverage on NHL","Sam reinhart is the florida panthers’ hero during the stanley cup.
