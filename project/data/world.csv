NEW DELHI: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday presented his reasoning behind extending invitation for G7 summit to PM Narendra Modi. Highlighting India's economic prowess, he said that it ""made sense"" to have the fifth largest economy at the table.""There are certain countries that should be at the table for those discussions and in my capacity as G7 chair consultation with others some others make those determinations. India is the fifth largest economy in the world, effectively the most populous country in the world central to a number of those supply chains at the heart of number of those supply chains so it makes sense.

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic turn of events, Canadian PM Mark Carney called PM Modi and invited him for the G7 summit that begins eight days from now at Kananaskis in Alberta. Modi accepted the invitation and said he was looking forward to meeting him at the summit.The announcement by Modi on X followed almost a week of suspense over his participation because of a lack of invitation, drawing barbs from the opposition about his possible exclusion from the summit. India is not a member of G7 but Modi has been invited for all summits since 2019. Modi congratulated Carney on his poll win and thanked him for the invitation.As vibrant democracies bound by deep people-to-people ties, India and Canada will work together with renewed vigour, guided by mutual respect and shared interests,"" Modi posted on X.Without elaborating, a Canadian readout said that ""importantly, there was agreement to continued law enforcement dialogue and discussions addressing security concerns"".Modi and Carney, who was sworn in as PM in March and won federal elections the next month to cement his position, have pledged to rebuild the relationship that was left tottering by former PM Justin Trudeau's allegation of India's complicity in the murder of pro-Khalistan separatist and Canadian national Hardeep Singh Nijjar.New Delhi has rejected the allegation saying Ottawa hasn't provided any evidence to back its claim.The Indian govt will hope that Canada will ensure enough security to not allow Sikh separatist groups, who had been applying pressure on Carney to not invite Modi, to disrupt the visit. India's official position remains that the main issue with Canada is the leeway provided to Khalistan backers to carry out anti-India activities. For India to engage in any serious effort to rebuild the relationship, foolproof security for the country's diplomats, along with a crackdown on extremists and secessionists who seek to hurt Indian interests, is of paramount importance.Modi had last visited Canada in 2015. While the two countries are also said to be considering reappointing high commissioners, both Canadian and Indian authorities maintain they are looking at repairing ties one step at a time. Asked about the Nijjar investigations, Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand said last week that while the rule of law will never be compromised, Canada is looking forward to continuing to build this partnership.""The two leaders discussed the longstanding relationship between Canada and India, including deep people-to-people ties and significant commercial links,'' said the Canadian readout. The summit will also see Modi coming face to face with US President Donald Trump for the first time since their bilateral meeting in Washington in February this year.This will be Modi's first visit abroad since the military conflict with Pakistan and the PM is likely to use the opportunity to highlight India's concerns about Pakistan's continued support to cross-border terrorism and India's use of force to prevent terrorist attacks.",Canadian pm mark carney called pm modi and invited him for the g7 summit.

Musk vs Trump: Did Vivek Ramaswamy 'Doge' a bullet by getting out in time?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-vs-trump-did-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-a-bullet-by-getting-out-in-time/articleshow/121664165.cms,"Trump WIPES OUT Elon Musk's $15 BILLION In Just 6 Minutes; Tesla Shares Tank, MAYHEM At Wall Street

Elon Musk EXPOSES Donald Trump-Epstein Link From 1992 Video: Mar-a-Lago Tapes Go Viral





In Washington’s latest episode of Tech Titans vs MAGA Caesar, D onald Trump has turned on Elon Musk —his former bromantic partner-in-disruption, SpaceX messiah, and self-appointed guardian of Western civilisation. The trigger? Musk labelled Trump’s much-hyped One Big Beautiful Bill “a disgusting abomination” and warned that America was hurtling toward “debt slavery. ”Trump, never one to take offence lightly—or privately—responded with a MAGA-flavoured blitzkrieg. Contracts for Musk’s companies? At risk. His reputation in conservative circles? Torched. “Just another whiny billionaire,” Trump sneered, “who forgot who made him matter.”As the Trump-Musk bromance dissolves faster than a Tesla on Autopilot in Washington traffic, one man watches the fireworks from a safe, well-lit distance—sipping Perrier, adjusting his campaign blazer, and thanking his stars he got out early, having clearly absorbed Sun Tzu’s timeless wisdom: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”—Vivek Ramaswamy.Also read: 'Disgusting abomination' to 'bombshell': Trump & Musk feud spirals; timeline of the public meltdown Once the philosophical darling of the new right, Ramaswamy was handed a shiny new toy in Trump’s second term—DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.A meme-ified federal Frankenstein, DOGE was Trump’s idea of bureaucratic reform through Silicon Valley swagger. Musk was the co-head. Vivek was the “sane one.” Together, they were meant to revolutionise Washington. Or at least yell at it until it agreed to be disrupted.But like any startup built on vibes and vague mission statements, DOGE began to implode before it launched. Musk wanted to fire half of Washington via app. Trump wanted press conferences with golden eagles and fog machines. And Vivek? Vivek quietly disappeared.Officially, he left to run for Ohio governor. Unofficially, insiders suggest he saw the writing on the Twitter wall —that DOGE was less a reform movement and more a digital kamikaze mission, powered by ego, caffeine, and libertarian hallucinations.And now, in hindsight, his exit looks less like a career pivot and more like a Sun Tzu manoeuvre. Because while Musk is now battling Trump, Congress, and his own booster-fuelled paranoia, Ramaswamy is free to reinvent himself as a centrist tech-whisperer in the Rust Belt. MAGA enough to get the base. Moderate enough to avoid the madness.Except MAGA, like any self-devouring revolution, doesn’t forget. Or forgive.Since stepping away from DOGE and softening his Trumpian rhetoric, Ramaswamy has found himself in the crosshairs of the same base that once anointed him their biotech Brahmin. Hardcore influencers have branded him a traitor. Conservative meme accounts now photoshop him next to Liz Cheney. And in the subterranean rage economy of right-wing internet culture, he's been rebranded from “America First entrepreneur” to “globalist plant with a Harvard tongue. ”Also read: Feud intensifies: Musk shares 1992 video; Trump seen with Jeffrey Epstein in clip The irony? The same mob now grilling Ramaswamy for “disloyalty” is turning on Musk for “disrespect.” In MAGAland, loyalty is a zero-sum blood sport, and the only acceptable exit is the one through public execution.DOGE, predictably, has become a political punchline. It was doomed from conception—run like a Reddit thread, branded like a crypto coin, and staffed by men who confuse spreadsheets with scripture. The only surprising thing is how quickly it crashed. Musk thought he could out-Trump Trump. But in MAGA-land, there can only be one sun god—and he’s orange, not emerald-mined.Ramaswamy, to his credit, didn’t wait around to become collateral damage. He understood what Musk didn’t: that proximity to Trump is radioactive. Stay too long and you mutate. Get out early and you might just survive.The result? Musk is in political freefall. Trump is in attack mode. And Ramaswamy? He’s in Ohio, sipping Perrier and talking about “innovation in public policy”—while ducking MAGA Twitter grenades and hoping they forget he ever existed.Call it foresight. Call it cowardice. Or just call it good political hygiene.Because as Sun Tzu said—he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.And in the dystopian sitcom that is American politics, that makes Vivek Ramaswamy the guy who ghosted the group chat before the firestorm—and lived to run another episode.","Vivek ramaswamy was the co-head of doge, the department of government efficiency.

Poll What is more important in international diplomacy? Clear and assertive communication Building strong global alliances

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday said that US vice president JD Vance understood there could be no mediation between India and Pakistan, as it would imply an equivalence between the two countries.Speaking in Washington, Tharoor, who leads Group 5 of the all-party delegation tasked with conveying India's message against terrorism abroad, said they made India’s position “very clear” to the US vice president.Tharoor said, “The meeting with VP Vance was very clear. Mediation implies an equivalence between two parties, and there can be no equivalence between terrorists and their victims. Vance fully understood our points, and so did other levels of the system.”Commenting on the Pakistani delegation also visiting the United States, Tharoor said the Americans who met the Pakistani delegation had not publicly expressed any support for the country. “We've seen some of them tweeting about their meetings. But we haven’t seen those they met say anything publicly supportive or appreciative of Pakistan,” he said.Speaking about the Pakistani delegation in the United States, Tharoor noted that the people the Pakistani delegation met in the US didn't say anything supportive of Pakistan.""We've seen some of them tweeting about their meetings. We've not seen the people they met saying anything very supportive or appreciative of Pakistan in public.""He also underlined the strength of India’s diplomatic outreach, saying the Indian team had more meetings and at a higher level. “Whether it was Senators and Congressmen on the Hill or government officials, our list of appointments was far better,” he said. “We’ve got the better of the argument.”On various statements coming from the Congress, Tharoor stressed that any internal Congress discussions would take place later. “There'll be a time for internal discussions when one gets back. I'm not anticipating anything because I've not been told anything directly. All I see is in the media, some of which is speculative. But on the whole, my view is that we are facing a situation where the country is united. And that unity was very apparent in the delegation. ""Reflecting on the five-day effort, Tharoor called the visit a success. “We had good conversations, high-level contacts, and clear outcomes. We got our message across about Pahalgam and Operation Sindoor and reaffirmed India’s relations globally.”",Congress mp shashi tharoor said us vice president jd vance understood there could be no mediation between india and pakistan.

How is India using AI as a soft power or diplomatic tool globally?



The Election Commission's 2024 AI content labelling advisories set a global benchmark for ethical AI in elections, noted by international media.

PM Modi's safe AI advocacy in G20 and bilateral talks (e.g., with US leaders) enhances India's image as a responsible tech power.

Bhashini's multilingual AI is being adapted for diaspora engagement, translating cultural content for Indian communities in the US and Gulf.

AI startups like Krutrim and Polymath Solutions, plus plans for India-specific AI models, position India as an innovation hub for the Global South.

As tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the horrific Pahalgam attack on April 22, the nation witnessed a parallel war that erupted online — one that included not drones or missiles but manipulating pixels and synthetic voices.From AI-generated clipping of a newspaper falsely praising Pakistan's air force to deepfaked video of S Jaishankar offering fake apologies, public fell prey to misinformation created with help of Artificial Intelligence.The weaponisation of AI, particularly in times of elections or war, is not just a nuisance or prank; it's a calculated effort to sway voters or influence public sentiment. Even to distort facts.India, with tech-savvy population, is suffering the threat where mass-producing propaganda takes seconds, and it is no longer hypothetical but real, present, and dangerous.The threat isn't just reserved for wartime, it is increasingly creeping into India's democratic bloodstream.A prominent politician appears on your WhatsApp feed, making inflammatory remarks about a sensitive religious issue. The video spreads like wildfire across social media, triggering outrage and potentially swaying thousands of voters. There's just one catch – the politician never actually said those words.Welcome to the age of deepfakes, where seeing is no longer believing.While Artificial Intelligence offers powerful new tools for political campaigning and even diplomatic engagement, its rapid advancement also casts a long shadow – the rise of deepfakes and the potential for widespread digital deception. The very technology that amplifies a campaign's reach can also be weaponised to manipulate the truth, posing significant ethical challenges to the integrity of information and trust within India's democratic processes.In a conversation with TOI, Devesh Singh, a political communication strategist, said deepfakes are a serious threat, undermining electoral integrity through misinformation. In 2024:""Low digital literacy (76.32% adult literacy) exacerbates vulnerability, especially in rural areas. The Election Commission’s May 2024 advisory, mandating deepfake labelling and removal within three hours, lacks robust enforcement, and India has no specific AI laws. With deepfakes created in 2-3 minutes, their viral potential threatens hyper-local constituencies, risking trust erosion and potential unrest if unchecked,"" he added.Talking about deepfakes and morphed videos, a digital communication consultant, Keshav Mishra, said, ""these have been used to defame political opponents during elections. While digitally literate audiences can often identify AI-generated content, rural populations remain vulnerable to misinformation.""While explaining harm caused by fake AI-generated content, Singh said harmful AI content spreads rapidly, often outpacing takedown efforts. ""Misinformation spreads five times faster than corrections. A deepfake can reach tens of thousands in a day, underscoring the need for real-time monitoring and stricter platform accountability,"" he added.As domestic politics is adapting to AI, India's foreign policy is also evolving under its influence. Recently, the world went mad over Ghibli Art, and even politicians went gaga over it.For example, in the wake of Ghibli art, AI united two nations — India and Israel, through AI-generated images. The Israeli Embassy in India shared an image showcasing the friendship between PM Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu in a beautiful Ghibli-style art piece. The Indian Embassy in Israel also shared images of PM Modi driving a vehicle on the shores with Netanyahu enjoying his company.The artistic portrayal is an example of how the two countries are strengthening ties at a crucial time (the Israel-Gaza conflict).Apart from this, India is leveraging AI as a soft power tool on the global stage, from cyber diplomacy to multilateral tech partnerships.D uring AI Action Summit in Paris on February 11, 2025, PM Modi emphasised how ""AI is already re-shaping polity, economy, security and even society.""""AI is developing at an unprecedented scale and speed. And being adopted and deployed even faster. There is also a deep inter-dependence across borders. Therefore, there is a need for collective global efforts to establish governance and standards, that uphold our shared values, address risks, and build trust,"" he added.Highlighting India's tech-savvy youth at a global platform, he underlined the fact that India is building AI applications for public good. ""India is building its own Large Language Model considering our diversity. We also have a unique public-private partnership model for pooling resources like compute power. It is made available to our start-ups and researchers at an affordable cost. And, India is ready to share its experience and expertise to ensure that the AI future is for Good, and for All,"" he added.Cutting short, diplomacy is not just about defence, infrastructure, nuclear deals and trade tariffs anymore — it's also about tech stacks and AI models.Singh said India is leveraging AI to bolster its soft power, positioning itself as a tech governance leader:However, the lack of comprehensive AI legislation limits India's influence compared to the EU or the US. Still, its election AI experiments offer a model for democratic nations, strengthening its diplomatic narrative.Amid fears of AI working at the forefront and replacing jobs, a question arises: will it also replace politicians? Well, time will generate the code to decode the question. But now, we can say that AI might change how they win.With scale, diversity and digital ambition, India is positioned well to become a leader in ethical AI adoption. But, it is noteworthy that leadership won't come from tools alone.","Pib shared the picture on x while fact-checking a false claim about the daily telegraph's story.

Brics Parliamentary Forum condemns Pahalgam terror hit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brics-parliamentary-forum-condemns-pahalgam-terror-hit/articleshow/121684421.cms,"NEW DELHI: The 11th Brics Parliamentary Forum has unequivocally condemned the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam in which 26 innocent civilians were masscared, triggering tensions with Pakistan that culminated with Operation Sindoor ""We express strong condemnation of any acts of terrorism as criminal and unustifiable regardless of their motivation, whenever, wherever and by whomsoever committed. We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 22 April 2025,"" said the forum whose members include China, Pakistan's staunchest ally.The formulation, adopted by the forum after its three-day meeting in Brasilia where the Indian delegation was led by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, is seen a repudiation of the ""root cause"" alibi used by Pakistan to justify anti-India terror.""We reaffirm our commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including the cross-border movement of terrorists, terrorism financing and safe havens,"" the resolution further said.In his speech, Birla stressed the need for joint efforts to curb financial support to terrorist organisations, enhance intelligence sharing, prevent the misuse of emerging technologies, & promote cooperation in investigation and judicial processes.He also highlighted India's strong and clear position on various key subjects, especially global cooperation against terrorism, a just and balanced international order, participation in technological innovation, and democratic exchange.On terrorism, the parliamentary forum asked for zero tolerance response to terrorism, rejected double standards in countering it, while also underlining ""terrorism should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilisation or ethnic group, and that all those involved in terrorist activities and their support must be held accountable and brought to justice in accordance with relevant national and international law.

Vijay Mallya relates how he told Arun Jaitley he was flying to the UK before he left India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vijay-mallya-relates-how-he-told-arun-jaitley-he-was-flying-to-the-uk-before-he-left-india/articleshow/121683988.cms,"TOI correspondent from London:





Fugitive liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya has told a podcast, in a rare interview, that he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016.At the time there was supposed to be a CBI lookout circular (LOC) issued against him.Mallya told “Figuring Out with Raj Shamani” he was not aware of any LOC against him, nor that it had been downgraded by the CBI from detaining him to informing immigration of authorities of his travel plans.He told Shamani that certain TV anchors and the Indian govt want to see him in “jail clothes, eating jail food” in Tihar and spending the rest of his life behind bars. “If that is what is inevitable, what options do I have? It might be inevitable, I’m not an astrologer. I will fight my way in court.”He said: “I told FM Arun Jaitley before leaving for the airport and then I flew from Delhi to London on the way to Geneva for a meeting which was fixed months ago. I told the then finance minister because I went from Parliament to Delhi airport. When this news hit the media, once again, it created a storm.People went running to Mr Jaitley. He denied meeting me. A Congress MP saw us and then said to the media ‘No, I saw them together’. Mr Jaitley had to retract his statement and say ‘Yes, yes I met him but only while walking — it was a fleeting meeting’.”“I never said I went to Mr Jaitley’s office, sat in front of him, had tea with him. All I said is I told the finance minister while leaving, I’m going to London and going to Geneva for a meeting, please tell the banks to sit across the table and settle with me. How long does this once sentencetake? You see the way he denied it, and then when a Congress MP pointed out his mistake that he saw us, he quickly changed.”He also said he had always planned to go back to India but his Indian passport was revoked.In the four-hour podcast Mallya also said he would be prepared to return to India. “If I have the assurance of a fair trial and assurance of dignified existence in India, I will think about returning to India seriously. “ He then reminded Shamani of the judgment in the Sanjay Bhandari case which found “Indian detention conditions a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights)”, which may mean he could not be extradited now.When asked why he had not gone already as he had lost his extradition battle in the courts, the 69-year-old said: “My stay in England is fully legitimate. There is more than the particular case you are referring to. There are ongoing proceedings in this country. It’s one of the legal battles I am fighting,” he said. This suggests he may have applied for asylum.",Vijay mallya has told a podcast that he told the late former finance minister arun jaitley that he was about to fly out of india to london before he left for the airport in march 2016.

NEW DELHI: On his return to India after being a part of a global delegation that visited several countries, veteran Congress functionary Salman Khurshid said though he had been asked by his party to be a part of Centre's global outreach against terrorism, he was left wondering ""why people were making speculations and what they were looking for"". He was explaining his biting remarks that were apparently directed at Congress officebearers who ran down the govt campaign.Khurshid termed the trip as successful after his delegation met with external affairs minister S Jaishankar for a briefing. Congress MP Manish Tewari too praised his delegation's efforts in Gulf and African countries, where it effectively ""busted false equivalence"" Pakistan has drawn between Palestine and Kashmir, and sensitised the hosts about Pakistan's terror agenda against India.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is leading a delegation that is in the US at present, said, ""I think anybody who thinks that working in national interest is some sort of anti-party activity really needs to question themselves rather than us.""However, unfazed by the criticism of these party members, Congress continued its offensive against the programme, saying the foreign visits achieved little with the delegations failing to meet big leaders in host countries.When asked about Khurshid's praise of the outreach, All India Congress Committee spokesman Ajoy Kumar said the issue was not about any party or individual because it is govt that decides the script for any such delegation. ""And the problem is that govt did not give the script,"" he felt.Kumar added that the delegations did not even name China as the force behind Pakistan's devious agenda or call out US president Donald Trump for his claim that he was behind Indo-Pak ceasefire. ""The media was busy pitting Congress against Congress by talking about Tharoor, etc, but this was Modi's surrender,"" he claimed.Nevertheless, Khurshid stuck to his guns and said he had been in touch with the party high command throughout the tour.Citing an example of what the trip had achieved, he said Pakistan had to issue a ""frustrated press release"" after his delegation's three-day visit to Malaysia.""While some questions were raised by Malaysia, given its strong membership of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, we received a firm letter of support from the prime minister of Malaysia. We saw no indication of any hesitation in backing India,"" Khurshid pointed out.",Congress mp manish tewari too praised his delegation's efforts in gulf and african countries.

NEW DELHI: In an unexpected turn, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor was left momentarily stunned when he received a question from his son on foreign soil during a briefing.As Tharoor sat poised, addressing a room filled with foreign policy experts, diplomats and journalists, a familiar voice rose from the crowd. With a laugh, he said, ""that shouldn't be allowed. This is my son.""His son, Ishaan Tharoor, global affairs columnist with the Washington Post, stood up and said, ""Ishaan Tharoor, Washington Post. Definitely asking a question in a personal capacity. Mostly to say hi before you go off to your next engagement.""Ishaan then asked his father whether government interlocutors sought evidence of Pakistan's culpability in the Pahalgam attack, to which Tharoor said, India would not have conducted Operation Sindoor without convincing evidence.""I'm curious though, on this tour you've been to various countries in the Western Hemisphere. Have any of your government interlocutors asked you to show evidence of Pakistan's culpability in the initial attack? And what do you say to the repeated Pakistani denials of having any hand in the initial attack?” Ishaan asked.""I'm very glad you raised this, Ishaan. I didn't plant it. I promise you. This guy does this to his dad,"" Tharoor replied to Ishaan's question amid laughter.""Very simply, no one had any doubt, and we were not asked for evidence, but media have asked, and so you are speaking for your tribe, and that in two or three places, media asked this question,"" Tharoor said.""Let me say very clearly that India would not have done this without convincing evidence,"" he added.""I can assure you, India is not the kind of country that would undertake a military operation without a very solid basis for doing so. This was not some random terror attack. I must say, our government counted 24 terrorist attacks in the course of last year emanating from Pakistan, but none of them required this kind of response,"" he said.""We dealt with them. We either got the terrorists or killed them, minimal damage, a very little loss of life. We dealt with it. This showed all the hallmarks of a sophisticated, planned, deliberate operation with reconnaissance, with intelligence work, with a modus operandi worked out this cynical exercise of asking people their religion, shooting them between the eyes,"" the Congress leader added.He then stressed that India has a 37-year pattern of repeated terror attacks from Pakistan.""Americans haven't forgotten that Pakistan allegedly didn't know where Osama bin Laden was until he was found in a Pakistani safe house right next to an army camp in a cantonment city,"" he said.Tharoor then recalled Pakistan’s initial denial of involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, noting that one of the attackers was captured alive and identified, with his name, address, and nationality confirmed.""The US intelligence, as well as ours, recorded the voice of a Pakistani handler giving minute-by-minute instructions to the killers in Mumbai. So, we know what Pakistan is all about,"" he added.""They will dispatch terrorists. They will deny they did so until they're caught with red hands,” he saidTalking about the Pahalgam terror attack, he said that minutes after the tragedy, the Resistance Front claimed credit. ""Who are the Resistance Front?

Bangladesh will head to the polls in early April 2026, marking the country’s first election since last year’s mass uprising that toppled the Sheikh Hasina government, interim leader Muhammad Yunus announced on Friday.Addressing the nation, Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate who is leading the caretaker administration, said, “I am announcing to the citizens of the country that the election will be held on any day in the first half of April 2026.”Yunus made the announcement during a televised address to the nation on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha.“After reviewing the ongoing reforms related to justice, governance, and the electoral process, I am announcing to the nation today that the next national election will be held on any day in the first half of April 2026,” Yunus said. He added that the election commission will soon present a detailed election roadmap.According to the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), Yunus reiterated that the government had previously indicated the elections would be held between December 2025 and June 2026. ""We are taking every necessary measure to ensure the country is ready to hold free and credible elections during this window,” he said.The 84-year-old caretaker leader acknowledged widespread anticipation over the poll date, emphasising that Bangladesh’s political crises since independence have often stemmed from flawed elections.“Through repeated manipulation of elections, a political party turned into a fascist regime. Those who orchestrated those sham elections were branded as criminals by the people. The regimes that emerged from them were ultimately rejected by the public,” Yunus said.He stressed that the government's primary responsibility is to ensure the upcoming elections are ""clean, festive, peaceful, and widely participatory,"" so the nation does not fall into yet another cycle of crisis. “Institutional reform is key. If we fail to ensure good governance in institutions tied to the electoral process, all the sacrifices made by our students and citizens will be in vain,” he warned.Yunus said his administration operates on three key mandates: reform, justice, and elections. “I believe we will reach significant milestones in justice and institutional reform by Eid al-Fitr,” he said, citing visible progress in the prosecution of crimes against humanity, particularly those committed during the July uprising.He also expressed confidence in holding “the most free, fair, competitive, and credible election in the country’s history,” adding, “We want an election that honors the martyrs of the uprising and brings peace to their souls.”Yunus emphasised the importance of maximum participation: “We want the largest number of voters, candidates, and parties in this election. Let it be remembered as the most impartial election in Bangladesh’s history. After more than a century and a half, a truly representative parliament will be formed, and millions of young people will vote for the first time.”Calling on citizens to engage proactively, Yunus urged voters to seek firm commitments from all political parties and candidates: that they will uphold the reform agenda agreed upon by consensus in the next parliament; protect Bangladesh’s independence, sovereignty, and dignity; and never compromise the people’s democratic rights.He also called for pledges of clean governance: “Ask them to promise they will lead with honesty and transparency, rejecting corruption, partisanship, extortion, syndicates, and any form of anti-people activity.”Yunus concluded by framing the upcoming election as more than a political event: “This is not just a vote — it’s a chance to build a New Bangladesh. While familiar parties and symbols will appear on the ballot, it is up to the people to choose candidates truly committed to your hopes and your future.”","Bangladesh will hold its first election since last year’s mass uprising that toppled the sheikh hasina government, interim leader muhammad yunus announced on friday.

Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old with a background in gardening and grocery store work, has been appointed by US President Donald Trump to head the center for prevention programs and partnerships (CP3) at the department of homeland Security (DHS).Just five years ago, Fugate was working as a neighborhood gardener. As recently as August 2023, he held a job at a grocery store. A 2023 graduate of the University of Texas at San Antonio, Fugate has experienced a swift rise through Republican political circles.Fugate’s LinkedIn page shows limited experience in the national security or policy field. In 2020, he listed himself as a self-employed “landscape business owner.” He also worked as a “cross functional team member” at an H-E-B supermarket in Austin, Texas.After completing his degree in politics and law, Fugate joined Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign as an “advance team member.” He has also interned at the conservative Heritage foundation and with Texas state representatives Terry Wilson and Steve Allison.In February, he was reportedly hired as a special assistant in an immigration office at DHS.Following the resignation of the previous CP3 director, Fugate was named as the acting head of the center.“Tom Fugate has performed well in his current role as a confidential assistant in our immigration & border security suboffice,” a DHS official told The Daily Beast.“Due to his success, he has been temporarily given additional leadership responsibilities in the center for prevention programs and partnerships office (CP3). This is a credit to his work ethic and success on the job.”Earlier posts from his X account show a different tone, one of interest in global aid, LEGO, Star Wars, and international development. In past tweets, he encouraged Texas lawmakers to support the international affairs budget and aid for the global poor.Fugate later shifted toward a MAGA-aligned political image, rebranding himself with the “thomas4texas” Instagram handle and announcing his entry into public service. His online profiles reflect a carefully constructed persona, including a LinkedIn photo in front of the DHS seal, hinting at confidence and ambition.His rapid promotion has sparked questions about experience and readiness, but DHS officials have stood by the decision, citing his work ethic and current performance.","Thomas fugate, a 22-year-old with a background in gardening and grocery store work, has been appointed by us president donald trump to head the department of homeland security.

Pak Says Simla Pact Is 'DEAD'; Says Kashmir No More Bilateral With India, LOC Now 'Ceasefire Line'





A day after Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif declared the 1972 Simla Agreement “a dead document,” the country’s foreign ministry clarified that no decision has been made to revoke any bilateral agreements with India, including the landmark pact.A senior foreign office official, while responding Asif’s comments, said that while recent developments have triggered internal discussions in Islamabad, there has been no formal move to scrap existing agreements with New Delhi.“At present, there is no formal decision to terminate any bilateral accord,” news agency PTI quoted the official as saying. He indicated that all treaties, including the Simla Agreement, remain operational.The clarification comes amid heightened tensions following the recent Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent Indian strikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7. Pakistan had threatened to review the Simla Agreement in the aftermath but had not made any official moves until Asif’s televised remarks stirred speculation.During a televised interview on Tuesday, defence minister Asif said that India’s ""unilateral actions"", particularly the 2019 revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, had rendered the Simla framework obsolete.“The Simla Agreement is now a dead document. We are back to the 1948 position, when the United Nations declared the Line of Control a ceasefire line,” Asif had claimed.“Whether the Indus Waters Treaty is suspended or not, Simla is already over,” he added.Asif also suggested that the bilateral structure had collapsed and that future disputes between India and Pakistan would need to be addressed via multilateral or international mechanisms.However, the foreign office’s statement effectively distanced the Pakistani government from the defence minister’s remarks.The Simla Agreement, signed in 1972 in the aftermath of the Indo-Pak war, outlines key principles meant to guide peaceful bilateral relations and resolve disputes through dialogue.Hostilities between India and Pakistan flared again in early May, with Pakistan attempting retaliatory attacks on Indian military posts from May 8 to 10. These were met with a firm response from India. A ceasefire understanding was eventually reached after talks between the two countries' directors general of military operations on May 10.","Pakistan's foreign ministry says no decision has been made to revoke any bilateral agreements with india.

Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy faced another round of vicious trolling for no reason while the MAGA world imploded with Donald Trump and Elon Musk attacking each other in public. Vivek Ramaswamy was a part of the MAGA world until Christmas 2024 when he chastised American culture and doubled down on the need of H-1B visa programs. At that time, Ramaswamy was a co-chief of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Elon Musk too backed Ramaswamy on H1-B but did not like his unraveling and eventually Ramaswamy exited DOGE even before Trump's inauguration.Ramaswamy announced his bid for Ohio Governor race, got the backing of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump but gradually distanced himself from the White House.As the Trump-Musk feud unfolded, Ramaswamy posted a photo carrying his two children -- Karthik and Arjun and wrote: 'It's why we do it'.
