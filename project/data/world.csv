""The disclosure (about USAID funding to India) came from the US President himself, nobody else could have a better knowledge about it,"" he said.He also cited the US department of government efficiency's (DOGE) post on X that specifically mentioned funding of $21 million for ""voter turnout"" in India, and alleged that Gandhi family sympathisers were spreading lies.BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya claimed that the media report suggesting that the money was meant for Bangladesh was a cover-up for foreign funding through George Soros's Open Society Foundation.Bhatia claimed USAID funding came to India to meddle with internal politics and disrupt electoral politics.""More than $2,000 million came to govt in India from 2004 to 2013 during the UPA regime.

NASA’s New Update RevealsThe Truth About Asteroid 2024 YR4

An asteroid that is likely to hit Earth in the year 2032 has major Indian cities at risk according to the assessment by astronomers.Asteroid 2024 YR4, 130 to 300 feet long, is expected to make a very close pass of the planet in 2032. Although much of the object’s estimated track passes over an empty ocean, it includes mega Indian cities Mumbai and Kolkata.Based on the trajectory, towns in the state of Maharashtra, Northern Telangana, Southern Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal are also at risk. The impact, however, depends on several factors like entry angle, speed, and atmospheric effects.Other probable impact locations in the world include Bogotá, Colombia; Lagos and Nigeria.Although the asteroid is not large, especially when compared to a much larger asteroid Apophis discovered in 2004, its potential impact is nevertheless capable of creating extensive destruction. Nasa , however, has lowered the probability of the asteroid striking the Earth to 1.5%.The speed of the asteroid will be approximately 40,000 miles per hour, which will generate an energy outflow 500 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, and the explosion could very well annihilate a whole city.The kinetic energy of an asteroid is a proxy for how destructive its impact would be. And as asteroids mostly move at the same speed — about 38,000 mph — the key variable is its mass. The composition is also important. 2024 YR4 is statistically likelier to be a stony asteroid, which is more prone to fragment into smaller pieces as it is heated during its atmospheric descent.While the thought of an asteroid hitting Earth is undoubtedly unsettling, the probability of 2024 YR4 making contact in 2032 is extremely low. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are closely monitoring the asteroid’s path.The asteroid was initially discovered on December 27, 2023, by Chilean El Sauce Observatory, 2024 YR4.","Asteroid 2024 yr4, 130 to 300 feet long, is expected to make a very close pass of the planet in 2032.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday went hammer and tongs at the Congress party after US President Donald Trump acknowledged India's 2024 Lok Sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"".Hours after Trump criticised the Biden dispensation's decision to disburse $21 million towards "" voter turnout efforts "" in India, the BJP IT department head Amit Malviya posted multiple clips of PM Modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.During the poll campaign in the summer elections last year, PM Modi was seen lashing out at the Congress over the ""external influence"".""Nowadays influential people around the world have united to remove Modi but there is the blessing of(women power)(maternal power)... it's yourprotective shield) that Modi keeps working despite facing challenges,"" PM Modi said while addressing a rally in Karnataka's Chikkaballapur in April ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.In another rally at Chhattisgarh's Sarguja, PM Modi said: ""Congresspeople and some influential people in the world lose their cool...if India grows in power, it would spoil the game of some influential people. Today, if India becomes self-reliant...some influential people would lose their jobs.""""Therefore, they want a weak government of Congress and the INDI alliance. The government with issues of infighting, which practices corruption. The history of Congress suggests that can destroy the nation for the greed of power,"" he added.In a television interview PM Modi said: ""The entire world trying to influence India's election, which they shouldn't do. They aren't giving their opinion or comment but influencing it. But they won't be able to influence it.""Further accusing Rahul Gandhi of ""urging foreign powers to intervene in India’s internal affairs"", BJP shared a clip from his visit to London in 2023 and said: ""He has aligned himself with global networks seeking to undermine India’s strategic and geopolitical interests, acting as a tool for foreign agencies.""Earlier, Trump once again questioned the United States' decision to allocate $21 million for voter turnout efforts in India. Speaking at the FII PRIORITY Summit in Miami, he said, ""$21 million for voter turnout, why do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected.""""We have got to tell the Indian Government. Because when we hear that Russia spent about two thousand dollars in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for two thousand dollars.

They malign India’s democracy, and we strongly condemn this. This blatant attempt at foreign interference in India’s democratic process is a matter of great shame,"" Prasad said.BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan called Trump's statement a ""smoking gun"" which ""exposes"" the dangerous role of a foreign hand.""President Trump's statement is a smoking gun which shockingly exposes the dangerous role of a foreign hand interfering and influencing the outcome of the Indian elections, but the million dollar question, rather the 21 million dollar question, is which were the Indian hands who were at cahoots with the foreign hands, receiving foreign funds to undermine Indian's democracy and destabilise India's statement..."" said BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan.On Wednesday, Trump also questioned the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that New Delhi is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"".This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.","Us president donald trump acknowledged india's 2024 lok sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"" the bjp it department head amit malviya posted multiple clips of pm modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118416406,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-707576,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
I am a multi-religious person: Indian Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-am-a-multi-religious-person-indian-army-chief-general-upendra-dwivedi/articleshow/118388533.cms,"Indian Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi

NEW DELHI: Indian Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi recently opened up about his multi-religious upbringing and illustrious military career.In an exclusive interview with ANI, he shared his thoughts on being multi-religious, citing his exposure to diverse faiths during his time in the 18th battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir rifles .This regiment uniquely had a mosque, gurdwara, Durga Mata temple, and Mahakal temple all under one roof, fostering an environment of interfaith harmony.When asked about his recent visit to Mahakaleshwar Temple in Madhya Pradesh's Ujjain with defence minister Rajnath Singh, the Army chief said, ""I am multi-religious. I have been commissioned into the 18th battalion, the Jammu and Kashmir rifles, where you have a Masjid, Gurdwara, Durga Mata, and Mahakal, all under one roof.""General Dwivedi recounted how his subedar major, a Maulvi, would perform Durga Mata Puja without any issues, demonstrating the regiment's spirit of mutual respect. When asked about his own spiritual journey, general Dwivedi said after taking over, he first sought blessings from his unit, Bhakti Dhaam, where he received blessings from his Maulvi, Pandit, and Granthi.""My subedar major, who may be a Maulvi, is able to do Durga Mata Puja, which is not an issue at all. Now, if you see, have I visited any Mashoor (famous) place, Golden Temple or Mahakaal or Vaishno Devi, in the initial stages? No. The first thing I went to was to my unit, Bhakti Dham. And once I got the blessings there from my Maulvi, my Pandit, my Granthi, thereafter I started going to all the places,"" said the Army chief.General Dwivedi recalled how his father would tell him stories of freedom fighters and World War II heroes, inspiring him to join the army.In a candid revelation, Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi shared the story of how his childhood experiences shaped his decision to join the Indian Army.One particular memory that stood out was when his uncle would bring home copies with photographs of soldiers. These images sparked a sense of curiosity and admiration in young Dwivedi. As he grew older, he began to explore various career options, considering medicine and engineering, just like his brothers.However, the allure of the Army ultimately won him over. General Dwivedi recalled how he initially wanted to become an intelligence officer, but after gaining more exposure, he decided to join the Army first and then explore opportunities in intelligence.""I remember my uncle when he used to ask him, So the copy which he used to bring used to have a soldier's photo. Okay. My father used to always give me the story of freedom fighters or the story of World War II, where we won Vera, who escaped as a pilot. I remember. So all these stories I used to keep reading. And my one brother was a doctor. So I said, no, this is closed. My second brother was an engineer. I said, this is closed. Okay. So third was the army, which was there. I wanted to become an intelligence officer if I can say that. But when I went to school and saw everything, then I said, okay, let me join the Army first, thereafter look at intelligence,"" the Army chief said.He also shared his experience of flying the LCA with air marshal AP Singh during Aero India 2025, praising Singh's leadership and straightforward qualities. He recalled that air marshal Singh was a standout individual even during their National Defence Academy (NDA) days, earning the respect and admiration of his peers.In a nostalgic reflection, Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi reminisced about his school days, when he and his peers would admire all three services - the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He shared that it was simply fate that led him to join the Army.""See, when we were in school, we used to look at all three services. We used to love all three, if I can say that. It just so happened that I came into the army. Let me tell you about AP first. As far as AP is concerned, from NDA days, he is a gold torch. And he is, everybody has a natural liking towards him. He is a man who can collect people together. He is a natural leader. And he takes ownership of a crowd. But he is a very straightforward man. So, I say in the lighter moment, he should have been in the infantry,"" said the Army chief.The Army chief highlighted Air Marshal Singh's ability to bring people together, his natural leadership skills, and his willingness to take ownership of responsibilities. General Dwivedi jokingly added that Air Marshal Singh's straightforward nature and team-bonding skills would have made him an excellent fit for the infantry.""He's so straightforward. And such a team-bonding man, he should have been infantry,"" he added.This lighthearted exchange reflects the camaraderie and mutual respect between General Dwivedi and Air Marshal Singh, underscoring the strong bonds formed during their early days at the NDA.The Army chief’s remarks provide insight into his personal life and military journey, emphasising the significance of respecting all religions and the principles of teamwork and leadership.As the 30th Chief of the Army Staff, he brings extensive experience, having held key positions such as Northern Army Commander and Director General of Infantry.","Indian army chief general upendra dwivedi recently opened up about his multi-religious upbringing and illustrious military career.

Delta Plane Crash Toronto Pilot: Who is Kendal Swanson? Why everyone thinks she was responsible for Delta flight turning upside down in Toronto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-kendal-swanson-why-everyone-thinks-she-was-responsible-for-delta-flight-turning-upside-down-in-toronto/articleshow/118428652.cms,"The Delta aircraft turned upside down as it crash-landed on the runway.

In a shocking incident, a Delta Airlines flight turned upside down after crashing on the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport Monday becoming the latest in a series of aviation mishaps. There was no fatality as all 80 people including the crew managed to crawl out of an upside-down plane. 21 of them were taken to hospital with injuries and by Thursday morning all of them were released.As the harrowing incident is under investigation, Delta reportedly announced a payoff of $30,000 to each of the passengers which raised suspicion as to whether the airlines want to silence the passengers. But reports claimed that taking the money will have no strings attached and the passengers can still sue the airlines for the life-threatening crash-landing.Speculations are rife on social media that the airlines has not revealed the identity of the pilots to safeguard their DEI (diversity, equity and inclusivity) hiring policies. Many viral posts indulged in a gender blame game claiming that all pilots were female -- though the gender had no link to the mishap and Delta did not release any details about the pilots -- neither their names nor gender.Kendal Swanson is the only name doing rounds on X. It has been claimed that she was the pilot of the plane but there were other pilots and the captain -- and these claims are not verified.One viral post with a photo of Kendal Swanson claimed that she was not experienced enough for the landing while the runway was covered in snow. The post said she was an instructor pilot for a small propellor aircraft a year ago and she recently received her licence. Others countered the claims and many questioned who the captain of the flight was as it was the captain's fault to give the landing to an inexperienced pilot, if the claims were true at all.According to the screenshot attached to the viral post, the PIC (pilot in command) was James and the FO (First Officer) was Kendal and the flight attendants were Hollie and Rebecca. Social media users asked if James was the captain, then it was not Kendal's fault. Delta said the pilots on that flight were very experienced.",The delta aircraft turned upside down as it crash-landed on the runway.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it
