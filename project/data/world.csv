Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad

New Delhi: Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) on Saturday commenced “Operation Herof 2.0”, a large-scale military offensive characterised by synchronised attacks at dawn. While BLA claimed scores of casualties across the region, the official count stood at 12. The local administration claimed to have neutralised 58 BLA fighters.“Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out attacks at 12 locations across Balochistan. During the clashes with the terrorists, 12 personnel of the security forces and the police were martyred,” the Pak media reported, quoting the administration and adding that the attacks were foiled due to “timely and effective action”. In a post on X, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti claimed that Pak security forces had killed 70 rebels at various locations across the province during the past two days.Spanning around 12 districts and especially targeting the provincial capital, Quetta, this offensive marks a significant escalation in regional conflict and is being regarded as the most extensive assault since 2024.The attacks involved use of suicide bombers and a significant number of women rebels at Kalat, Gwadar, Mastung, Noshki, Kharan, Turbat and Pasni where bank, govt offices and Frontier ops HQ were targeted.The attacks coincided with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) top functionary Hafiz Hamdullah’s declaring that armed groups, not the state, now controlled Balochistan.BLA’s Hakkal media also released a new video footage showing commander Bashir Zeb leading armed separatist units on motorcycles.In a statement, BLA claimed to have brought under its control several areas of Quetta, besides Noshki jail and Pasni coast guard camp, police stations and the military intelligence office. BLA’s Majeed Brigade and Fateh Squad (or Fidayeen soldiers) participated in the operation.“The Baloch nation will defeat the enemy in every city, every street and every neighbourhood,” Jeeyand Baloch, spokesperson for BLA, said. Op Herof-I was conducted in Aug 2024 and saw at least 126 Pakistani soldiers being killed and scores injured.","Balochistan liberation army (bla) on saturday commenced “operation herof 2.0” bla claimed scores of casualties across the region, the official count stood at 12.

India Can Be Pivotal In Peace And Two-State Solution, Says Palestine Ambassador

New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi met the Palestinian foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian, and reiterated India’s continued support for the people of Palestine and welcomed ongoing peace efforts, including the Gaza peace plan.The minister met the PM as a member of a delegation of the foreign ministers of Arab countries who are in India for the second India-Arab Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. The meeting saw external affairs minister S Jaishankar asserting that the countries targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves.According to an Indian readout, Modi conveyed his appreciation for the important role played by the Arab League in supporting efforts towards regional peace and stability.“The Arab world is a part of India’s extended neighbourhood, linked by deep civilisational bonds, vibrant people-to-people connections and enduring brotherly ties, as well as a shared commitment to peace, progress and stability. Confident that enhanced cooperation in technology, energy, trade and innovation will unlock new opportunities and take the partnership to new heights,” said Modi in a post on X.Highlighting the “humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza”, the Palestinian minister told Modi Palestine values India’s principled support for Palestinian rights under international law.According to external affairs ministry, the PM outlined his vision for the India-Arab partnership in the years ahead and reaffirmed India’s commitment to further deepen cooperation in trade and investment, energy, technology, healthcare and other priority areas, for the mutual benefit of our peoples.“India has been a long-standing development partner for Palestine. This has been rendered both bilaterally and through UN agencies. India has so far given assistance worth USD 170 million. Of these, projects worth USD 40 million are under implementation,” said a source.In the foreign ministers’ meeting, Jaishankar strongly raised the issue of cross-border terrorism saying it’s particularly unacceptable because it violates the basic principles of international relations and diplomacy. He also told the Arab foreign ministers societies targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves and will understandably exercise it. “It is essential that we strengthen international cooperation to combat what is a global scourge. Zero-tolerance for terrorism must be an uncompromising universal norm,” he said.He also said the changing landscape in West Asia has implications for India’s relations with the Arab world as well and taking forward the comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict was a widely shared priority.“Various countries have made policy declarations on the peace plan, individually or collectively. This is the larger context in which we deliberate on the region’s challenges and prospects,” said the minister.","Pm narendra modi met the palestinian foreign minister, varsen aghabekian.

New Delhi: Days after India and European Union clinched what has been termed as ‘mother of all trade deals’, CJI Surya Kant on Saturday wooed French industrialists and businessmen to invest in India by hard-selling Supreme Court–backed trade-friendly legal system in the country. Referring to the uncertain business atmosphere in the world, apparently because of arbitrary import tariffs imposed by the US on various countries, CJI Kant said, “Today, we face a world transformed by uncertainty.”“The forces of disruption and geopolitical tension threaten to destabilise the very framework of international cooperation. In such a world, France-India partnership is not a luxury, it is a lifeline.”Addressing the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Paris Bar Association, the CJI said that for foreign enterprises engaging with their Indian counterparts, India’s legal ecosystem offers clarity. “All that one would have to do is draft well-defined arbitration clauses, select reputable institutions or neutral seats if appropriate and trust that India’s courts will respect the sanctity of arbitral agreements and awards,” he said.CJI Kant said SC provides a safety net against any biased arbitral awards that may adversely impact foreign companies operating in India. “SC has made it clear that while arbitral autonomy must be respected, the judiciary cannot relinquish its supervisory role when natural justice is at stake.” “In this context, SC has adopted a calibrated approach of minimal judicial intervention in its role as guardian of credibility, where, for instance, domestic awards may be set aside if bias, corruption or serious procedural deficiencies are proven,” he said.Indian laws encourage pre-litigation mediation. “This approach reflects global best practice: to resolve differences before they ripen into full-fledged litigation, preserving business relationships and reducing strain on judicial systems,” he said.",Cji surya kant wooed french industrialists and businessmen to invest in india by hard-selling supreme court–backed trade-friendly legal system.

He will also inaugurate the Terminal Building at Halwara Airport in Ludhiana, Punjab.On the occasion of the 649th Birth Anniversary of Sant Guru Ravidas Ji, the renaming of Adampur Airport honours the revered saint and social reformer whose teachings of equality, compassion, and human dignity continue to inspire India's social ethos.Further advancing aviation infrastructure in the state, the Terminal Building, to be inaugurated by the Prime Minister at Halwara Airport, will establish a new gateway for the State, serving Ludhiana and its surrounding industrial and agricultural hinterland. Located in the Ludhiana district, Halwara is also home to a strategically important Indian Air Force station.The earlier airport at Ludhiana had a relatively small runway, suitable for small-size aircrafts. To improve connectivity and accommodate larger aircraft, a new civil enclave has been developed at Halwara, which has a longer runway capable of handling A320-type aircraft.Aligned with the Prime Minister's vision of sustainable and environmentally responsible development, the terminal incorporates several green and energy-efficient features, including LED lighting, insulated roofing, rainwater harvesting systems, sewage and water treatment plants, and the use of recycled water for landscaping.The architectural design reflects Punjab's rich cultural heritage, offering passengers a distinctive and regionally inspired travel experience.Earlier, Bharatiya Janata Party's Punjab President Sunil Jakhar said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Dera Ballan on February 1, calling it a significant visit that reflects the Prime Minister's respect for Guru Ravidas and the sentiments of the people of Punjab.Jakhar said the Prime Minister's visit is taking place on a special day when the Union Budget is also being presented, underscoring the importance the Prime Minister attaches to faith and reverence. He described the visit as a message of affection and respect for Punjab and urged leaders of other political parties not to view it through a political lens.He urged that the Prime Minister's visit be viewed through the lens of faith, reverence, and respect, rather than political gain. Jakhar said that the renaming of Adampur Airport as Guru Ravidas Airport had already been announced, and the Prime Minister will now formally implement it during his visit. He added that Prime Minister Modi will also visit the Dera and pay his respects there.According to Jakhar, the move reflects respect for a community which, he claimed, was sidelined or misunderstood by the Congress, and should be seen as an inclusive gesture towards society as a whole.

The penguin walked away quietly. But what was it trying to say?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-penguin-walked-away-quietly-but-what-was-it-trying-to-say/articleshow/127803414.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. The internet loves noise, but this time it fell in love with silence. A short video went viral: a lone penguin walking away from its colony, not toward the sea, not toward its companions, but straight toward the frozen mountains of Antarctica. No drama. Just a steady, deliberate walk into white nothingness. Memes followed, as they always do. Even the White House posted one where the American President escorts the penguin to Greenland. Social media crowned it the nihilist penguin . Laughter spread, but beneath it lay recognition. This penguin wasn’t protesting. It wasn’t rebelling. It wasn’t asking to be saved. It was simply walking away. And that quiet exit felt deeply familiar, especially to Gen Z—a generation tired of performing happiness, exhausted by constant comparison, crushed by the pressure to prove that life is “working out”. Somewhere inside, many whispered the same thought the penguin seemed to carry: Enough is enough. What many forgot — or never knew — was that this was not a new moment. The footage came from a 2007 documentary by Werner Herzog , titled ‘Encounters at the end of the world’. At the time, the scene passed quietly, almost uneasily, without commentary or conclusion. It was neither analysed nor celebrated. The internet was not yet ready for it. Two decades later, in an age of burnout and quiet quitting, the clip resurfaced and suddenly felt uncannily current, as though the penguin had been walking all this time to meet us here. From a Western philosophical lens, the label came easily: nihilism. The word itself comes from nihil , Latin for nothing. Nihilism argues that life has no inherent meaning, no objective values, and no moral truths beyond human invention. It emerged in modern Western thought, especially in the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, who saw it as a dangerous vacuum left by the collapse of religion and tradition. For Nietzsche, nihilism was a crisis, not a destination. Closely allied is existentialism, articulated by thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Simone de Beauvoir. Existentialism claims that humans are not born with purpose; we exist first and define ourselves later through choice. Meaning is not given; it is made. Everyone saw the solitary walk of the penguin to be in synchronisation with western philosophical ideas that inherently indicated purposelessness. But here is where the Eastern lens gently interrupts the Western conclusion. Indian philosophy talks about renunciation. At first glance, nihilism and renunciation seem similar. But nihilism often carries a bleak tone, disillusionment after belief collapses. Renunciation, or vairāgya , begins not in emptiness but in insight. The world is not denied; it is understood as transient. Suffering does not arise from existence itself, but from clinging. The renunciate does not walk away in despair, but in clarity. There is freedom here, not apathy; compassion, not cynicism. Thiruvalluvar captures this radical lightness with stunning economy. In Kural 345, from the chapter on renunciation, he writes: Matrum thodarpaadu evankol pirapparukkal Utraarkku udambum migai. “For those who have renounced, even the body itself is a burden; what more could they desire?” This is where the penguin begins to look different. Perhaps it is not rejecting life. Maybe it is stepping out of the noise. Perhaps it is not a nihilist at all, but an accidental symbol of letting go.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

NEW DELHI: As the March 31, 2026 deadline for making the country ""Naxal-free"" approaches, the security forces are in the final leg of intelligence-based operations to get the remaining 'Big Four' of the apex CPI(Maoist) leadership -- three politburo-cum-central committee members and one central committee member -- and an estimated ""300-350 regular, uniformed cadres of concern"" still out there in the jungles.""Time is running out for these leaders, and full-time cadres spread across Chhattisgarh (around 200-250) and totalling no more than 10-20 each in Telangana, Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra. They must choose between eschewing the path of violence and being confronted by the security forces in their hideouts across the Indravati national park area, small pockets of Jharkhand, and the inter-state borders of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra and Telangana,” Bastar range Inspector General P Sundarraj told TOI.There are only four surviving politburo (PB) and central committee (CC) members, of which two are not known to be active. Thippiri Tirupathi @ Devji is the de facto No. 1, though not formally anointed as the CPI(Maoist) general secretary. Former general secretary Muppalla Laxman Rao @ Ganpathy is in his late seventies and supposedly ailing. Misir Besra, who is heading the CPI(Maoist) Eastern Regional Bureau since his predecessor Prashant Bose's arrest in 2021 and is the only non-Telugu face in PB, is currently operating in the Saranda forests of Jharkhand, where his aide and CC member Patiram Manjhi @ Anal Da was killed only a few days ago.The forces are already on Besra's trail. Malla Raji Reddy @ Sangram, who is in charge of Maoist operations in Odisha, is not known to have been involved in any active operations for quite some time.Though some state police have a 5th CC member — Asim Mondal — in their ‘active’ list, opinion is divided on whether he indeed is part of the CC.Devji, though currently No. 1 in CP( Moist), is debilitated by the series of killings and surrenders by his PB/CC colleagues, senior commanders and armed cadres in the past year or so. ""There have been multiple public appeals for surrender, including at the political level, but Devji may prefer to go down fighting, holding on to Maoist ideology,"" said a senior officer.As a senior MHA functionary had told TOI earlier, the “end” of Left-wing extremism may not mean there will be no incidents of Maoist violence. “But such incidents will be isolated and dealt with at the police station level. CPI(Maoist) will no longer have an organised, cadre-based strength operating across states,” said the officer.Between January 1, 2025, and January 22, 2026, a dozen central committee members, including general secretary and politburo member Basavaraju, were neutralised by the counter-Naxal forces, and five opted for surrender. There are still two senior commanders -- Pappa Rao and Prabhakar, both members of the Dandkarenya special zonal committee (DKSZC) — on the loose. They are said to be active in the inter-state border of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, covering Kanker, Gadchiroli and south of Indravati.The flood of Maoist surrenders last year, including by PB and CC member Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu; CC members Chandranna and Sujata in Telangana; and Ramder and Rupesh in Chhattisgarh, along with the huge dent in Naxal arsenal with the recovery of 698 weapons and 915 IEDs in Chhattisgarh alone over the past year, have left the Maoists a depleted army on ventilator support.","There are only four surviving politburo (pb) and central committee (cc) members, of which two are not known to be active. Thippiri tirupathi @ devji is the de facto no. 1, though not formally anointed as the cpi(maoist) general secretary. There are still two senior commanders -- pappa rao and prabhakar -- on the loose.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127811982,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-44924,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Dwyane Wade stood beside Gabrielle Union through their difficult days

Dwyane Wade and his wife, the popular actress Gabrielle Union, have had a beautiful and a healthy marriage ever since they tied the knot in 2014.While things have always been good between them, Gabrielle Union went through a traumatic struggle as she tried to conceive their baby early on in their marriage. Unfortunately, the popular actress went through a number of miscarriages and had to opt for surrogacy later. While the miscarriages affected her health, Gabrielle Union opened up how it changed her relationship with Dwyane Wade.A few years ago, in 2021, Gabrielle Union wrote an essay for TIME where she revealed how she thought of ending her marriage with Dwyane Wade because of her fertility issues.Gabrielle Union wrote, “Because at that point I would have sold my soul to get out of the endless cycle of loss. What was the going rate for souls? What was mine worth, anyway?”The Being Mary Jane actress added, “Clearly, my feelings weren’t originating from a healthy place. So much of what made the decision so difficult was that if I didn’t submit to a surrogacy, then I was convinced I needed to let Dwyane go.”Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, continue, “Even if he didn’t want to, I had to let him find someone who could give him what he wanted.”When Gabrielle Union wanted to try on new experimental medicines to conceive, it was Dwyane Wade who stopped her from harming her health further and choose an alternative route.Despite Gabrielle Union’s strong doubts over how their marriage will last, the NBA legend Dwyane Wade stood by his wife and became a strong source of strength and support to her.In 2017, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union ended up choosing a surrogate to give birth to their baby and in 2018, they were blessed with a healthy child, Kaavia Wade.Close to a decade later, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union are in one of the happiest phases of their lives as they choose to celebrate their daughter everyday.","Dwyane wade and his wife, the popular actress gabrielle union, have had a beautiful and a healthy marriage ever since they tied the knot in 2014.

Why gold & silver crashed suddenly?

Spot price of gold exceeded $5,500 this week

Spot gold sudden crash

What’s the outlook for gold, silver prices in coming days?

While the short term volatility in any asset is usual, the important question is: Is the gold, silver bull run over?

Gold, silver: What should investors do?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Trillions wiped out - gold and silver prices crash globally - the headlines from the commodity market on Friday described the volatile nature of the commodity market. Gold and silver have been on a record breaking spree for several months now, climbing to new lifetime highs every few days. The sudden crash, and the extent of it - took markets by surprise.Gold prices dropped by a whopping Rs 14,000 per 10 grams and silver prices tanked by Rs 20,000 per kg in Delhi on Friday. The sharp dip came after gold hit a fresh high of Rs 1,83,000 and silver of Rs 4,04,500 on Thursday. Both the precious metals have plunged sharply - gold is down nearly 10%, while silver has slumped about 20% from the record highs.On Friday, in late trades on the MCX, gold futures for February delivery were down to Rs 1.5 lakh/10 grams, while the silver futures for March delivery crashd to Rs 3 lakh/kg, down over Rs 1 lakh.According to Mirae Asset ShareKhan data, in last two days, gold’s market cap is down by around $3.50 trillion, while silver has lost around $1.50 trillion - which is a combined drop of $5 trillion! Still, gold’s market cap is up by around $3 trillion since the start of the year, while silver has gained around $2 trillion. In fact, despite the crash on Friday, in the last two years gold prices are up 150% and silver has gained 326% in international markets.Several factors led to the sudden crash in the prices of the precious metals. For one, prices had run up too sharply, and some but of profit booking was expected. Some analysts are of the view that the decline in prices was due to heavy liquidation of long positions. A record in dollar also added pressure to gold.Experts also say that US President Donald Trump’s pick for the post of US Federal Reserve - Kevin Warsh - sent jitters in markets as he is known to be an inflation hawk, tempering expectations of rate cuts.Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers tells TOI, “Gold & Silver which peaked in overnight on Thursday trade fell sharply after six of the Mag 7 equities related to AI stocks got hammered during the North American session. On Wednesday, US Fed also maintained the status quo, keeping rates unchanged after revealing an improvement in the labor market. Regarding inflation, they said that it remains elevated and sticks to its data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach. ”“Sharp moves in precious metals seen on Friday reflected speculation that Warsh may be less enthusiastic to cut rates given his past warnings of inflation risks and more recent calls for the Fed to reduce its balance sheet. This led to a rise in Dollar & Yields weighing on sentiments for bullions complex,” Sharma explained.Praveen Singh, Head of Commodities Mirae Asset ShareKhan tells TOI that Warsh’s nomination came as a surprise, as Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s Global Fixed Income CIO, had been widely viewed as the frontrunner. “Rieder, who has advocated for aggressive rate cuts to support economic growth, was seen as favouring a dovish monetary stance aligned with President Trump’s policy preferences.”“In contrast, Warsh is a well‑known monetary hawk. During his five‑year term on the Federal Reserve Board, which ended in 2011, he consistently pushed back against what he viewed as overly accommodative policy. He warned that near‑zero interest rates and large‑scale asset purchases risked market distortions and long‑term price instability. Warsh voted against QE2 in 2010 and criticized the Fed for going too far with post‑crisis stimulus. He has also remained critical of the Fed’s large balance sheet and spoke out against rate cuts in 2024,” Praveen Singh said.According to Praveen Singh, by choosing Warsh, Trump has effectively signalled a commitment to upholding the Federal Reserve’s independence, despite the political pressures surrounding monetary policy.Yet another factor that is at play is easing geopolitical situation. “While geopolitical tensions remain elevated, the situation has eased somewhat as Iran has signaled a willingness to engage in dialogue with the United States—provided Washington ends its threats against the Islamic Republic. The US President, meanwhile, is keeping all options open,” Praveen Singh explains.Investors are also cautious ahead of several key US macroeconomic releases next week, including ISM Manufacturing, ISM Services, and Non‑Farm Payrolls. With the Fed signaling an extended pause in rate cuts at its January 28 FOMC meeting—citing a stabilizing job market and resilient economic conditions—strong data would reinforce the central bank’s current stance, says Singh.Abhilash Koikkara, Head – Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Client Group explains that gold and silver prices tumbled and crashed due to profit booking following a strong rally in precious metals pack, followed by stop losses getting triggered and collapse of premium in the Chinese market especially for silver. Dollar index has bounced on appointment of new FED chairman who is perceived to be an interest rate hawk by the markets which added to the correction.“Meanwhile, technically, gold's relative strength index had spiked above 90 while silver’s was around 84. Normally, any reading above 70 is an indicator of an asset to be in an overbought zone and due for a correction. This has led to buyers to be on the sidelines as they would prefer some meaningful correction as the rally looked overstretched,” he tells TOI.Maneesh Sharma of Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers says that going ahead markets could now look ahead to more cues from labor market reports due next week in US which could show signs of weakening labor markets, while local markets could remain glued towards Union budget announcement due on Sunday (Budget 2026). “Any signs of changes in import duty structure could reflect directly into MCX prices as MCX futures prices include customs duty value,” he says.Also news that Shanghai Futures Exchange will widen trading limits of some silver futures to 17% from 16%, effective from settlement after market close on February 3, according to an exchange statement could now weigh further on price sentiments in Monday’s trade creating sharp volatile moves in prices in coming few sessions, Sharma says.“Overall on a technical front volatility is expected to continue in prices for few more sessions as strong supports for silver prices persist around today's low @ $ 95.10/Oz in spot markets (CMP $ 100.75/Oz). A weekly close below the same level only calls for a corrective bias towards 90 - 89 $/Oz where prices are expected to stabilize next week. On MCX this could translate to a strong support in the range of Rs. 3,04,000 - 2,92,000 per Kg (CMP Rs. 3,41,750/kg - Mar Futures. contract). Overall we expect a trading range of 95 - 107 $/Oz in next 1-2 weeks perspective. For gold trading range remains around $ 4780 - 5260 for 1-2 weeks perspective,” Maneesh Sharma tells TOI.Maneesh Sharma of Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers is still bullish on gold and silver, expected new highs in the coming quarters.“Sharp run up in prices seen in the current month was due for correction, but that does not mean that the bull run is over. We expect prices to stabilize in next 2-3 weeks perspective. Meanwhile in the medium term prices are expected to consolidate in the second half of the current quarter,” he says.“Overall we still expect prices to hit new highs in Q2-Q4 time period as we still see gold to cross $6000 /Oz in H2 2026. Also silver may see levels of $130-135 in spot market in the second half of the year,” he adds.Goldman Sachs has also said that the rally in gold prices is far from over. Anshul Sehgal, global co-head of Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, says the precious metal could continue to rise.“The main driver of the move has been global central banks’ shift from the US dollar to precious metals. These are tiny markets compared to global stocks or fixed income, so the smallest change in demand makes prices go parabolic,” Sehgal has said.Sehgal is of the view that only 5% of the world’s gold is currently held by speculators. “If a central bank decides they want to pivot away from the dollar and own more gold, that is going to move the price quite violently. Which is what we're observing. Do we expect gold to continue to appreciate exponentially as it has? No. But we’re not fussed about there being a lot of froth when it comes to precious metals,” he has said.Praveen Singh of Mirae Asset ShareKhan is also confident that the bull run in both the precious metals remains intact. He believes the bull run is supported by a broad set of powerful structural drivers. These include persistent fiscal concerns, heightened geopolitical instability, rising global fragmentation, increasingly isolationist US policies, eroding trust in the US dollar, the use of economic sanctions as a policy weapon, an unsustainable US fiscal trajectory, growing fragility in bond markets, and the weakening of the long‑standing rules‑based international order.“Silver will continue to benefit on high gold prices and record high industrial demand amid supply constraints. It remains indispensable metal in green energy transition,” he adds.So, what levels will gold and silver hit by year-end? Praveen Singh expects gold to rise to $6000-$6500 levels, while silver is expected to rise to $150. In rupee terms, gold is expected to rise to Rs 200,000 and silver can reach Rs 500,000.Abhilash Koikkara of Nuvama also believes that the bull run is far from over. “The current overbought zones can bring correction but the fundamental factors of geopolitical escalation, de-dollarisation theme and ever evolving tariff news will continue to push prices higher. From changing its status from macro event safe haven, gold and silver are now characterised as the only instruments free from any sanctions or tariffs which gives them a special status and warrant higher allocation in portfolio going ahead,” he says.“Going ahead, Iran-US conflicts and China-Taiwan escalations can bring additional geopolitical premium in precious metals pack. On the demand front, central bank buying might have slowed from record highs but we will see pick up from smaller central banks which will provide additional support to gold prices. For silver, AI related demand from data centers, solar and EV demand will continue to provide support to prices. Along with this, strong physical demand from China and India is providing additional support. Any meaningful correction can be used as an opportunity to buy as it will provide a favourable risk- reward,” he adds.Sharing targets for 2026, Abhilash Koikkara says that gold is still relatively undervalued when compared to silver and has more scope to outperform now. The gold / silver ratio might see a reversal from 50 levels which might increase the intensity of gold rally. On the international front, gold is expected to reach $6500 levels with silver touching $145 by year end. On MCX, gold is expected to target Rs. 2.15 lacs and silver is expected at Rs.5.25 lacs by year end. However, both metals can see increased volatility in 2026.","Gold prices dropped by a whopping rs 14,000 per 10 grams in delhi on friday.

Ryan Wedding and the people accused of helping his global drug network

Ryan Wedding, a former Olympic snowboarder, stood in a federal courtroom in California on Monday, facing serious charges that shocked the sports world. Wedding, now 44, is accused of running a massive drug network and ordering multiple murders, according to US authorities. Wedding was arrested last week in Mexico City and flown to Southern California, nearly a year after the FBI placed him on its Most Wanted Fugitives list. He pleaded not guilty to two federal indictments during his first court appearance. His lawyer, Anthony Colombo, strongly denied reports that Wedding turned himself in.“He was arrested,” Colombo told reporters. “He did not surrender.”FBI Director Kash Patel described Wedding as a major threat. “He is a modern-day El Chapo,” Patel said Friday. “He is a modern-day Pablo Escobar, and he thought he could evade justice.” Federal prosecutors claim Ryan Wedding led a billion-dollar drug operation uncovered during a joint investigation called Operation Giant Slalom. Law enforcement agencies from North and South America worked together on the case, according to the US Department of Justice.Wedding’s criminal history goes back years. In 2008, he was arrested for trying to buy cocaine from a US federal agent.He was convicted in 2009 and released from prison in 2011. Authorities say his alleged criminal empire grew rapidly after his release. Prosecutors also accuse Wedding of ordering murders to protect his operation. Among the victims were Canadian couple Jagtar Sidhu and Harbhajan Sidhu, who were killed in front of their daughter, Jaspreet Kaur, who suffered life-changing injuries. Authorities still think it was a case of mistaken identity.Federal officials say Ryan Wedding did not work alone. Several people linked to him are now under investigation, arrested, or facing extradition. Wedding’s wife, Miryam Andrea Castillo Moreno, has been sanctioned by the US Treasury Department over alleged money laundering. She has not been arrested, and her current location is unknown, according to Treasury and FBI officials. Castillo Moreno is originally from Nuevo Leon, Mexico, based on the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions list.His alleged girlfriend, Daniela Alejandra Acuna Macias, has also been sanctioned and banned from entering the United States. The Treasury Department said she received large sums of money from Wedding and helped gather information on his rivals.Authorities say Acuna was introduced to Wedding by Carmen Yelinet Valoyes Florez, a Colombian national accused of running a high-end escort service in Mexico City. Valoyes was arrested in November as part of Operation Giant Slalom, according to federal records.Another key figure is Deepak Balwant Paradkar, a Canadian criminal lawyer accused of advising Wedding to kill an FBI witness. “If you kill this witness, the case would be dismissed,” Paradkar allegedly told Wedding, according to Bill Essayli, first assistant US attorney for the Central District of California. Paradkar denies the claims and is fighting extradition.Andrew Clark, known as “El Dictador,” is also accused of working closely with Wedding. US prosecutors say Clark helped order murders in Canada and lived in Mexico under cartel protection. All accused individuals have not entered final pleas and remain innocent under the law, according to court records and the US Department of Justice.","Ryan wedding, 44, is accused of running a massive drug network and ordering multiple murders.

DOJ Releases Millions Of Epstein Files As Emails Make Bombshell Claims About Bill Gates | WATCH





US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who once said that he avoided being in one room with Jeffrey Epstein , had planned a trip to his private island, according to documents that the Justice Department released on Friday.The planned visit in 2012 came years after Lutnick had said he severed ties with Epstein.In December 2012, the records show, Lutnick sent an email to Epstein saying that he had a group of people including his wife and children and another family who were visiting the Caribbean. He asked where Epstein was located and whether they could visit for a meal, New York Times reported.Epstein replied through an assistant to give more information about the location of Little St. James, his private island off the coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. They eventually settled on plans for a lunch gathering.Prominent people who were close to Epstein have been scrutinised in recent years for their visits to Little St. James, but Lutnick’s planned visit had not been previously disclosed. Reached by phone on Friday, Lutnick said he could not comment about the island visit because he had not seen the latest Epstein documents.“I spent zero time with him,” Lutnick said. He then hung up.The documents suggest the visit did occur. The gathering was set for Dec. 23, 2012. A day later, an assistant to Epstein forwarded Lutnick a message from Epstein: “Nice seeing you,” it said.In a podcast interview last year, Lutnick claimed that around 2005, he and his wife had been so revolted by Epstein that they decided not to associate with him again.Lutnick said in the interview that Epstein invited them to tour his Upper East Side mansion, next door to Lutnick’s own home. When they noticed a massage table in the middle of a room, Lutnick recalled, Epstein explained that he received “the right kind of massage” every day. Lutnick said that he and his wife quickly left and decided to “never be in a room with that disgusting person ever again.”“So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy,” Lutnick said in the interview with Pod Force One. “If that guy was there, I wasn’t going, because he’s gross.”Before they connected in December 2012, an assistant to Epstein had reached out to Lutnick. “Jeffrey requested I please pass along some phone numbers to you so the two of you can possibly get together,” the assistant wrote the month before.Lutnick planned the Caribbean excursion along with his wife, Allison. She explained in an email that they would be arriving on a 188-foot yacht called “Excellence.”The documents show that Lutnick and Epstein’s lives continued to overlap in more recent years. In 2017, Epstein contributed to a charity dinner honouring Lutnick. In 2018, they exchanged emails that appear to discuss them joining forces to battle construction plans by The Frick Collection, a museum across the street from both of their homes.","Us commerce secretary howard lutnick had planned a trip to jeffrey epstein's private island, according to documents released by the justice department on friday.

A diplomatic balancing act between UK and China



What to know about UK-China relations as Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits Beijing

Geopolitical context: A reset in West-China relations?



BEIJING, CHINA - JANUARY 30: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers remarks at a UK-China Business Forum at the Bank of China on January 30, 2026 in Beijing, China. Keir Starmer undertakes a high-profile diplomatic mission to China and Japan, marking the first visit to Beijing by a British leader since 2018. Accompanied by a delegation of 50 business leaders, Starmer aims to ""reset"" relations with President Xi Jinping to stimulate UK economic growth through expanded trade and the revival of high-level economic dialogues. Starmer concludes the trip with a brief visit to Tokyo on Saturday. (Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images)





In a landmark diplomatic breakthrough, China has agreed to relax visa requirements for British citizens, allowing visa-free travel of up to 30 days for tourism and business visits, a move announced during UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer’s visit to Beijing at the end of January 2026. The agreement, hailed by leaders on both sides as a “win for people-to-people ties”, is the first major travel policy concession by Beijing toward the UK in decades and signals a potential resetting of bilateral relations that have been strained by geopolitical tensions, trade disagreements and differing values on human rights.For the first time since 2018, a British prime minister has undertaken an official visit to China, underscoring a renewed willingness to engage Beijing at the highest levels. On January 29, 2026, Sir Keir Starmer met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior leaders in the Great Hall of the People to discuss a wide range of issues, from trade and investment to global security and people-to-people exchange.The most attention-grabbing outcome was the visa-free travel agreement, under which British citizens holding ordinary passports will be able to enter China without a visa for stays of up to 30 days once the policy takes formal effect. The agreement is understood to be unilateral on China’s part, meaning British citizens benefit without reciprocal visa-free entry for Chinese nationals in the UK.This move brings the UK into alignment with more than 50 countries (including France, Germany, Australia, Japan and Canada) whose citizens already enjoy similar access to mainland China.Starmer described the agreement as “really good progress” in strengthening bilateral ties and facilitating easier travel for tourists, business leaders, academics and cultural exchange participants. He emphasised that this step would support UK businesses seeking to deepen their presence in China’s vast market while also encouraging greater cultural understanding between the two nations.The visa-free travel move is expected to deliver immediate practical benefits -According to travel advisory services, the change is particularly significant for frequent travellers who previously spent time and money, typically around £150 per visa application plus processing logistics, on securing short-stay permits. However, important caveats remain. The visa-free arrangement does not apply to long-term stays, such as work positions, full-time study or residency permits. Standard visa requirements still apply for those purposes.The visa concession was part of a broader package of agreements aimed at boosting economic cooperation between the UK and China. Starmer’s delegation included representatives from major British businesses and professional services sectors (including finance, legal, healthcare and education) signalling that the UK is seeking to expand its services sector footprint in China despite structural barriers in Chinese markets.During talks, leaders also addressed tariff reductions on UK exports such as Scotch whisky, enhancing competitive positioning for British goods in a major consumer market. Such economic gestures come as the UK seeks to diversify trade relationships and reduce over-dependence on Western markets, especially amid turbulent global trade conditions and unpredictable geopolitical shifts.The decision to engage China more deeply reflects a broader strategic posture by the UK: pursuing economic opportunity while navigating geopolitical sensitivity. Starmer has framed the visit as an effort to build “a more sophisticated relationship” with China that balances cooperation with candid discussion on contentious issues, including human rights concerns and global security dynamics.This balancing act has prompted mixed reactions on the political stage. Some voices, including former British lawmakers recently freed from Chinese travel restrictions, view engagement as a step toward constructive dialogue. Others argue that economic incentives should not overshadow persistent concerns over issues such as human rights, surveillance practices, and regional tensions.In the international arena, critics including former US President Donald Trump have described the rapprochement as “very dangerous,” arguing that closer ties with China may compromise Western strategic interests. Starmer, however, has publicly defended the UK’s approach, noting that strengthening ties with China does not require choosing between China and traditional allies such as the United States. Rather, he emphasises that nuanced engagement can help the UK navigate complex global challenges while pursuing British interests.The visa-free agreement comes at a time when multiple Western countries are reassessing their relationship with China. Canada recently received a similar commitment from Beijing for visa-free travel, reflecting a broader Chinese strategy to open its doors to global visitors while promoting economic and cultural exchange. China’s expansion of visa-free policies over recent years, which already included many European, Oceanian and Asian nations, underscores its intent to position itself as a more accessible destination for global mobility and tourism.For the UK, the agreement represents not just an easing of travel restrictions but also a symbol of warming ties after years of downturns in diplomatic engagement. Starmer and Xi’s joint references to long-term strategic cooperation reflect a mutual interest in stabilising relations even amid broader geopolitical headwinds.Despite the announcement, some details including the official start date of the visa-free travel policy have yet to be publicly confirmed by Chinese authorities. That means British travellers should continue to follow existing visa rules until the change is formally implemented.On social media and public forums, many Britons welcomed the change as a practical and people-friendly development, highlighting the travel and business opportunities it unlocks. Others noted frustration that the policy may not take effect immediately, potentially leaving travellers who planned trips under the old visa regime in limbo.Overall, the visa-free agreement between London and Beijing marks one of the most significant developments in UK-China relations in recent years.

What the Sardinia coin find reveals about Roman money and movement



How Roman follis coins kept the empire moving



How nature protected the Sardinia coins over time



Why the Sardinia coin find stands out in Roman history







A casual swim off Sardinia turned into something remarkable. Near Arzachena, a diver spotted metal glinting faintly on the seabed. Curiosity sparked immediately. Authorities were alerted. What they found was astounding: thousands of fourth-century bronze coins, reportedly between 30,000 and 50,000 pieces, many remarkably well-preserved despite centuries underwater.The coins lay scattered on sand between the beach and underwater seagrass. Small fragments of amphorae rested nearby. Some might have come from Africa, others from Asia. This stretch of coast was a busy trade route in late Roman times, bustling with merchants, ships, and goods. For a moment, the past was visible, resting quietly under the calm, blue Mediterranean waters.“The treasure found in the waters off Arzachena represents one of the most important coin discoveries in recent years,” said Luigi La Rocca, general director of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape at Italy’s Ministry of Culture. Experts say finds like this tell stories beyond collectors’ shelves. They capture moments in the economy, politics, and daily life of the Roman world.A snapshot of trade, rulers, and reforms that shaped ordinary people’s lives.It’s more than old coins. It’s a tiny, detailed window into history. The stash sits off Sardinia’s northeastern shore, near modern Arzachena. The seabed forms a shallow platform. Currents spread objects without burying them too deeply. Investigators mapped two main zones in sand, bordered by dense seagrass. That boundary is important. Plant roots hold sediment in place, while coins and ceramic fragments peek through. Amphora fragments hint at commercial movement. Some from North Africa, others from eastern provinces. Merchants apparently mixed goods from different routes on a single voyage.Most are follis, large bronze coins introduced during Diocletian’s currency reform. Early folles weighed about ten grams and had a thin silver wash. It made the base metal look respectable. Over time, silvering and weight declined as a signal of the pressures Rome faced in funding armies, bureaucracy, and public projects. Yet, face value kept everyday trade moving. By the early fourth century, folles linked people across the empire. Sailors, farmers, and merchants all used the same currency. Hoard like this helps historians track how far coins travelled and how interconnected the empire really was.Large coin groups usually tell a story. A storm might have spilled cargo. A captain might have stashed pay for the next port. Currents near Arzachena slow naturally, which could help concentrate objects. Scattering patterns suggest containers broke apart. Coins tumbled, lodged in pockets of sand, sometimes near amphora fragments. Archaeologists hope to reconstruct a voyage, its cargo, and perhaps its abrupt end.Seagrass might have saved the coins. Posidonia oceanica locks artifacts in low-oxygen sediment, slowing decay. The meadows trap particles, dampen waves, and create a quiet archive where coins and ceramics can last centuries.Even at the lower estimate, this find surpasses the Seaton Down Hoard in Britain, which held about 22,888 late Roman coins. The Sardinia discovery sets a new reference point for late Roman money in the western Mediterranean. Coins carry precise information. Icons, inscriptions, mint marks. Names of rulers. Slogans of the time. Their metal chemistry hints at water and sediment conditions. Tool marks reveal workshop practices. Matching amphora clay recipes might even link the coins to a cargo of oil or wine.","Thousands of fourth-century bronze coins, reportedly between 30,000 and 50,000 pieces.

Read Apple CEO Tim Cook’s memo to employees

Team,

I’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities, and with everyone that’s been affected.

This is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity.

This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.

I know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.

Thank you for all that you do.

Tim

Apple CEO Tim Cook has broken his silence on the Minneapolis shootings, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" that left two people dead at the hands of federal immigration agents, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" and believes America must live up to its highest ideals. In an internal memo sent Tuesday, as obtained by Bloomberg, Cook revealed he discussed the situation with US President Trump earlier this week.The memo comes as Cook faces mounting criticism for his proximity to the Trump administration. On Saturday, just hours after ICE agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti—an intensive care nurse at the US Department of Veterans Affairs—Cook was spotted at a VIP screening of the ""Melania"" documentary at the White House.""This is a time for de-escalation,"" Cook wrote in Tuesday's message to staff. ""I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they're from.""Cook said he had a ""good conversation"" with Trump where he shared these views, though he didn't specify the president's response or any commitments made. ""I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all,"" he added.The Apple chief has maintained close ties with the Trump administration since the president's re-election, becoming a regular fixture at White House events and policy briefings. Trump has frequently praised Cook in public speeches.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint for immigration enforcement tensions. Pretti's killing on Saturday followed another fatal ICE shooting on January 7, when agents killed 37-year-old poet Renée Good in the same city. Cook acknowledged the emotional toll on his workforce, praising their empathy as ""one of Apple's greatest strengths.""","Apple ceo tim cook expressed heartbreak over the minneapolis shootings, where two individuals were killed by federal immigration agents.
