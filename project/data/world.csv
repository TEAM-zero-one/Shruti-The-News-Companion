'Threatening anarchy': BJP hits out at Rahul's 'democracy' remark in Berlin; accuses him of 'wanting chaos',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/threatening-anarchy-bjp-hits-out-at-rahuls-democracy-remark-in-berlin-accuses-him-of-wanting-chaos/articleshow/126132709.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday launched a broadside against Rahul Gandhi after he targeted the saffron party while addressing an event in Germany's Berlin. BJP 's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari alleged that Rahul and Congress want ""chaos and unrest in Indian Democracy""""From Fighting Indian state, to threatening Anarchy. Rahul Gandhi's Congress with his ideological patron George Soros wants Chaos, Unrest in Indian Democracy. Rahul goes abroad for uniting such Anti India forces,"" Bhandari wrote on a post on X.""Congress hates Indian Democracy. Congress hates Bharat's progress. Rahul Gandhi's Congress wants Anarchy!"" he added.Earlier, while addressing an event at Hertie School in Berlin, Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP of ""capturing the country's institutional framework"", terming it an ""attack"" on the democratic system.Rahul alleged that the Centre has ""weaponised"" investigating agencies, suggesting a quid pro quo in which businessmen in India financially support the BJP rather than Opposition parties.""There is a wholesale capture of our instituteonal framework. Our intelligence agencies, ED and CBI, have been weaponised. ED and CBI have zero cases against the BJP, and most of the political cases are against the people who oppose them. If you are a businessman and try to support the Congress, you are threatened. BJP uses the institutional framework of India as a tool to build political power. Look at the money the BJP has and the opposition has,"" he said.""There is an attack on the democratic system. We have to find ways to counter this. We will create a system of opposition resistance that will succeed. We are not fighting the BJP, but their capture of the Indian institutional structure,"" he added.Further, the Congress leader claimed that India and the West have ""handed over"" the production of goods to China and said that Made in China goods have crippled job creation in democracies, fuelling political turbulence across India, the United States and Europe.""The West and to an extent India, have handed over production to the Chinese. China dominates production today, which means that it is difficult to give employment to a large number of people. Countries like India, the US and Germany cannot give their employment based on services. How do democracies produce in this transition? What are the models that are required, how do you think about production in a democratic environment, and what are the types of partnerships that India, the US and Europe can create for production? It will become very difficult for democracy to sustain itself if we are not able to produce,"" he said.""A huge part of the turbulence that we are seeing in Europe, India and the US, polarisation of politics, is because we are not able to give our people jobs, which is because we said: China, you produce for the world,"" he added.Rahul Gandhi is on a five-day visit to Germany.His remarks come after he had claimed that manufacturing in India is declining.During his visit to the BMW World museum in Munich, Germany, on December 17, he said, ""Manufacturing is the backbone of strong economies. Sadly, in India, manufacturing is declining. For us to accelerate growth, we need to produce more - build meaningful manufacturing ecosystems, and create high-quality jobs at scale.""However, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari refuted the Lok Sabha LoP's claim, calling it ""fake news"" against India's growth story.The BJP Spokesperson, in an X post, claimed 495 per cent growth in total electronics manufacturing in the last 10 years, with exports growing by 760 per cent, and a 14 times increase in the automobile manufacturing since 1991.","Bjp national spokesperson pradeep bhandari alleged that rahul and congress want ""chaos and unrest in indian democracy"" earlier, rahul gandhi accused the bjp of ""capturing the country's institutional framework"", terming it an ""attack"" on the democratic system.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126132725,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-238048,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

‘Not Misleading Propaganda’: Bangladesh Responds To India Over Delhi High Commission Protest

Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], December 23 (ANI): The Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) on Monday wrote to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , seeking urgent intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of Indian medical students currently studying in Bangladesh amid ongoing protests, tensions, and incidents of violence, particularly in Dhaka and surrounding regions.In the letter addressed to the Prime Minister, the Association urged him to intervene to ensure the safety and protection of Indian medical students in view of the prevailing unrest and uncertain conditions in Bangladesh.National Convenor of the Association, Nasir Khuehami, said that there are around 9,000 Indian students pursuing medical education in various colleges across Bangladesh, among them over 4,000 students from the Kashmir Valley.Khuehami said, ""We have been told by students studying in Dhaka that they have been advised to hide their identity for their own safety, which is deeply disturbing and unacceptable for young Indians who have gone abroad solely to pursue education."" He added that the reported ""death and lynching of a student leader has further shocked and alarmed the entire student community and their families back home,"" underlining the gravity of the situation and the potential risks faced by Indian students on the ground.Highlighting the plight of students, the Association said, ""Many students are confined to hostels and accommodations, facing restrictions on movement, lack of clarity, and fear of being caught in violence. Parents in India are living in constant anxiety, unsure about the safety of their children. The prevailing conditions are unsafe and uncertain, and students feel vulnerable and stranded.""Khuehami said the Association has been receiving distress calls and messages from students and their families, who are extremely anxious about the rapidly deteriorating situation and the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty prevailing there.Urging immediate action, Khuehami said, ""We urge the Prime Minister to kindly intervene to ensure the immediate safety and protection of Indian medical students in Bangladesh. We request the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian High Commission in Dhaka to urgently take up this matter with the Government of Bangladesh and seek firm assurances for the security, dignity, and well-being of our students.""The Association also appealed for evacuation if the situation worsens, stating, ""If the situation of tension and violence continues or worsens, the Government of India should kindly consider making arrangements to evacuate and bring back Indian students safely to India, so that no young life is put at risk. Timely evacuation, if required, will go a long way in preventing any untoward incident and in reassuring anxious families across the country. ""Reposing faith in the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Association said, ""India has always stood by its citizens abroad in times of crisis. We are confident that every possible step will be taken to protect our students and uphold India's responsibility towards its youth.

Sheikh Hasina Slams Yunus Over Violence In Bangladesh, Calls Out 'Hostile Statements Against India'

Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina reacted to the death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi, accusing the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of presiding over “lawlessness” and claiming the violence reflects a breakdown of governance that has worsened since her ouster.In an email interview with ANI, Hasina said the killing of the youth leader underscored a growing culture of violence under the interim administration, warning that the situation was destabilising Bangladesh internally and straining ties with neighbouring countries, particularly India.“This tragic killing reflects the lawlessness that uprooted my government and has multiplied under Yunus. Violence has become the norm while the interim government either denies it or is powerless to stop it. Such incidents destabilise Bangladesh internally but also our relationships with neighbours who are watching with justified alarm. India sees the chaos, the persecution of minorities, and the erosion of everything we built together. When you cannot maintain basic order within your borders, your credibility on the international stage collapses. This is the reality of Yunus's Bangladesh,” Hasina said.Her remarks came after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader associated with Bangladesh’s 2024 “July uprising” and spokesperson of the political platform Inqilab Mancho.Hadi was shot at close range by unidentified assailants while travelling in a rickshaw in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area on December 12. He sustained a critical gunshot injury to the head and was initially treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital before being shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition worsened.He was later airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment and admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit at Singapore General Hospital.Inqilab Mancho announced Hadi’s death in a social media post, stating that he had fought for his life for six days, according to Bangladesh news outlet Daily Star. An aspiring independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency, Hadi emerged as a prominent political figure following last year’s uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina’s removal from office.Hasina also expressed serious concern over the killing of a Hindu youth amid the unrest, linking the incident to what she described as the interim government’s failure to protect minorities and maintain basic law and order.Referring to the lynching of 27-year-old Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh district, the former PM held the Yunus-led administration responsible. Das was allegedly beaten to death by a mob over accusations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire, triggering nationwide outrage.Hasina said such incidents were contributing to diplomatic strain, particularly with India and accused the interim government of allowing extremists to dictate both domestic and foreign policy.“The strain you are witnessing is entirely of Yunus's making. His government issues hostile statements against India, fails to protect religious minorities, and allows extremists to dictate foreign policy, then expresses surprise when tensions rise. India has been Bangladesh's most steadfast friend and partner for decades. The ties between our nations are deep and fundamental; they will outlast any temporary government,” she said.She further claimed that anti-India hostility was being deliberately fuelled by radical elements emboldened under the current dispensation, pointing to attacks on diplomatic facilities, media houses and minority communities.“This hostility is being manufactured by extremists who have been emboldened by the Yunus regime. These are the same actors who marched on the Indian embassy and attacked our media offices, who attack minorities with impunity, and who forced my family and me to flee for our lives. A responsible government would protect diplomatic missions and prosecute those who threaten them. Instead, Yunus grants immunity to hooligans and calls them warriors,” Hasina alleged.Sheikh Hasina also warned of what she described as the growing influence of radical Islamist forces, claiming the interim government had released convicted terrorists and allowed extremist-linked groups to enter public life, raising alarms about Bangladesh’s secular foundations.""I share this concern, as do the millions of Bangladeshis who prefer the safe, secular state we once were. Yunus has placed extremists in cabinet positions, released convicted terrorists from prison, and allowed groups linked to international terrorist organisations to take roles in public life. He is not a politician and has no experience governing a complex nation. My fear is that radicals are using him to project an acceptable face to the international community while they systematically radicalise our institutions from within,"" Hasina said.Separately, Hasina criticised the interim government’s approach to Pakistan, arguing that major foreign policy shifts were being pursued without democratic legitimacy.She said that Bangladesh had long adhered to a balanced diplomatic principle but accused Yunus of moving hastily to reorient ties after alienating traditional allies.“Bangladesh has always believed in friendship to all, malice toward none. Of course it makes sense for our country to have a stable relationship with Pakistan, but Yunus’ headlong embrace is inappropriate. Having needlessly alienated many of our longstanding allies, he now seems desperate to find a friend on the world stage,” Hasina said.She further stressed that the interim administration lacked the mandate to undertake strategic realignments that could have long-term consequences.“The crucial point is this: Yunus has no mandate to realign Bangladesh's foreign policy. He was not elected, so he has no right to make strategic decisions that could impact generations. Once Bangladeshis can vote freely again, our foreign policy will return to serving our national interests, not the ideological fantasies of extremists who have temporarily seized power. The ties between Bangladesh and India are fundamental and will endure long after this interim government is gone,” she added.",Sheikh hasina slams interim government over death of sharif osman hadi.

Sajid Akram, one of the two men behind the deadly Bondi Beach attack on December 14, had been homeless and living in a series of short-term Airbnbs across Sydney for at least six months before the massacre, new reports show.Even after his death, his estranged wife has refused to claim his body. Now the government is responsible for burial arrangements, according to 7NewsSydney.The 50-year-old was killed during a shootout with police following the ISIS-inspired attack that claimed 15 lives, including a child, and left dozens injured. His son, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was apprehended at the scene and remains in hospital under police guard in critical but stable condition.Authorities have confirmed that Sajid Akram had travelled to Davao City in the Philippines from November 1 to November 28, just weeks before the attack. The area is known as a hotspot for Islamic State activity, and police believe he may have undergone military-style training there. Two other men from Sydney who visited the same region at the same time are now under investigation.Before the attack, the father-son duo reportedly told family members they were going on a weekend fishing trip to Jervis Bay.Instead, they opened fire from a pedestrian footbridge near Campbell Parade, targeting participants of the Jewish Chanukah by the Sea festival, as well as locals and tourists in the area. Loud bangs were heard, and people were seen fleeing for their lives.Investigations are ongoing into how the Akram men obtained high-powered weapons. Police discovered improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the shooters’ vehicle and conducted raids across Sydney, including Naveed Akram’s home in Bonnyrigg. Sajid was originally from Hyderabad and held an Indian passport. He moved to Australia in 1998 and had limited contact with his family back home. His body remains in the morgue in the Coroner's office as of now.The Bondi Beach shooting was treated as an act of terror by the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese. Israeli PM Netanyahu had earlier warned his Australian counterpart of growing anti-semitism and Jewish hate in the country.","Bondi beach terror suspect visited hyderabad six times after leaving india, telangana police reveal.

"India closer to $450m BrahMos pacts with Vietnam, Indonesia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-closer-to-450m-brahmos-pacts-with-vietnam-indonesia/articleshow/126131232.cms,".

NEW DELHI: India has moved closer to inking deals to export BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to Vietnam and Indonesia, which collectively will be worth over Rs 4,000 crore ($450 million).Russia, the joint developer of BrahMos missiles that fly at almost three times the speed of sound (Mach 2.8), has assured India that it has no objection to the precision-strike weapon being sold to Vietnam and Indonesia, defence sources said.With the assurance being given during the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov on Dec 4, a formal no-objection certificate is now awaited from Moscow. “Both Vietnam and Indonesia, after agreeing to the initial deals, may go for more orders in the future,” a source said.Once the deals are inked, Vietnam and Indonesia will become the other Asean countries after the Philippines to buy the air-breathing missiles. India had inked a $375 million contract to supply three anti-ship BrahMos coastal batteries to the Philippines in Jan 2022. “Manila, too, is likely to order more BrahMos missiles,” the source said.All three countries, incidentally, have major concerns over China’s strong-arm tactics and expansionism in the South China Sea, with confrontations escalating, especially between Manila and Beijing, over the last couple of years.India, on its part, had successfully deployed the BrahMos missiles, whose range has been increased to 450 km from the original 290 km, from Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets for targeted strikes deep into Pakistan during Operation Sindoor in May.Over the years, Indian armed forces have inked deals worth around Rs 60,000 crore with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace, with the missiles becoming the prime conventional (non-nuclear) precision-strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.India also plans to begin inducting the new 800-km BrahMos from 2028 onwards, with tests currently underway for the extended-range missiles with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades, as was earlier reported by TOI.Apart from Brahmos missiles, India wants to sell the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a 25-km range, and Pinaka multi-launch rocket systems to the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam as well as other “friendly countries” like the UAE and Brazil.While India is still in the strategically vulnerable position of being among the top three arms importers in the world, it exported a wide range of arms, ammunition, defence sub-systems and components, worth nearly Rs 24,000 crore, to around 80 countries in the 2024-25 fiscal.In this, Armenia is one of India’s biggest clients of ‘finished’ weapon systems like Akash air defence missile systems, Pinaka rocket systems and 155mm artillery guns, as was reported by TOI earlier.","India has moved closer to inking deals to export brahmos supersonic cruise missiles to vietnam and indonesia.

NEW DELHI: The India-New Zealand FTA ran into some political opposition in Wellington as the right-wing New Zealand First (NZF), a member of the ruling coalition, opposed the deal, calling it neither free nor fair. NZF leader Winston Peters, who is also the foreign minister of New Zealand, said his party would vote against the enabling legislation as and when it's introduced.""Regrettably, this is a bad deal for New Zealand. It gives too much away, especially on immigration, and does not get enough in return for New Zealanders, including on dairy,"" said Peters.However, the opposition Labour Party was reported to have indicated support for the legislation when it's introduced in Parliament. According to Peters, while New Zealand is completely opening its market to Indian products under the deal, India is not reducing the significant tariff barriers currently in place for New Zealand's major dairy products. ""The India FTA would be New Zealand's first trade deal to exclude our major dairy products -- including milk, cheese and butter. In the year to Nov 2025, New Zealand exports of these products were worth around $24 billion, or 30% of our total goods exports,"" said the minister.","The india-new zealand fta ran into some political opposition in wellington.

NEW DELHI: The conclusion of the India-New Zealand free trade agreement (FTA) in record nine months will serve as a catalyst for greater trade, investment, innovation and shared opportunities between both countries, PM Narendra Modi and his counterpart Christopher Luxon said after jointly announcing the conclusion of talks.“The FTA would significantly deepen bilateral economic engagement, enhance market access, promote investment flows, strengthen strategic cooperation between the two countries and also open up new opportunities for innovators, entrepreneurs, farmers, MSMEs, students and youth of both countries across various sectors,” said an official statement.With the strong and credible foundation provided by the FTA, both leaders expressed confidence in doubling bilateral trade over the next five years as well as an investment of $20 billion in India from New Zealand over the next 15 years, it added. The leaders also welcomed the progress achieved in other areas of bilateral cooperation, such as sports, education and people-to-people ties, and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening further the India-New Zealand partnership.“India–New Zealand FTA, that brings in $20 billion investment and offers lucrative opportunities for Indian innovators, entrepreneurs, farmers, MSMEs, students and youth will open new gateways to prosperity.

Indian envoy speaks to medical visa-seekers

DHAKA: Amid growing tensions between Bangladesh and India, Dhaka suspended Monday consular and visa services due to ""unavoidable circumstances"" from its high commission in Delhi. This even as India reopened its visa centres in Khulna, Rajshahi and Sylhet, keeping ""humanitarian needs in mind"", especially of those applying for medical visas, and despite the security threat to its diplomatic facilities.Bangladesh's move came a day after it claimed that protests near its high commission left the ""high commissioner and his family feeling threatened"". India slammed Dhaka's attempts to draw a false equivalence between protests targeting its facilities in Bangladesh and outside the Bangladeshi mission in Delhi. Dhaka's charge was trashed by the foreign ministry officials as ""misleading propaganda"".The Indian visa centre in Chittagong remains closed after a mob pelted the Indian assistant high commissioner's residence with stones on Thursday, with demonstrators coming precariously close to the diplomatic facility despite the presence of Bangladeshi security personnel. The visa services in Khulna and Rajshahi were also closed Thursday in the wake of massive ""anti-India"" protests in the country.In Dhaka, a senior Indian visa application centre official said, ""Keeping humanitarian needs in mind and despite the evolving security situation, the Indian high commission continues to operate the visa centres at Dhaka, Khulna, Sylhet and Rajshahi.""Though the centre at the Indian high commission in Dhaka was closed Wednesday after protesters had gathered near it, it was opened a day later.In a notification, Bangladesh high commission said, “Due to unavoidable circumstances, all consular and visa services from high commission in New Delhi are temporarily suspended until further notice.” Indian high commissioner Pranay Verma visited IVAC in Dhaka Monday to take stock of functioning of visa services.

Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina dismissed on Monday calls for her return to the country amid ongoing legal proceedings, saying the action against her was politically driven and insisting she would not go back under the present circumstances, even as Bangladesh witnessed fresh unrest last week, including the killing of a Hindu man.""You cannot demand my return to face my political assassination,"" Hasina said, reiterating that she has challenged Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus to take the matter to The Hague, expressing confidence that an independent court would acquit her. She said she would return only when Bangladesh has a legitimate govt and an independent judiciary.Elaborating on her position in an email interview with ANI, Hasina said the verdict delivered by International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) was not a judicial exercise but a political one, describing it as a ""political assassination in judicial robes"". She said she was denied the right to defend herself and appoint lawyers of her choice, alleging that the tribunal had been used to conduct a ""witch hunt of Awami League"".Despite allegations, Hasina said her trust in Bangladesh's constitutional framework is intact: ""Our constitutional tradition is strong, and when legitimate governance is restored and our judiciary regains its independence, justice will prevail.""Her comments follow a ruling by a Bangladesh court in Nov that found Hasina guilty of ""crimes against humanity"" in connection with the July-Aug 2024 uprising, with local media reporting that ICT-1 imposed death penalty. According to Dhaka Tribune, the tribunal convicted the former PM on all five charges of crimes against humanity.Against this backdrop of legal action and recent violence, Hasina accused the interim administration headed by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus of ""lacking democratic legitimacy"" and driving the country toward ""instability by weakening institutions and empowering extremist elements"".She also questioned the credibility of elections scheduled for Feb 2016, citing continued ban on Awami League. ""An election without Awami League is not an election, but a coronation,"" she said, alleging that Yunus is governing ""without a single vote from Bangladeshi people"" while attempting to bar a party that has won nine national mandates.""Any administration formed under such circumstances would lack moral authority and squander an opportunity for genuine national reconciliation,"" she said.Explaining her exit from Bangladesh, Hasina said she left to prevent further bloodshed and not because she feared accountability.Hasina also raised concerns about the growing influence of radical Islamist groups, alleging that Yunus has appointed extremists to cabinet positions, released convicted terrorists and allowed organisations linked to international terror networks to operate in public life.","Former bangladesh pm sheikh hasina dismissed calls for her return to the country amid ongoing legal proceedings.

NEW DELHI: Senior Sikh leader and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday condemned the disruption of a peaceful Sikh Nagar Kirtan procession in South Auckland, New Zealand, expressing concern over the threat posed to religious freedom and communal harmony.Sharing a video of the incident on X, Badal said, “Nagar Kirtan is a sacred Sikh tradition—a joyous religious parade involving the singing of hymns from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, promoting devotion, unity, and sharing of blessings with all humanity. I am glad to note that the Sikh community responded with remarkable restraint and peace despite provocation—true to Guru Sahib’s teachings of ‘Chardi kala’ and ‘Sarbat Da Bhala’. ”“Such intimidation threatens religious freedom and the spirit of universal brotherhood,” he added.Badal further urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene and raise the matter with the New Zealand government to “protect the rights of the Indian diaspora.”On Saturday, a Sikh religious procession in New Zealand was disrupted by a group of ‘Patriot’ protesters. According to reports by the NZ Herald, the group was linked to political leader Brian Tamaki’s Destiny Church, a Christian fundamentalist religious organisation.In a video shared on Tamaki’s social media, members of a group calling themselves the True Patriots of NZ were seen confronting the Sikh procession as it moved along the street. The group described themselves as “Guardians of the Kiwi Way of Life. Defenders of Faith, Flag & Family,” and said they oppose “globalism, mass immigration, and woke ideology.”The protesters displayed a large banner reading, “This is New Zealand not India.” While being kept apart from the Sikh group by police, they linked arms, performed a haka, and chanted “One true God,” “Jesus,” and “God of nation.”Inspector Matt Hoyes said around 50 protesters blocked the road in an attempt to disrupt the parade. He stated, “Police acted swiftly to ensure the parade was able to safely continue and additional officers were called in to escort the parade participants through the remainder of their route.”","Senior sikh leader sukhbir singh badal condemned the disruption of a peaceful sikh nagar kirtan procession in south auckland, new zealand.

Erika Kirk addresses Candace Owens meeting, accusations, and Egypt plane theory





Erika Kirk has spoken publicly for the first time about her private meeting with Candace Owens, and her message was calm, clear, and direct. She made it clear that she is done with public drama and wants to move forward. On December 21, Fox News Sunday shared a preview of an upcoming interview with Erika Kirk, the CEO of Turning Point USA. In the interview, she speaks with host Shannon Bream about faith, leadership, and recent controversy around the organization.In a separate clip shared by Fox News, Shannon Bream asked Erika Kirk a direct question. She asked whether Kirk had found any “common ground” with Candace Owens after meeting her face to face.Erika Kirk did not avoid the question. Instead, she explained why the meeting happened and what her goal was. She said she did not go into the meeting to argue or judge Owens. She said the meeting was about clarity and honesty.Erika Kirk said:“I’m not going to speak on her behalf. We provided what we wanted to provide to show context, and also to show we have nothing to hide. And you just let the Lord do the rest. But I’m not going to sit and judge how anyone interpreted anything outside of myself.So I pray for her. I pray for her family and let the Lord handle the rest. We’re building. I don’t have time for the noise. I said my piece, and that’s it. And we get back to work. ” This interview marked the first time Erika Kirk publicly addressed the private meeting.Candace Owens has made several serious claims against Turning Point USA since the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Over the past few weeks, Erika Kirk addressed those claims in multiple interviews and publicly asked Owens to stop spreading them.Instead of backing down, Candace Owens shifted her focus toward Charlie Kirk’s wife. That led Erika Kirk to invite Owens to a private, closed-door meeting, which she announced on X. Owens accepted the invitation.The meeting took place on December 15. Afterward, both Erika Kirk and Candace Owens posted on X and described the meeting as “productive.”However, the situation did not end there.Candace Owens later shared her own version of the meeting during a podcast episode. She continued to question official findings and refused to believe that Tyler Robinson was responsible for Charlie Kirk’s murder.During AmericaFest (AmFest), Erika Kirk appeared to respond to one of Owens’ most talked-about claims, the so-called Egyptian plane theory. Owens had claimed that two Egyptian planes were tracking Erika Kirk for years and questioned whether they were present at Provo Airport on the day Charlie Kirk was shot.While speaking on stage, Erika Kirk said:“We have 40 breakout sessions, 178 sponsors, and all 50 states represented. We have 25 countries represented, plus Puerto Rico. But I have the list here. Don’t worry, guys, Egypt is not on the list. Don’t worry about that. Oh, how funny. I say ‘Egypt,’ and my iPad turns on. That’s fun.”The comment drew strong reactions online. Later the same day, Ben Shapiro criticized Candace Owens during his AmFest speech. Owens responded by calling him a “parasite.”After AmFest ended, Candace Owens also agreed with comedian Tim Dillon, who called the event “bad reality drama,” and said on X that the event felt “out of touch and elite.”Also Read: Candace Owens Shares Shocking Fresh Witness Claim About Erika Kirk Meeting Security Before Charlie Kirk Death",Erika kirk has spoken publicly for the first time about her private meeting with candace owens.

Andrew Tate strikes massive Misfits payday despite defeat against Chase DeMoor



'HE'S NOT THE SAME ANDREW TATE' - Andrew and Tristan Tate FIRST REACTION TO CHASE DEMOOR LOSS

Andrew Tate may have lost inside the ring, but his brother Tristan insists the former kickboxing champion walked away with a massive payday. Tristan Tate claimed Andrew was set to earn $52 million from his involvement in last night’s Misfits Mania event. The fight took place in Dubai, where Tate faced Chase DeMoor in a bout that attracted major attention online.In the build-up, Andrew Tate was heavily promoted as Misfits Boxing’s new CEO, replacing KSI. Many fans believed this was a staged storyline similar to professional wrestling. However, Tristan has now suggested that while the title may have been exaggerated, Andrew did secure a significant ownership stake in the company as part of his deal to fight.The fight was a huge success for broadcaster Rumble Premium. Inside the ring, though, the night went badly for Andrew Tate. He appeared to run out of energy, was knocked down, and eventually lost to Chase DeMoor.DeMoor is best known as a reality TV personality rather than a professional boxer, making the defeat even more damaging to Tate’s fighting image.Despite the loss, Tristan Tate focused on the business side. Speaking on the Cars and Money podcast, he explained how Tate’s earnings went far beyond standard fight pay.He said the rumors about Andrew becoming Misfits Boxing’s new CEO were true in principle. According to Tristan, the deal involved demanding a 10 per cent stake in the company.He explained, “The whole rumor about Andrew as the new CEO of Misfits, that’s true. We demanded 10 per cent of the company. If Andrew fought on Misfits and then becomes the face of Misfits, your company has just gone up 50 per cent in value. So give us 10 per cent. It was a simple business negotiation.”Tristan then claimed Misfits Boxing is valued at $520 million. Based on that figure, he suggested Andrew’s ownership alone would be worth $52 million. He added that this was separate from Tate’s actual fight purse, which he chose not to disclose.Tristan Tate also admitted that the public tension involving KSI was partly for show. He said KSI remains a major owner of Misfits Boxing and understood the business advantage of bringing the Tate brothers into the promotion.The Tate brothers have often highlighted their ability to make money across different ventures. Andrew Tate has previously claimed his personal net worth is around $700 million. While the figures shared by Tristan remain unverified, they have once again placed the spotlight on how spectacle and business often outweigh results in modern influencer boxing.Also Read: Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua reportedly earn over $40-50 million each from viral Netflix boxing spectacle","Tristan tate claims andrew tate was set to earn $52 million from his involvement in last night’s misfits mania event.

Detroit Lions QB Jared Goff’s wife Christen reveals how motherhood inspired a complete makeover of both family homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/detroit-lions-qb-jared-goffs-wife-christen-reveals-how-motherhood-inspired-a-complete-makeover-of-both-family-homes/articleshow/126112162.cms,"Jared Goff wife (Instagram and Getty Images)

Jared Goff ’s wife, Christen, creates two homes with one heart

Lions star Jared Goff’s wife, Christen, stepped into motherhood with the same intention she brings to every part of her life. Since welcoming daughter Romy, her days have been shaped by movement between two cities, two homes, and one new priority. While her husband leads the Detroit Lions on the field, Christen has been quietly redefining what home means during one of the biggest transitions of her life.Life now unfolds between Los Angeles and Michigan, places tied deeply to the couple’s journey. One carries the rhythm of the ocean, the other the warmth of Midwest winters. With a newborn in tow, those spaces needed to feel safe, calm, and deeply personal. Christen approached that challenge not as a checklist, but as an emotional reset that reflects who they are becoming as a family.For Christen Goff, adapting both houses meant honoring their personalities while making room for Romy. She openly admits she is learning as she goes, sharing, “We’re so lucky to be able to live in two different places.” In California, where she grew up, the home leans into light and air. “I grew up in California, and there, we live by the beach, so our house kind of reflects that,” she says. “We live steps away from the ocean so our house definitely has more of a coastal feel, very indoor-outdoor, which we love.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Michigan tells a different story. “And then here in Michigan, our house is a little bit more cozy, kind of farmhouse country. We always have the fireplace going, even in the summer, which is kind of insane, but I would say that this house is so cozy and it just makes me want to cuddle up on the couch and watch a movie.” Each space now includes a nursery that mirrors its surroundings. “In L.A., it’s, like, boho, Bohemian,” she explains. “We have some fun antiques in there.” Michigan’s nursery leans softer. “And then this one is a little more classy,” she says. “Her nursery is so sweet here. It's very, like, muted pink tones. I went full into the girly pink.”As the holidays approach, Michigan will host Romy’s first Christmas. “We are here in Michigan through this season, so we're here, we'll be celebrating here, which is great,” Christen says, adding, “I love a California Christmas by the beach, but nothing beats a fireplace rolling with snow outside and your Christmas tree lit.”Behind the scenes, motherhood has brought exhaustion and joy in equal measure. “I feel like it's a roller coaster a bit,” she admits. Laundry piles up, routines shift, and patience gets tested. Still, perspective grounds her. “My key is chipping away day by day at everything,” she explains. “Just doing what you can and giving yourself grace.”In this season, Christen has found belonging in a new circle. “I feel like I'm part of this new club of women and we all have something in common,” she says. “Moms are superheroes.”Also Read: Travis Hunter’s wife Leanna turns heads in chic white bikini selfie during family birthday celebration","Jared goff’s wife, christen, stepped into motherhood with the same intention she brings to every part of her life.

Everything to know about Brittani, the woman keeping the Steelers QB grounded

For two decades, Aaron Rodgers has lived under a microscope where every throw, feud, and relationship was pulled into public view. Fame followed him everywhere, often blurring the line between his professional brilliance and personal choices. Yet this offseason delivered a surprise no one saw coming. The Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback quietly arrived at training camp wearing a wedding ring, setting off whispers and questions that even seasoned reporters did not anticipate.Rodgers confirmed the news himself. He was married. Not in a splashy ceremony or magazine reveal, but in the most Rodgers way possible, calm and guarded. The identity of his wife stayed mostly out of reach, though one name surfaced quietly. Brittani. And in a career filled with noise, this silence spoke volumes.Aaron Rodgers has made it clear that this chapter of his life is different. Older, more reflective, and more intentional, he no longer treats his private world as public property. During Steelers training camp, he explained how marriage reshaped his outlook, both on and off the field.“When you meet the right one, and you’re with the right one, your whole world changes in a second,” Rodgers told NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt at Steelers training camp this summer.“To have that person who unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there’s no better feeling. I’ve got the most incredible wife. I just really love her. I’m so thankful to have her by my side at the end. When you have that stability and rock behind you at the house, you feel like you can do anything. ”That sense of grounding did not appear overnight. Rodgers’ past relationships played out loudly. From Olivia Munn to Danica Patrick to Shailene Woodley, each connection carried attention, speculation, and eventually pain. Patrick later accused him of being “emotionally abusive.” Woodley reflected on their breakup with quiet sorrow, saying, “I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful.”Aaron Rodgers has not dodged accountability. In his 2024 Netflix documentary, he admitted, “I didn’t do myself any favors with some of the girls I dated after that that were in the public eye.”With Brittani, the approach changed. She avoids the spotlight entirely. Rodgers explained the reason plainly on “The Pat McAfee Show.” “It’s a sick society, isn’t it? I lived in the public eye for 20 years. I had a public relationship. How did that work out? Now I’m with somebody’s who private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye, didn’t sign up to be a celebrity.”That privacy seems to have unlocked peace. Teammates see a calmer leader. Coaches see focus. Fans see a quarterback who looks settled at last. As Aaron Rodgers enters what could be his final NFL chapter, Brittani’s quiet presence may be the steady force that keeps his world balanced, even as the stadium lights burn brighter than ever.Also Read: Who is Josh Johnson, the Commanders’ emergency QB whose NFL resume includes stops with nearly half the league",Aaron rodgers has kept his wife out of the spotlight.

Candace Owens shares witness claim linking Erika Kirk and Brian Harpole to Fort Huachuca meeting

Erika Kirk’s BIG SLAP To Candace Owens Amid Public Fight On Charlie Kirk’s Death | ‘Egypt Not Here…’





Fresh claims shared by Candace Owens have stirred heavy debate online. On her podcast Candace Owens spoke about a witness who says he saw Erika Kirk in a restricted place just hours before the reported killing of Charlie Kirk . Candace Owens said these claims come from a former special forces operative. The man, identified only as Mitch, said he saw Erika Kirk with Charlie Kirk’s head of security at a military base in Arizona. Owens made it clear this was an eyewitness account shared on her show, not an official finding.Right now, there is no confirmation from police or federal agencies backing these claims. Still, the story has drawn attention because of who is involved and the serious nature of what is being alleged. Candace Owens said she no longer trusts the official version of events and wants answers about what really happened in the final hours before Charlie Kirk’s death.During the podcast, Candace Owens interviewed Mitch, who said he was at Fort Huachuca in early September. He explained that he went there to “get records” and noticed an unusual military presence that day.Mitch said he was questioned by officials and told to leave the area for at least 24 hours.He added that at the time, he did not think much about the people he saw. Everything changed, he claimed, after news broke about Charlie Kirk.“I don’t know these people from TP USA, never been associated with it,” Mitch told Candace Owens. “I could recognise Charlie Kirk, probably.”He continued, “But what I started seeing come across and got more familiar once I saw a picture of somebody in a ponytail with those eyes, that was that person. They were there, and the head of security [Brian Harpole] was one of the people walking out with the congressman.”Mitch said he is “95 to 99 per cent” sure about what he saw. He claimed his confidence comes from strong facial recognition skills. “There’s a picture with Erika Kirk with a ponytail from her past, that person matches who I saw at Fort Huachuca in the lobby,” he said.Candace Owens said these claims raise serious questions about why key people linked to Turning Point USA would be at a secure military site that night. She stressed that she is seeking truth, not politics, and believes the public deserves much clear answers.Also Read: “Envious Of Charlie Kirk”: Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro As AmFest Clash Shakes Conservative Media","Candace owens shares fresh witness claim about erika kirk meeting security before charlie kirk death.

Who is Jeff Landry?

Trump Greenland claims







The Prime Ministers of Denmark and Greenland, in a stance against US President Donald Trump 's appointment of a special envoy, demanded respect for their territorial integrity. They insisted that the US won't take over Greenland and that the sovereignty of the nation is rooted in international law.""We have said it before. Now, we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,"" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a joint statement. ""They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security.""Trump, on Sunday, announced the appointment of Louisiana governor Jeff Landry as a special envoy to Greenland. This has added fuel to the ongoing tensions regarding Trump's intention of the US annexation of the land. Denmark's foreign minister, on Monday, told Danish broadcasters that he would summon the US ambassador to his ministry.Further in the statement, Frederiksen's office stated, ""Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the US shall not take over Greenland. We expect respect for our joint territorial integrity.""The governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, has been appointed as the special envoy to Greenland by Trump. While the exact scope of the role is yet unclear, Jeff shall still be holding the governor's office.Landry is a conservative fighter who, before winning the governor's race, was appointed as Louisiana's attorney general in 2016. Throughout his time in office, he became a frequent legal adversary of Democratic leadership, launching numerous courtroom challenges against the agendas of both the Biden administration and his predecessor, John Bel Edwards, including pandemic vaccine mandates, environmental regulations, etc.Being a staunch Trump supporter, Landry had also applauded the deployment of border patrol agents in New Orleans. The mission, known as Operation Catahoula Crunch (or ""Swamp Sweep""), set a target of 5,000 arrests of individuals without permanent legal status. Landry framed the move as a necessary strike against ""criminal illegal aliens,"" The operation sparked intense backlash for its heavy-handed approach and reports of aggressive tactics.In June 2025, Landry led a Louisiana delegation to the International Paris Air Show to boost the state’s aerospace industry and attract global investment.While Landry has little formal history with the Danish government, President Trump recently appointed him as the U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland. Landry described the volunteer role as a mission to ""make Greenland a part of the U.S.,"" sparking a diplomatic row with Denmark. This move follows Trump’s pattern of using personal loyalists to manage unconventional international priorities.Announcing the appointment of the envoy on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump went on to say that Jeff understands the importance of Greenland for the US' national security and shall be extending the US's interest.Later on Monday, reiterating the security claims, Trump said the US needed Greenland ""not for minerals"" and claimed Russian and Chinese vessels were operating extensively in the region, and said Landry would ""lead the charge.""""We need Greenland for national security,"" Trump told reporters on Monday, ""And if you take a look at Greenland, you look up and down the coast, you have Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.""In the initial months of his second term, Trump had expressed a strong interest in taking over the largely self-governing island territory.
