Satellite imagery suggests India's missile hit Pakistan's nuclear-hub Kirana Hills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/satellite-imagery-suggests-indias-missile-hit-pakistans-nuclear-hub-kirana-hills/articleshow/122791325.cms,"This image shows the impact location of India's missile strike on Pak’s Kirana Hills in May, geo-intel researcher Damien Symon posted on X

NEW DELHI: More than two months after the Indian govt denied targeting Kirana Hills, where a chunk of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal is believed to be located, fresh imagery from Google Earth, captured in June, appears to indicate that a missile indeed hit the strategically sensitive site in Pakistan’s Sargodha district.On May 10, India targeted several key Pakistani military installations as part of Operation Sindoor to avenge the horrific killing of tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam by terrorists linked to Pakistan-based terror groups.The satellite images were analysed and shared by well-known satellite imagery expert and geo-intelligence researcher Damien Symon on X. “Imagery update from Google Earth of the Sargodha region, Pakistan, captured in June 2025, shows — 1. The impact location of India’s strike on Kirana Hills in May 2025; 2. Repaired runways at Sargodha airbase post-India’s strikes in May 2025,” he shared.Kirana is a heavily-fortified area associated with Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme. It’s believed to house an underground nuclear weapons storage facility and serve as a site for nuclear research and testing, including subcritical nuclear tests conducted in the 1980s.The area is considered strategically important because of the radar stations and tunnels, supposed to be meant for military purpose, located there. The site’s proximity to the Sargodha airbase (now rechristened Mushaf airbase) only adds to its strategic importance .In the immediate wake of Operation Sindoor, the IAF had denied reports that it hit Kirana Hills.Replying to a question on Kirana Hills in a press conference on May 12, Director General of Air Operations Air Marshal AK Bharti had said, “Thank you for telling us that Kirana Hills houses some nuclear installations. We did not know about it. We have not hit Kirana Hills. I did not brief in my briefing yesterday.” However, DGMO Bharti’s peculiar smile while answering that question then went viral.To an X user’s question on whether the Indian missile strike “indicates that the explosion was deep inside and whether this place which was struck a point of significance like an entrance or an exit”, Symon replied, “No, this along with earlier imagery, neither indicate any subterranean impact or penetration, its just one side of a hill with nothing of value in its immediate vicinity, must've been a warning strike on India’s part, tunnels etc are further away & don’t show any damage. ”In addition to the impact site, the satellite images also showed repaired runways at the Sargodha airbase, further indicating damage sustained during the Indian strikes in May. The rapid repairs suggest the airbase was considered a high-priority strategic asset.India had launched around 15 BrahMos missiles and other precision weapons on the night of May 9-10, targeting key Pakistani airbases. The operation, carried out by the IAF, damaged 11 out of Pakistan’s 13 major airbases, delivering a significant blow to the rival country’s air defence network and military infrastructure.It was Symon who had earlier dismissed certain Pakistan media outlets’ claims that their military had targeted the Adampur airbase in Punjab allegedly damaging a Su-30MKI and destroying a Russia-developed S-400 air defence system. To dismiss these assertions, Symon had then provided imagery from March 2025, well before the conflict, which depicted a MiG-29 undergoing routine maintenance.After the conflict ended, PM Narendra Modi went to the Adampur airbase and posed with security personnel with an S-400 missile defence battery in the background, debunking Pakistan’s claims.","Kirana is a heavily-fortified area associated with pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme.

'Friendship, Huglomacy': Jairam Ramesh Slams Modi Over Trump’s 'Jets-Down' Claim | Monsoon Session

BJP's reaction

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s silence following fresh comments made by US President Donald Trump about mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.This time, Trump went a step ahead and claimed that ‘five jets were shot down’ in the conflict.Sharing a video of Trump’s remarks, Gandhi posted on X: “Modi ji, what is the truth about the 5 jets? The nation has a right to know!”Rahul’s post came as Trump, in what is now his 24th such claim, said at a private Republican dinner that he helped stop a war between India and Pakistan using trade threats. Trump claimed that “planes were being shot out of the air… five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down, actually.”Senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP P Chidambaram also criticised the government’s silence.“After President Trump’s latest statement, what does the government of India have to say? Silence is no answer,” he wrote on X.“I would like to believe the government of India, but if the government does not state the truth — does not say anything at all on the outcomes of the 5-day war — what do we believe?”, he added.Responding sharply to Rahul Gandhi’s post, BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya accused the Congress leader of echoing anti-India sentiments.In a post on X, Malviya wrote, “Rahul Gandhi’s mindset is that of a traitor.” He argued that Trump never explicitly mentioned India while speaking about the downing of five jets, and questioned why Gandhi assumed the aircraft belonged to India.“Why not assume they were Pakistan’s? Does he have more sympathy for Pakistan than for his own country?” Malviya asked.Taking a direct swipe, he added, “Whenever the country’s army teaches the enemy a lesson, Congress gets riled up. Anti-India sentiment is no longer just a habit for Congress; it’s become their identity.” Malviya ended his attack by questioning Gandhi’s allegiance: “Rahul Gandhi, tell us — are you Indian or Pakistan’s spokesperson?”The Congress party earlier said PM Modi’s silence was a compromise of India’s national honour.“Trump keeps repeating this, and PM Modi remains silent. Why is the nation’s honour being bartered for trade?” the party posted.Congress MP Jairam Ramesh also weighed in and said that the PM must make a statement in Parliament. “Just two days before the Monsoon Session of Parliament begins, the Trump missile gets fired for the 24th time,” he said, highlighting Trump’s repeated claims that a potential nuclear conflict was stopped due to US pressure linked to trade talks.Ramesh also referred to PM Modi’s past closeness with Trump, including events like ‘Howdy Modi’ in 2019 and ‘Namaste Trump’ in 2020. “The Prime Minister must respond himself in Parliament. No substitute batsman will do,” he added.Trump has claimed multiple times that he used trade pressure to stop escalating tensions following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.India responded with Operation Sindoor on May 7, striking nine terror camps. Pakistan retaliated with drones and missiles, which were intercepted by Indian air defences.India later targeted 11 Pakistani airbases in precision strikes.Though Trump insists his trade warnings helped prevent further escalation, India maintains that the ceasefire came after Pakistan’s director general of military operations reached out to his Indian counterpart.","Congress leader rahul gandhi questioned prime minister narendra modi’s silence following fresh comments made by us president donald trump about mediating a ceasefire between india and pakistan.

Yes, the public deserves clarity No, it may hinder the process

NEW DELHI: Following a barrage of reports in the western media that have squarely blamed AI 171 captain for switching off fuel supply to the doomed Air India Dreamliner leading to its June 12 crash, the American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has now termed those articles “premature and speculative. ”In a statement, NTSB chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said: “Recent media reports on the Air India 171 crash are premature and speculative. India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) just released its preliminary report. Investigations of this magnitude take time. We fully support the AAIB’s public appeal, which was released Thursday, and will continue to support its ongoing investigation. All investigative questions should be addressed to the AAIB. ”The appeal comes after AAIB on Thursday called out “irresponsible” drawing of “conclusions through selective and unverified reporting.” The bureau had issued this statement after The WSJ in its latest report on the issue said, “…captain turned off switches that controlled fuel flowing to the plane’s two engines” accidentally or deliberately.But almost everyday reports in the western media come out with reports that have alleged details of the crash which the Indian authorities like AAIB are yet to deny.The preliminary report had identified that first officer Clive Kunder was the pilot flying the doomed AI 171 while Captain Sumeet Sabharwal was the pilot monitoring. The confusion partially stems from AAIB’s prelim report which did not contain any cockpit voice recorder (transcript) and a solitary indirect quote from the same. “One of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” says the AAIB report without identifying which pilot said what.An Italian newspaper has now cited the CVR with time stamps. A translation of this latest in a series of reports coming from the west amid radio silence from authorities in India reads:“At 13:38:39, the aircraft lifts off.At 13:38:42, the engines are starved of fuel while the plane is climbing at 180 knots (333 km/h).At 13:38:44, a microphone attached to the first officer’s seat records him saying in shock:“Why did you shut off the engines?”One second later, the captain’s microphone picks up a vague:“I didn’t do it.”Kunder isn’t convinced and repeats the question for another six seconds.While Kunder is piloting the jet, the captain is supposed to be monitoring.Kunder’s hands were on the yoke and his mind focused on airspeed, heading, and pitch.Even if he didn’t see it, he almost certainly knew the captain had moved the switches: the sound of the levers being flipped down is unmistakable, confirmed by multiple pilots.”TOI has not been able independently verify whether the contents of this Italian media report are correct or not.Pilots and aviation experts in India have blamed the AAIB report for raising more questions than it answers and they have also slammed the reports in the western media.",Reports in western media have squarely blamed ai 171 captain for switching off fuel supply to the doomed air india dreamliner leading to its june 12 crash.

Operation Sindoor is not over, it continues.”Further talking about halting strikes few days after launching Operation Sindoor on May 7, he said India is a peaceful and nonviolent nation rooted in the philosophies of Buddha, Mahaveer, and Gandhi. “We do not wish to kill even living beings. How can we target human beings?

1st Parliament session after Operation Sindoor set to open on stormy note,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1st-parliament-session-after-operation-sindoor-set-to-open-on-stormy-note/articleshow/122790029.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Demonstrating unity over the parliamentary agenda, opposition Saturday said its demand for discussion on Pahalgam terror attack-Operation Sindoor and “drift” in foreign policy is non-negotiable, and PM Narendra Modi should reply to the debate — an apparent red line that threatens a stormy monsoon session which gets under way Monday. The opposition has listed the controversial “special intensive review” of Bihar electoral rolls as another major issue for discussion.The opposition argued that US President Donald Trump has been speaking non-stop about having forced cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan by using trade as the bait, and only PM Modi, who has allegedly been silent on the issue, can reply to him.Just how much is govt willing to accommodate the opposition’s demand — subjects of discussion, duration of debate, PM’s reply — would decide the trajectory of the monsoon session. But the govt appears to have made up its line of defence for the opposition’s charge on Pahalgam-Sindoor. Official sources said the treasury will focus on how it has shown “zero tolerance” towards terrorism and its sponsors, and didn’t hesitate to target the terror hideouts deep inside Pakistan territory. They refuted allegation that PM has been silent on Trump’s mediation claim, pointing out that in a one-on-one telephonic chat the PM had rejected Trump’s assertion that he leaned on a reluctant India to suspend Operation Sindoor , pointing out that India decided to pause fire on May 10 after Pakistan conveyed its willigness to do so through military channels.Although the expected confrontation can potentially disturb govt’s plan to get eight bills passed, it has in the recent past been able to achieve its legislative agenda by working around protests.The INDIA bloc Saturday evening brainstormed on issues of “national concern” in a virtual meeting, that saw the participation of 24 parties and included Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, K C Venugopal, Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Dipankar Bhattacharya (CPI-ML), N K Premachandran (RSP), Abhishek Banerjee (TMC), Tejashwi Yadav (RJD), Ramgopal Yadav (SP), Omar Abdullah (NC), Hemant Soren (JMM) and Tiruchi Siva (DMK). Rahul is learnt to have pushed for a united fight in Parliament.Aam Aadmi Party which had decided to disengage itself from the opposition grouping, did not attend the meeting.Another contentious issue in the session would be the “attack on migrants across the country”. TMC’s Banerjee, CPI (ML)’s Bhattacharya, and other netas highlighted that migrants from Bengal and other regions were being attacked. They linked it to the voters’ review. The discussion on migrants and voters rolls in the meeting suggests opposition may be unrelenting on the SIR.BJP is sure to return fire by saying that the scrutiny of voters was consistent with the Constitution which lays down that only Indian citizens have the right to vote, and by accusing the oppoosition of trying to shield infiltrators from Bangladesh as part of their “votebank politics”.Amid the differences between the govt and the opposition, a rare bipartisanship will see the Lok Sabha bring a motion to impeach Justice Yashwant Varma for alleged corruption. But even here, a fresh faultline is the pendency of the impeachment notice submitted by the opposition against Justice Shekhar Yadav of Allahahad HC for “hate speech”. While the opposition is pushing for Yadav’s sacking, the govt is reluctant to entertain it.",The opposition has listed the controversial “special intensive review’ of bihar electoral rolls as another major issue for discussion.

SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir administration deployed a heavy contingent of police and paramilitary forces outside the Congress headquarters in Srinagar on Saturday, preventing a planned march demanding the restoration of full statehood.Congress’s J&K unit chief, Tariq Hameed Karra, and party general secretary G A Mir, were present at the party office to lead the march to the divisional commissioner’s office, where they intended to submit a memorandum addressed to the Prime Minister. However, police sealed the main gate and barred party workers from leaving the premises.“This is undemocratic and a sign of administrative frustration,” Karra told reporters, alleging that Congress workers from various parts of the Valley were prevented from entering Srinagar.He added that the party would intensify its campaign during the upcoming Parliament session.Mir criticised the Centre for failing to restore J&K’s statehood even ten months after an elected govt was formed. “The Centre has not moved an inch in this direction.

'Time For Revival...': Russia's Big Unity Call To Rivals India & China | 'RIC Troika Will...'

(With inputs from agencies)

BEIJING/NEW DELHI: China on Thursday expressed its support for Russia’s initiative to revive the dormant Russia-India-China (RIC) troika.Russian news portal Izvestia on Thursday quoted Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko as saying that Moscow expects the resumption of the RIC format and is negotiating on this issue with Beijing and New Delhi.“This topic appears in our negotiations with both of them. We are interested in making this format work, because these three countries are important partners, besides being the founders of BRICS,” Rudenko said.“Therefore, the absence of this format, in my opinion, looks inappropriate. In this regard, we expect that the countries will agree to resume work within the framework of the RIC — of course, when relations between these states reach a level that allows them to work in a trilateral format,” he said.In India, the ministry of external affairs said RIC is a consultative format where the three countries discuss global issues and regional issues of interest to them. “As to when this particular RIC format meeting is going to be held, it is something that will be worked out among the three countries in a mutually convenient manner,” said the spokesperson.Asked for his reaction to Rudenko’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Thursday said, “China-Russia-India cooperation not only serves the respective interests of the three countries but also helps uphold peace, security, stability and progress in the region and the world.”China stands ready to maintain communication with Russia and India on advancing the trilateral cooperation, he said.The Russian and Chinese interests in the revival of RIC followed the recent visit of foreign minister S Jaishankar to China to take part in the SCO foreign ministers meeting, during which he held talks with his Chinese and Russian counterpaerts Wang Yi and Sergei Lavrov.Joint work in the RIC format was stalled, first because of the Covid pandemic and then by the India-China military standoff at eastern Ladakh in 2020.",China expresses its support for russia’s initiative to revive the dormant russia-india-china troika.

What is The Resistance Front (TRF)?



The United States on Thursday designated The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of the banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).The TRF -- the group responsible for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people.The US department of state, led by secretary Marco Rubio , said in a statement that TRF is a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy and front, and that it had claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack.The statement said the group has also carried out multiple assaults on Indian security forces, including as recently as 2024.""Today, the Department of State is adding The Resistance Front (TRF) as a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). TRF, a Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) front and proxy, claimed responsibility for the April 22, 2025, Pahalgam attack which killed 26 civilians. This was the deadliest attack on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks conducted by LeT.

NEW DELHI: India can arrange alternative supplies if Russian oil exports are sanctioned, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday in what is seen as the first official reaction to the US and EU threat of secondary sanctions for buying those barrels.“India has diversified the sources (of oil). I am not worried at all. If something happens, we will deal with it. There is sufficient supply available,” Puri said at an industry event.Separately, the foreign ministry said govt’s overriding priority was to secure the energy needs of its people, while also cautioning against any double standards on the issue.The comments, in response to media queries, followed NATO chief Mark Rutte’s threat, echoing the US, that countries like India, China and Brazil would take a battering for buying Russian exports.“Let me reiterate, and I have said this in the past as well. Securing energy needs of our people is understandably an overriding priority for us,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.“In this endeavour, we are guided by what is there on offer in the markets, as also by the prevailing global circumstances. We would particularly caution against any double standards on the matter,” he added. India has in the past too accused the West of having double standards on the issue, saying that European countries have themselves benefited from importing Russian energy for prolonged periods.Puri said India has built up “navigational resilience” by expanding the sourcing of oil from 40 countries against 27 countries earlier. “India has been clear that it will buy oil from wherever it has to. The prime minister’s commitment, in the final analysis, is to the Indian consumer,” he said.In addition, Puri said, more oil was coming into the global market from countries such as Brazil, Guyana and Canada that are not members of the OPEC+ grouping. “If a major source goes off the market, you diversify. The current debate in the oil market is whether prices will be in the range of $65-70 or $60-65 (per barrel),” he said.","Petroleum minister hardeep singh puri said india can arrange alternative supplies if russian oil exports are sanctioned.

NEW DELHI: The US Department of State on Friday designated The Resistance Front (TRF), which claimed responsibility for the April 22 Pahalgam massacre, a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).Highlighting the TRF's involvement in multiple attacks against India, including the deadly Pahalgam attack, the state department said the decision reflected the Trump administration’s ""commitment to protecting US national security, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice following the Pahalgam attack"".""TRF and other associated aliases have been added to LeT’s designation as a FTO and SDGT pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and Executive Order 13224, respectively.

Amendments to FTO designations go into effect upon publication in the Federal Register,"" the statement read.The April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam's Baisaran meadow, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, was a closely guarded conspiracy hatched by Pakistan spy agency ISI and terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) on the directions of the country’s political and military brass, and executed exclusively by Pakistani terrorists.In what sources have described an LeT-ISI joint project akin to the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) gave specific directions to Pakistan-based Lashkar commander Sajid Jutt to deploy only foreign terrorists for the gruesome targeted killings in Pahalgam’s Baisaran valley.To ensure complete secrecy, no Kashmiri terrorists were taken on board, and instead, LeT foreign terrorists operating in J&K for sometime were told to execute the killings while ensuring minimal local involvement on a “need-to-know” basis.The Pahalgam attack squad was led by Sulaiman, a suspected former Pakistani special forces commando, who had trained at the LeT Muridke hub in Pakistan’s Punjab province before crossing the LoC in 2022 with his M-4 weapon to enter the Jammu region. Two other Pakistani terrorists were members of the squad.Satellite phone analysis has revealed that Sulaiman’s location on April 15 was in Tral forest, indicating he was in the vicinity of the attack site at Baisaran for almost a week before the incident. Sulaiman was also involved in the April 2023 attack on an Army truck in Poonch, in which five soldiers were killed. However, he laid low for the next two years, before carrying out the ISI-LeT mission.Sources did not reveal the identities of the two other Pakistani terrorists who selectively gunned down the 26 civilians — all men and 25 of them being Hindus.There are currently about 68 foreign terrorists and three local terrorists active in the Valley. Only one local terror recruitment has been reported so far this year.","The us department of state on friday designated the resistance front (trf) as a foreign terrorist organisation (fto) and a specially designated global terrorist (sdgt) the april 22 terrorist attack in pahalgam's baisaran meadow, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, was a closely guarded conspiracy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122683606,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-449979,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) on Wednesday raised serious concerns over the preliminary findings and public commentary surrounding the crash of Air India Flight AI171, which went down in Ahmedabad shortly after takeoff en route to London.In an official statement, the FIP said, ""We register our dissatisfaction with the exclusion of pilot representatives from the investigation process. We also firmly object to how the preliminary report has been interpreted and presented publicly.""The federation criticised the report for lacking comprehensive data and relying heavily on ""selectively paraphrased cockpit voice recordings"" that appear to imply pilot error and question the competence of the flight crew. ""This approach is neither objective nor complete,"" the FIP said, urging members and the public not to draw conclusions prematurely.""Assigning blame before a thorough, transparent, and data-driven investigation is both premature and irresponsible.

Melania Trump once praised Taylor Swift despite Donald Trump’s public jabs

At the same time, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce shared a low-key moment in Ohio

A surprising ally in an ongoing political-cultural tug-of-war



In a surprising moment from summer 2025, Melania Trump broke ranks with her husband’s longtime criticism of Taylor Swift , offering rare praise for the pop icon. Her unexpected compliment came just as Swift enjoyed a quiet Ohio lunch date with Travis Kelce, creating a memorable intersection of politics, pop culture, and heartfelt romance away from headlines.In the summer of 2025, just days before America’s Independence Day celebrations, a moment of unexpected admiration made headlines — and it didn’t come from a Swiftie. During a visit to a Washington, D.C. children’s hospital, Donald Trump's wife Melania Trump, often viewed as carefully distant from her husband's politics, offered a rare public compliment to pop superstar Taylor Swift, saying “She is very talented. ”The comment, shared during a cheerful arts-and-crafts session with young patients, came at a particularly ironic time. President Donald Trump had just taken a jab at Taylor Swift on Truth Social, claiming she was “no longer hot.”The contrast between the former First Lady’s warm praise and her husband’s latest attempt to diminish the singer’s influence was impossible to ignore — and sparked a flood of online reaction.For a cultural figure like Taylor Swift, who has sparred with Trump over voting rights and women’s issues since 2018, Melania’s words felt like a small but symbolic gesture.While political commentary swirled, Taylor Swift stayed unbothered — finding joy far from the noise with her partner, NFL star Travis Kelce. Just as Melania's words were making waves, Swift and Kelce were spotted enjoying a quiet lunch date at Jojo’s Bar near Kelce’s hometown in Ohio. Bar owner John Ponicky later described their visit as “wonderful,” noting the couple’s down-to-earth charm and kindness.It was the kind of moment that defined the Swift-Kelce romance during that era — intimate, genuine, and removed from the Hollywood flashbulbs. Their relationship, built on shared admiration and mutual respect, often unfolded in places that felt more heartland than headline. Whether supporting each other’s careers or sneaking in peaceful afternoons in Ohio, they captured fans’ attention with simplicity and sincerity.As 2025 rolled on, Melania Trump’s comment stood out for its timing and tone. Taylor Swift remained one of the most influential cultural voices of the generation — politically outspoken, fiercely independent, and firmly in control of her image. That someone from the Trump circle, especially Melania, would break ranks to acknowledge Swift’s talent was a quiet but notable departure.In retrospect, this throwback moment reminded us that even in the most polarized public spheres, admiration can surface in the most unexpected places — often without fanfare, just a soft-spoken truth shared with a child.Also Read: Are Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce halting Selena Gomez’s wedding?

Why did Trump sue?



What was in the 2003 birthday letter?



Epstein's death: Suicide or something more? Debate still rages







US President Donald Trump has filed a libel and slander lawsuit against Dow Jones, News Corp, two Wall Street Journal reporters, and the paper’s owner Rupert Murdoch.The legal action comes just a day after Trump threatened to sue WSJ after it released a report alleging he had sent a sexually suggestive birthday letter to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.In a post on Truth Social, Trump himself announced that he has filed a 'powerhouse lawsuit.'""We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS “article” in the useless “rag” that is, The Wall Street Journal,"" the MAGA supremo said.""This historic legal action is being brought against the so-called authors of this defamation, the now fully disgraced WSJ, as well as its corporate owners and affiliates, with Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson (whatever his role is!) at the top of the list,"" Trump added.The lawsuit was filed in the federal court for the Southern District of Florida, based in Miami. A full copy of the complaint has not yet been made public.The Wall Street Journal had reported that, in 2003, then-real estate mogul Donald Trump allegedly sent Jeffrey Epstein a birthday letter -- complete with a nude illustration, Trump's initials in a compromising place, and a reference to their shared “secret.”Furthermore, to calm anger among his Republican base over Epstein-related conspiracy theories, Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony from the prosecution against Epstein.Bondi, in a filing submitted in New York, cited the “extensive public interest” in the case to justify the unusual legal step of requesting access to what is typically sealed testimony.MAGA bigwigs like US vice president JD Vance, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and right-wing commentator Laura Loomer all defended Trump after the WSJ report came into light.Trump and Epstein had a decade-long bond before parting their ways 15 years ago, as the US president claims.The leather-bound album, made for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday, has come back into public focus after WSJ said it had reviewed a copy that included a letter attributed to Donald Trump. The album was reportedly put together by Ghislaine Maxwell and included personal messages from several of Epstein’s well-known associates.According to WSJ, the page linked to Trump contains several lines of typewritten text, framed by the outline of a naked woman drawn in thick black marker. The report says: “A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.” The note is written as a pretend third-person conversation between Trump and Epstein. It ends with the line: “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.”Epstein, who knew Trump and other powerful men for years, was found dead in a New York jail cell in 2019 while waiting for trial on charges of sexually abusing underage girls in New York and Florida. His death was officially ruled a suicide, but it sparked many conspiracy theories, especially among Trump’s far-right supporters, who believe in a global network of elite paedophiles.Democrats believe Epstein was murdered to stop him from revealing the names of more high-profile people involved in the scandal.Since returning to power for a second term in January, Trump has faced growing demands from his supporters to reveal what they believe is Epstein’s secret list of clients. However, Bondi appeared to close the door on that speculation with an official memo in July declaring that no such list exists.","Us president donald trump has filed a libel and slander lawsuit against dow jones, news corp, two wall street journal reporters, and the paper’s owner rupert murdoch.
