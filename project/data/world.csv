Netanyahu Links Modi’s Israel Visit To ‘Alliance Against Radical Axes’, Calls India 'Global Power'

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu highlighted the upcoming visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Israel during a Cabinet meeting on Monday.He described the relationship between the two countries as “an axis of nations committed to stability and progress,” emphasizing their partnership in innovation, security, and shared strategic goals.""This morning, at the opening of our Cabinet meeting, I spoke about the historic visit of my dear friend, Prime Minister @narendramodi, to Israel this coming Wednesday. 🇮🇱🤝🇮🇳. The bond between Israel and India is a powerful alliance between two global leaders. We are partners in innovation, security, and a shared strategic vision. Together, we are building an axis of nations committed to stability and progress,"" Netanyahu said through a post on X.Netanyahu also emphasised that the partnership between Israel and India is expanding, spanning areas from AI to regional cooperation.Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli prime minister praised India’s rising global influence ahead of PM Modi’s visit. Speaking about the close ties between New Delhi and Tel Aviv, Netanyahu tweeted that the visit would “express the special relationship” forged over recent years between Israel and India, and between himself and PM Modi.On the diplomatic front, Netanyahu shared his vision of building a regional network of alliances, describing it as a “hexagon” encompassing India, Arab and African nations, Mediterranean countries like Greece and Cyprus, and select Asian nations.He said he plans to present the framework in a more detailed and organized manner in the future.This will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s second visit to Israel, following his landmark 2017 trip that made him the first Indian prime minister to travel to the country.The visit comes amid developments linked to the Board of Peace meeting held on February 19, an initiative that emerged from former US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza ceasefire plan endorsed by the UN Security Council.The initiative has since broadened in scope, with officials saying around 35 countries have committed to join and about 60 invited. Trump has suggested the body could eventually assume some functions currently carried out by the United Nations.","Netanyahu links modi’s israel visit to ‘alliance against radical axes’, calls india 'global power' israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu highlighted the upcoming visit of prime minister narendra modi to israel during a cabinet meeting on monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128697535,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-711542,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Indian Embassy In Mexico Issues Advisory For Nationals After Killing Of Drug Lord 'El Mencho'

NEW DELHI: The Embassy of India on Monday issued an advisory asking Indian nationals in several parts of Mexico to remain indoors following a major security operation that killed a top cartel leader and sparked widespread violence.Mexican authorities said Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, was wounded in a clash with soldiers in Tapalpa and died while being flown to Mexico City.“Dear all Indian nationals in Mexico: There are ongoing security operations and related road blockages and criminal activity, Indian nationals in Jalisco State (areas of Puerto Vallarta, Chapala, and Guadalajara), Tamaulipas State (areas of Reynosa and other municipalities), areas of Michoacan State, Guerrero State, and Nuevo Leon State should shelter in place until further notice,” the Indian Embassy said.“For assistance please contact the Embassy of India at +52 55 4847 7539,” it added.Officials said six suspected cartel gunmen were killed in the operation, three soldiers were wounded and taken to hospital in the capital, and two suspects were arrested. Authorities also seized a cache of weapons, including rocket launchers capable of taking down aircraft and destroying armoured vehicles.The strike in western Jalisco was described by officials as one of the most significant blows to organised crime since the arrests of Joaquín Guzmán and Ismael Zambada García, co-founders of the Sinaloa cartel.Within hours of the announcement, cartel gunmen set vehicles ablaze, blocked highways and clashed with security forces, spreading retaliatory violence across at least five states and paralysing transport networks.Amid the unrest, the United States Department of State and Canadian authorities also urged their citizens in parts of Mexico to shelter in place due to violence, road blockages and flight cancellations.","Mexican authorities said nemesio rubén oseguera cervantes, leader of the jalisco new generation cartel, was wounded in a clash with soldiers.

Pakistan Strikes Afghanistan; Massive Civilian Casualties Reported In Overnight Air Attacks | WATCH

NEW DELHI: India on Sunday strongly condemned Pakistan’s overnight airstrikes on neighbouring Afghanistan during the holy month of Ramadan. The strikes reportedly targeted alleged terror hideouts that Islamabad has blamed for recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.In an official statement, the ministry of external affairs highlighted the casualties of women and children in the attack. “In response to media queries about Pakistan’s airstrikes on Afghanistan, Official Spokesperson Shri Randhir Jaiswal said: India strongly condemns Pakistan’s airstrikes on Afghan territory that have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, during the holy month of Ramadan. ”Meanwhile, Kabul has repeatedly denied allegations that armed groups are using Afghan territory to launch attacks against Pakistan.Afghanistan’s ministry of defence said on Sunday that “dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children, were martyred and wounded” after airstrikes hit a school and residential homes in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika.Pakistan said it killed 70 terrorists in military strikes targeting at least seven militant hideouts inside Afghanistan, describing the action as retaliation for recent rebel attacks in the country.“Afghanistan has long been exporting terrorism. Pakistan is taking all actions to secure the life and property of its citizens,” Pakistan’s State Minister for Interior, Talal Chaudhry, said while speaking on Geo News.Earlier, Pakistan’s ministry of information and broadcasting confirmed that the strikes were carried out in response to recent suicide bombings in Islamabad, Bajaur and Bannu. Kabul, however, warned that it would deliver a “necessary and measured response” to the attacks.In the latest incident, an army lieutenant colonel and a soldier were killed in a suicide bombing in the Bannu area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.According to a statement from Pakistan’s ministry of information and broadcasting, the government has conclusive evidence that the recent terrorist attacks, including one at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, as well as attacks in Bajaur and Bannu, followed by another incident in Bannu on Saturday, were allegedly carried out by Khwarij militants acting on the direction of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers.The ministry said responsibility for the attacks was claimed by Afghanistan-based Pakistani Taliban belonging to Fitna-al-Khwarij (FAK) and its affiliates, as well as the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP).Fitna-al-Khwarij is a term used by the Pakistani state to refer to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).",Pakistan said it killed 70 terrorists in military strikes targeting at least seven militant hideouts inside afghanistan.

"Beware of digital fraud, do KYC via official channels: PM in ‘Mann Ki Baat’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/beware-of-digital-fraud-do-kyc-via-official-channels-pm-in-mann-ki-baat/articleshow/128692463.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday issued a blunt warning against the growing menace of digital fraud and so-called “digital arrest” scams, flagging how ordinary people — from senior citizens to families saving for children’s education — are being duped of their hard-earned money by cyber criminals.Even as he cautioned people to stay vigilant and adhere to official banking processes, the PM used his monthly Mann Ki Baat address to spotlight a contrasting story of technology being used for national good — showcasing how artificial intelligence is helping India preserve, restore and reimagine its ancient knowledge systems for a global audience.In his monthly radio address, Modi said fraudsters were increasingly targeting innocent citizens.“In ‘Mann Ki Baat’, I have spoken to you at length about digital arrest… still such incidents are happening around us, that are unpardonable,” he said. “We often come to know that a senior citizen has been swindled of their lifelong earnings.”The PM cautioned people against fake calls, messages and links disguised as official communication. “Someone calls up and says, ‘I am a big officer. You have to share some details.’After this, innocent people do just that,” he said, stressing that KYC or re-KYC should be completed “only through your bank branch, official app, and authorised medium”. He urged citizens not to share OTPs, Aadhaar numbers or bank account information, adding, “most importantly, keep changing your password from time to time. ”Modi also highlighted how India is blending cutting-edge technology with its civilisational heritage, drawing from demonstrations at the recently held Global AI Impact Summit in Delhi. “Leaders from all over the world were amazed to see how, with the help of AI, we are preserving our ancient texts, our ancient knowledge, our manuscripts and adapting them for today’s generation,” he said.Citing the live demonstration of Sushruta Samhita, Modi explained the multi-step AI process showcased at the summit. “In the first step, it was shown how, with the help of technology, we are improving the image quality of manuscripts and making them readable,” he said.“In the second step, this image was converted into machine-readable text… the machine-readable text was read by an AI avatar… and further… this invaluable Indian knowledge can be translated into Indian and foreign languages,” Modi saidThe PM said global leaders had showed “great interest in learning about India’s ancient knowledge through a modern avatar”, underlining India’s growing confidence in pairing advanced AI tools with its cultural and intellectual legacy.","Prime minister narendra modi issues blunt warning against growing menace of digital fraud.

Pilot duty rules' exemptions for airlines weigh in heavy on DGCA’s summer schedule plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pilot-duty-exemptions-weigh-in-heavy-on-dgcas-summer-plan/articleshow/128692498.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Aviation authorities have begun the process of determining how many flights — both domestic and international — will operate this summer. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) will weigh in pilot availability of airlines while approving their summer schedules that will be effective March 29 to avoid a crisis like the one seen by IndiGo two months back.But determining pilot availability is proving to be a tightrope walk as all big Indian carriers have got regulatory exemption from certain clauses of flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules for cockpit crew. These exemptions lapse next month end, when the summer schedule kicks in. Airlines have sought an extension for the same and the regulator is reviewing their requests.Airlines’ ability to operate any given number of flights will depend on that decision. Withdrawing FDTL exemptions will mean fewer flights in peak summer travel season, higher fares and public outcry — something Govt will be keen to avoid. And extending them will lead to concerns over fatigued crew streching themselves, something that adversely affects flight safety. Clearly, aviation authorities are in a Catch 22 situation given airlines’ arguments on one side and pilot community concerns on the other.Air India, for instance, has been taking longer routes on its flights to and from the west due to geopolitical reasons. As per rules, they are supposed to have three pilots for flights that are over 10-hour long. Since all flights between north India (Delhi being AI’s primary hub) and the west are impacted due to Pakistan airspace closure, they have an exemption for having two pilots on flights that take upto 10.5 hours.If US-Iran tensions flare up, overflying Iraq (overflying Iran was stopped since late last month) will also be impacted. Which means the already impacted north India routes will get even longer and west & south India routes will also get longer. Withdrawing the exemption for AI’s Boeing 787 pilots will mean fewer Maharaja flights to and from the UK & Europe.“Due to airport infra crunch, IndiGo and Akasa mostly get night slots at busy hubs in India. They have sought exemption from night time utilisation of pilots for this reason as otherwise the number of flights will not grow to cope with rising traffic but actually decline,” said people in the know. Accordingly, IndiGo has requested that night time be considered from midnight to 5 am, instead of till 6 am. And three landings be allowed by pilots between midnight and 2 am, as opposed to the allowed two. Not getting an extension could see IndiGo alone drop many flights.Pilots, on their part, say the current situation has arisen primarily due to the fact that airlines have almost always had their way with the DGCA for getting exemptions. While they were supposed to deal with events beyond anyone’s control like airspace closures forcing longer routes, many airlines took exemptions for granted and charted their growth path accordingly. Only after AI 171 crash last summer and then IndiGo schedule collapse in Dec exemptions — which were to be an exception and not the norm — same under the glare with pilots openly speaking against them.“The fact is apart from poor planning, airlines managements went slow on pilot hiring and career progression of pilots (like co-pilots being made captains) to keep their wage bill in check. As a result, fatigue, stress and inhuman rosters had become a reality till everyone was forced to wake up two months back,” said many senior captains. IndiGo and Air India recently resumed pilot hiring at trainee first officer level after almost 1.5 years.","The directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) will weigh in pilot availability of airlines.

Netanyahu Links Modi’s Israel Visit To ‘Alliance Against Radical Axes’, Calls India 'Global Power'

NEW DELHI: “Global power that is India,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday as he spoke ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s forthcoming visit, scheduled for next week, praising India’s growing stature on the world stage.Highlighting the special bond between New Delhi and Tel Aviv, Netanyahu posted on X from the official account of his office, saying, “This week, expression will be given to the special relationship that has been forged over recent years between Israel and the global power that is India, and between myself and its leader, Prime Minister Modi.”He added, ""We are personal friends; we speak frequently on the phone and visit one another. I have visited India, and Modi has visited here. We waded together in the waters of the Mediterranean, and much water has flowed since then in the Mediterranean, the Ganges, and the Jordan, though less in the Jordan.""This will be PM Modi’s second visit to Israel, following his landmark 2017 trip, when he became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit the country.Israeli PM Netanyahu earlier in the day said that both sides would seek to further strengthen economic, diplomatic and security cooperation during the visit.“On Wednesday, the Prime Minister of India will arrive. He will deliver a speech at the Knesset (Israeli Parliament), and I am sure you will all be there. We will also hold an innovation event in Jerusalem and visit Yad Vashem together,” Netanyahu said at the start of a meeting of government officials.Israeli PM Netanyahu said the relationship between India and Israel has grown stronger over the years and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit would help deepen it further.“The fabric of this relationship has grown tighter, and he is coming here so we can tighten it further through a series of decisions related to strengthening cooperation between our governments and countries. This includes economic, diplomatic and security cooperation,” Netanyahu said.On the diplomatic front, he outlined a broader regional vision. “In the vision I see before me, we will create an entire system, essentially a ‘hexagon’ of alliances around or within the Middle East. This includes India, Arab nations, African nations, Mediterranean nations (Greece and Cyprus), and nations in Asia that I won't detail at the moment. I will present this in an organized manner,” he said.“The intention here is to create an axis of nations that see eye-to-eye on the reality, challenges, and goals against the radical axes, both the radical Shia axis, which we have struck very hard, and the emerging radical Sunni axis. All of these nations share a different perception, and our cooperation can yield great results and, of course, ensure our resilience and our future,” Netanyahu added.During PM Modi’s visit, Netanyahu said Israel would “promote cooperation in high-tech, AI, and quantum computing.”“I say AI and quantum not because they are the future, but because they are the present. We, of course, want to be among the world's leading nations in these fields,” he said.PM Modi’s upcoming visit comes against the backdrop of the Board of Peace meeting held on February 19. The Board of Peace initiative originated from US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza ceasefire plan endorsed by the UN Security Council, but has since expanded beyond its initial scope. Administration officials said around 35 nations had committed to join, while 60 received invitations. Trump has suggested the new body could take on roles currently performed by the United Nations.At the recent AI Impact Summit 2026 held in New Delhi, Ilan Fluss, former Ambassador and Emerging and Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) Policy Coordinator at Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, highlighted Israel’s commitment to innovation, responsible development and expanded bilateral cooperation in emerging technologies.Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, Fluss described artificial intelligence as a transformational moment comparable to major historical global shifts.An Israeli delegation visited India for the AI Summit and held bilateral meetings with Indian government representatives aimed at strengthening technological collaboration.Meanwhile, the global network israel.com on Sunday announced the launch of a new news portal, israelnews.in, targeted at Indian readers.","Netanyahu links modi’s israel visit to ‘alliance against radical axes’, calls india ‘global power’ israeli pm benjamin netanyahu said the relationship between india and israel has grown stronger over the years.

JAMMU: Security forces killed three terrorists during a gunfight in Kishtwar district of J&K, tightening a weeks-long hunt through dense forests and steep terrain, officials said Sunday.The fighting erupted in Chatroo forest belt of Kishtwar, where joint teams moved on intelligence inputs pointing to terrorists hiding in a mud house. As search parties closed in, the terrorists fired, triggering hours of combat.Two terrorists were killed during initial action. A third body was found by evening from a blown-out hideout, officials said. Authorities have yet to establish their identities. Troops seized arms and ammunition, including three AK-47 rifles.Army units from CIF Delta, working with J&K police and CRPF, led the operation. A spokesperson for White Knight Corps said troops “dominated” the site and re-engaged after contact was re-established Sunday morning.Udhampur and Kishtwar districts have seen repeated gunfights since mid-Jan, leaving several terrorists dead, including three on Feb 4. The latest action came under a single ongoing campaign, code-named Operation Trashi-I, launched after a Jan 18 gunfight that killed a paratrooper and wounded seven soldiers.The sweep followed multiple contacts over the past month as forces tracked a group believed to be moving between Sonnar, Janseer-Kandiwar, Dachaan and nearby high ground. A hideout was discovered on Jan 19, intensifying seek-and-shoot efforts. Northern Command said operations would continue to deny terrorists sanctuary.","Security forces kill three terrorists during a gunfight in kishtwar district of j&k.

Jairam Ramesh Questions Modi Govt On US Trade Deal, Tariffs And Russia Oil Claims

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Jairam Ramesh on Sunday questioned the Centre over not waiting for the Supreme Court of the United States ruling on Trump tariffs before agreeing to a trade deal framework with Washington.The US court, in a 6-3 decision, ruled that the administration had exceeded its authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 to impose broad-based import tariffs.However, US president Donald Trump later raised worldwide tariffs to the “fully allowed, and legally tested, 15 per cent level,” effective immediately.Ramesh said the Union government could have waited for the court’s decision instead of agreeing to the trade deal framework. He suggested that India could have been in a stronger position to negotiate after the verdict.In a post on X, he wrote, “This is the calendar of the US Supreme Court, decided and released months in advance. It clearly marks out February 20 as a non-argument day i.e., a day when arguments will not be heard and a judgment could be released. The court had already heard arguments relating to tariffs on November 5, 2025, and it was well known that the justices were not expected to be favourably inclined to president Trump's tariffs.Why then did India not wait until February 20 to sign the trade deal? What was the desperation to do so on February 2, 2026?”Criticising the deal further, he alleged that the framework compromised the interests of Indian farmers. “Had the Prime Minister not felt the need to distract the media, the parliament, and the people by announcing this trade deal and compromising the interests of millions of our farmers, India would have been in a much stronger bargaining position right now,” he said.On Saturday, the government said it was studying the implications of the US Supreme Court judgment on tariffs and the steps announced by the Trump administration.Meanwhile, ANI sources in the commerce ministry said the proposed meeting of chief negotiators of India and the US in Washington DC to finalise discussions on the trade deal will be rescheduled.“The two sides are of the view that the proposed visit of the Indian chief negotiator and the team be scheduled after each side has had the time to evaluate the latest developments and their implications. The meeting will be rescheduled at a mutually convenient date,” the sources said.",Congress mp jairam ramesh questioned the centre over not waiting for the supreme court of the united states ruling on trump tariffs.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Saturday described the 'shirtless' protest by Indian Youth Congress (IYC) workers at the AI Impact Summit-2026 as a “blatant assault on public order” that endangered India’s diplomatic image.Judicial magistrate Ravi allowed five days of police custody for the four accused, Krishna Hari, national secretary of Youth Congress from Bihar, Kundan Yadav, state secretary of Bihar, Ajay Kumar, state president of Uttar Pradesh, and Narasimha Yadav from Telangana, for questioning, citing the risk of absconding and potential links to external conspiracies, reported PTI.“Such conduct palpably transcends the ambit of legitimate dissent, metamorphosing into a blatant assault on public order. It imperils not merely the event's sanctity but also the Republic's diplomatic image before foreign stakeholders, rendering it wholly unprotected by constitutional safeguards,” the magistrate said.The magistrate noted that the protestors allegedly “donned provocative T-shirts bearing offensive slogans such as ‘India US Trade Deal Compromised’, vociferously raised incendiary chants, obstructed public servants in the execution of their duties, and perpetrated physical assaults causing grievous injuries to police personnel, as substantiated by the medico-legal cases (MLCs) on record.”“…the accused persons are alleged to have orchestrated a premeditated intrusion into the high-security precincts of Bharat Mandapam during the AI Summit 2026, a premier international conclave hosting global delegates and dignitaries,” the court order accessed by PTI said.The court further cited early investigation findings that suggested multiple associates of the accused could be absconding, potentially tampering with digital footprints, financial trails, and co-accused disclosures.

NEW DELHI: Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva cautioned his US counterpart Donald Trump against starting a new Cold War and said all countries must be treated equally. Lula was speaking ahead of his departure from India, a day after a bilateral meeting with PM Narendra Modi that saw the two sides signing a pact for cooperation on critical minerals and also exchanging notes on the US Supreme Court judgment that struck down Trump's sweeping global tariffs.""I want to tell US President Donald Trump that we don't want a new Cold War. We don't want to interfere in any other country, we want all countries to be treated equally,"" Lula said at a press conference. He is likely to travel to Washington next month to meet Trump.The president lauded the strategic partnership between Brazil and India, describing it as a relationship between peers that shuns the ""authoritarianism"" often found in negotiations with wealthier nations.Speaking at the India-Brazil Economic Forum, Lula emphasised the deep-rooted similarities between the two countries and their shared vision for growth. Highlighting the unique nature of this bilateral bond, Lula said, ""What is really more important is that when we're talking about a negotiation with a country like India, we are not dealing with a coloniser.""He further observed that unlike dealings with rich countries that often fail to account for the happiness of individual nations, ""with India, it's different"".This balanced power dynamic, where ""no one is above the other country"", stems from a mutual understanding of shared needs and attitudes, he said.Lula noted that despite differences in religion and language, there was a profound similarity in the challenges both nations faced. He said this shared perspective made it ""much easier for us to work and to establish an action plan"" and build partnerships between entrepreneurs from both sides.This ease of collaboration had already resulted in a significant economic trajectory, he added.Since the president's first visit, trade has surged from $2.4 billion to $10.5 billion. While PM Modi previously established a target of $20 billion by 2030, Lula expressed even greater ambition, stating, ""We'll reach $30 billion of trade.""","Brazil prez wraps up india visit, likely to visit us next month.

‘Gandi Aur Nangi Rajneeti’: PM Modi Slams Congress Over ‘Shirtless’ Protest At AI Summit

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday joined the chorus of criticism against the Congress party over its “shirtless” protest at the AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi, accusing the grand old party of turning a global event into an arena for its “gandi aur nangi” politics.In his address after flagging off the Namo Bharat train, the Prime Minister said, “Congress turned a global event into an arena for its ‘gandi aur nangi’ (dirty and shameless) politics.”Further intensifying his attack on the largest opposition party, he added, “I ask Congress leaders — the nation already knows your true form. What was the need to strip further?”PM Modi’s remarks came days after workers of the party’s youth wing, the Indian Youth Congress (IYC), staged a “shirtless” protest at Bharat Mandapam, the venue of the AI Summit in New Delhi.Following the incident, the Congress faced widespread backlash, including criticism from some of its allies and other opposition leaders, who termed the act “inappropriate,” in addition to sharp reactions from the ruling BJP.One of Congress’s key allies, Akhilesh Yadav , also denounced the protest, saying, “They should have refrained from doing something that brings shame to our country in front of foreign delegates and world representatives.”Meanwhile, the Patiala house court sent four IYC workers -- Krishna Hari, Kundan Yadav, Ajay Kumar and Narsingh -- to five days of police custody.During the protest, they were wearing T-shirts with the slogan “India-US Trade Deal Compromised.”The court rejected the bail pleas of all four accused. It said the investigation is at an important early stage and releasing them now could lead to them fleeing or tampering with evidence. The court described the bail request as premature.Delhi Police told the court that the accused raised anti-national slogans and carried out the protest in a way similar to the Gen Z protests in Nepal, allegedly to defame India at an international event. The protest took place when foreign dignitaries were present at Bharat Mandapam.Police have registered a case against them under charges including obstructing a public servant from performing official duty, assaulting a public servant, hate speech, and criminal conspiracy.Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) Ravi granted five days of police custody after hearing arguments from Delhi Police and the Additional Public Prosecutor.",Pm modi slams congress over'shirtless' protest at ai summit in new delhi.

Jairam Ramesh Questions Modi Govt On US Trade Deal, Tariffs And Russia Oil Claims

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh on Sunday stepped up his attack on the Centre over the proposed India-US interim trade agreement, saying it was reflective of “Abki baar Trump se haar” and should be put in “cold storage. ”His remarks came amid confusion following a US Supreme Court verdict striking down President Donald Trump’s earlier global tariffs.He said the terms of the framework must be renegotiated and the clause on import liberalisation, especially of agricultural products, scrapped, arguing that India had conceded without adequate gains.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given a slogan in Houston in 2019 — ‘Abki baar Trump Sarkaar’ but this framework for an interim agreement is proof of ‘Abki baar Trump se haar’,” he told PTI.Ramesh pointed out that the framework allows either side to modify commitments in case of changes, and said India had the right to revise its obligations after Trump altered tariffs. “The first commitment we have made is to reduce or eliminate tariffs on a wide range of food and agricultural products. Our demand to the PM is to put this in cold storage,” he said.According to him, India had committed to eliminate or cut import duties on all US industrial goods and a wide range of American food and agricultural products — a provision that should be changed under the joint statement.He warned that soybean, maize, fruits and nuts, and cotton farmers in Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh would be directly affected.“Our second question is that when the PM, the commerce minister (Piyush Goyal), knew from December that any time (now) the Supreme Court verdict could come, many believed that it could be struck down. Why did you hurriedly strike a deal when you knew the verdict could go against Trump,” he said.“I hope in light of the massive confusion that surrounds this issue, this joint statement is put on cold storage, we renegotiate the terms, this is a one-sided deal. This will be detrimental to the interests of lakhs and lakhs of farmers in different states of the country,” Ramesh added.Questioning the timing of the announcement, he asked what happened on February 2 that led the prime minister to “force” President Trump to announce the trade deal. “This is directly linked to Mr. Rahul Gandhi's attack in Parliament on the PM on the failures on the external security front. So this announcement of the deal was part of managing the news and the headlines,” he alleged.Sharpening his campaign, Ramesh said the Congress would organise a “Maha Kisan Maha Chaupal” in multiple states to mobilise farmers and discuss the potential fallout of the evolving trade deal.“We'll have a Maha Kisan Maha Chaupal in Bhopal, in Yavatmal, Maharashtra, on 7th March, and later in Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan. We're in touch with farmers' organisations. We'll work with them too. Three black laws were withdrawn. It took 14-15 months, but PM Modi was forced to withdraw them. Prime Minister does 'taareef', while Trump keeps imposing 'tariffs'. I'm telling you this based on President Trump's statements,” he told ANI.The remarks came days after the US Supreme Court struck down most of Trump’s sweeping tariff measures, ruling 6-3 that the administration exceeded its authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to impose broad import tariffs. The Court held that the power to levy taxes rests primarily with Congress.Following the ruling, Trump announced a new 10 per cent global tariff on all countries under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 as a temporary import surcharge of up to 15 per cent for 150 days to address balance-of-payments deficits.He later raised it to the “fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level,” effective immediately.",Congress general secretary in-charge communications jairam ramesh stepped up his attack on the centre over the proposed india-us interim trade agreement.

“World Will See AI Differently”: PM Modi On AI Impact Summit In Mann Ki Baat

Top quotes from PM Modi's address:

At the summit, I got the opportunity to meet the world leaders and Tech CEOs. At the AI summit exhibition, I showed myriad things to world leaders... In this summit, it explained how AI is helping us in the treatment of animals… and how farmers keep track of their dairy and animals with the help of 24x7 AI assistance.

I showcased many innovations to world leaders. I would like to mention two things in particular: The first innovation was at the Amul booth. It was explained how AI is helping in treating animals and how, with the help of a 24/7 AI assistant, farmers are keeping track of their dairy operations and livestock. The second innovation focused on preserving India's cultural heritage. Leaders from across the world were surprised to see how, with the help of AI, our ancient scriptures, traditional wisdom, and manuscripts are being preserved and adapted for today's generation

In our country, those who have worked for the welfare of society… those who have prioritised the public in their noble deeds always remain in the hearts of the people. Amma Jayalalithaa ji was one such popular leader. February 24th is the occasion of her birth anniversary. I still feel the deep affection the people of Tamil Nadu had for her, even today, during my visits to the state. The mention of Amma Jayalalithaa brings a glow to the faces of the people of Tamil Nadu. She attended my oath-taking ceremonies in Gujarat. Her thinking was very clear.

During the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, I spoke of the ‘Panch-Pran’ from the Red Fort. One of them is freedom from the mentality of slavery. Today, the country is leaving behind the symbols of slavery and has begun to value symbols related to Indian culture. Tomorrow, on 23rd February, Rajaji Festival will be celebrated in Rashtrapati Bhavan... The exhibition will run from 24th February to 1st March.

In 'Mann Ki Baat', I have spoken to you at length about Digital Arrest . After this, a lot of awareness was generated in our society regarding Digital Arrest and Digital Fraud, but still, such incidents are happening... You all must be familiar with the process of KYC – Know Your Customer. Sometimes, when you receive messages from your bank asking you to update KYC or re-KYC, the question arises in your mind - I have already done KYC, then why this? I urge you not to fret; this is just for the safety of your money. We all know that nowadays everything from pension, subsidy, insurance, UPI, everything is linked to the bank account. This is why banks periodically perform re-KYC to ensure your bank account remains secure.

You surely remember the amazing images of the Maha Kumbh around this time last year. The sea of humanity surging on the banks of the Sangam, the immense flow of faith, and in that sacred moment of bathing, it seemed as if India was ‘in communion’ with its ‘Sanatan Chetana'... But today, in our country, which is re-recognising its heritage, history has taken another turn, without any major announcement kerala Kumbh was organised.

We must always remember some mantras like 'Vocal for Local'. Many items used during Holi or even in other festivals have entered our markets that are foreign-made. Keep these products away from festivals. Choose local products. When you buy local, you also support the initiative of making the country self-reliant.

There is no greater sorrow for any parent than losing one’s own child. The pain of losing a very young child is deeper. Just a few days ago, we lost Aalin Sherin Abraham, a little innocent girl from Kerala... Awareness regarding organ donation is increasing... Medical research is also getting a boost... There are many people like Aalin who has given another life to someone by organ donation.

You must be watching T20 World Cup matches these days. The jersey may belong to another country, but hearing their name, you realise that he is from our country. This moment gives you slight happiness, because the player is of Indian origin and is playing for the country where his family is settled. Canada's team has the highest number of Indian-origin players. The team's captain, Dilpreet Bajwa, was born in Punjab's Gurdaspur. America's team has many players from India's domestic cricket.

I hope you watched 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' earlier this month and learned something from it. You are exam warriors. I'm sure you're all wholeheartedly preparing for your exams.

""With India, It's Different"" Lula Hits Out At Global Powers, Eyes $20B India-Brazil Trade Milestone

NEW DELHI: Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, during his state visit to India, said he was moved by a special gesture that reminded him of a surprise he had arranged for PM Modi during his visit to Brazil last year.Speaking at the India-Brazil Economic Forum on Sunday, the President recalled that at both a lunch and a state dinner, songs by Brazilian composers—including the iconic Asa Branca—were played, leaving him “surprised” by the thoughtful tribute.“I was surprised yesterday, at the state dinner and at lunch too. I don't know if the Brazilian journalists remember this, but when Prime Minister Modi went to visit Brazil last year, we did research on the song that he preferred most. We went to São Paulo to try to find a singer who could sing the song that he enjoyed most. So we did a surprise for him at the Palácio da Alvorada in Brazil, and it was visible that he was touched by the song that we chose to play for him,” he said.“Yesterday I was surprised because during lunch we started to hear a song. I saw that that song had something to do with us... Then they played other songs from the Brazilian composers. They played Asa Branca,” Lula added.""I was very touched for that because I did not remember. I did not imagine that they could've remembered of a good reception that we did for him and so they decided to give me a gift in exchange,” he added.President Lula was on a state visit to India from February 18-22, meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to strengthen bilateral ties and expand strategic cooperation. Addressing a joint press conference after delegation-level talks, PM Modi outlined the key outcomes of their discussions.The two leaders set a target to raise bilateral trade to $20 billion within five years and signed agreements in areas including rare earth minerals, digital partnership, and mining cooperation.Energy cooperation also emerged as a key pillar, with both sides agreeing to accelerate collaboration in renewable energy and sustainable fuels. President Lula described the meeting as “a partnership between two major global powers of the Global South” and highlighted the strategic importance of India–Brazil relations.“My dear friend Modi, it is a reason of happiness for me to return to this country for the sixth time. The meeting between India and Brazil is a meeting of superlatives. We are not just the two biggest democracies of the Global South. This is a meeting of a digital superpower with a renewable energy superpower,” he said. He emphasized the importance of multilateral cooperation, adding, “A turbulent global scenario requires our countries to strengthen and deepen our strategic dialogue. India and Brazil are crucial voices at the UN, the WTO and G20.”President Lula was accompanied by a delegation of top business leaders and participated in the 2nd AI Impact Summit, as well as a state banquet hosted by President Droupadi Murmu.",President lula was on a state visit to india from february 18-22.
