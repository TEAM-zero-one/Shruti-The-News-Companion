Republic Day Parade Turns High Octane As Bike Daredevils Showcase Skill Discipline And Nerve

NEW DELHI: From leading contingents to showcasing India’s missile arsenal to presenting daredevil skills on motorcycles, women military personnel stole the show during the 90-minute 77th Republic Day parade on Kartavya Path on Monday.Akshita Dhankar, a flight lieutenant with IAF, was part of one of India's highest ceremonial events — unfurling the national flag alongside President Droupadi Murmu. “It is a matter of great pride for me... Operation Sindoor was not just an Indian Air Force effort but a joint endeavour of all the armed forces,” she said before the majestic parade.Captain Harshita Yadav, daughter of an IAF officer, led an animal contingent that made its debut on Kartavya Path. The contingent included Bactrian camels from Ladakh, raptors (black kites), Zanskar ponies and indigenously bred hounds that are used by Indian Army in security, surveillance and logistical operations in border areas.Capt Samira Z Buttar, a fourth-generation Army officer, was the contingent commander of the Integrated Operations Centre tableau that showcased the success of Op Sindoor. A fourth-generation officer, Capt Samira had her moment of pride even as she was mourning the recent loss of her father, Col Sarabjeet Singh Buttar (retd).“Being a contingent commander during this Republic Day parade is a tribute to my father,” she said, putting up a brave front.The IAF marching contingent was led by Squadron Leader Jagdesh Kumar along with Squadron Leader Nikita Choudhary. The IAF band, led by Sergeant Charles Antony Daniel, supported the marching contingent and comprised 72 elite musicians, including 57 Agniveervayu and nine Agniveervayu women.Simran Bala, assistant commandant of CRPF, scripted history by leading an all-male contingent of India’s largest central armed police force. The 26-year-old officer, who hails from J&K’s Rajouri district, led the squad of 147 male personnel. Bala, who joined the force less than a year ago, is the first woman from the district to join CRPF in officer rank.CRPF and SSB all-women contingents also marched down Kartavya Path during the parade, led by assistant commandants Seema Nag and Naveen Kumari, displaying discipline and confidence. The high-octane display by women motorcycle daredevils emerged as one of the key highlights of the parade, drawing applause for its precision, balance and coordination. Girls also participated enthusiastically as part of NCC contingents and cultural programmes.","Women military personnel stole the show during the 90-minute 77th republic day parade on kartavya path on monday.

"Op Sindoor: IAF releases video of Rafale armed with beyond-visual-range Meteor missile, silences sceptics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/op-sindoor-iaf-releases-video-of-rafale-armed-with-beyond-visual-range-meteor-missile-silences-sceptics/articleshow/127586218.cms,"A video footage of the IAF showing Indian Rafale's hard point where deadly missiles are attached

NEW DELHI: Releasing a video of advanced fighter jets armed with deadly missiles on Republic Day, the Indian Air Force (IAF) on Monday moved to silence some Pakistani and western critics, who had alleged that India did not have the beyond-visual-range Meteor missile in its arsenal it had claimed to have used during the strikes deep inside Pakistan in 2019 (Balakot) and during Operation Sindoor last year.In the video posted on X on Monday, the IAF showed the fully-loaded hardpoints of fighter jets French-acquired Rafale, Sukhois and indigenously-manufactured Tejas with advanced missiles like Meteor and BrahMos missiles that were used against Pakistan as part of Op Sindoor. The video has put months of suspense to rest.Meteor is the next-generation beyond visual range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) system designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat in the 21st century. It offers a multi-shot capability (multiple launches against multiple targets), and has the ability to engage highly maneuverable targets such as fighter jets, and small targets such as UAVs and cruise missiles in a heavy electronic countermeasures (ECM) environment with a range in excess of 200 km. A solid-fueled ramjet motor allows the missile to cruise at a speed of over Mach 4 and provides the missile with thrust and mid-course acceleration.It also provides the largest ‘no escape zone’ of any air-to-air missile system, several times greater than current medium-range air-to-air missiles (MRAAMs). The fragmentation warhead ensures maximum lethality.In Sept 2016, India and France had signed the 7.87 billion euro deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets, equipped with the latest missiles and weapon system besides multiple India-specific modifications. The fighter jets then came equipped with Meteor and Scalp missiles as part of the deal.However, sceptics doubted whether India received the Meteor missiles with the Rafale jet package. But the IAF video on Friday put to rest all those speculation about whether India had the missile.In another footage a Tejas fighter jet (LCA) is seen firing the Meteor. A fully-loaded Mirage 2000 had the same model of missiles used by the IAF in the 2019 Balakot surgical strike.In the video, IAF also showed the Rampage air-to-surface missile, known for its precision strike. The IAF's Sukhoi-30MKIs carried the Rampage during Op Sindoor.","Iaf released a video of advanced fighter jets armed with deadly missiles on republic day.

'Europe Will Retaliate': America's European Allies FIRE BACK At Trump Over Greenland Tariff Attack

US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent, accusing the ally’s legislature of failing to uphold its trade agreement with the United States.Trump added that South Korea’s legislature has not approved the trade deal he and President Lee Je Myung agreed to on July 30, 2025, and reaffirmed during his visit on October 29, 2025, questioning why it has not been ratified.""Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%."" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.""Our Trade Deals are very important to America. In each of these Deals, we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to. We, of course, expect our Trading Partners to do the same,"" Trump added.South Korea has been moving to implement a deal announced with Washington in November aimed at reducing US tariffs on its exports. More recently, Seoul has been in talks with US officials to clarify its investigation into US-based e-commerce company Coupang (CPNG.N), which was launched following a major data leak, as cited by Reuters.South Korea is a key trading partner for the United States, consistently ranking among the top 10 sources of US imports. American companies and consumers import nearly $150 billion worth of goods from South Korea each year.In July, Trump announced a trade deal with South Korea’s president, but progress stalled for months amid disagreement over an investment pledge sought by the United States. The two leaders later finalized the agreement in October during Trump’s trip to Asia, including a commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States.In November, the White House and the South Korean government released a ""fact sheet"" outlining the deal, which was intended to move the agreement forward, as cited by NBC News.The agreement included reduced tariffs for both countries, capping US import duties at 15 per cent. This marked a rollback from the 25 per cent tariff rate announced earlier in 2025 on South Korea’s ""Liberation Day"" in April, a move that had unsettled markets.Trump’s latest tariff announcement follows at least three previous threats that were never carried out. These included a proposed 10 per cent tariff on Canada after Ontario ran an anti-tariff World Series ad, threatened tariffs on European countries over Greenland, and a 100 per cent tariff on Canada that was announced last week.","Us president donald trump announced on monday that he is raising tariffs on south korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent.

Interview slots for H-1B visas now only in 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/interview-slots-for-h-1b-visas-now-only-in-2027/articleshow/127503949.cms,".

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new h-1b stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

Thrilled to see US-made aircraft in Indian skies, symbolises strength of our ties: Gor



NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping were among the global leaders who extended greetings to the Indian govt and people on Republic Day. While Trump underlined the significance of ties between the world's oldest and largest democracies, Xi said in a message to President Droupadi Murmu that India and China were ""good neighbours, friends and partners"" and a dragon-elephant dance was the right choice for both countries.""On behalf of the people of the United States, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the govt and people of India as you celebrate your 77th Republic Day. The United States and India share a historic bond as the world's oldest and largest democracies,"" said Trump, according to a post on X by the US embassy.Secretary of State Marco Rubio, too, put out a congratulatory message, saying the two countries shared a historic bond. ""From our close cooperation on defence, energy, critical minerals, and emerging technologies to our multi-layered engagement through the Quad, the US-India relationship delivers real results for our two countries and for the Indo-Pacific region,"" he said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was looking forward to working with India to “advance our shared objectives in the year ahead”.US ambassador Sergio Gor said he was thrilled to see US-made aircraft soaring in the Indian sky and called it a powerful symbol of the strength of the US-India strategic partnership.In his message, Xi said that India-China relations have continued to improve and develop, aligning with the fundamental interests of both the countries and their people, and are of great significance for maintaining and promoting world peace and prosperity.Xi stressed that China has always believed that being good neighbours, friends and partners who help each other succeed, and achieving the “dragon and the elephant dancing together”, is the right choice for both China and India, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.The Chinese president expressed hope that both sides will adhere to the important consensus that China and India are “partners for cooperation and opportunities for development”, strengthen strategic communication, expand exchanges and cooperation, address each other’s concerns, and promote the healthy and stable development of China-India relations.King Charles III hailed the enduring India-UK partnership in his Republic Day message to President Murmu as members of the Indian community gathered at India House in London for a flag hoisting ceremony.The 77-year-old monarch’s letter to the President of India, posted on social media, reflected upon the “shared values and mutual respect for the Commonwealth” as Indians around the world commemorate the adoption of the Constitution of India.Charles specifically highlighted the deepening tie-ups in the field of “sustainability through clean energy initiatives, cooperation on climate finance and initiatives on clean tech and green growth”. “The Commonwealth’s rich diversity and the energy of its younger generations continue to inspire hope and progress. In these times of global uncertainty, our collective strength and unity are more vital than ever,” read the message from King Charles and Queen Camilla.",Us president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping were among the global leaders who extended greetings to the indian govt and people on republic day.

PIO civil servant gets flak on X for negotiating Chagos deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/pio-civil-servant-gets-flak-on-x-for-negotiating-chagos-deal/articleshow/127568529.cms,"Image: X@/BasilTheGreat

LONDON: An Indian-born British civil servant has found himself unwittingly under fire on social media over the controversial Chagos deal.Dr Francis Vijay Narasimhan Rangarajan was born in Delhi and educated at Cambridge University where he obtained a master’s in maths and PhD in astrophysics.Since March 2024 he has been chief executive of the Electoral Commission. Before that he led the negotiations over the Chagos deal in his role as a director-general at the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). The Chagos deal, agreed in May 2025, is opposed by the Conservatives and Reform UK, and a large number of the British public.On Sunday night Rangarajan’s name was trending alongside “Chagos Deal” on X after it was revealed he negotiated the deal to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago, which Britain owns, to Mauritius, and then pay Mauritius millions of pounds a year to lease back the strategic Diego Garcia military base, used by US and UK forces.At the time of going to press, the FCDO had not responded to a request for comment.Journalist and former Tory MEP Daniel Hannan wrote on X: “Every former minister I have spoken to blames the Chagos fiasco on Vijay Rangarajan, the relevant FCDO official. But, in Britain, civil servants are never blamed for anything and, indeed, he is now running the Electoral Commission, which makes MPs reluctant to criticise him.”Former Tory MP Douglas Carswell wrote on X: “Vijay Rangarajan should be summoned to the bar of the House to explain his asinine deal.” British political commentator Nick Dixon commented: “So we let an Indian give away our territory to a majority Indian country? Did we lose a war or something?”An account called “Basil the Great”, with 265k followers, wrote: “INDIAN CIVIL SERVANT BEHIND CHAGOS DEAL. Vijay Rangarajan born in New Delhi has been revealed as the man behind the whole Chagos islands fiasco. An Indian giving away British territory to Mauritius, a majority Indian state. WHY ARE FOREIGNERS RULING OVER US?”The Chagos negotiating team, led by Rangarajan, “overstepped its brief and offered Mauritius too much”.“Officials were freewheeling,” said one political source, according to the UK Times.Last week US president Donald Trump had said giving away the land was “an act of great stupidity”.Although the treaty handing over sovereignty was signed in May 2025, the bill has not been ratified in UK’s parliament. The Tories on Friday tabled a motion in the House of Lords requiring the govt to confirm that the Chagos deal did not breach the existing 1966 UK-US treaty governing the use of Diego Garcia. Later that day the bill was removed from Monday’s order paper.India supports the deal. Last Sept PM Modi had called the Chagos deal “a historic milestone for Mauritius’s sovereignty”.","Dr francis vijay narasimhan rangarajan was born in delhi and educated at cambridge university.

Decline of Himalayan rivers could trigger nuclear war: UK report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/decline-of-himalayan-rivers-could-trigger-nuclear-war-uk-report/articleshow/127567910.cms,"ANI file photo

LONDON: The decline of rainforests and glacier-fed rivers could lead to global competition for food and water as early as the 2030s, UK intelligence chiefs have warned, adding that the decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan, potentially leading to nuclear war The British govt report warns that ecosystem degradation is occurring across all regions and “every critical ecosystem is on a pathway to collapse”.There is a realistic possibility that some ecosystems (SE Asia coral reefs, boreal forests and the Himalayas) will start to collapse from 2030, and others (rainforests and mangroves) start to collapse from 2050, it states.“Severe degradation or collapse would drive displacement of millions, change global weather patterns, increase global food and water scarcity, and drive geopolitical competition for remaining resources,” the 14-page report said.The impacts will range from crop failures, intensified natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks to conflict within and between states. Migration and organised crime will rise and terrorist groups will exploit political instability, it said.The report, titled “Global Biodiversity Loss, Ecosystem Collapse and National Security”, was published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).But TOI understands it was actually put together by the Joint Intelligence Committee, which coordinates MI5 and MI6. The report assesses how biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse impact UK national security and warns that the UK’s food security will be under threat as Britain imports 40% of its food and is not self-sufficient in fertilisers. “Both existing (plant pre-breeding, regenerative agriculture) and emerging technologies (AI, lab grown protein, insect protein) offer potential solutions,” it states.According to the UK Times newspaper, the report was due to be published last autumn but “was blocked by No. 10 for being too negative”. An “abridged version” has been published following a freedom of information request. The Times claims to have seen the “full internal version”, which states that the degradation of rainforests in the Congo and the drying up of rivers fed by the Himalayas could drive people to flee to Europe, leading to “more polarised and populist politics in the UK” and putting “additional pressure on already strained national infrastructure”.The internal version also warns of the risk of nuclear war from the decline of Himalayan rivers.“Critical ecosystems that support major global food production areas and impact global climate, water and weather cycles are the most important for UK national security. The Amazon and Congo rainforests, boreal forests, the Himalayas and Southeast Asia’s coral reefs and mangroves are particularly significant for the UK,” it states.The report notes that Britain’s large South Asian diaspora could make the UK an attractive destination for people from the region.“Countries best placed to adapt are those that invest in ecosystem protection and restoration, and resilient and efficient food systems. Restoration of some ecosystems (tropical forests) is more feasible than others (coral reefs, Himalayas),” it states.A Defra spokesperson said: “Nature underpins our security, prosperity, and resilience and understanding the threats we face from biodiversity loss is crucial to meeting them head on.”","Decline of himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between china, india and pakistan.

SRINAGAR:

Pakistan’s attempts to destroy J&K’s tourism have failed, deputy chief minister Surinder Choudhary said in a Republic Day speech on Monday while appealing to people across India and abroad to visit Kashmir as it is “peaceful and ready to welcome” visitors.Addressing a gathering on behalf of the National Conference (NC) govt at Bakshi Stadium in Srinagar, Choudhary paid tributes to the tourists killed in last year’s Pahalgam terror attack The deputy CM pointed out that the Pahalgam victims had travelled from various parts of the country. “Friends, Pakistan has given immense injuries to Kashmir and tried to cause huge losses to lives and property. Pakistan has tried to destroy our tourism industry. The people of Kashmir and security forces have defeated its designs,” Choudhary said.Security was tightened in Srinagar and other districts of the Valley for Republic Day. Tourists celebrated at Srinagar’s historic Lal Chowk. BJP organised a R-Day event in the city.Choudhary dwelt further on the theme in his speech, stressing the region was moving towards peace and development. “We have overcome the injuries inflicted by Pakistan.Kashmir’s beautiful valleys are ready to welcome tourists. I appeal to tourists to visit and experience the hospitality and brotherhood of the Valley.”Choudhary highlighted the “sacrifices and courage” of security forces to ensure peace. “This Republic Day, I applaud security forces and the Army, who remain constantly alert to safeguard the country. I thank the Army, whose efforts ensure that we are able to live peacefully in our homes. I am also grateful to J&K Police, who have been fighting militancy for the past 36 years.”","Pakistan's attempts to destroy j&k's tourism have failed, deputy chief minister surinder choudhary said in a republic day speech.

India’s air superiority during Operation Sindoor made Pakistan call for truce: European think-tank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-air-superiority-during-operation-sindoor-made-pakistan-call-for-truce-european-think-tank/articleshow/127498896.cms,"Operation Sindoor: Swiss Military Report Details How IAF Neutralised Pakistan And Won The Skies

NEW DELHI: India’s air superiority during its “88-hour Operation Sindoor coerced Pakistan into a ceasefire” during the May 7-10, 2025 conflict, according to a detailed European military analysis.The report, titled ‘Operation Sindoor: The India-Pakistan Air War (7–10 May 2025)’, has been authored by Adrien Fontanellaz and was published last week by the Centre d’Histoire et de Prospective Militaires (CHPM), an independent Swiss military history and strategic studies institution based in Switzerland. Founded in 1969, CHPM is not affiliated with any govt and positions itself as a neutral forum for professional military research.Referring to last year’s Indo-Pak conflict, the report said, “This (May 2025) clash between the Pakistan and Indian air force s initially saw the former achieve a clear tactical victory by shooting down several enemy fighters, then largely fail in its conduct of strikes over Indian territory, as those were countered by an integrated air defence system whose effectiveness was one of the surprises of the conflict. Conversely, the Indian Air Force managed to significantly degrade the enemy's air defence system, then concluded the conflict by carrying out a series of spectacular strikes against Pakistan’s principal Air Force stations.Thus, by achieving clear air superiority, India coerced Islamabad into requesting a ceasefire .”Though the Indian govt never admitted losing any fighter aircraft, including Rafale, in the conflict, the report said, “The loss of at least one Indian Rafale fighter jet on the night of 7 May 2025, can be seen as the tip of the iceberg as this event, above all, made a strong impression in the West and attracted significant media attention. However, this sequence saw a large-scale confrontation between two competent air forces, equipped with small fleets of state-of-the-art aircraft designs, such as the J10C and the Rafale, supported by substantial fleets of fourth-generation combat aircraft as well as sophisticated integrated air defence networks and force multipliers. ”On the escalation of war, the report stated, “On the strategic plane, Operation Sindoor has led to conventional military clashes of considerable magnitude between two de facto nuclear-weapon states with differing doctrines regarding the use of nuclear weapons, which made the situation very tricky to handle, with a high risk of escalation and potentially catastrophic consequences.”“This episode provides valuable lessons on the tactical and operational plans, particularly because it illustrates the strong interpenetration between the military and communication lines of operation, as well as a paradigm that has been consistently confirmed over the years, namely the crucial role of long-range strikes,” the report further added.","India’s air superiority during its “88-hour operation sindoor coerced pakistan into a ceasefire” during the may 7-10, 2025 conflict, according to a detailed european military analysis.

NEW DELHI: India’s military offensive, courage and valour displayed during Operation Sindoor were showcased in front of European chief guests and thousands of spectators on Kartavya Path during the 77th Republic Day parade on Monday when the country made a grand display of lethal weapon systems, missiles, anti-missile shield and fighter jets used during the conflict against Pakistan last year.A glass-cased integrated operational centre, depicting the conduct of Op Sindoor with the use of weapons systems such as BrahMos and S-400 missiles rolled down Kartavya Path. Two key pillars of India's air defence architecture, Akash weapon system and ABHRA Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missile System (MRSAM) that formed a robust layered shield for the Indian Army during the conflict last May were also displayed.For the first time, the parade showcased a phased ‘Battle Array Format’ of the Indian Army that included an aerial component.

Even helicopters carrying Operation Sindoor flags flew over the Kartavya Path before the start of the parade.Besides Op Sindoor weapon systems, the military also flaunted the rocket launcher ‘Suryastra’, Shaktibaan, followed by Divyastra, equipped with cutting-edge surveillance and targeting technologies.Mechanised columns on display included BMP-II Infantry Combat Vehicle, along with Nag missile system (Tracked) Mk-2.In a first, DRDO showcased its hypersonic glide missile LR-AShM, which is capable of engaging static and moving targets and designed to carry various payloads.The parade was led by Parade Commander Lt General Bhavnish Kumar, General Officer Commanding, Delhi Area, a second-generation army officer.

NEW DELHI: The presence of EU leaders at the Republic Day parade underscores the growing strength of the India-EU partnership and their commitment to shared values, said PM Narendra Modi as he welcomed European Commission and Council presidents, Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa, respectively, on Kartavya Path on Monday.The EU leaders’ attending the parade, which included a display of Russian weapon systems, as chief guests reinforced the shared intent to deepen the India-EU strategic partnership in a fractured world. The 16th India-EU summit on Tuesday is expected to see several major outcomes, including a successful conclusion of the trade negotiations and the signing of what von der Leyen has described as a potentially game-changing security and defence partnership. In all, 8-12 agreements are to be signed during the summit.“India is privileged to host European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during our Republic Day celebrations. The visit will add momentum to the deepening engagement and cooperation between India and Europe across diverse sectors,” Modi wrote on X.Von der Leyen reciprocated the sentiment as she said a successful India makes the world more stable, prosperous and secure and benefits all.“Europe and India are the world’s largest democracies, committed to working together to shape a new global order. This is why we are here to take our partnership to new heights,” said von der Leyen, after the At Home ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan.She added display of the flags of EU, EU Military Staff and its maritime missions ATALANTA and ASPIDES at R-Day was a powerful symbol of the deepening security cooperation between the two sides. “It will culminate tomorrow in the signing of our security and defence partnership.”EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas also attended the parade that displayed, among others, Russian designed weapon systems — T-90 tanks, BrahMos missiles and S-400 air defence system. As it looks to seal the trade deal with India, Brussels has in past few months cut down on the rhetoric on India’s ties with Russia and said it’s looking to forge a reliable partnership with Delhi that’s anchored respect for each other’s security concerns. “There is strong momentum for closer cooperation with India... At the summit, we will take our ties forward by signing the EU-India Security and Defence Partnership,” he said.","The presence of eu leaders at the republic day parade underscores the growing strength of the india-eu partnership, said pm narendra modi.

Congress brass may meet Shashi Tharoor to settle issues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-brass-may-meet-shashi-tharoor-to-settle-issues/articleshow/127579207.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Congress leadership is likely to meet senior party member Shashi Tharoor after his absence from a brainstorming session on Kerala elections last week triggered a row, suggesting he was unhappy with the party.Sources said the party brass is thinking of inviting Tharoor for a discussion to address his grievances.Tharoor set tongues wagging after he stayed away from a meeting to which select senior Kerala functionaries were invited by AICC to discuss strategy for the upcoming state elections. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi chaired the meeting, which was attended by all key party members from the poll-bound state.While Tharoor, who was in Kozhikode for Kerala Literature Festival, said he had informed the party about his inability to attend the session, the Thiruvananthapuram MP also underlined that he has some issues with the party which he wants to discuss with the leadership. He even corroborated press reports about his unhappiness, saying some of them were correct.Sources said the thinking in the party is that the Kerala MP should be invited for a discussion to address his grievances.According to a party manager, the brass wants to ensure that the party is united going into the Kerala elections in which it believes the opposition alliance, United Democratic Front (UDF), has a good chance of dislodging the governing Left Democratic Front (LDF) alliance, its hopes raised by Opposition's strong performance in the local body elections last month.It is felt that Tharoor has his own pull with the electorate and should actively participate in the run-up to the polls to boost the party's prospects. However, the Lok Sabha MP has his detractors in the organisation who blame him for repeatedly taking a stance at variance with Congress and even being soft on BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The sudden emergence of wrinkles in the Kerala party organisation last week left many disturbed as developments of the last couple of months had indicated a new-found unity in the otherwise fractious unit. Tharoor not only attended party events like Lakshya but also clarified that he had never diverged from the party stance on key issues. But the supposed thaw was shattered by his absence from the AICC meeting last week.","Tharoor set tongues wagging after he stayed away from a meeting to which select senior kerala functionaries were invited by aicc to discuss strategy for the upcoming state elections.

CHANDIGARH: A 27-year-old first-generation Army officer from Bathinda commanded a T-90 Bhishma main battle tank at the Republic Day parade this year, as Captain Vipanjot Virk of the Indian Army ’s 77 Armoured Regiment led it along Kartavya Path. Commissioned as the first Young Officer of the regiment, Captain Virk traces his decision to join the Army to formative school years marked by regular exposure to military role models, including a defining 2013 interaction with then COAS General Bikram Singh that left a lasting impression.“I knew about the Army through the school’s legacy of producing officers. You grow up seeing seniors joining the forces, and that makes the idea of serving in uniform feel achievable,” said Captain Vipanjot Virk.He said a defining moment came in 2013 during his school’s Founders Day celebrations, when General Bikram Singh, then Chief of the Army Staff and an alumnus of the school, visited the campus for Founders’ Day. He met the Army chief during the event and that the interaction strengthened his resolve to pursue a career in the armed forces.Captain Virk is part of the Indian Army’s 77 Armoured Regiment, a unit raised in recent years. He was commissioned into the regiment as one of its first officers and has been associated with it since its initial phase, including its raising and training activities.A resident of village Virk Khurd near Bathinda, Captain Virk is the only child of Iqbal Singh Virk.With no prior family background in the armed forces, he joined the Army as a first-generation officer from Punjab’s rural belt.“My son’s interest in the Army developed during his school years,” said his father, a farmer. “We never had anyone in the forces in our family, but he was clear about his goal very early and worked consistently towards it.”He completed his schooling in 2016 and joined the National Defence Academy in 2017. Virk credits his early exposure to military life to his time at the Punjab Public School, Nabha, which has a long association with the armed forces and has produced several officers over the years, including Major Anuj Sood, who got martyred in Handwara in 2020.","Captain vipanjot virk is part of the indian army’s 77 armoured regiment, a unit raised in recent years.

Xi Jinping, Rubio, Ursula Hail India On Republic Day As Delhi Becomes Centre Of World Attention

NEW DELHI: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday extended greetings to President Droupadi Murmu on the occasion of India’s 77th Republic Day, describing New Delhi and Beijing as “good neighbours, friends and partners. ” He also said that achieving the vision of the “dragon and the elephant dancing together” is the right choice for both countries.In his message, Xi said India-China relations have continued to improve and develop, aligning with the fundamental interests of both countries and their people. He added that the relationship also carried significant implications for global peace and prosperity.According to China’s state-run Xinhua news agency, he stressed that Beijing has consistently believed that being good neighbours, friends and partners who help each other succeed is the correct path for the two Asian giants.Xi also expressed hope that both sides would adhere to the consensus that China and India are “partners for cooperation and opportunities for development,” strengthen strategic communication, expand exchanges and cooperation, address each other’s concerns and promote the healthy and stable development of bilateral ties.Highlighting Xi’s message, Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong shared a post on X, reiterating Beijing’s position on ties with New Delhi.Chinese Premier Li Qiang also sent a congratulatory message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The message comes amid a gradual improvement in ties between the two countries, which had stalled following the eastern Ladakh military standoff in 2020.Relations began to revive after PM Modi and President Xi held two meetings first in Kazan in 2024, and later in Tianjin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in August last year.During their August meeting, the two leaders agreed to deepen bilateral ties, tackle pressing challenges and work towards a “fair” solution to the long-standing border issue.In recent months, India and China have taken a series of steps to normalise relations after ending the more than four-year military face-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.These include resumption of direct flights in October, agreement to restart the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra, commemoration of the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations and visa facilitation. India also resumed granting tourist visas to Chinese nationals in July, reversing a suspension imposed after the 2020 standoff.Earlier this month, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri met Sun Haiyan, vice minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China, to review the positive momentum in bilateral relations.The ministry of external affairs said that the discussions focused on advancing ties through enhanced people-to-people exchanges while addressing sensitive issues. Separately, a Chinese Communist Party delegation also held courtesy meetings with leaders of the RSS and the BJP as part of routine exchanges, news agency ANI reported.","Chinese president xi jinping extended greetings to president droupadi murmu on the occasion of india’s 77th republic day.

Why January 26?

From Irwin Stadium to Kartavya Path

January 26, 1950

NEW DELHI: As India celebrated its 77th Republic Day, Kartavya Path once again became the setting for the country’s most enduring national ritual. President Droupadi Murmu unfurled the national flag — the Tiranga — amid elaborate celebrations, in the presence of the country’s top leadership and chief guests, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa. Their presence reflected India’s expanding global engagement, even as attention turned to what officials have described as the “mother of all deals” between India and the European Union.The celebrations on Monday were grand, as always — but this year carried a sharper edge. Against the backdrop of Operation Sindoor, launched in May 2025, the display of India’s military strength sent a clear and deliberate message.For the first time, the parade showcased the Army’s phased “Battle Array Format,” integrating ground forces with aerial elements. The display featured a high-mobility reconnaissance vehicle and India’s first indigenously developed armoured light specialist vehicle.In another first, a military contingent from the European Union took part in the parade. Carrying military staff flags and those of EU naval missions Atalanta and Aspides, it marked the EU’s first participation in a military parade outside Europe.The celebrations brought together an unusual sweep of history and the present — from the 150-year legacy of the national song Vande Mataram to displays of the country’s developmental strides, military strength, cultural diversity and participation from citizens from all walks of life.Yet, for all its scale and symbolism, the ceremony inevitably draws the eye back to where it all began.The journey began on January 26, 1950, the day India formally became a Republic. On that morning, Rajendra Prasad , the nation’s first President, unfurled the Tricolour as the ceremonial parade took place at the Irwin Stadium, in the vicinity of Rashtrapati Bhavan and India Gate.The parade route, and even the space it occupied, would evolve over the decades — mirroring the Republic itself.The ceremonial stretch has since shifted from Irwin Stadium to Rajpath, later renamed Kartavya Path, while, in colonial times, the same avenue linking India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhavan was known as Kingsway.Accompanied by a 31-gun salute near India Gate, the unfurling of the flag was a declaration to the world of India’s new status as a Republic. With the world’s lengthiest written Constitution coming into force that day, the framework for the nation’s future was set, a constitutional journey that has now spanned more than seven decades.January 26, 1950. At 10:18am, a new chapter quietly but decisively opened in India’s long history.Nearly two and a half years after Independence, the Republic of India was formally born. Inside the grand Durbar Hall of Government House, the former Viceroy’s House, today’s Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Constitution came into force, turning a newly freed nation into a sovereign democratic republic.Perched atop the Raisina Hills, the hall bore witness to a moment that marked India’s final break from colonial rule.Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, the last Governor-General, read out the proclamation announcing that India was no longer a Dominion. The country had stepped into full self-rule.Minutes later, Rajendra Prasad took oath as the first President of the Republic, assuming the highest constitutional office in the land.India’s oldest defence magazine, Fauji Akhbar, captured the drama of that morning with remarkable precision.“At the most solemn ceremony, held in the brilliantly lit and high domes of Durbar Hall at Government House, India was declared a Sovereign Democratic Republic exactly at 18 minutes past 10 on the morning of Thursday, January 26, 1950,” the magazine reported in its February 4 issue titled Birth of a Republic.“Six minutes later, Rajendra Prasad was sworn in as President,” it added.The announcement was followed by a salute of 31 guns, echoing across the capital shortly after 10:30am — a sound that signalled the arrival of a new nation.Reading from the Constitution, Rajagopalachari formally declared the Republic of “India, that is, Bharat,” invoking Article 1.The proclamation affirmed that the new nation would be a Union of States, bringing together former Governor’s provinces, Indian states, and Chief Commissioners’ provinces under one constitutional umbrella.With the declaration complete, the retiring Governor-General stepped aside and invited Rajendra Prasad to occupy the Presidential seat — a quiet but powerful handover from colonial authority to constitutional leadership.Addressing a nation of around 320 million people, now of over 1.4 billion, Rajendra Prasad delivered his first speech as President, first in Hindi and then in English, mirroring the diversity of the country he now represented.“Today, for the first time in our long and chequered history, we find the whole of this vast land… brought together under the jurisdiction of one Constitution and one Union,” he said, speaking of a nation stretching from Kashmir to Cape Comorin, from Kathiawad to Kamrup.The Durbar Hall was filled with dignitaries: Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , members of the Constituent Assembly, and leaders who had shepherded India through freedom and into republican governance.Just two days earlier, Prasad had announced Jana Gana Mana as the national anthem and Vande Mataram as the national song, giving formal shape to the symbols of the new Republic.Soon after, the Constituent Assembly adjourned sine die — its task complete — and later transformed into the Parliament of India.While history was being written inside the halls of power, the celebrations belonged to the people.At the Irwin Amphitheatre — today’s Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium — nearly 15,000 citizens gathered to witness the first Republic Day parade. Built in 1933 and gifted by the Maharaja of Bhavnagar, the venue was already steeped in imperial history, now repurposed for a republican future.Indonesia’s President Sukarno, a close friend of India and a future co-founder of the Non-Aligned Movement, was the chief guest.Iconic scenes unfolded across Delhi: troops marching with the Old Fort as their backdrop; President Rajendra Prasad riding ceremonially through the capital in a buggy, without any security cover; crowds lining rooftops, trees and balconies, greeting him with shouts of “jai”.As the procession moved through what is now Vijay Chowk, Prasad folded his hands in greeting, responding warmly to the cheers.“The drive ended exactly at 3:45 pm at the Irwin Amphitheatre,” Fauji Akhbar recorded, “where 3,000 officers and men of the three Armed Services of India and the police, along with massed bands, had taken up positions for the Ceremonial Parade.”The parade itself, inherited from the British Raj, was transformed from a display of imperial power into a celebration of national unity, discipline and strength.The choice of the date was no accident.For years before Independence, January 26 had been observed as Purna Swaraj Diwas. At the Indian National Congress’s Lahore session in December 1929, under Jawaharlal Nehru’s presidency, the demand for complete independence had been formally declared.On January 26, 1930, Indians across the country were urged to mark the day as Independence Day — a symbolic rejection of British dominion status after negotiations collapsed.That legacy made January 26 the natural date for the Constitution to come into force two decades later.Since 1950, Republic Day has grown into one of India’s most important national rituals — an annual reaffirmation of constitutional values.The parade moved to Rajpath, now Kartavya Path, in 1955. It evolved to include displays of military capability, cultural tableaux from states and Union Territories, and the conferral of Padma awards.Global leaders have attended as chief guests — from Cold War allies to modern strategic partners. In recent decades, the list has included Vladimir Putin, Barack Obama, and leaders from Japan, France and now the European Union.Yet at its core, Republic Day remains anchored to that winter morning in 1950 — when India formally chose to govern itself through law, democracy and the will of its people.The spectacle may change with time. The setting may be renamed. But the promise of that first Republic Day endures.","'successful india stabilises world': eu chief backs india as talks on 'mother of all deals' near end of 77th republic day celebrations.

Donald Trump Greets India On Republic Day, Calls India-US Ties A Historic Bond Of Democracies

US President Donald Trump on Monday extended his heartfelt greetings to India on the occasion of 77th Republic Day, describing the relationship between the two countries as a ""historic partnership"" between the world’s oldest and largest democracies.In a message shared on X by the US Embassy in India, Trump said, “On behalf of the people of the United States, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the government and people of India as you celebrate your 77th Republic Day.”“The United States and India share a historic bond as the world’s oldest and largest democracies,” he added.US secretary of state Marco Rubio also conveyed greetings on the occasion, underscoring the breadth of engagement between the two countries. “From our close cooperation on defense, energy, critical minerals, and emerging technologies to our multi-layered engagement through the Quad, the US-India relationship delivers real results for our two countries and for the Indo-Pacific region,” Rubio said in a statement.“I look forward to working together to advance our shared objectives in the year ahead,” he added.US ambassador to India Sergio Gor, who attended the Republic Day parade at Kartavya Path, also extended wishes.“Happy Republic Day, India! Honored to attend the Republic Day Parade for the first time, a celebration of India’s Constitution and democratic spirit. Thrilled to see the US-made aircraft soaring in the Indian sky, a powerful symbol of the strength of the US-India strategic partnership,” he said.US-origin military platforms, including C-130J transport aircraft and Apache helicopters, featured in the aerial display during the parade.The greetings come against the backdrop of tensions in India-US relations following the decision by US President Donald Trump to impose steep tariffs on Indian goods, including a 25 per cent punitive levy linked to India’s purchase of Russian oil, taking total duties to as high as 50 per cent on certain items.Both sides held multiple rounds of negotiations last year to finalise a proposed bilateral trade agreement, but the talks failed to yield a deal, largely due to Washington’s demand that India open up its farm and dairy sectors. Beyond trade, ties have also been strained by other issues, including US President Donald Trump’s claim of ending the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year and changes in Washington’s immigration policy.","Us president donald trump extended his heartfelt greetings to india on the occasion of 77th republic day.
