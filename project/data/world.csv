What Donald Trump's Tariff Letters Say

Tariff Date: From April 2 To July 9 To August 1

US President Donald Trump on Monday released letters sent by his administration to various trading partners informing them of the reciprocal tariff rates that will be effective from August 1, 2025. The first two letters posted by Trump on social media platform Truth Social revealed that US will be imposing a tariff rate of 25% on Japan and South Korea. After some gap, the US President also shared tariff letters for other countries including Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, South Africa, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Tunisia, Malaysia, Serbia, Cambodia and Bosnia & Herzegovina.In the last few days, Trump had declared his intention to dispatch tariff letters to multiple countries, ahead of the approaching deadline for trading associates to conclude negotiations. On Sunday, Trump indicated he would issue up to 15 initial letters, cautioning that US import duties would revert to the elevated rates he established in April if nations do not secure agreements.Till now, Trump has shared letters on Truth Social for tariffs on seven countries. These are: Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Laos, and Myanmar. The applicable tariff rates mentioned in his letters are:In similarly phrased correspondence to Japan's and South Korea's heads of state, Trump announced the implementation of tariffs beginning August 1, citing that their trade relations with Washington were ""unfortunately, far from Reciprocal.""In his letter to Japan Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru, Trump said, “Starting on August 1, 2025, we will charge Japan a tariff of only 25% on any and all Japanese products sent into the United States, separate from all sectoral tariffs. Goods transhipped to evade a higher tariff will be subject to that higher tariff.”The letters also cautioned Japan and South Korea against reciprocal tariff increases, with the Trump administration threatening to impose additional import duties that could adversely affect their automotive and electronics industries. Both nations are vital US allies in counterbalancing China's regional power.""If for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 25% that we charge,"" Trump wrote in the letters to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung. Similar letters were issued to Myanmar, Laos, South Africa, Kazakhstan, and Malaysia.However, Trump indicated his willingness to reduce these tariffs if these countries revised their trade policies.During a Sunday statement, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba declared that he ""won't easily compromise"" whilst negotiating trade terms with Washington.During the daily press conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that letters would be dispatched to twelve nations on Monday. Trump intends to maintain his established approach of publishing these diplomatic communications on social media platforms before sending the physical documents to his international counterparts.The letters are yet another chapter in the worldwide economic situation, where the US president has positioned himself as the key player. These actions have sparked concerns about potential economic downturn and increased susceptibility to recession, both in the US and globally.Nevertheless, Trump remains steadfast in his belief that tariffs are essential for revitalising domestic manufacturing and supporting the recently enacted tax reductions he approved last Friday.The letters reflect Trump's unilateral decisions on tariffs, rather than mutually agreed terms, indicating unsuccessful private discussions with international representatives.Leavitt explained that Trump's personal determination of rates demonstrated the administration's commitment to developing ""tailor-made trade plans for each and every country on this planet and that's what this administration continues to be focused on.""The US President has enacted emergency economic measures to independently levy taxes, claiming they address historical trade imbalances, despite American buyers' appreciation for Japanese and South Korean products, including vehicles and electronic devices.However, the strategic advantage against China remains questionable, as this action challenges two vital Asian allies who could potentially serve as counterweights to Chinese economic influence.""These tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your Country,"" Trump wrote in both letters.With the imminent implementation of revised tariff rates in approximately three weeks, the US administration under Trump is initiating a phase of potentially intense negotiations with its trading partners to establish fresh agreements and frameworks.On April 2, which he dubbed ""Liberation Day"", Trump introduced comprehensive tariffs, implementing a 10% duty on imports from nearly all trade partners. Several nations, including certain European Union members, were designated to face substantially higher rates.As financial markets declined, Trump suspended the tariffs for 90 days to facilitate negotiations - a period that ends on Wednesday. The outcomes have been modest thus far, with Washington securing agreements solely with Britain and Vietnam, whilst reaching a temporary arrangement with China to reduce the exceptionally high duties on their respective products.Trump indicated to journalists while boarding Air Force One on Sunday that he would dispatch between ""12, could be 15"" letters the following day.""I am pleased to announce that the UNITED STATES TARIFF Letters, and/or Deals, with various Countries from around the World, will be delivered starting 12:00 P.M. (Eastern), Monday, July 7th,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social network.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had earlier said that the reciprocal duties would not be effective until August 1, allowing additional time for negotiations on an issue that has created instability in worldwide markets.Trump stated that by July 9, most nations would receive either correspondence or finalise agreements, noting that some arrangements were already concluded.","Us president donald trump on monday released letters sent by his administration to various trading partners informing them of the reciprocal tariff rates that will be effective from august 1, 2025.

'An enduring symbol of love, compassion, patience': PM Modi on Dalai Lama

India says only Dalai Lama can pick successor

China on Monday protested against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday wishes to the Dalai Lama and the participation of senior Indian officials at his 90th birthday celebrations in Dharamshala, warning that India should not interfere in its internal affairs.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in a media briefing on Monday that New Delhi should “fully appreciate the great sensitivity of Xizang-related issues and recognise the separatist nature of the 14th Dalai Lama”.“The 14th Dalai Lama is a political exile, who for a long, has been engaged in separatist activities and attempted to separate Xizang from China under the cover of religion,” Mao said, as quoted by news agency PTI.“India should act and speak prudently and stop using this issue to meddle in China’s internal affairs,” she added.She confirmed that Beijing had lodged an official protest with the government. China refers to Tibet as Xizang and maintains that the Dalai Lama is part of a separatist movement, though he has long maintained that he only seeks greater autonomy for Tibetans within China.PM Modi, who was attending the Brics Summit, had posted a message on X on Sunday: “I join 1.4 billion Indians in extending our warmest wishes to His Holiness the Dalai Lama on his 90th birthday.He has been an enduring symbol of love, compassion, patience and moral discipline. His message has inspired respect and admiration across all faiths. We pray for his continued good health and long life.”The birthday event saw the attendance of Union ministers Kiren Rijiju and Rajiv Ranjan Singh, Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu, and Sikkim minister Sonam Lama, among others. Hollywood actor Richard Gere and political leaders from around the world also joined the celebrations, signalling strong support for the Tibetan spiritual leader.India has strongly rejected China's assertion that it has a role in selecting the next Dalai Lama, insisting the decision lies solely with the Tibetan spiritual leader and traditional Buddhist practices. “The Dalai Lama’s position is of immense importance, not just for Tibetans but for millions of his followers across the globe. The right to decide on his successor rests solely with him, in accordance with centuries-old Buddhist customs,” said Kiren Rijiju, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs and Minorities. He condemned Beijing’s stance as “unwarranted interference”.Also read: Dalai Lama cannot decide on reincarnation, says China; India maintains neutrality The response follows the Dalai Lama’s statement that his reincarnation would be determined by the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a body he established, and not by Chinese authorities. The Dalai Lama has previously indicated his successor would come from outside China, contradicting Beijing’s desire to select a pro-China figure from Tibet. China insists the process must include the 'Golden Urn' method and government approval.China has long maintained that any future reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must go through a process approved by the Chinese government, including the drawing of lots from a golden urn. Chinese ambassador to India Xu Feihong echoed this view, posting that “he has no authority to abolish or continue the system”.The ministry of external affairs also clarified India’s position. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “Government of India does not take any position or speak on matters concerning beliefs and practices of faith and religion.”",China lodges official protest against pm modi's birthday wishes to the dalai lama.

Yes, I fully support it. No, I do not support it.

NEW DELHI: More than 25 crore workers across sectors including banking, insurance, postal services, coal mining, and construction are expected to join a nationwide general strike on Wednesday, potentially disrupting key services across India, according to a joint forum of central trade unions.The strike, described as a ‘ Bharat Bandh ’, has been called by a forum of 10 central trade unions and their associates to protest against what they term “anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the government”.“Preparations have been taken up in earnest by unions in all sectors of the formal and informal/unorganised economy” and urged supporters to make the strike a “grand success"", said the forum in a statement.“All India Trade Union Congress’s Amarjeet Kaur said, “More than 25 crore workers are expected to take part in the strike. Farmers and rural workers will also join the protest across the country.” Harbhajan Singh Sidhu of Hind Mazdoor Sabha added, “Banking, postal, coal mining, factories, state transport services will be affected due to the strike.”The forum said it had earlier submitted a 17-point charter of demands to Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya but received no concrete response.It also alleged that the government had not conducted the annual labour conference for the past decade and was instead pushing through four labour codes that would weaken collective bargaining, cripple union activity, and favour employers in the name of “ease of doing business”.It further claimed that economic policies were deepening unemployment, raising prices of essential commodities, suppressing wages, and reducing expenditure on education, health, and civic amenities, thereby widening inequality and burdening the poor, lower-income groups, and the middle class.The statement added, “The government has abandoned the welfare state status of the country and is working in the interest of foreign and Indian corporates, and it is so evident from its policies being pursued vigorously.”The unions are also protesting against the privatisation of public sector enterprises, outsourcing, contractual employment, and casualisation of the workforce. They claim that the four labour codes passed in Parliament were designed to “suppress and cripple the trade union movement, increase working hours, snatch workers’ right to collective bargaining, right to strike, and decriminalise violation of labour laws by employers. ”“We are demanding from the government to address unemployment, recruitments against sanctioned posts, creation of more jobs, increase in days and remuneration of MGNREGA workers and enactment of similar legislation for urban areas. But the government is busy imposing ELI (Employment Linked Incentive) scheme to incentivise employers instead,” the statement said.It also alleged that instead of hiring young professionals, government departments were increasingly recruiting retired personnel, as seen in Railways, NMDC Ltd, steel sector, and education services — a move the unions say is harmful to a country where 65 percent of the population is below the age of 35 and unemployment is highest among those aged 20 to 25.Unions from NMDC Ltd, non-coal minerals, steel, state government departments, and other public sector enterprises have also served notices for participation in the strike.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha and a joint front of agricultural workers’ unions have also extended support to the strike and announced large-scale mobilisation in rural areas.Similar nationwide strikes were observed by trade unions on November 26, 2020; March 28-29, 2022; and February 16, 2023.(With inputs from news agency PTI)","More than 25 crore workers across sectors including banking, insurance, postal services, coal mining, and construction are expected to join a nationwide general strike.

MUMBAI: As the 30-day limit to submit the report of the preliminary investigation into the June 12 Air India accident in Ahmedabad to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) ends this week, there is anticipation India will release it to the public.The ICAO places no obligation on the investigating country to make the report public and India had not released the preliminary report of the last major accident at Calicut in 2020. But the AI 171 probe is being followed by the global airline industry with keen interest as it was the first major one involving a Boeing 787.""Apart from the roles and responsibilities of Air India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, and others, the investigation will crucially be a Boeing 787 systems-level case study. It's the first such global investigation of the 'more electric' B787 aircraft. The preliminary findings, if substantial and critical, could reshape B787 operations,"" said a senior commander, requesting anonymity. ""What we hear is that India will make the preliminary report public this time,"" he added.Prior to the June 12 accident, the last major fatal accident India investigated was the August 2020 Calicut Air India Express accident involving a Boeing 737 and 21 deaths.Back then, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) did not release its preliminary report to the public.Since an aircraft accident investigation is solely carried out to learn lessons and prevent a repeat — unlike a murder investigation, it does not apportion blame or trace culprits — most countries release their preliminary findings to the public.The last time the global aviation industry tracked an accident investigation closely was in 2018 after the Oct 29 Indonesian Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX crash. Keeping with the 30-day deadline, on Nov 28, Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee sent a preliminary report to ICAO and also publicly released it. In fact, it announced in advance that the preliminary report would be uploaded on its website at 10 am on November 28.“The preliminary investigation following Lion Air Flight 610 revealed that prior to the crash, a system called Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS engaged without the Lion Air pilots’ knowledge. Back then, Boeing hadn’t disclosed MCAS to any airlines or pilots. The MCAS lowers the nose automatically to prevent a stall, or the loss of lift, if it detects that the angle of the plane’s nose is too high relative to the ground. What we learnt from the preliminary report is that a malfunctioning sensor may have led the MCAS to engage repeatedly, countering the pilots’ manoeuvres,” said a B737 examiner. “When Ethiopian Airlines B737 MAX crashed five months later, it was the Lion Air preliminary report that came back into focus. The final report into the Lion Air crash came a year later; by then, the B737 MAX was already grounded globally,” he added.“If Air India accident preliminary report points to any possible warning or technical fault in the B787, you can imagine the impact it would have on Dreamliner operations globally,” the examiner said. Of all the accident investigations carried out by India in the past decades, this one is arguably the most followed investigation globally. The AAIB can submit the preliminary report to the ministry of civil aviation if it chooses. Under Annex 13 of ICAO, which lays down the guidelines for carrying out an accident investigation, the preliminary report has to be submitted by the state (India, in this case) to ICAO within 30 days of the occurrence.",The 30-day limit to submit the report of the preliminary investigation into the june 12 air india accident in ahmedabad ends this week.

NEW DELHI: Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Tuesday submitted its preliminary report on the AI171 plane crash to the ministry of civil aviation. The report is based on the initial findings of the probe, reported news agency ANI citing top sources.Meanwhile, a crucial meeting of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is scheduled for today, with top officials from the civil aviation ministry, including the civil aviation secretary and the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), expected to appear.The recent Air India Flight AI-171 crash in Ahmedabad is also likely to come up during the meeting, along with broader concerns over aviation safety.Sources confirmed ANI that the civil aviation Secretary and representatives from the DGCA have been summoned.However, the meeting’s primary focus will be on how passenger fees, airline charges, and other tariffs are determined and regulated for public infrastructure and airport services, in addition to ongoing safety concerns in the aviation sector.On June 12, a London-bound Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.The aircraft collided with a hostel complex at BJ Medical College, killing 241 of the 242 people on board. Among the victims was former Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani.Since the crash, the ministry of civil aviation has been assisting the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which is conducting a full-scale investigation. The AAIB, operating from its lab in New Delhi and equipped with advanced technology, is leading the probe.According to the ministry, the Crash Protection Module from one of the plane’s black boxes was retrieved and accessed by June 25, and data from it has been successfully downloaded. A source told ANI, an identical black box, referred to as a ""golden chassis"", was used to confirm whether the data could be accurately retrieved from the original black boxes.The investigation team comprises experts from the Indian Air Force, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), and the U.S.-based National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Additionally, officials from Boeing, GE, aviation medicine specialists, and Air Traffic Control experts are involved.

Brics rejects EU's unilateral carbon border tax proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brics-rejects-eus-unilateral-carbon-border-tax-proposal/articleshow/122327999.cms,"Brics Summit

NEW DELHI: The Brics nations have rejected the European Union's proposed carbon border tax, or the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), calling it ""unilateral, punitive and discriminatory protectionist measures"", and said the move, being made ""under the pretext of environmental concerns"", would undermine their capacities to invest in just energy transitions and development priorities.India has long been opposed to such measures and even flagged its concerns during the recent free trade agreement talks with the EU.The concerns of the group of 11 nations, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, over such trade barriers got reflected prominently in the 'Leaders' Framework Declaration on Climate Finance' adopted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Monday. The CBAM, to be implemented from next year, is a tool to impose border tax on carbon-intensive goods, such as iron & steel, aluminium and cement, that enter the 27 EU nations.Since it will impose a tariff burden on developing countries and impact their trade prospects, large exporters of such goods, including India and China, have consistently been opposing it.Condemning CBAM, the Brics nations declared that such measures are ""not in line with international law"", and said they oppose ""unilateral protectionist measures which deliberately disrupt the global supply and production chains and distort competition"".Besides flagging the EU's trade barrier, the Brics nations expressed ""serious concern"" over pre-2020 mitigation gaps for developed countries and urged them to urgently bridge the gaps between what they promised and what they have achieved in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The group asked the rich nations to increase their 2030 climate action targets and achieve net-zero emissions significantly ahead of 2050, preferably by 2030.Referring to the critical issue of finance that is going to dominate the climate talks (CO) in Belem, Brazil, later this year, the Brics nations called upon developed countries to meet their earlier goal of jointly mobilising $100 billion per year through 2025 to address the needs of developing countries, and achieve the finance goal of $300 billion per year by 2035.""We note that substantial gaps remain in fulfilling the financing needs identified by developing countries,"" the declaration said. The developed countries were also urged to increase their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation, doubling the amount from 2019 levels by 2025 at the least.","The brics nations have rejected the european union's proposed carbon border tax.

'Stop Funding Terror': Priyanka Chaturvedi Calls Out European Nations on 'Sweet' Trade Deals for Pak

NEW DELHI: Referring to the 2019 Pulwama attack , which resulted in 40 CRPF casualties, and the 2022 Gorakhnath Temple, the FATF on Tuesday said e-commerce and online payment platforms are being utilised for terrorist funding.The FATF's 'Comprehensive Update on Terrorist Financing Risks', a Global terror financing watchdog, highlighted state-sponsored terrorism, noting that various public sources and delegation inputs indicate ongoing financial and other support from several national governments to specific terrorist organisations.The FATF noted that delegations reported state sponsorship of terror financing as both a fundraising method and financial management strategy for certain terrorist organisations. Support manifested in various forms, including direct financial assistance, logistical aid, material resources, and training provisions, PTI reported.Following the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives, the FATF announced in June its intention to produce a detailed analysis of terrorist financing, incorporating cases from its global network of 200 jurisdictions.In an Indian case study, the FATF detailed how aluminum powder, a crucial component for an improvised explosive device, was acquired through EPOM Amazon to amplify the explosion's impact.""In February 2019, a suicide bombing targeted a convoy of Indian Security forces in Pulwama in Jammu & Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of 40 soldiers. India's authorities concluded that the attack was orchestrated by Jaish-I-Mohammed (JiM).""The investigation led to charges against 19 individuals under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, including terror financing provisions. Seven foreign nationals, including the suicide bomber, were among those charged. Law enforcement recovered related assets, including vehicles and terrorist hideouts.Indian officials have consistently highlighted Pakistan's ongoing support for terrorism and its diversion of multilateral funds for weapons procurement. Sources indicate India believes Pakistan's actions warrant its placement on the FATF's ""grey list"".The report identified terrorists' misuse of e-commerce platforms and online marketplaces for operational procurement of equipment, weapons, chemicals, and 3D-printing materials.These platforms enable terrorists to generate funds by selling items, including previously low-demand products.The FATF explained that EPOMs facilitate fund transfers through trade-based money laundering schemes. This involves purchasing items and sending them to accomplices via EPOMs for resale in different jurisdictions, using profits for terrorist financing.The report outlined methods for raising, moving, and managing terrorist funds, noting that online payment services offer greater anonymity than wire transfers, making it difficult to identify transaction participants.The report cited the April 3, 2022, Gorakhnath Temple incident where an ISIL-influenced individual attacked security personnel. The suspect transferred Rs 669,841 via PayPal internationally using VPNs and received Rs 10,323.35 from abroad.Financial investigations revealed the accused's VPN service payments and approximately 44 international third-party PayPal transactions totalling Rs 669,841 to foreign accounts. The suspect also received foreign funds through PayPal.The probe uncovered payments to multiple ISIL followers abroad supporting terrorist activities.""Due to the suspicious nature of these transactions and the potential for TF, PayPal suspended the accused's account, thereby preventing further illicit fund transfers,"" stated the FATF, citing India's finance ministry.The report noted the significant growth in Fintech payment services over the past decade, with terrorists increasingly utilising these services for their low cost, speed, and ability to obscure participants through pseudonyms or fake accounts.Europol's assessment indicates widespread use across terrorist organisations. Small cells, FTFs, and individual terrorists use P2P payment services for procuring military equipment, chemicals, and propaganda materials.The report noted EoRMT groups' use of peer-to-peer payments for selling merchandise promoting extremist ideologies, forming a key revenue source.Online payment services facilitate donations to larger organisations, particularly when integrated with social networks and content hosting services, enabling recruitment, crowdfunding, and fund transfers through a single platform.The report concluded that online payment services provide less transparency than wire transfers, complicating the identification of transaction participants.","The fatf on tuesday said e-commerce and online payment platforms are being utilised for terrorist funding.

NEW DELHI: India and China were among 12 countries that abstained in UN General Assembly from voting on a resolution on Afghanistan, seeking political inclusion and urging Taliban to reverse its repressive policies resulting in the ""grave, worsening, widespread and systematic oppression"" of all women and girls. The 193-member UNGA adopted the draft resolution introduced by Germany with 116 votes in favour, two against (US and Israel) and 12 abstentions.Explaining its abstention, India cited Kabul's strong condemnation of the Pahalgam attack, and said a coherent policy to address a post-conflict situation must be a mix of policy instruments: incentivising positive behaviour and disincentivising harmful actions.Pakistan, which has had a turbulent relationship with Taliban in recent times, voted in favour. On the contrary, India's ties with the Taliban have improved dramatically even in the absence of a formal recognition by New Delhi of the regime in Kabul, as evident from foreign minister S Jaishankar's recent contact over phone with Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. ""An approach focused only on punitive measures, in our view, is unlikely to succeed. The United Nations and the broader international community have adopted more balanced and nuanced approaches in other post-conflict contexts.However, no new policy instruments have been introduced to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan since Aug 2021,"" said P Harish, India's permanent representative to the UN. ""A 'business as usual' approach, without new and targeted initiatives, is unlikely to deliver the outcomes the international community envisions for the Afghan people,"" he added.""While we remain committed to continued engagement with all relevant stakeholders and broadly support the international community's efforts towards a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan, India has decided to abstain on this resolution,"" said Harish in his statement, while calling upon the international community to work together for an Afghanistan free of terrorist activities.""The international community must direct its coordinated efforts towards ensuring that entities and individuals designated by the UN Security Council, the Al Qaeda and their affiliates, ISIL and their affiliates, including Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, along with their regional sponsors who facilitate their operations, no longer exploit the Afghan territory for terrorist activities,"" said the ambassador.According to a UN News report, the UNGA resolution called on Taliban to swiftly reverse policies that exclude women from education, employment and public life. It also demanded that Afghanistan not be used as a safe haven for terrorist activity.","India and china were among 12 countries that abstained in un general assembly from voting on a resolution on afghanistan.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan army chief general Asim Munir on Monday rejected claims that Islamabad relied on external support during the recent four-day conflict with India, calling assertions ""factually incorrect"" and ""irresponsible. ""His response came days after Indian Army deputy chief Lieutenant General Rahul R Singh alleged that China provided active support to Pakistan during the operation, using the conflict as a “live lab” to test weapon systems, with Turkiye also supplying military equipment.Speaking at the national defence university in Islamabad during a graduation ceremony, Munir said, “Insinuations regarding external support in Pakistan's successful Operation Bunyanum Marsoos are irresponsible and factually incorrect and reflect a chronic reluctance to acknowledge indigenous capability and institutional resilience developed over decades of strategic prudence.”He criticised India for involving other countries into what he described as a ""purely bilateral military conflagration.""“Naming other states as participants in the purely bilateral military conflagration is also a shoddy attempt at playing camp politics,” he said.Munir warned that any future provocation would be met with full force. “Any misadventure or attempt to undermine Pakistan's sovereignty will be met with a swift, and resolute response without any constraints or inhibitions,” he said.He further added, “Any attempt to target our population centres, military bases, economic hubs and ports will instantly invoke a deeply hurting and more than reciprocal response.”Munir rejected claims that Pakistan had to plead for an end to the fighting, saying wars are not decided by media headlines or imported weapons.“Wars are not won through media rhetoric, imported fancy hardware, or political sloganeering, but through faith, professional competence, operational clarity, institutional strength and national resolve,” he said. Operation Sindoor was launched by India on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which killed 26 civilians.The operation targeted 9 terrorist infrastructure sites in areas controlled by Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Pok).The operation led to four days of intense military exchanges, ending on May 10 after both sides agreed to halt the hostilities.Last week, deputy chief of army staff (capability development and sustenance), lieutenant general Rahul R Singh provided details on how China was helping Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.Speaking at the 'New Age Military Technologies' event organised by FICCI, the general said, ""When the DGMO level talks were going on, Pakistan was getting live inputs of our deployment from China. So that is one place we really need to move fast and take appropriate action.""""When the DGMO level talks were going on, Pakistan actually was mentioning that we know that your such and such important, sort of vector is primed, and it is ready for action. I would request you to perhaps, you know, pull it back. So he was getting live inputs from China,"" Singh added.Furthermore, the general explained how India was fighting three adversaries at the same time, naming Pakistan, China, and Turkey.The general said, ""We had one border and two adversaries, actually three. Pakistan was in the front. China was providing all possible support. 81% of the military hardware with Pakistan is Chinese... China is able to test its weapons against other weapons, so it's like a live lab available to them. Turkey also played an important role in providing the type of support it did; they gave Bayraktar. We saw numerous other drones also coming in during the war.

Surveillance aircraft aborts mission after laser incident

Poll Should international military forces face stricter rules of engagement in shared maritime zones? Yes, to prevent dangerous incidents No, current protocols are sufficient

ASPIDES mission: Civilian protection, not combat

No immediate response from Beijing

What this means for maritime security





Germany on Tuesday said a Chinese military vessel targeted a German surveillance aircraft with a laser in the Red Sea, triggering strong diplomatic protest and the summoning of the Chinese ambassador in Berlin. The aircraft was part of the EU-led ASPIDES mission, which protects civilian vessels navigating through high-risk waters threatened by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.The German foreign office called the act “entirely unacceptable” and accused the Chinese warship of endangering both personnel and operational safety. The incident has added a new layer of tension to the already volatile maritime zone.The laser was reportedly fired earlier this month by a Chinese warship that had been encountered repeatedly in the area, according to Germany’s defense ministry, AP reported. The targeted aircraft was operated by a civilian commercial provider, with German army personnel onboard. The ministry clarified that there was no prior contact or reason given for the laser targeting.""By using the laser, the warship accepted the risk of endangering people and material,"" said a defense ministry spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity, as quoted by AP.As a precaution, the aircraft aborted its mission and safely landed at its base in Djibouti.Fortunately, the crew was unharmed, and the aircraft has since resumed operations under the EU mission.The ASPIDES mission, under the EU’s common security and defence policy, is focused exclusively on protecting commercial and merchant vessels transiting through the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and the Indian Ocean. It does not participate in any offensive or military strikes.The southern Red Sea is designated a high-risk zone due to the escalating threat from Houthi rebel attacks. These attacks, often targeting international shipping, have disrupted global trade and heightened tensions in the region.As of Tuesday, China had not issued any formal response to Germany’s accusations. The Chinese embassy in Berlin and China’s foreign ministry remained silent following the diplomatic summons.Meanwhile, Yemen’s Houthi rebels launched another hours-long assault on a Liberian-flagged cargo ship in the Red Sea, a day after claiming to have sunk another vessel. The continued violence underlines the volatile environment in which the EU mission is operating.The laser incident, while not causing injuries, raises serious concerns about the rules of engagement and safety protocols among military forces in shared international waters. For Berlin, the use of a laser device by a Chinese warship with no prior warning amounts to a breach of operational norms, particularly within a peacekeeping mission.With diplomatic pressure mounting and threats in the region continuing, the European Union may be forced to revisit security guidelines, especially when multiple global powers operate in close proximity within contested zones.","A chinese military vessel targeted a german surveillance aircraft with a laser in the red sea, triggering strong diplomatic protest and the summoning of the chinese ambassador in berlin.

What is the Einstein visa? How Melania Trump qualified for a visa reserved for Nobel-level talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-einstein-visa-how-melania-trump-qualified-for-a-visa-reserved-for-nobel-level-talent/articleshow/122204926.cms,"

What is the EB-1 or 'Einstein' visa?

How did Melania Trump qualify for the Einstein visa?

The larger debate: Loopholes, privilege, and policy





When Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein visa,” in 2001, it raised eyebrows and continues to stir debate. Reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, arts, education, business, or athletics, the EB-1 green card is typically associated with Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, or globally recognized experts. Melania, a Slovenian model at the time, was not widely known for groundbreaking accomplishments, prompting questions about how she met the high bar required. So, what exactly is the Einstein visa, and how did the former First Lady qualify for a program meant for the world’s best and brightest?The EB-1 visa is a US employment-based green card designed for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in specific fields, or who are recognized as outstanding professors, researchers, or multinational executives. Applicants must prove “sustained national or international acclaim” and either win a major international award (like a Nobel Prize) or meet at least three of ten criteria set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include published work, media recognition, contributions to a field of major significance, or commanding a high salary compared to others in the same field.While the standards are rigorous, the process is subjective.Immigration officers ultimately decide if the evidence supports a claim of extraordinary ability. This subjectivity has sparked debate over how consistently the criteria are applied and who benefits most from its loopholes.Melania Trump, then known as Melania Knauss, was living in New York as a model when she applied for the EB-1 visa in 2000. It was approved the following year. Though she was featured in magazines and had some runway experience, she had not received prestigious modeling awards or reached the supermodel status typically associated with international acclaim. Critics argue her qualifications were modest compared to the visa's intent.Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett recently reignited the controversy, questioning whether Melania’s case truly exemplifies merit-based immigration. Her approval has drawn comparisons to other questionable EB-1 recipients, including Playboy models and niche artists who managed to craft narratives aligning with the visa’s requirements.Experts note that while the visa is often seen as exclusive, it can be awarded to applicants whose accomplishments, though not widely known, are well-documented and strategically framed within a narrow field. In Melania’s case, her successful petition may have emphasized uniqueness in her modeling niche, media presence, or professional trajectory.The EB-1 program, limited to around 40,000 visas annually, has been praised for attracting top global talent. But its subjective evaluation process has also made it vulnerable to exploitation. Legal experts and immigration attorneys admit that certain applicants with the right legal guidance can tailor their portfolios to meet the criteria, even without widely celebrated achievements.Adding to the irony, Melania later used her citizenship to sponsor her parents for green cards through “chain migration,” a policy her husband, Donald Trump, has publicly opposed. This contradiction has further politicized her immigration journey and raised broader questions about fairness, privilege, and transparency in the US immigration system.","Melania trump received an eb-1 visa, often dubbed the ‘einstein visa,’ in 2001.

Elon Musk's America Party: Laura Loomer predicts these people may join to spite Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-america-party-laura-loomer-predicts-these-people-may-join-to-spite-donald-trump/articleshow/122291639.cms,"ELON MUSK Forms New 'AMERICA PARTY', Declares War On Trump & Republicans | US News

Laura Loomer predicts defections to undermine Donald Trump

A bold move from Elon Musk

Cracks within the Republican base



Conservative activist Laura Loomer has reignited political tensions by claiming that several prominent conservatives may align with Elon Musk’s newly launched America Party, not necessarily out of shared ideology, but to undermine US President Donald Trump. Loomer’s remarks, shared publicly on social media, come in the wake of Musk’s official announcement of the America Party. Musk framed it as a bold alternative to the entrenched two-party system. The tech billionaire’s increasing political activity, combined with high-profile disagreements with Trump, is stirring speculation about a growing split on the American right.The timing of Loomer’s prediction is especially notable. It came just after President Trump signed off on the controversial “Big, Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping tax and spending package that drew criticism from fiscal conservatives and Musk alike. As ideological fault lines widen, Loomer’s comments reflect growing discontent within Republican ranks and hint at a possible political realignment ahead of 2026.Shortly after Musk’s announcement, Laura Loomer took to X (formerly Twitter) to make a striking prediction. She named Tucker Carlson, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG), and Rep. Thomas Massie as potential defectors to Musk’s America Party, a move she believes would be aimed at undercutting Donald Trump’s influence. “I predict Tucker Carlson, MTG, and Thomas Massie will join the new ‘America Party’ to spite President Trump,” Loomer wrote.Loomer, a longtime Trump supporter known for her hardline views, has frequently called out fellow conservatives whom she believes are disloyal or politically opportunistic. Her latest comments add fuel to speculation about rising fault lines within the GOP.Elon Musk officially launched the America Party on July 4, declaring it a response to public frustration with the current political establishment. In a widely shared post, Musk wrote, ""By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""His decision followed a public fallout with President Trump over the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” Musk had strongly opposed the legislation, criticizing its size and scope. His move to form a new party signals an effort to reshape the political conversation, particularly among conservatives dissatisfied with Trump-era policies.Tensions between Trump and various Republican figures have been escalating, especially over issues like government spending and party direction. Rep. Thomas Massie, a libertarian-leaning Republican from Kentucky, has frequently clashed with Trump, including during the pandemic when he opposed Covid relief packages. Trump once referred to him as a “pathetic loser.”Marjorie Taylor Greene, although once a close Trump ally, has recently voiced support for some of Musk’s positions. Tucker Carlson, meanwhile, has maintained a complicated relationship with Trump and may be open to political shifts that align with his populist brand. Loomer’s naming of these figures underscores growing uncertainty about where influential conservatives will place their loyalty going forward.Whether or not Carlson, Greene, or Massie will formally align with the America Party remains to be seen. But the speculation itself is already shifting political dynamics, raising new questions about Trump’s grip on the GOP and whether Musk can truly disrupt the conservative power structure.As the 2026 elections approach, the right is poised for internal battles that may define its future. One thing is clear. Elon Musk is no longer just a disruptor in tech. He is now a force reshaping the landscape of American politics.","Laura loomer predicts defections to undermine donald trump.

Texas flash floods have claimed at least 82 lives, with numerous other holiday visitors and campers still missing after torrential rains triggered a rapid and devastating rise in water levels. Kerr County emerged as the worst-hit region as nearly 12 inches of rain fell early Friday morning during an overnight storm, causing the Guadalupe River to surge 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The disaster unfolded over the holiday weekend, catching many off guard and overwhelming campsites, roads, and riverside communities.This tragedy underscores a stark reality: flash floods are the deadliest weather hazard in the United States, surpassing hurricanes and tornadoes in annual fatalities. The National Weather Service reports an average of over 125 flood-related deaths each year. As communities continue to reel from this latest disaster, it becomes yet another entry in a long history of devastating US floods from Hurricane Katrina to Superstorm Sandy that reveal the escalating threat of extreme weather events. Here are the 10 most disastrous flood events in the US in the last 25 years that will shake you.The Texas Hill Country flood now adds to the growing list of flood disasters that have devastated parts of the US Here’s a closer look at some of the most severe flood events in the US:O ne of the most recent deadly events, Hurricane Helene tore through Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Virginia in September 2024. The storm caused around 250 fatalities, most of which were due to inland flooding, not wind.North Carolina alone reported 108 deaths, and entire Appalachian communities were left cut off from electricity, communications, and vital supplies. It was the deadliest hurricane since Katrina in 2005.In July 2022, relentless rainfall triggered catastrophic flooding in eastern Kentucky, killing 45 people, according to the Associated Press.Meteorologists noted that the floods destroyed entire neighborhoods, schools, water systems, and roadways. Thousands of residents lost their homes and belongings overnight, marking one of the worst natural disasters in Kentucky’s history.A staggering 17 inches of rain fell within 24 hours in Waverly, Tennessee, in August 2021. The resulting flood claimed 20 lives, including young twin babies swept from their father’s arms. The rapid rise in water levels overwhelmed communities, destroying homes, vehicles, and businesses.One of the most infamous recent disasters, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 hurricane, then stalled, releasing historic rainfall over Houston and surrounding areas.
