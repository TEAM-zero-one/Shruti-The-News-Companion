Pakistan claimed that its three air bases were targeted - Nur Khan air base in the garrison city of Rawalpindi near the capital Islamabad, Murid air base in Chakwal city and Rafiqui air base in the Jhang district of eastern Punjab province.Reports also said that Army has destroyed Pakistani posts and terrorist launch pads, from where tube-launched drones were also being launched, as per defence sources.Surface-to-air missile systems were activated in Srinagar and there was heavy engagement ongoing at the LoC.The Indian retaliatory action comes in the wake of continuous targeting of Indian cities and security establishment by Pakistan. On Friday, Pakistan used armed drones to target 26 locations across the border -- from Jammu and Kashmir to Gujarat.Defence sources said the enemy's attempts to hit vital installations for second successive night, included airports and air bases, were successfully thwarted.On Thursday night, India successfully prevented Pakistan's attempts to strike military sites with drones and missiles after foiling its attempts to target military installations in 15 cities in the northern and western parts of the country.The Indian armed forces had on Wednesday carried out precise missile strikes on nine terror targets in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Pakistan under Operation Sindoor in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 innocent civilians were killed.The ministry of external affairs had on Friday said that the Indian armed forces responded “proportionately, adequately, and responsibly” to Pakistan's provocative drone and artillery attacks on Thursday night. It also added that India in its retaliatory action launched armed drones at four Pakistani defence sites and destroyed its AD radar.The response followed Pakistan's large-scale violation of Indian airspace on the night of May 7 and 8, when it launched hundreds of drones and heavy artillery across the Line of Control (LoC) and International Border.Colonel Sofiya Qureshi explained the nature of the attack: ""On the night of May 7 and 8, the Pakistani army violated Indian airspace several times over the entire western border with the intention of targeting military infrastructure. Not only this, the Pakistani army also fired heavy caliber weapons along the Line of Control. Around 300 to 400 drones were used to attempt infiltration at 36 locations. The Indian armed forces shot down many of these drones using kinetic and non-kinetic means. The possible purpose of such large-scale aerial intrusions was to test air defence systems and collect intelligence. Forensic investigation of the wreckage of the drones is being done. Initial reports suggest that they are Turkish Asisguard Songar drones.""","Multiple explosions heard at several locations in pakistan pointing to indian punitive action.

NEW DELHI: Multiple explosions were reported at several Pakistani military bases early Saturday morning, as tensions with India reached a new high.

NEW DELHI: Following Pakistan's repeated failure to breach India's air defence, Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir may engineer terror attacks inside India.Sources said the possibility of Munir, who as ISI chief scripted the 2019 Pulwama suicide attack, ordering Pakistan's terror proxies to carry out such strikes was real, adding India was ramping up its defences to prevent them.The sources pointed to the presence of senior Pakistan army personnel at the funeral of terrorists who were killed in India's strikes on nine terror camps in Pakistan and POK on the night of May 6-7. ""It was quite a moment when they dropped the fiction of terrorists being non-state actors; that too, when the global spotlight is trained on them. While it may signal defiance, it underlined their compulsion not to offend the jihadis they have raised and trained to hurt India,"" said a senior source. He also said that for Pakistan to desert terrorists at a time when they are grieving, fearful and, perhaps, thirsting for revenge would amount to abandoning their favourite weapon against India.As per the estimate of the security establishment here, the risk of terrorists trying to set off fresh attacks has risen also because of India’s success in neutralising the efforts to breach its air defence and target its military facilities over the past 48 hours. “They may fall back on the default option of using terror proxies to compensate for the failure of their forces,” a senior govt functionary involved in decision-making said. “Tragic aberrations like the Pahalgam massacre notwithstanding, India has been very successful in thwarting terror attacks over the past 10 years. But now we have to brace for a higher level of desperation,” he said.","Pakistan army chief general asim munir may engineer terror attacks inside india.

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday night repelled 300 to 400 drones launched by Pakistan across the entire western front to target military and civilian establishments and then undertook a swift counter-strike against four air defence sites, even as deadly artillery duels led to soldiers being killed on both sides.The Pakistani attack resumed on Friday night, with drones once again being spotted in 26 locations in a wide arc, ranging from Srinagar, Baramulla and Awantipora in the north to Bhuj in the south, along both the international border and the Line of Control with Pakistan.The locations targeted included Srinagar airport , Avantipora air base, Baramulla, Nagrota, Jammu, Ferozpur, Pathankot, Fazilka, Lalgarh Jatta, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bhuj, Kuarbet and Lakhi Nala.""These included armed drones posing potential threats to civilian and military targets,"" an officer said.The attack on Srinagar airport followed one on Jammu the previous night.While the armed forces neutralised the bulk of the drones with a variety of air defence weapons, an armed drone targeted a civilian area in Ferozpur, resulting in severe injuries to members of a family.On Thursday, the intrusion by drones, mainly Turkish but some also from China, came in three waves at 36 locations across the LoC and IB, stretching from Leh to Sir Creek, between 8pm and midnight.Pakistan also used an armed UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) to target Bathinda military station, headquarters of the Army's 10 'Chetak Corps'. The UAV was swiftly detected and neutralised by Indian air defence systems.""These provocative and escalatory actions taken by Pakistan last night were targeted at Indian cities and civilian infrastructure, in addition to some military targets. The Indian armed forces responded proportionately, adequately and responsibly,"" foreign secretary Vikram Misri said at a briefing.The counter-strike saw four Israeli-origin Harop and Harpy armed drones being launched once again by the IAF against four air defence sites in Pakistan. ""One of our drones was able to destroy an air defence radar,"" Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said.Indian air defence units, which are plugged into the IAF's fully-automated integrated air command and control system (IACCS) network, destroyed 50 of the Pakistani drones using L-70 anti-aircraft guns, ZU-23 twin-barrel guns and other weapons.Another 20 drones were brought down after being jammed by a variety of devices, while the rest flew back across the border.With some of the drones being unarmed, Wing Commander Singh said, ""The possible purpose of these large-scale aerial intrusions was to test our air defence systems and gather intelligence.""Preliminary forensic analysis of some drone debris showed they were Asisguard Songar drones of Turkey, she said. Equipped with both daylight and infrared cameras, the Turkish drones have an operational range of 10 km and can be configured for various missions ranging from area surveillance to target detection and destruction.Turkiye has deep ties with Pakistan and has repeatedly endorsed Islamabad's position on Kashmir.Along the 778-km LoC, Pakistan also carried out heavy artillery shelling and used armed drones in Tangdhar, Uri, Poonch, Mendhar, Rajouri, Akhnoor and Udhampur areas in Jammu & Kashmir on Thursday night.Around 20 ceasefire violations were recorded, 13 south of the Pir Panjal range and seven north of it. In the heavy exchange of fire, at least one Indian soldier was killed and another 10 injured. Two civilian deaths were also reported from the Uri sector. ""Pakistan army also suffered major losses in Indian retaliatory fire,"" Colonel Sofia Qureshi said.The shadowboxing between the rival navies also continued in the northern Arabian Sea, with both issuing 'NavArea' warnings for ships to stay away from specified coordinates due to firing exercises by their warships.

NEW DELHI: Given the evolving conflict situation since the launch of ' Operation Sindoor ' by India against Pakistan in response to the killing of 26 tourists at Pahalgam, Supreme Court on Friday told the Centre that the time is not right for the discharge of 69 short service commission officers (SSCOs), including 47 women.""In the prevailing situation, let us not bring their morale down.They are brilliant officers. Their services can be used somewhere else. This is not the time to force them to roam the corridors of the Supreme Court.

""This is based on a policy to keep the armed forces young,"" she said.Appearing for Lt Col Geeta Sharma , senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the administrative decision could not be discriminatory and that when there are vacancies in PC officers' posts, there is no reason why SSCOs like Sharma are not granted PC. Guruswamy cited the example of Col Sofiya Qureshi, who fought a legal battle to get PC and is now seen briefing the media about the Operation Sindoor.The bench said the question before the court is purely a legal one and has nothing to do with individual officers. However, it stayed the discharge of SSCOs till Aug 6-7, when the court would hear the petitioners and the govt in detail.Bhati informed the court that Sharma, commissioned in the Corps of Signals in March 2011, was considered for permanent commission in Dec 2020 and was found fit for four-year extension of service.For her batch of 204 SSCOs, 77 technical and 127 non-technical, there were 119 vacancies of permanent commission. PC was granted to 118 SSCOs, and a four-year extension to 56 others. In all, 30 batchmates of Sharma were released from service from March 18. However, the release of eight female SSCOs has been stayed.

They have burn injuries. Doctors will treat them.Most of the drones have been neutralised by the army,"" said Bhupinder Singh Sidhu.The attack comes just a day after Pakistan’s attempt to target Indian military infrastructure was thwarted by India’s air defence systems. On May 7 and 8, Pakistan violated Indian airspace along the Line of Control (LoC) and International Border, launching hundreds of drones and heavy artillery. However, India’s air defence forces intercepted most of the drones, preventing further damage.On Friday, drones from Pakistan were again spotted in the Jammu, Samba, and Pathankot sectors. In the Samba sector, explosions were heard as the Indian air defence systems intercepted these drones.To reduce risks, a precautionary blackout was imposed in areas like Akhnoor and Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir, and Ferozepur in Punjab.The blackout aimed to protect civilians and infrastructure from further drone attacks.The situation remains tense, with additional security measures in place, including blackouts in areas such as Ambala, Panchkula, and Jaisalmer.Colonel Sofiya Qureshi confirmed in a press briefing that Pakistan deployed 300 to 400 drones across 36 locations on the night of May 7 and 8.

NEW DELHI: Judea Pearl , father of Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl , has posed searing questions to Pakistan's leaders following reports of elimination of Abdul Rauf Asghar , a Jaish-e-Mohammed commander, who was among those who masterminded his murder after luring him to Pakistan.He also sought justice for his son while dismissing as eyewash Pakistan's claim of having taken action against his son's killers.As dignitaries and Pakistan army officers were spotted attending the funeral of terrorists killed in India's surgical strike on May 7, Pearl wondered what exactly they were mourning and what role models they wished their children to revere.While expressing gratitude to those who reached out to him after Rauf's elimination by Indian military forces, Judea detailed the Jaish commander's role in a post on X. He said Rauf was ""a Pakistani extremist and leader of the terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed"". ""His group wasn't directly involved in Daniel's abduction but was indirectly responsible, as his (Rauf's) actions led to Omar Sheikh's release from prison during the Kandahar hijack.

Judea asked the international community not to forget that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Pakistani who scripted the 9/11 attack on New York, and Sheikh had not been punished yet for Daniel's murder. ""I hope this incident will help refocus attention on two other criminals directly involved in Danny's murder,"" he said, seeking justice for his son's tragic death.Daniel was kidnapped by jihadi terrorists in Jan 2002 while he was on his way to what he had expected would be an interview with Pakistani religious cleric Mubarak Ali Gilani in Karachi.","Judea pearl questions pakistan's leaders following elimination of abdul rauf asghar.

NEW DELHI: After Pakistan attacked 26 locations across LoC, India reportedly launched missiles targeting three Pakistani air bases on Saturday. This development follows heightened tensions after April 22 terror attack in Kashmir's Pahalgam that claimed the lives of 26 tourists, including a Nepali national.Reports claim that explosions were heard at three Pakistani installations - Nur Khan air base in Rawalpindi, Murid air base in Chakwal and Rafiqui air base in eastern Punjab province's Jhang district.Pakistan Air Force Base Nur Khan, situated in Chaklala, Rawalpindi is around 10km from Islamabad, Pakistan capital.It is an active airbase that encompasses the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport within its grounds.The facility, originally established as RAF Station Chaklala and later known as PAF Base Chaklala, continues to serve as a vital military installation in Pakistan.The base is also home to PAF College Chaklala, which trains Aviation Cadets, and Fazaia Inter College Nur Khan, providing additional educational facilities on the premises.Located near Punjab's Chakwal District, Murid serves as an operational flying base for the Pakistan Air Force. The base is notable for housing the PAF's UCAV and UAV fleet.The base plays a strategic role in Pakistan's air defense capabilities through its unmanned aerial vehicle operations.Pakistan Air Force Base Rafiqui, situated near Shorkot in Jhang District, is a major military installation located 337 kilometers south of Islamabad. The base features a 10,000-foot runway with a parallel taxiway that serves as an emergency landing strip.The airbase was previously known as PAF Base Shorkot before being renamed after Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui, a fighter pilot from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.The base's infrastructure includes a primary runway and an emergency taxiway system that allows for aircraft recovery operations when needed.Earlier, army reported that drones were detected in 26 locations across LoC. The army confirmed tracking and engaging these drones.
