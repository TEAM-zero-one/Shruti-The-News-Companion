Poll Should the Supreme Court mandate the release of the flight data recorder information? Yes, for transparency. No, for confidentiality.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday raised serious concerns over the AAIB preliminary report on the June 12 Air India Crash , calling certain aspects ""irresponsible."" A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh issued notice to Centre and the director general of civil aviation (DGCA) on a plea seeking an independent, fair and expeditious probe.The bench examined the July 12 preliminary report, which suggested lapses on the part of pilots in the Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who is representing the aviation safety NGO, Safety Matters Foundation led by Captain Amit Singh (FRAeS), contended that three members of the probe panel were from the aviation regulator, raising potential conflict-of-interest concerns.He also urged the court to order the release of the flight data recorder (FDR) information to clarify the cause of the accident.The plea highlighted that AAIB's preliminary report attributed the accident to the fuel cutoff switches being moved from ""run"" to ""cutoff,"" effectively implying pilot error.The plea also alleged that the report withholds critical information, including the full Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) output, complete Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) transcripts with time stamps and Electronic Aircraft Fault Recording (EAFR) data.Supreme Court stressed the issues of confidentiality, privacy and dignity while acknowledging the need for a final report. It warned that releasing certain details could be exploited by rival airlines, but clarified that its notices were limited to ensuring a free, fair, and independent investigation.","Supreme court raises serious concerns over the aaib preliminary report on the june 12 air india crash.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in New York, marking their first in-person meeting since US President Donald Trump imposed additional tariffs on India.Both the leaders met on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).""Good to meet @SecRubio this morning in New York. Our conversation covered a range of bilateral and international issues of current concern. Agreed on the importance of sustained engagement to progress on priority areas.

Trump on Friday (US time) issued a new presidential proclamation titled ""Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers"" that introduces a major overhaul to the H-1B visa programme, imposing a steep $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, raising fresh questions about whether this is a much-needed correction or a potentially crippling blow to America's tech talent pipeline.The new fee takes effect from 12:01 am on September 21, 2025, prompting immigration attorneys and companies to advise H-1B holders or their families currently outside the US to return immediately or risk being stranded.The fee increase represents a massive jump from the current $2,000–5,000 range, sparking concerns over its impact on startups, small businesses, and Indian IT professionals.",S jaishankar met us secretary of state marco rubio in new york.

Yes, more measures required No, current measures are adequate

Here are ten things to know about the incident:

A 32-year-old man from Telangana’s Mahabubnagar district, Mohammad Nizamuddin, who had moved to the United States in 2016 to pursue higher education, was allegedly shot dead by police in Santa Clara, California on September 3. Nizamuddin had first studied at Florida College before joining a private company, where his performance earned him a promotion that eventually took him to California, according to his family’s account. His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, a retired teacher, expressed shock and grief, saying he was informed only recently about his son’s killing, which reportedly occurred weeks earlier in the United States. The family claimed they were left in the dark for nearly two weeks, learning about Nizamuddin’s death only on September 18, when a friend from Raichur, Karnataka, informed them of the tragic news. According to reports, the incident began with a quarrel among roommates over an air-conditioning issue, which escalated into a violent scuffle involving knives before neighbors called police for help. The Santa Clara Police department said its officers responded to a 911 call reporting a stabbing, encountered Nizamuddin holding a knife, and opened fire, which led to him being shot. Police chief Cory Morgan defended the officer’s actions, saying that the shooting likely prevented further harm and may have saved the life of another roommate who had already been stabbed. Nizamuddin’s relatives, however, have raised questions about the speed of the police response, alleging that no proper inquiry was conducted before shots were fired, leaving the family with unanswered concerns. His body remains in a hospital in California awaiting formalities, while his grieving family in Mahabubnagar has appealed to both the Indian government and the Telangana state government to repatriate his remains. Nizamuddin’s father and community representatives, including Majlis Bachao Tehreek leader Amjed Ullah Khan, have urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene urgently and help bring his body back to India so the family can perform last rites in their hometown.

NEW DELHI: The death of Indian techie Mohammed Nizamuddin in Santa Clara, California, has drawn strong reactions, with police describing him as an armed aggressor, his family alleging a hasty and excessive response, neighbours recalling a domestic quarrel that turned deadly, and him alleging workplace racial harassment, including ""wage-fraud, wrongful termination and obstruction of justice.Santa Clara police said they were called to a residence on September 3 after reports of a stabbing, where they found Nizamuddin allegedly armed with a knife after attacking his roommate. Officers claimed he ignored commands and appeared poised to strike again, prompting them to open fire, fatally wounding him, while his injured roommate was hospitalized and two knives were recovered from the scene.The family of Nizamuddin alleged that the shooting ""happened so quickly."" His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, said they were only informed weeks after the September 3 incident.""The account says the roommates had a quarrel -- something about the AC or something in the room -- and in the ensuing scuffle knives were involved. A neighbour phoned the police. When the police entered the room, they asked the occupants to show their hands. One boy complied; the other did not. The police then fired four rounds and the child was shot.It is extremely regrettable that, according to the reports, no proper inquiry took place and the shooting happened so quickly,"" ANI quoted a relative said.The family of the Telangana man has appealed to the external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene in the matter and help bring back Mohammad Nizamuddin's body.Indian consulate expressed condolences and assured ""all possible consular assistance."" ""We are saddened by the death of an Indian national, Mr. Mohammed Nizamuddin, in an incident involving Santa Clara Police. We are in contact with the local authorities & the family, and we will extend all possible consular assistance.

The family of Rakesh Kumar, 30, has written to the ministry of external affairs (MEA), sought support from the Indian embassy in Moscow, and approached local officials in a bid to bring him back home.Rakesh, a resident of Kushmoth village in Shaktifarm under Sitarganj tehsil, had left for Russia on Aug 7 after securing admission to St Petersburg University on a study visa. However, within a few days, he began hinting at being in a troubling situation, suggesting things were not going as planned.His elder brother, Deepu Maurya, said the last time they had a direct conversation was on Aug 30, when Rakesh informed them that he had been forcibly drafted into the Russian army and would soon be deployed to the war zone in Ukraine. After that call, his phone went unreachable. The family later received a photo of Rakesh in a Russian military uniform, which only heightened their fears and confirmed their worst suspicions.A few days later, Rakesh called again, this time from an unfamiliar Russian number. In a short and distressed conversation, he told them that his passport and personal documents had been seized, his official emails had been deleted, and that he had undergone military training in the Donbas region before being sent to the battlefield. That was the last they heard from him.""We do not even know if he is alive. We just want the govt to bring him back home safely,"" said Deepu. The family wrote to MEA on Sept 5 and has also reached out to elected representatives and the local administration.This is not the first such case to surface in recent months.

Khalistani Outfit Threatens To 'Siege' Indian Consulate In Vancouver; Targets New Envoy

Gosal allegedly planned violence at Indian consulates in Canada

Inderjit Singh Gosal, who took over Canada's Khalistan referendum campaign after Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing, is learned to have been arrested by Canadian police. Gosal is also the Canada coordinator for terror group Sikhs for Justice and has links with Babbar Khalsa International, also a designated terror outfit.The action comes shortly after India's national security adviser Ajit Doval and his Canadian counterpart, Nathalie Drouin, held talks in Delhi last week.The arrest - made on multiple firearms charges - signals a shift from Canada's previous approach.Gosal was also an accused in the case of violence at the temple in the Greater Toronto Area last year but was let off after a brief detention. Ties nosedived after the killing of Nijjar, a wanted terrorist, as former Canadian PM Justin Trudeau accused Indian agencies of masterminding it. In Oct last year, India said it was pulling out its high commissioner and five other diplomats due to Ottawa's attempt to link them to the Nijjar case. It also expelled many Canadian diplomats.Gosal came to the forefront of anti-India activities in Canada and campaigned aggressively for Khalistan referendum. Multiple instances of confrontations were reported as pro-Khalistan activists sought to get other Sikhs to sign off on their secessionist agenda.Gosal even acted as one of the personal security officers to SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannu during his visits to Canada. He was also allegedly involved in the planning of the violence at Indian consulate establishments in Canada.A few months ago, he had revealed that Canadian police had asked him to be ""careful"" against a possible hit. Canadian police had also subsequently claimed that Gosal was among the 13 citizens of the country who were targets of criminal violence aimed at pro-Khalistan elements. ""As a result of being the organiser of Khalistan referendum, I am facing an imminent threat to my life from the agents and proxies of the govt of India but I have to continue. .."" he told a Canadian new website.","Inderjit singh gosal took over canada's khalistan referendum campaign after hardeep singh nijjar's killing.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court sought on Monday responses from DGCA, Aircraft Accidents Investigation Bureau and the Centre on steps taken to conduct an independent, impartial and expeditious probe into the crash of Air India's June 12 London-bound flight.The court told PIL petitioner NGO 'Safety Matters Foundation' that its demand to make public details of the flight data recorder could have serious consequences for relatives of the pilots.All passengers and crew, barring one, were killed in the crash. ""We have seen how one single sentence from the preliminary inquiry report was plucked out by western and Indian media to lay the blame on pilot error. Such selective reporting causes immense agony... Confidentiality of the investigations should be maintained till the submission of the final report,"" Justice Surya Kant said.Appearing for the NGO, Prashant Bhushan said even after more than 100 days, people do not know the exact cause of the crash, even as experts are of the opinion that electrical system failure of the Boeing aircraft cut off fuel supply to the engine. ""Releasing FDR data would enable independent experts to analyse it and help reach a logical conclusion,"" he said.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh said selective release would enable all these experts to sit in podcasts and give their opinion, running many parallel theories. Bhushan then questioned the fairness of the investigation, saying the five-member probe team included three DGCA officers, which could also be under scrutiny for not carrying out regular safety checks on aircraft under the airlines.The NGO said, ""The preliminary report is incomplete, selective, and lacking in transparency, thereby undermining credibility of the investigative process and the trust of the travelling public. By withholding critical data, omitting safety recommendations, disregarding documented technical anomalies, and prematurely attributing blame to the pilots, the respondent has created a skewed narrative that fails to serve the preventive purpose of an air accident investigation. ""On August 8, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi had refused to entertain a petition seeking safety audit of every aircraft of Air India and rebuked the petitioner for seeking the audit of only one airline and not all airlines.""It was a very unfortunate incident. But this is not the time to run down airlines. You must approach the DGCA and the central govt on the issue of safety and security of passengers. If they do not take any action, then we can step in,"" the Supreme Court bench had said.","The court told pil petitioner ngo 'safety matters foundation' that its demand to make public details of the flight data recorder could have serious consequences for relatives of the pilots.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended greetings to the nation on the occasion of Navratri , calling the festival a time of devotion, courage, patience and determination, on Monday.In a post on X, he wrote, “Heartfelt wishes to all for Navratri.

In a sweeping immigration update, the United Arab Emirates has temporarily halted the issuance of tourist and work visas for citizens of nine countries spanning Africa and Asia. Though no official confirmation has been publicly released, an internal immigration circular signals a significant policy shift — one with far-reaching economic, diplomatic, and humanitarian consequences. The 2026 UAE visa ban reflects evolving concerns over security, health, and migration governance.According to a confidential immigration circular accessed by multiple outlets, the UAE has imposed a temporary suspension on new visa applications from the following countries:Citizens of these nine nations are barred from applying for both tourist visas and work permits in the UAE as of 2026. The policy remains in effect until further notice, with no announced timeline for reassessment or reversal.It's important to emphasize that this is a visa ban, not a travel ban. Nationals of the listed countries who already hold valid UAE visas are not affected and can continue residing or working in the UAE legally.While the UAE government has not released an official explanation, sources and analysts have pointed to several contributing factors behind this decision:The most cited rationale in unofficial reports is national security. The UAE has previously enacted similar measures in response to concerns about:The suspension is described by insiders as a preventive measure to shield the country from potential risks associated with fraudulent or unverified entries.Tense or complex bilateral relations between the UAE and some of the affected nations may also be influencing the visa policy. Past instances suggest that immigration policies are sometimes used to manage or reflect broader diplomatic positions.Residual COVID-19 protocols appear to remain part of the UAE’s visa review process. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in cross-border health management. Analysts point to concerns over:These health considerations may continue to shape immigration policy well into the post-pandemic era.The visa freeze also aligns with efforts to streamline documentation, improve identity verification, and digitize the visa process. The UAE is reportedly working to overhaul its immigration systems to reduce paperwork inconsistencies and identity fraud.The UAE’s visa ban has triggered a chain reaction across multiple sectors:Though indefinite, the UAE visa ban is not permanent. Once lifted, nationals from the listed countries will regain access to the UAE visa application process via:The standard visa requirements will then apply, including:Authorities and businesses across affected countries are awaiting further clarification from the UAE.

Major airports in Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway, faced flight disruptions on Monday and early Tuesday after multiple drones were spotted near the airspace, forcing temporary closures and diverting dozens of flights.Copenhagen Airport was closed around 8:30 pm local time after two to three “unidentified” drones were observed in the area, an airport spokesperson said. “No aircraft can take off or land at the airport, and as a result, several flights are being diverted to other airports. The police are investigating the matter, and we currently have no timeline for reopening,” airport spokeswoman Lise Agerley Kurstein told AFP.As of late Monday night, aviation tracking website Flightradar24 reported more than 50 flights diverted. Some incoming flights were rerouted to other airports in Denmark, while others were sent to Gothenburg and Malmö in Sweden. The airport reopened around 12:20 am local time (6:20 pm ET) but delays and cancellations continued into Tuesday.Copenhagen police duty officer Anette Ostenfeldt told AFP that “three or four big drones” were still flying over the airport.“They are still flying back and forth, coming and going,” she said, adding, “But they are bigger than what you as a private individual can buy.”In Oslo, the airspace over the airport was temporarily closed Tuesday morning following another drone sighting. “This means that incoming flights are now being redirected to the nearest airport,” Communication Manager Monica Iren Fasting told CNN. Police said two foreign nationals were arrested for flying drones over a restricted area near Akershus Fortress, although there was no indication the incident was linked to Copenhagen.European authorities have been on high alert after Russian drones violated Polish and Romanian airspace earlier this month, prompting Nato allies to strengthen eastern defenses. There is currently no evidence that Monday’s drone activity in Denmark or Norway is connected to those incidents.The disruption comes after a weekend of travel issues at major European airports, including a cyberattack affecting check-in systems. Drone sightings have previously caused major chaos in Europe, such as at Gatwick Airport near London in 2018, where repeated drone activity stranded tens of thousands of passengers and disrupted hundreds of flights.","Copenhagen airport was closed around 8:30 pm local time after two to three “unidentified” drones were observed in the area.

This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition. Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday’s proclamation. This applies only to new visas, not renewals, and not current visa holders.





H-1B visa fee hike news: The recently announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee will apply only to new visa applications and is not an annual charge, the White House press secretary clarified on Saturday. The announcement comes after widespread confusion and concern over the implications of a presidential proclamation signed Friday by US President Donald Trump The proclamation, titled “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,” introduced a major overhaul of the H-1B visa program, significantly increasing the fee from the current $2,000–5,000 range to $100,000. The move sparked fears among immigration attorneys, Indian IT professionals, and companies that holders outside the US might face urgent deadlines to return, and raised questions about potential disruption to the country’s tech talent pipeline.In response, the White House press secretary clarified the following points:This comes amid reports that companies asked employees on visit to India to rush back to avoid the fees.Amid the chaos, a senior US administration official told ANI also, “Those visiting or leaving the country, or traveling to India, do not need to rush back before Sunday or pay the $100,000 fee,"" echoing similar statement to Levitt's adding, ""It is applicable only for new visa applications.”Industry representatives in both India and the US have highlighted that H-1B talent mobility is crucial for innovation, economic growth, and technological development. The White House said policymakers will continue to assess the steps, taking into account mutual benefits, including strong people-to-people ties between the two countries.","The $100,000 h-1b visa fee will apply only to new visa applications and is not an annual charge, the white house press secretary clarified.
