Dwayne Johnson moved to tears after powerful reception at Venice Film Festival



Poll Which aspect of Dwayne Johnson's transformation for the role do you find most impressive? His physical transformation His emotional depth

Benny Safdie and Emily Blunt share an emotional moment with Dwayne Johnson



Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson experienced one of the most emotional nights of his career when his latest film, The Smashing Machine, premiered at the Venice International Film Festival. The 53-year-old actor, portraying UFC legend Mark Kerr, was overcome with tears as the audience delivered a thunderous 15-minute standing ovation, among the longest of this year’s festival.Footage from inside the theater showed Dwayne Johnson wiping his eyes while applauding back at the cheering crowd. Standing beside him were his co-star Emily Blunt , director Benny Safdie , and Kerr himself, each visibly shaken by the extended applause. Variety’s co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh, who shared the moment on X, remarked, “Dwayne Johnson weeps during the 15-minute #Venezia2025 standing ovation for ‘The Smashing Machine.’ This was the most emotion we’ve since on the Lido since Brendan Fraser launched his Oscar campaign here four years ago for ‘The Whale.’”The comparison to Fraser’s Venice triumph quickly sparked speculation about Johnson’s awards season prospects.Fraser went on to win an Academy Award for The Whale, and Johnson’s raw, vulnerable turn as Kerr is already drawing early buzz.Johnson himself acknowledged how transformative the project has been. At a press conference earlier that day, he admitted, “I looked around a few years ago and I started to think, you know, am I living my dream or am I living other people’s dreams? I've been scared to go deep and intense and raw until now, until I had this opportunity.”Safdie, making his solo directorial debut after acclaimed collaborations like Uncut Gems, also broke down during the ovation, clutching Johnson and Blunt as tears streamed down his face. Blunt, who plays Kerr’s now-ex-wife Dawn Staples, stood hand-in-hand with Johnson as the real Mark Kerr wiped his own eyes from the audience.The moment showed how personal the film is for everyone involved. Johnson underwent a dramatic physical transformation to embody Kerr, stepping away from his signature blockbuster action persona. Fans even noticed his lean frame on the red carpet.Also Read: John Cena turns heads as he carries wife Shay Shariatzadeh over puddle during sweet public moment Distributed by A24, The Smashing Machine releases in theaters on October 3. If the reaction in Venice is any indication, Johnson may have delivered the most defining performance of his career.

Trump & Pakistan business







NEW DELHI: Former US National Security Advisor (NSA) and attorney Jake Sullivan has accused President Donald Trump of sacrificing Washington’s ties with India to further his family’s business interests in Pakistan In an interview with MeidasTouch YouTube channel, Sullivan described the development as “a huge strategic harm” to the United States itself.He was asked about America’s trade row with India and Trump’s repeated claims about resolving the India-Pakistan conflict, which resurfaced after the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir.“I think this is one of the more under-reported stories in Trump's foreign policy, and I'm really glad that you raised it,” Sullivan said in response to the host’s question, which also mentioned the Trump family’s Bitcoin business with Pakistan and Tim Cook’s Apple factories in India.The former NSA stressed that the US has for decades worked on a bipartisan basis to strengthen ties with India, “the world's largest democracy,” and a country it should be “aligned with on technology, talent, economics, and so many other issues, and aligned with in dealing with the strategic threat from China.”Sullivan noted that Washington had made significant progress in developing these ties. “And now, in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, he has thrown the India relationship over the side.That is a huge strategic harm in its own right because a strong US-India relationship serves our interests,” he added.He warned that such moves would worry US allies worldwide. “But imagine every other country in the world, your Germany, your Japan, your Canada. You look at that and you say that could be us tomorrow. And that only reinforces your view that you got to hedge against the United States,” Sullivan said.According to him, America’s credibility was at stake. “And having all of our friends and countries around the world decide they just can't rely on the US in any way, shape or form. That is not in the interest of the American people long term. Our word should be our bond. We should be good for what we say. Our friends should be able to rely on us. And that has always been our strength. And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.”During the conversation, Sullivan was reminded of Trump’s earlier claims about being “best friends with Modi” and promising that the first deal he would sign would be with India. The host said Trump then began “taking credit for resolving the India Pakistan war which is a very big sensitive topic for India saying you did not do that stop taking he does that every day and that like you know hurts their hurts everything there and it like crushes them that's not they go that's not true. ”The host further alleged, “Donald Trump took like his family took Bitcoin from the Pakistani Bitcoin sovereign fund and they brought in the general from the Pakistan to be there and India's like what the hell are you. And then meanwhile, you still have Apple building new factories because Tim Cook came in with the gold bar and he's building the factories in India. What do you make of what's happening there?”Sullivan reiterated, “I think this is one of the more under reported stories in Trump's foreign policy and I'm really glad that you raised it on a bipartisan basis going back decades. The United States has worked to build its relationship with India, the world's largest democracy, a country that we should be aligned with on technology and talent and economics and so many other issues and aligned with in dealing with this strategic threat from China. And we had come a long way on that. And now in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, Trump has thrown the India relationship over the side. That is a huge strategic harm in its own right because a strong US India relationship serves our interests. But imagine every other country in the world, your Germany, your Japan, your Canada. You look at that and you say that could be us tomorrow. And that only reinforces your view that you got to hedge against the United States.

And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.”Before concluding, Sullivan remarked, “It's a big world, so there's a lot more to say. I'll have to come back at some point in the future and, you know, hit the next 10 topics that we didn't get to today.” The host thanked him, saying, “Jake Sullivan, former national security adviser. Thank you as always.”The controversy comes amid Trump’s increasing business engagements with Pakistan. In April, the World Liberty (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by Trump, signed agreements with the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to promote investment and blockchain innovation. Trump and his affiliates reportedly hold a 60 per cent stake in WLF, launched in 2024.A US delegation at the signing included WLF co-chairman and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff’s son, Zachary Witkoff.In June, the Pakistan army stated that Field Marshal Asim Munir and Trump had discussed trade, economic development, and cryptocurrency during a White House meeting. “President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,” the army said.A month later, Trump announced a trade agreement with Pakistan while threatening 25 per cent tariffs on Indian goods. “We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,” Trump posted on Truth Social.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the agreement, calling it “historic” and expressing hope it would expand cooperation between Islamabad and Washington.",Former nsa jake sullivan accuses president donald trump of sacrificing washington’s ties with india to further his family's business interests in pakistan.

Trump’s New Message To India As Modi Hails ‘Privileged’ Ties With Putin; ‘It’s Getting Late’

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday strongly criticised US counterpart Donald Trump for using tariffs as a bargaining tool with China and India in the current geopolitical landscape.Putin said both Beijing and New Delhi have their ""own domestic political mechanism and laws"" and noted that the two nations have endured difficult periods in their history, marked by colonialism and repeated attacks on sovereignty.""When somebody [Donald Trump] tells you that they are going to punish you...you have to think about the leadership of those big countries,"" Putin said.""You have countries like India with 1.5 billion people, and China, both with powerful economies. They also have their own domestic political mechanism and laws. When somebody tells you that they are going to punish you...you have to think about the leadership of those big countries, which had a difficult period of their history too...that had to deal with colonialism, attacks on their sovereignty during prolonged periods of time,"" the Russian President said at a press briefing.He futher said: ""You have to understand that if one of them shows weakness, his political career will be over, which influences his behaviour"".Putin, however, expressed hope that everything will ultimately be sorted out for the normal political dialogue to begin.""Just as the colonial era is over, they have to realise that they [the US] cannot use this term when speaking with partners. But ultimately, things will be sorted out, and we will have normal political dialogue again,"" he said.Last week, on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in China's Tianjin, leaders from India, China, and Russia projected an image of warmth and strategic convergence that rattled Washington.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Russia a ""special and privileged partner"".Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that “the world’s two most populous countries need to be friends.” And Russian President Vladimir Putin clasped PM Modi’s hand, addressed him as “dear friend,” and whisked him away in his armoured Aurus limousine.The optics told a story of deepening chemistry: Xi and PM Modi smiling together after years of tension, PM Modi leaning into Moscow even as Trump slapped tariffs on Indian goods, and Putin positioning himself as the indispensable broker of this triangular courtship.The move was subtle but seismic. While Trump met Putin in Alaska on August 15 to persuade him to drift from China's orbit, Beijing welcomed PM Modi just two weeks later. On August 30, Modi was in Beijing. The next day, he stood smiling next to Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the SCO summit in Tianjin - a public relations coup for Beijing and Moscow.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a pointed remark seen as a veiled dig at Trump, said: ""India had achieved a 7.8 per cent GDP growth despite ""challenges created by economic selfishness"".Earlier, in support of India, Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong wrote: ""Give the bully an inch, he will take a mile"".Feihong said this a day after Trump slapped an additional 25 per cent tariff on India for its trade with Russia.The remark was seen by some as expressing solidarity with countries like India and Brazil, at the receiving end of Trump's trade war.Xu's post also tagged Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi's remarks, after his talks with the Brazilian president's chief advisor Celso Amorim, that using tariffs as a weapon to suppress other countries violates the UN Charter, undermines WTO rules and is both unpopular and unsustainable.","Vladimir putin criticises us counterpart donald trump for using tariffs as a bargaining tool with china and india in the current geopolitical landscape.

Jaishankar Urges Stronger India-EU Ties As Trump’s Tariffs Shake Global Strategic Landscape

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said predictability has a huge premium in global politics, a remark made as India looks to readjust its relations with China while manoeuvring through US tariffs.The foreign minister also said the world is witnessing sweeping changes in the global strategic landscape. ""Changes we see in the world today do influence our policy and do influence the manner we approach other countries,"" he said.Speaking at a press briefing with German counterpart Johann Wadephul, Jaishankar further said: ""We are seeing sweeping changes in the global strategic landscape. We are also seeing volatility on the global economic landscape, and together they make a very powerful case for India and the European Union (EU) and Germany to work more closely with each other.""Jaishankar's remark could also be implied as a jibe at US President Donald Trump, who recently described India's economy as ""dead"" and has upended the global economy with his numerous contradictory tariff diktats.Wadephul said the only demand the Western nations have with regard to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is that ""weapons fall silent"". He said that Russia has ""not been willing"" to sit down at the negotiating table despite ""enormous efforts"" by Trump.""We have right from the outset been pursuing a policy that has the objective of Russia and Ukraine following the path of negotiations. However, what we have noticed of late is that despite the enormous efforts that the American president has invested, Russia has not been willing to sit down at the negotiating table, whereas the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has expressed his immediate readiness to negotiate and sit down at the negotiation table,"" the German foreign minister said.He further said that Ukraine has been attacked ""without having done anything"" to trigger the Russian attack, while choosing to skip Moscow's apprehension of Kyiv joining the US-led Nato alliance, which is argued as a key reason Russian President Putin decided to invade Ukraine.""In a way, it has taken a first step. We're talking about a country that has been attacked without having done anything to trigger that attack. The only demand is that weapons fall silent. No more than that... The German approach and the European approach are that we want to do whatever we can to make President Putin sit down at the negotiating table,"" Wadephul said.On Friday, Jaishankar said India should not be ""unfairly targeted"" in the context of the Ukraine war, as New Delhi continues to face pressure over its oil trade with Russia.""Had a telecon today with Finnish Foreign Minister,"" Jaishankar posted on X. ""Our discussions centered around the Ukraine conflict and its ramifications. India should not be unfairly targeted in that context. We have always advocated dialogue and diplomacy.""The remarks come as India is facing 50 per cent tariffs from the United States for purchasing Russian oil. The US administration has accused New Delhi of ""funding the war"" by continuing trade with Moscow.India has strongly criticised Washington’s decision, calling the tariffs ""unjustified and unreasonable"". The Trump administration recently raised duties on Indian goods to over 50 per cent as a penalty for India’s oil imports from Russia.Last week in Moscow, Jaishankar defended India’s position during a joint press briefing with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. He questioned the rationale behind Washington’s move.","Jaishankar's remark could also be implied as a jibe at us president donald trump, who recently described india's economy as ""dead"" the remarks come as india is facing 50 per cent tariffs from the united states for purchasing russian oil.

He also said EU doesn’t want Russia to use “detours” for its oil. The US accuses India of profiteering from its export of refined Russian oil to Europe and other places. In Europe,countries like Germany and France are pushing for secondary sanctions that would target entities in third countries they see as backing Russia’s war.Jaishankar said in a joint press conference the world’s facing the twin challenges of economic volatility and political uncertainty India believes that a multi-polar world with strategic autonomy can best respond through more intensive cooperation among key member states.“There’s no question that the changes we see in the world today do influence our policies and do influence the manner in which we approach other countries. And I think together they make a very powerful case for India and the EU and India and Germany to work much more closely with each other,” he said. Backing Germany’s desire to double its Euro 50 billion trade with India, Jaishankar said India would pay special attention to any concerns German companiesmight have about operating in India.There was also discussion on the Indo-Pacific as Wadephulstressed India and Germany are united by the objective to preserve the rules-based international order and China’s aggressive behavior in the Indo-Pacific was a cause for concern for both our countries. “More generally, we aim to further expand our cooperation in the areas of defense, security and armaments,” he said, adding Germany agrees with India and others that there’s a need to defend the rules-based order from China.Jaishankar also thanked Wadephul for the understanding shown by Germany on India’s fight against terrorism. “Minister Wadephul has himself been explicit about our right to defend our people against terrorist attacks. Our Parliamentary delegation that visited Germany in June after Operation Sindoor was also warmly received,” he said.Jaishankar said he raised the issue of Ariha Shah, an Indian child who has been in foster care of German authorities for years, saying it is essential that her cultural rights are ensuredand she grows up in Indian surroundings. “So. this matter needs to be resolved without further delay, and I think we have had some discussions today on that subject,” he said.",The leaders discussed the ukraine conflict as wadephul urged india to convince russia to join peace efforts.

Sadhguru Reveals Its Mystical Power

Sadhguru on Saturday completed the Kailash Yatra on his motorcycle and returned to a grand reception at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, just 18 months after undergoing two emergency brain surgeries.He was welcomed at the Coimbatore Airport, with locals, villagers and volunteers lining the route to the ashram in a devotional procession.Speaking to journalists at Coimbatore Airport, Sadhguru noted, “As per medical advice, I was not supposed to ride a motorcycle, yet I went to 18,000 feet above mean sea level. This demonstrates the power of yoga.”Describing how yoga helped him in the journey, he said, “Yoga means you become one with the very source of creation, which is within every one of us. So when you are in touch with the source of creation, this is not a challenge. Effortlessly, I have done this at this stage.”Sadhguru began his yatra on a motorcycle, from Gorakhpur on August 9, travelling through Nepal and Tibet amid rain, landslides, rough terrain and altitudes of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. His route took him through Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Thulikhel in Nepal, before crossing into Tibet via Zhangmu, Nyalam and Saga.After reaching Lake Manasarovar, he trekked to Mount Kailash.Ahead of the journey, in an interaction with actor Dino Morea he had said, “I am not going to see Shiva. For me, the dimension we refer to as Shiva—when I close my eyes, that is where I am. I don’t have to go to Kailash for that. Kailash is the most spectacular library, but these days I am not going even for that.”He further added, “I'm taking a few hundred people with me. People when they wake up in the morning, do they say Shiva? No, they'll say stock market or cinema. So for those people with altitude and variety of other challenges, it lowers their concerns about stock market and we can get them to focus on something more profound.”Talking about the tariffs that the US has imposed on India, he said, “When challenges are thrown at us, it's for us to stand up sharper and stronger, which I think India will do for sure. Maintaining India's sovereignty, its freedom to do its business the way it wants to do, is something that we cannot give up as a free nation.”“Even when things are against you, you must thrive. That is the capacity we need to build. And this is a good example, this is a good lesson for us. To make sure that India thrives no matter what kind of conditions,” he furher added.","Sadhguru completed the kailash yatra on his motorcycle on saturday.

Alleged secret payments to Kawhi Leonard put Los Angeles Clippers under scrutiny

Exploring the Joe Smith scandal and its impact on the Minnesota Timberwolves

If the recent accusations against the Los Angeles Clippers are accurate, then they are going to be in a lot of trouble. According to the shocking information released on Wednesday by investigative journalist Pablo Torre, the franchise has allegedly been participating in a shell corporation plan that has been paying their star player, Kawhi Leonard, under the table and below the salary cap for years. They got him to sign a $28 million endorsement contract for a ""no-show job"" with a fake tree-planting business that team owner Steve Ballmer was allegedly funding. Now, this incident brings back memories from the Minnesota Timberwolves’ Joe Smith trade.It all started with Aspiration Partners, a technology and sustainable growth firm that arranged carbon emission credits for major corporations such as Microsoft and Meta. Aspiration was compelled to divulge its outstanding debt in their bankruptcy filings, including a $7 million payment to ""KL2 Aspire LLC,"" a company whose manager is identified as Kawhi Leonard At this point, Torre started looking into the payments and posing inquiries about the business. He got documents of the agreement between Aspiration Partners and Kawhi Leonard. The documents specified that Aspiration allegedly paid Leonard a total of $28 million, planned in four annual payments of $7 million.To persuade Kawhi Leonard to come to Los Angeles, they exchanged most of their draft capital. It is not until 2030 that the team fully owns their first-round pick. Additionally, the LA superstar was getting $28 million from a business that Clippers owner Steve Ballmer supported for doing nothing. It seems like a way to increase Kawhi's compensation without having to deal with NBA salary cap restrictions.After this mess is cleaned up, the Clippers will probably suffer a similar fate to the Minnesota Timberwolves, as they have had similar luck. If the Clippers are found guilty of what Torre alleges, the league will probably punish them harshly, just as it did Minnesota.In 1999-00, Joe Smith played for the Minnesota Timberwolves . In order to have wage cap flexibility, the organization paid him underhandedly for the three veteran minimum deals he signed, each worth less than $3 million.After everything came to light, the Wolves received a severe penalty from the NBA. The Wolves were forced to pay a $3.5 million fine, forfeit five first-round draft picks for the following five years, and have their owner and general manager suspended. This was for signing Smith to three short-term contracts before agreeing to give him a huge payout after securing his Bird Rights.In an attempt to build around Kevin Garnett , Minnesota violated the regulations. With KG in the forefront, the Wolves never lived up to their full potential. They were ousted in the first round seven times, but they made the playoffs eight times in a row. Prior to Anthony Edwards' arrival, Minnesota qualified only once in 17 seasons and missed the playoffs for 13 consecutive years beginning in 2005.Also read: ""I was super excited""- Terance Mann embraces new chapter with Brooklyn Nets after Los Angeles Clippers stints","Alleged secret payments to kawhi leonard put los angeles clippers under scrutiny.

Final days and $6,000 ketamine deal





Jasveen Sangha, the dealer dubbed the “Ketamine Queen,” pleaded guilty Wednesday to supplying the ketamine that killed Friends star Matthew Perry.The 42-year-old US and UK citizen admitted to multiple federal charges that could carry a prison sentence of up to 65 years. Sangha pleaded guilty to one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of ketamine distribution, and one count of distribution resulting in death.Prosecutors agreed to drop additional charges, including methamphetamine distribution unrelated to Perry’s case. Sentencing will be scheduled later, with prosecutors noting they will seek less than the maximum penalty.The plea marks the conclusion of a yearlong investigation announced after Perry’s Oct. 28, 2023 death. Sangha is the fifth and final defendant in the case to plead guilty, joining Dr Salvador Plasencia, Dr Mark Chavez, Perry’s assistant Kenneth Iwamasa, and friend Erik Fleming.Perry, 54, was found unresponsive in his Los Angeles home by Iwamasa. The medical examiner ruled ketamine the primary cause of death. Perry had been receiving ketamine legally through his doctor as an off-label treatment for depression but sought additional supplies.According to prosecutors, Perry paid Sangha $6,000 in cash for 25 vials of ketamine just four days before his death. Fleming had connected Perry with Sangha, calling her drugs “amazing” and saying she only dealt “with high end and celebs.” On the day Perry died, Sangha urged Fleming to delete their messages.Federal prosecutors described Sangha as a prolific supplier with wealthy and celebrity clients. On social media, she flaunted a lavish lifestyle, sharing photos from luxury destinations alongside influential figures.Sangha and Plasencia were the primary targets of the probe, with the other co-defendants providing testimony that helped build the case against them. None of the defendants have been sentenced.Perry’s long struggle with addiction dated back to his years on Friends, where he became a household name as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004, cementing his place as one of television’s most beloved actors.","Jasveen sangha is the fifth and final defendant in the case to plead guilty.
