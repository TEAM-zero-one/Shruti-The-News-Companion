NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar Wednesday utilised the India International Conference on Democracy and Election Management (IICDEM) 2026 - which got underway in Delhi with the participation of delegates from 70 nations - as a forum to showcase the successful conduct of special intensive revision (SIR) in Bihar, citing the zero appeals received after publication of the final electoral roll and the subsequent assembly election that witnessed no repolls.""Pure electoral roll, including each and every eligible elector as per law, is essential to strengthen democracy and all elections which will be held on the basis of that electoral roll. The second segment is conduct of polls, which becomes a very challenging, logistical affair, because a large number of people have to obey and follow the electoral laws and the instructions issued by EC,"" Kumar said while highlighting how Bihar election had delivered on both the fronts.Stating that the purpose of IICDEM 2026 is to not only celebrate democracy but also understand the future path, challenges, the expectations of electors and how to make the electoral process smoother and more transparent, free and fair, the CEC explained to the foreign delegates, who included top representatives of 42 electoral management bodies and 27 ambassadors/high commissioners, how Indian elections have become one of the largest exercises on the planet in terms of logistics, numbers and transparency needs.""More than a billion voters, (with) 640 million exercising their franchise at more than a million polling stations....and roughly 2 crore people involved in the exercise is a feat,"" Kumar underlined.Election commissioner S S Sandhu described the faith placed by citizens in electoral management bodies (EMBs) as precious, saying that it is the collective responsibility of EMBs to preserve it.Election commissioner Vivek Joshi said IICDEM-2026 brings together EMBs, researchers, students and practitioners, who view elections from different angles, to brainstorm on all issues relating to democracy & electoral management.Earlier, secretary general of International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA) Kevin Casas-Zamora welcomed India's chairship of International IDEA, saying that India must share with the world how it has dealt with challenges to build a legacy of ""free and fair elections, respect for the rule of law, tolerance, secularism, press freedom and all the things that constitute a democracy"".Recalling how recent elections across many countries had witnessed political polarisation, illicit funding flows, online and offline aggression and digital misinformation, Casas-Zamora also raised concerns over outright election denialism, with politicians from the US, Peru, Georgia and Bangladesh ""using spurious arguments to question credible results"". He said that 2024 saw 1.6 billion people casting ballots in 74 national elections, including India. ""Yet, global electoral turnout that year was down nearly 10 percentage points compared to 15 years before, while around 40% of elections suffered some form of dispute over their credibility,"" he pointed out.At the same time, he said, elections had helped reverse democratic backsliding in Poland, Senegal, Guatemala and Brazil. ""Democracy can be restored as long as electoral routes for political change remain open,"" he emphasised.Speaking on the theme of IICDEM-2026 - democracy for an inclusive, peaceful, resilient and sustainable world - DG IIIDEM Rakesh Verma said that it reflects a broad and multi-dimensional understanding of what democracy must deliver in the 21st century.","Democracy took roots in india in 600 bc, long before the world: cec gyanesh kumar.

NEW DELHI: India and Spain condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and emphasised the need for strengthening international cooperation to combat terrorism, as external affairs minister S Jaishankar hosted his Spanish counterpart José Manuel Albares for a bilateral meeting on Wednesday.For the second time this week, Jaishankar told a visiting European foreign minister the world must display zero tolerance towards terrorism. Jaishankar had conveyed the same message to Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski who visited India this week, albeit more bluntly because of Poland’s recent courting of Pakistan.“The world order is clearly undergoing a profound change. It is more imperative than ever before for nations to collaborate on shared challenges. This is particularly the case with respect to combating terrorism where both India and Spain have been victims. The world must display zero tolerance towards terrorism,” said Jaishankar in his opening remarks in the meeting with Albares.According to the MEA, the ministers reviewed the entire gamut of India-Spain relationship, including trade and investment, defence and security, culture, tourism and people-to-people ties. “The ministers discussed recent developments in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, and exchanged views on other issues of shared interest,” said the govt, as Albares handed over to Jaishankar a declaration of Spain’s accession to India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.

Stock market today: Indian equity benchmarks, Nifty50 and Sensex, closed lower on Wednesday as investors booked profits amid weak global cues and cautious sentiment ahead of key macro triggers.

Donald Trump Cites India Pakistan Ceasefire While Defending Nobel Gesture But Facts Raise Questions

Also read |

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday stepped up its attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi after US President Donald Trump once again claimed that he was responsible for ending the India-Pakistan conflict last year. The opposition party said the count of such assertions has now risen to 70.The swipe came after Trump highlighted ending the India-Pakistan conflict as one of the major accomplishments of the first year of his second term in the White House. He claimed the two countries “were going to go nuclear” and said millions of lives were saved because of his intervention. The US president said he ended “eight unendable wars in 10 months”.Reacting to Trump’s remarks, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X, “Before yesterday the count stood at 68. Yesterday itself the count shot up not to 69 but to 70 - once in the opening statement of his White House Press Conference and later in the Q&A.”“That is the number of times the PM's ‘good friend’ and the recipient of his many forced hugs has declared that he was responsible for the sudden and unexpected halt of Operation Sindoor on May 10, 2025,” Ramesh said.At a press conference in Washington, Trump said, “These were unendable wars - Cambodia and Thailand fighting for years, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda. Pakistan and India, they were really going at it. Eight planes shot down. They were going to go nuclear in my opinion.”Addressing a packed White House press briefing room, Trump said “the prime minister of Pakistan, who visited him in Washington last year, said that ‘President Trump saved 10 million people, and maybe much more than that’. They’re both nuclear countries.”Later in the 105-minute press conference, Trump again claimed credit for ending the war between India and Pakistan.Responding to a question on how winning the Nobel Peace Prize would have improved the lives of everyday Americans, Trump said he had saved probably tens of millions of lives by ending eight wars across the world.“If you add up the numbers, just if you look at any one of those wars, you're talking about millions of people. You multiply it eight times. But when you look at India and Pakistan, that could have been 10,15,20 million people. It could have been more than that. So I saved millions of people. So that to me is the big thing,” Trump said.Trump has repeatedly claimed that he stopped the conflict between India and Pakistan, making the assertion on various platforms in the US and around the world since May 10 last year, when he announced on social media that the two countries had agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire after talks mediated by Washington.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Trump also said that he should have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for ending wars, including conflicts between Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.",Congress steps up attack on prime minister narendra modi.

NEW DELHI: “When I reached International Space Station for the first time, the first thing I did was to locate India (on Earth), from where my father belonged to, and Slovenia, from where my mother belonged,” said Indian American astronaut Sunita Williams in Delhi on Tuesday — the only female astronaut who has set the world record for most cumulative spacewalking time by a woman with a total of 62 hours and 6 minutes. During her lifetime, Williams went to space three times as a Nasa astronaut, totalling 608 days in space.Williams’s father, Deepak Pandya, is from Jhulasan village in Gujarat’s Mehsana district, where he was born before migrating to the US. Her mother, Ursuline Bonnie Pandya, is of Slovenian-American descent. Nicknamed ‘Suni’ or ‘Soncka’ in Slovenia, Williams was born in the US state of Ohio and has an elder brother, Jay Thomas, and a sister, Dina Ann.“Though I spent nine months in space during my latest trip to the ISS, I missed meeting Group Captain Subhanshu Shukla who reached the station just after I left,” Williams said during an interactive session, 'Eyes on the Stars, Feet on the Ground' at American Center here.During her last trip to space before hanging her astronaut suit, Williams went to ISS in 2024 for a scheduled 8-day space trip but had to spend 9 months on ISS as the Boeing Starliner that took her to ISS malfunctioned and had to return empty-handed.Later, SpaceX's Dragon brought Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore back to Earth on March 18, 2025, with the duo ending up spending 286 days in space. India’s Group Capt Shukla went to space as part of the Axiom mission on June 25, 2025.Williams faced several health issues after returning to Earth after remaining in zero gravity for a long time. However, the 60-year-old was seen in high spirits in Delhi on Tuesday, guiding and inspiring Indian students to join the space sector. To cheer her at the Delhi event was the mother of another Indian-American astronaut, Kalpana Chawla, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia crash in 2003. Williams, wearing a trademark deep blue space overalls and sporting a pair of space-themed canvas shoes, stepped off the dais and reached out to Chawla’s mother, Sanyogita Chawla, 90, who was sitting in the front row, and gave her a warm hug.When asked about the renewed global interest in the Moon, Williams acknowledged the existence of a modern “space race”. “I think there is a space race going on. We want to get back to the moon sustainably and start the conversation about rules of engagement— how we actually work together with other countries. We want to do this in a productive, democratic way, much like Antarctica,” she said.Williams asserted that the horizon of space exploration is rapidly expanding beyond traditional boundaries, stating that the commercialisation of space is creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation. “Commercialisation of space is great. It means there are opportunities for people to work in so many different companies— not only rockets and spacecraft, but parts of space, experiments, satellites, and 3D printing of metals,” she said.“In my childhood, I never dreamt of becoming an astronaut. We used to watch Star Trek on black & white TV. After I did my schooling and graduated, my brother pushed me to join the military and, thereafter, I became a Navy officer,” she said. Williams had logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 types of aircraft during her career in the US Navy before donning the astronaut suit. While flying aircraft as a Navy commander, I then wished that I should go to the Moon. From then on, I pursued the career of an astronaut,” Williams recalled.“When I reached the ISS, I was craving for Indian food. I was delighted to see that somebody sent me an Indian dish (in the food cargo) though others were making faces. I was glad to also receive 3D printed models of my dogs on ISS.” In Nasa circles, Williams was called the ‘samosa astronaut’, as she liked carrying samosas to space.An athlete since childhood, Williams wanted to participate in a marathon. “So, my sister told me, ‘I will run on your behalf on the ground and you run in space. So that is how I decided to run a marathon in space,” she revealed. Williams ran the Boston Marathon in space in 2007 after qualifying by running the Houston Marathon in 2006, marking the first time a marathon was completed in orbit. She ran on a treadmill aboard the ISS, finishing in 4 hours and 24 minutes while her sister and others ran on Earth.Recalling her most difficult space job, Williams said she went for a spacewalk after the Starliner faced a technical issue and returned to Earth and the Dragon spacecraft was docking at ISS. “While I was replacing a defected reflector, I had ensured that the Dragon capsule was not damaged with my steel helmet. So, I did the job of replacing the reflector by bending my head on one side for over 1.5 hours. After I returned to my space cabin, I faced neck cramps the whole time. ”Williams, during her extended 9-month stay on ISS, conducted along with her crew over 150 scientific experiments and technological demonstrations, accumulating more than 900 hours of research across various fields like space gardening, microgravity biology, and water recovery systems.The Nasa astronaut said the perception about life on Earth changes when people go to space. “I am married and I argue with my husband like other couples do. But after reaching space (seeing the vast expanse of universe), I used to wonder why we argue (on minor issues) at all,” she said, adding, “The first thing I ate after returning to Earth was the bread my husband baked for me.”","Indian-origin nasa astronaut sunita williams says her first act in space was to spot india, home of her father. During her lifetime, williams went to space three times as a nasa astronaut, totalling 608 days in space. Williams had logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 types of aircraft during her career.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126886365,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1125902,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” aimed at overseeing post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza. The initiative forms a key pillar of Trump’s broader Gaza ceasefire plan and is now beginning to take shape, with the White House confirming the involvement of several global figures.In a letter, shared by US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, Trump framed the initiative as part of a sweeping 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” to end the Gaza conflict, first announced in September last year. He said the plan had since received wide backing from global leaders across the Arab world, Israel and Europe, and was formally endorsed by the United Nations Security Council through Resolution 2803 in November.Trump wrote that the moment had come to “turn dreams into reality”, with the centrepiece of the initiative being the creation of an international “Board of Peace”. The body, Trump said, would be established as a new international organisation and transitional governing administration, tasked with delivering what he called “lasting peace” through governance reform, reconstruction and economic investment.""Now it is time to turn all of these Dreams into reality. At the heart of the Plan is The Board of Peace, the most impressive and consequential Board ever assembled, which will be established as a new International Organization and Transitional Governing Administration,"" the letter read.The invitation places India among a growing list of countries and global figures being courted by Washington as Trump seeks to operationalise a 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” aimed at ending the Gaza conflict and managing the transition to long-term stability.According to the White House, the Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition. Chaired by Trump himself, it is expected to focus on governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment mobilisation and large-scale funding.Confirmed members include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special negotiator Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, billionaire financier Marc Rowan, World Bank president Ajay Banga and senior National Security Council aide Robert Gabriel. More appointments are expected in the coming weeks.Alongside the main board, two additional structures have been announced. The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), led by Palestinian technocrat Dr Ali Sha’ath, will oversee the restoration of public services, rebuilding of civil institutions and stabilisation of daily life in Gaza. The White House has described this as a key step in implementing Phase Two of Trump’s plan.A separate Gaza Executive Board will support governance delivery on the ground and includes international diplomats and regional figures from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the UAE, as well as UN humanitarian coordinator Sigrid Kaag.Apart from India several countries including Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Albania and Cyprus have been invited. Pakistan has also been invited to join the Board of Peace. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the prime minister received the invitation, adding that Pakistan will continue supporting international efforts for peace and security in Gaza.As per a report by Bloomberg, a draft charter proposes of the Trump-led “Board of Peace,” allegedly requires nations to contribute $1 billion to secure long-term membership.

Silver prices surged to a record high on Monday, crossing the Rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time. Gold also rebounded sharply, recovering from last week’s losses.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures jumped Rs 13,553, or 4.71%, to a record Rs 3,01,315 per kg. Gold futures rose nearly Rs 3,000, or over 2%, to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 1,45,500 per 10 grams.The rally in precious metals followed renewed geopolitical concerns after US President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on several European countries over Greenland.In response, the European Union is preparing retaliatory tariffs worth €93 billion, as reported by ET, citing a Financial Times report. The renewed tensions revived demand for safe-haven assets after easing US-Iran frictions last week had briefly reduced investor interest in gold and silver.Global prices also touched record levels. Spot gold rose 1.7% to $4,673 an ounce, while silver climbed around 3% to about $94 per troy ounce, marking fresh highs in international markets. Silver futures in the overseas market jumped more than 6% to a record $94.35 per ounce.Analysts said that silver has been outperforming gold in recent sessions, supported by strong industrial demand and favourable global trends. Some also pointed to currency movements as an additional factor. The dollar index rose for a third straight week, ending at 99.20, while the USD-INR January 28 futures contract closed higher at 90.8325 on the NSE.Gold, which does not offer interest income, typically benefits when interest rates are low. However, expectations that rate cuts may be delayed have raised the opportunity cost of holding the metal. Despite this, heightened geopolitical risks have continued to support prices.Market participants said precious metals could remain volatile in the near term, with prices driven by developments on the geopolitical front, currency movements and shifts in investor risk appetite.","Silver prices surged to a record high on monday, crossing the rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs, as intensifying geopolitical risks and shifting US monetary expectations fuelled strong safe-haven demand through the week. Escalating unrest in Iran, where over 500 people were reportedly killed, renewed US threats of military action and tariffs on countries trading with Iran, and the arrest of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro injected both short- and long-term uncertainty into global markets, supporting central bank buying and investor inflows into precious metals. With this President Trump has also levied tariffs on major EU nations with a threat to increase the same after June 1st if the deal to buy Greenland does not go through.Gold prices marked a low of around ₹141,000 and reversed sharply from there, as mentioned previously till prices are sustaining above ₹138,000 momentum for prices will remain on higher side. On lower end, immediate support remains at ₹143,000 and ₹140,000.Bollinger bands which were flat have expanded with prices on the higher side showcasing a positive run through expectations. This surge is more convincing as prices are rising along with a surge in volumes showing the buyers strength. The target of ₹145,000 is achieved, however any closing above the same could take the prices higher towards ₹148,000 and ₹152,000 from a medium to long term perspective.Despite a relatively firm dollar, Gold and Silver continued to mark record highs as geopolitical tensions, weak economic data, policy uncertainty, and easing inflation sustained safe-haven appeal. Focus this week will be on US inflation, GDP and speech from President Trump which could keep the volatility along with updates on uncertainties mentioned above.","Gold and silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs.

John Harbaugh's New York Giants era puts family and future in focus



John Harbaugh's New York Giants era has officially begun, and the first signs point to a cultural reset inside one of football’s most scrutinized franchises. The moment the deal became final on January 17, the Giants signaled that stability and experience now sit at the center of their long-term vision. After years of inconsistency, New York turned to a coach known for structure, accountability, and sustained relevance in the NFL.John Harbaugh arrives with context that matters. His exit from Baltimore followed an 8–9 finish in 2025, the Ravens’ first missed postseason since 2021. Injuries to Lamar Jackson shaped that outcome, but after 18 seasons, both sides understood change was inevitable. For the Giants, it was not about chasing trends. It was about leadership, credibility, and setting a tone that can last beyond one season.The hiring did more than reshape the Giants’ coaching staff. It pushed the Harbaugh family into a new spotlight. Fans quickly turned their attention to his inner circle, including his daughter Alison, a former Notre Dame lacrosse player who later continued her academic and athletic journey at the University of South Florida.Just as visible is Ingrid Harbaugh, whose steady presence has followed John through every chapter of his coaching life.Their story began years ago at Western Michigan. John was working as a graduate assistant under his father Jack, while Ingrid held a role in the baseball office as a student. What started on campus became a lifelong partnership that has now landed in New York. That connection felt front and center when the Giants shared a video of the couple together, welcoming them with the caption, ""Coach Harbaugh has arrived"".Beyond the emotion lies real football intrigue. John Harbaugh steps into a roster filled with young talent and unfinished promise. Jaxson Dart represents a quarterback project with upside. Malik Nabers, if healthy, gives the offense a dynamic edge. The appeal of this move rests in Harbaugh’s ability to develop players while demanding discipline from day one.Expectations will rise quickly. The NY Giants are not asking for miracles. They are asking for direction. With John Harbaugh, they finally believe they have it.",John harbaugh's new york giants era has officially begun.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday waived tariffs scheduled to hit European allies after claiming that he had reached a framework for a deal over Greenland.In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump said the tariffs that had been scheduled to take effect on February 1 would no longer go ahead.“Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region. This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America and all NATO nations,” Trump said.“Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1. Additional discussions are being held concerning the Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland. Further information will be made available as discussions progress. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and various others, as needed, will be responsible for the negotiations — they will report directly to me. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” he added.Trump, however, did not provide any details on the framework, but added that his threatened tariffs against European countries resisting his push to acquire Greenland were now off the table.Earlier, in a speech on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump for the first time ruled out using force but demanded “immediate negotiations” to acquire the island from Denmark.“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said.","Us president donald trump on wednesday waived tariffs scheduled to hit european allies after claiming that he had reached a framework for a deal over greenland.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday delivered a hard-hitting speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, taking aim at President Donald Trump’s approach to global politics while calling on ""middle powers"", including India, to unite as the existing world order weakens.Speaking at the forum, Carney warned that the US-led system which has underpinned global politics and trade for decades is no longer merely evolving but breaking apart. “We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,” he told an audience of political leaders, financiers and corporate executives, drawing a rare standing ovation.According to a government official who spoke to the New York Times on condition of anonymity, Carney wrote the speech himself—a notable departure from the usual practice, in which speeches of this scale are typically drafted by senior staff with input from the leader.During the speech, Carney who as worked as the governor of Canada and England's central banks, argued that the “rules-based international order” is fading, replaced by an era in which “the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must”, a direct nod to the growing use of tariffs, supply chains and financial systems as tools of coercion. “Call it what it is: a system of intensifying great power rivalry where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as coercion,” he said.Without naming Trump, the Canadian leader’s message landed amid rising tensions triggered by the US president’s threats to impose sweeping tariffs on allies and his renewed push to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark. Trump has also previously referred to Canada as the “51st state” and imposed tariffs that have hit key Canadian sectors such as steel, aluminium, autos and lumber.Carney cautioned against appeasement, warning that smaller and mid-sized nations can no longer assume that compliance will bring protection. “There is a strong tendency for countries to go along to get along… to hope that compliance will buy safety. It won’t,” he said. “The middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, we’re on the menu.”He acknowledged that Canada had benefited from American dominance in the past, crediting “American hegemony” with providing “open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security, and support for frameworks for resolving disputes”. But he said that bargain no longer works in a world where integration itself has become a vulnerability.Carney’s speech was also a rebuke to transactional diplomacy and one-on-one bargaining with major powers. “Great powers can afford for now to go it alone… Middle powers do not,” he said, warning that bilateral negotiations with hegemons often amount to “the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination”.Instead, he laid out a strategy of collective resilience, calling for “different coalitions for different issues based on common values and interests”. That approach, he said, would apply to defence, trade, critical minerals, technology and climate policy.India featured prominently in this vision. Carney confirmed that Canada is negotiating a free trade pact with India as part of a broader effort to diversify away from overwhelming dependence on the United States. He also cited negotiations with ASEAN countries, Mercosur, Thailand and the Philippines.""The past few days we've concluded new strategic partnerships with China and Qatar. We're negotiating free trade pacts with India, ASEAN, Thailand, Philippines and Mercosur. We're doing something else to help solve global problems. We're pursuing variable geometry, in other words, different coalitions for different issues based on common values and interests,"" the Canadian PM said.On security, Carney reaffirmed Canada’s support for Greenland and Denmark, declaring: “Canada stands firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully supports their unique right to determine Greenland’s future.” He added that Ottawa’s commitment to Nato’s Article Five was “unwavering”, even as Trump has threatened tariffs against European allies backing Denmark.","'the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must,' carney says. Canada is negotiating a free trade pact with india as part of a broader effort to diversify away from overwhelming dependence on the united states.
