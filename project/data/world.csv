'Dead-alive' narrative on 26/11 plotter left Pak exposed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dead-alive-narrative-on-26/11-plotter-left-pak-exposed/articleshow/121012828.cms,"NEW DELHI: Exploding hostilities with Pakistan has trained the spotlight once again on the audacious deception attempted by Islamabad to shield one of its serving army officers who was ""pronounced dead"" to deceive the world, but who had to be resurrected and put in prison when the global community discovered the fraud.Sajid Mir , a serving major who had been loaned to LeT - a common practice used by the ISI to groom young jihadis into fanatical terrorists - and played a key role in scripting the Mumbai 26/11 attack was declared dead to deflect the world's attention from India's charge of state-sponsored terrorism and to keep up the fiction that jihadi terrorism was the handiwork of ""non-state actors"".The deception went to the extent of Pakistan even staging a fake burial for him. However, when the charade was found out, Pakistan 'arrested' Mir and put him in prison.Mir's case has come handy as India reminded the world of Pakistan's duplicity, with foreign secretary Vikram Misri bringing him up twice since launch of Operation Sindoor.Misri said, ""Pakistan has been known to wilfully mislead the world and international forums such as FATF. In the Sajid Mir case, this terrorist was declared dead, and then, in response to international pressure, brought back to life, found alive and arrested."" According to sources, acceptance of Mir's existence by Pakistan was a desperate attempt to get off the 'grey list' of FATF.When pressure mounted on Pakistan with the search for perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks , Islamabad denied Mir's existence declared him dead in 2021. Mir was, on paper, lodged in the central jail in Lahore after being 'sentenced' for eight years by a Pakistan 'anti-terrorism court' on charges of terror financing . He was detained in April 2022 in a hush-hush affair while the jail term was awarded in June, just before a FATF meeting.Mir has a $5 million bounty announced by FBI, which has described him as someone who once wore a beard and hair down to his shoulders. He, according to the US agency, altered his appearance through plastic surgery.The US has held Mir responsible for directing preparations and reconnaissance and being one of the Pakistan-based controllers during the 26/11 attacks . In addition, Mir conspired to commit a terrorist attack against a newspaper and its employees in Denmark between 2008 and 2009.Mir, who would now be in his early 50s, was LeT's foreign recruiter and the main handler for Pakistani-American terrorist David Coleman Headley . A US justice department document mentioned how the 26/11 attackers were in real-time telephonic contact with Mir and his associates during the attacks. On Mir's advice, Headley changed his name of 'Dawood Gilani' to 'David Coleman Headley' in order to facilitate his activities on behalf of the LeT by enabling him to present himself in India as an American who was neither Muslim nor Pakistani.","Sajid mir had been loaned to let and played a key role in scripting the mumbai 26/11 attack.

Tomorrow (Friday) there is a meeting of the board of the IMF, and I'm sure that our executive director will put forward India's position,"" foreign secretary Vikarm Misri told a news conference when asked about India's position about the IMF loan to Pakistan which would be discussed.The IMF executive board is scheduled to meet Pakistan officials on May 9 for first review of the extended funding facility, and a request for an arrangement under the resilience and sustainability facility .Misri said the IMF board members will have to take a decision based on the facts. ""The decisions of the board are a different matter - you know, the process through which they are made.

NEW DELHI: In fast widening hostilities, India hit several air defence systems and other targets in Pakistan after thwarting missiles and drones launched from across the border against Indian military bases and civilian areas in the early hours of Thursday as well as later at night. Operation Sindoor is fully underway. Pakistan army chief Asim Munir will not be given a face-saving exit,"" a senior officer told TOI, as India's counter-strikes were still unfolding at night, including forward deployment of warships in northern Arabian Sea and total breakdown of the LoC ceasefire.Amid the 'fog of war', there were unconfirmed reports of two Pakistani JF-17 jets and an F-16 fighter being shot down and India targeting Pak capital Islamabad.The IAF deployed Israeli-origin Harop and Harpy kamikaze drones, which act as cruise missiles by exploding into enemy targets and radars, soon after Pakistan launched a salvo of missiles and suicide drones at 15 Indian military targets in northern and western India around 1am.The drone and missile attacks by Pakistan resumed as it got dark, with multiple locations being targeted, including Jaisalmer air base, Amritsar and military stations of Jammu, Pathankot and Udhampur as well as other places like Samba and Arnia. Explosions caused panic in Jammu city as the heavily-guarded airport was one of the targets. ""The threats were neutralised by our armed forces through kinetic and non-kinetic (jamming) actions. There were no losses,"" an officer said.India launched a massive retaliatory attack on Thursday as IAF drone strikes destroyed a Chinese-origin HQ-9 surface-to-air missile and radar system in Lahore. Other sites targeted in Pakistan included Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Khenju (Sind), Attock, Miano, Bahawalpur and an area near Karachi.Earlier in the day, Pakistan launched an attack on Indian military assets, including IAF bases in Awantipura, Srinagar and Uttarlai as well as Army formations in Jammu, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Bathinda and Chandigarh, which was foiled by the multi-layered air defence network led by the formidable Russian-origin S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile system.Following India's retaliation, defence minister Rajnath Singh said India has always played the role of a responsible nation by exercising great restraint and trying to resolve issues through dialogue. ""But if anyone tries to take advantage of our restraint, they will face the same kind of quality action as yesterday,"" he said.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the Pahalgam terror massacre was the ""original escalation"" and the Indian armed forces were only responding to it. ""India's response is non-escalatory, precise and measured. Our intention is not to escalate matters, and we are only responding to the escalation,"" he said. ""Any further action by Pakistan, some of which we are seeing today, is nothing but escalation by Pakistan once again, and will be responded to and is being responded to appropriately,"" he added.The outrage at Pakistan's attempt to hit Indian military bases at 15 locations in the morning was quite evident. Colonel Sofia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, at a briefing, said it had been made amply clear that Operation Sindoor on Wednesday had specifically hit nine terror hubs across the border, without any Pakistani military establishments being targeted.""It was also reiterated that any attack on military targets in India will invite a suitable response.

It also has the French-origin Spada anti-aircraft system with a 20-25km range for defence of airbases and other important facilities, among other systems.""The S-400, which has four kinds of missiles to intercept targets at ranges of 120, 200, 250 and 380km, by far outclasses the HQ-9. It is crucial to our air defence coverage and is fully plugged into IAF's integrated air command and control system (IACCS),"" an officer said.Under the $5.4 billion(Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons in north-west and east India to cater to both China and Pakistan.The S-400 radars - the primary acquisition one has a 600km range - can track hundreds of targets simultaneously. Delivery of the remaining two S-400 squadrons, however, has been hugely delayed to 2026-27 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.The fully-automated IACCS network , which combines a wide array of sensors and weapons, is now progressively also integrating military radars with civilian ones. ""With the new Akashteer system, data from IAF and Army radars are fused to provide a unified, real-time air picture, which is available to all IAF and Army air defence centres,"" another officer said.India is also developing its own long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system under the ambitious Project Kusha . With an interception range of around 350km, this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29,as reported by TOI earlier.Army, Navy and Air Force have all inducted the potent Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile (MR-SAM) systems, with an over 70km range, jointly developed with Israel. Army and IAF have also inducted in large numbers the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, with an interception range of 25km, which is now also being exported to other countries.Armed forces also have a variety of shorter range air defence weapons. They include the older Russian Igla-1M (5km), OSA-AK-M (10km) and Pechora missiles and upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5km). The newer ones are Israeli low-level Spyder quick-reaction anti-aircraft missiles (15km range) and Russian man-portable Igla-S (6km) systems. DRDO is also testing the indigenous very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS) missiles, which have a range of up to 6km.","India's air defence weapons range from the formidable russian-origin s-400 'triumf' surface-to-air missile system to the shoulder-fired igla-s missiles that have an interception range of 6km. Pakistan largely relies on chinese-supplied hq-9 air defence missile batteries and radars, which have a range of 120km.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121011994,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1479549,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Foreign secretary Vikram Misri on Thursday strongly rebutted Pakistan's recent claim of ""downing"" of Indian jets, amid rising tensions after India's precision strikes under ' Operation Sindoor ,' calling out Islamabad's ""long history of lies"".Addressing a joint press conference, Misri dismissed Pakistan’s claims that Indian jets had been downed.On Pakistan’s assertion that it shot down Indian aircraft, Misri said, “…There is nothing surprising in it.After all, this is a country that started lying as soon as it was born. In 1947, when the Pakistani army claimed Jammu and Kashmir, they lied not to any random person but to the United Nations that we have nothing to do with it… So this journey started 75 years ago…”He also referred to another claim by neighbouring Pakistan and said, “Pakistan also alleges that we have targeted the Neelum-Jhelum dam in PoJK, it is absolutely fabricated and a blatant lie. India has only targeted terrorist infrastructure... If this kind of a claim is a pretext of targeting Indian infrastructure of similar nature, then Pakistan will be solely responsible for the consequences that will undoubtedly follow.”Highlighting Pakistan’s track record as a hub for terrorism, Misri said the country's global reputation as the ""epicentre of terrorism"" is well established.""I don't need to remind where Osama Bin Laden was found and who called him a martyr... Pakistan is also home to a large number of UN proscribed terrorists and also to terrorists proscribed by many countries... You must have seen in the last few days, their defence minister and former foreign minister accepted their country's involvement with such terror groups,"" he said.The strong response from ministry of external affairs comes days after its armed forces launched coordinated strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and PoJK in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , which claimed 26 lives.","Foreign secretary vikram misri strongly rebutted pakistan's recent claim of ""downing"" of indian jets.

What are loitering munitions?



NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Thursday targeted Jammu with loitering munitions in retaliation to the Operation Sindoor . This is the same weapon used by the Indian Armed Forces during the Operation to target nine terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The Indian Armed Forces intercepted Pakistani missiles, drones. A complete blackout has been enforced in Akhnoor, Kishtwar, Samba and other Jammu regions.Blackout has also been imposed in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Jaisalmer, Gurdaspur in Punjab along with Bikaner, Rajasthan.A loitering munition is a precision-guided weapon designed to hover over a target zone, identify threats, and strike—either autonomously or with human input—before self-destructing upon impact.India had targeted nine locations, including Jaish-e-Mohammed ’s base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke. Utilising advanced precision weapons and intelligence-based targeting, the Army, Navy, and Air Force coordinated the strikes without engaging Pakistani military sites.The tensions escalated between the two nations after Pahalgam attack that killed 25 Indians and one Nepalese citizen on April 22.","A complete blackout has been enforced in akhnoor, kishtwar, samba and other jammu regions.

NEW DELHI: The presence of senior Pakistan army officers at the funeral of one of those killed in India's surgical strike on Jaish-e-Muhammed's terror camp at Bahawalpur sparked speculation about Abdul Rauf Asghar - the younger brother of Jaish chief Masood Azhar and mastermind of the IC814 hijack , Pathankot fidayeen strike and the Pulwama attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel - being among those killed.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri, at the official govt briefing on Thursday, refused to comment on the speculation about Rauf's death, but sources in security agencies said the funeral attendance was seen as a possible giveaway.Rauf, around 48 years old, was the most senior Jaish figure residing in the Markaz Subhan Allah at Bahawalpur. Rauf is believed to be the de facto head of Jaish, managing all its operations, overseeing training of its top fidayeen and plotting terror attacks against India.On X, BJP said Rauf had been ""eliminated"" while recalling his role as the prime conspirator and mastermind behind the Kandahar hijack, executed by him to secure the release of his brother Masood, the Pathankot attack and the 2001 Parliament terror strike.Masood chose the targets but stayed away from the finer planning, leaving such details to his younger brother. Masood himself is believed to be in the protective custody of Pakistan authorities at an undisclosed location in either Islamabad or Rawalpindi.Sources indicated that Masood was never an 'operations' man but the prime motivator for Jaish, who could turn 'jihadi' recruits into committed fidayeen with his fiery sermons. His recorded sermons still do the job, even as planning and execution of operations was left to Rauf.Rauf arranged consignments of weapons, including M4 rifles left behind by Nato forces in Afghanistan, through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-based smugglers for Markaz Subhan Allah.Rauf was designated by the home ministry as an ""individual terrorist"" in Oct 2020 under UAPA. As per the ban notification, he was involved in setting up terror training camps in Pakistan and organising terrorist attacks in India from Pakistan soil.

Rajkot was among the diversion/alternate airports for single aisle aircraft taking the longer route to and from the west after the closure of Pakistan airspace on April 24.""Now the diversion airports are more distant, like Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Goa.So, in case of diversion, aircraft will have to fly for a longer distance both while headed there and then when resuming their journey to north India,"" said a senior pilot.Airports that have been closed - till Saturday morning as of now - are Srinagar, Jammu, Leh, Chandigarh, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Patiala, Bhatinda, Halwara, Pathankot, Bhuntar, Shimla, Gaggal, Dharamsala, Kishangarh, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Mundra, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Porbandar, Kandla, Keshod, Bhuj, Gwalior and Hindon.With almost all airlines, and not just Indian, now bypassing Pakistan airspace, air traffic between the east and west has shifted to the Mumbai side, leading to congestion. ""Whenever Pakistan escalates the conflict, aircraft will get little farther away routes (from Pakistan airspace) in the Indian airspace. This will lead to slightly longer routes. But the big difference will be when an en route flight diverts to now further away airports in India,"" said a pilot.Meanwhile, Indian carriers have pulled out their aircraft from the 27 closed airports. ""The aircraft were flown out as ferry flights (without passengers). Crew stationed there has also been brought to Delhi or other places by trains. As of now, given the way Pakistan is brazenly acting, we don't know when normalcy will return and these airports will open. So, we couldn't have had our crew stuck there,"" said a senior official of an airline. IndiGo , for instance, flew out four aircraft from Chandigarh, and the crew stationed there travelled to Delhi by train. More international long-haul flights to and from India are now adding stops. United New York (EWR)-Delhi flight will now take a stopover at Frankfurt for a few days.

NEW DELHI: The initial civilian casualties in Poonch due to the relentless mortar fire and shelling by Pakistani forces occurred while the evacuation of residents from border villages was still underway, a government source said. Evacuations, officials told TOI, have since been stepped up not only in Poonch but also other border villages spread across Uri, Baramulla, Karnah, Tangdhar, Mendhar and Rajouri in J&K, all of which came under shelling on Tuesday and Wednesday night.Pakistan army had resorted to heavy mortar fire and shelling at several points in J&K close to LoC/international border soon after Indian armed forces struck terror facilities across PoK and Pakistan during the intervening night of May 6 and 7.Though Poonch town - which is just 2-3 km from the LoC, as is Rawalakot in PoK - has traditionally never been targeted with shelling, this time was an exception.The Pakistani forces opened heavy mortar fire, hitting civilian targets in the main Poonch town. This caused more than a dozen casualties, essentially border residents that were yet to be moved to bunkers of safer places inside. Local hospitals reported many more as injured.At its briefing here on Thursday, the ministry of external affairs put the overall toll of civilians killed in shelling from Pakistan, at 16, and the injured at 59.TOI has learnt that though the evacuation plans were drawn up in advance, with community bunkers readied across several border villages and schools and other buildings in areas further from the border earmarked to accommodate displaced border residents, the deployment of additional troops and equipment at LoC in anticipation of an escalation by Pakistan had been going on for the last few days.Civilian population was yet to be fully evacuated when Pakistani forces struck with mortar fire and shelling at several points along the LoC/IB. The Indian forces - Army and BSF - responded to the provocation with heavy retaliatory fire.Over the past couple of days, the J&K administration has ensured the evacuation of a large number of border residents, relocating them in community bunkers or government buildings like schools and halls, till the border is safer.""The local authorities in the border districts are connected 24x7 to the integrated control room to coordinate evacuation, emergency response, blackouts, medical assistance and maintenance of essential supplies and services,"" a senior J&K government official told TOI.","Pakistan army resorted to heavy mortar fire and shelling at several points in j&k close to loc/international border.

He said it's all been at the behest of the West, of the US and UK, but they're hardly likely to corroborate him.Then, Bilawal Bhutto admitted on Sky News, ""I don't think it's a secret Pakistan has a past as far as extremist groups are concerned."" I&B minister Attaullah Tarar told Sky News there are no terrorist camps in Pakistan, only to be fact-checked by the interviewer.In an interview with CNN , Asif was forced to confess that Pakistan's claims of shooting down IAF jets had no basis other than ""social media"". Asked if he had concrete evidence, he was left tongue-tied. The interviewer tried to put him on the mat on whether Pakistan had used Chinese equipment to counter the Indian strikes. He refused to answer. Clearly, it's okay for Pak mantris to diss their country but not China. That too tells you something.Amid the numerous gaffes by its ministers, Pakistan also dismissed India's statement that it had launched drone and missile strikes on 15 Indian military sites, including Amritsar, Srinagar, and Chandigarh, branding them as ""cinematic fabrications"" aimed at deflecting domestic scrutiny.

We have always believed in dialogue for solutions.But that does not mean that we will allow anyone to take unfair advantage of our tolerance and patience and, if anyone dares do that, we will give the same kind of quality response as yesterday,"" Singh said, his stark remarks coming on a day when India, responding to Pakistan's failed attempt to hit military installations, successfully breached the hostile neighbour's air defence.The defence minister, who had earlier in the day told an all-party meeting Operation Sindoor was ongoing, said the way the armed forces successfully carried out strikes on nine terror camps while ensuring that there were no collateral civilian casualties was unimaginable. ""I congratulate our armed forces. We are proud of the way they demolished terror camps in Punjab and POK,"" Singh said, emphasising that the success would not have been possible without quality weapons.He also lauded PM Narendra Modi for his focus on empowering the defence sector. ""He was guided by the philosophy of defence sovereignty which means that a country's defence preparedness can never be adequate unless it becomes self-reliant in meeting its defence needs,"" he said.""If we continue to source our weapons and defence equipment from others, then it will mean that we have outsourced our security to others.
