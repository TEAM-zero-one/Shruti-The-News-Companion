Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Reveals How India Thwarted Pakistan’s Attempt During Op Sindoor

Our fight against terror continues: Min

NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, defence minister Rajnath Singh Thursday said this shows its “true intentions”. Any misadventure by the neighbour would result in a response “so strong it will change both history and geography” of the area, he warned.“In 1965 (war), Indian Army showed courage by reaching Lahore. In 2025, Pakistan must remember that the road to Karachi also passes through the Creek,” Singh said after performing shastra (arms) puja at Bhuj military station in Gujarat.The marshlands of Sir Creek, a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Rann of Kutch and Pakistan’s Sindh, have been a bone of contention between the neighbours due to differing interpretations of the maritime boundary in the region. The long-standing dispute has implications for access to fishing rights and potential natural resources like oil and gas in the region and affects drawing of maritime boundaries and EEZs in Arabian Sea.Talking about the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, Rajnath said Pakistan made failed attempts to penetrate India’s defences along the LoCand International Border stretching from Leh to the Sir Creek region by launching multiple waves of drones and some missiles.The Indian response “exposed the weaknesses of Pakistan’s air defence”, Rajnath said. Despite its superior capability, India showed restraint because its military action was targeted against terrorism and its training hubs.“The objective of Operation Sindoor was not to escalate and start a war. I am happy that the Indian armed forces successfully achieved all the military objectives of Operation Sindoor.However, our fight against terrorismcontinues,” he said.","Rajnath singh warns pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive sir creek region.

Taliban minister's visit will help explore new areas of cooperation

NEW DELHI: The stunning turnaround in India’s ties with Taliban in the past few years on the back of its humanitarian aid for the people of Afghanistan is set to intensify further with a likely visit by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India on Oct 9-10.He is expected to meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar on the second day of the first trip to India by a senior Taliban official since the group took over the reins of Afghanistan in 2021.New Delhi had been in touch with Kabul since Aug for Muttaqi’s visit. As he faces a UNSC travel ban, India approached the Council for a waiver. It’s understood the request has now been granted, allowing the Centre to finalise the dates.The unprecedented visit by the senior Taliban minister will cap a landmark year in India’s ties with Taliban that saw India shedding inhibitions of the past to upgrade its engagements with the regime in Kabul, despite not recognising it officially.This was done through a meeting between foreign minister Muttaqi and foreign secretary Vikram Misri in Dubai in Jan and the first political contact in the form of a phone call between Jaishankar and the Afghan minister in May.Backing India’s decision to host a Taliban minister, the Taliban head of political office and Afghan ambassador to Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, told TOI last month high-level visits are required to upgrade and strengthen ties. Shaheen had also said the visit will pave the way for exploring various fields of cooperation.In their meeting in Dubai, Misri assured Muttaqi India would consider engaging in development projects soon, in addition to continuing its ongoing humanitarian assistance programme.",Amir khan muttaqi is expected to meet external affairs minister s jaishankar.

Poll Should India continue to engage in dialogue with Pakistan regarding the Sir Creek dispute? Yes, dialogue is essential No, it's a waste of time

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday raised concerns over Sir Creek and blamed Pakistan’s intentions for stalled dialogue, even 78 years after independence.The Sir Creek dispute is a long-standing boundary issue between India and Pakistan in the Rann of Kutch region, where the creek meets the Arabian Sea.""Even after 78 years of independence, a dispute over the border in the Sir Creek area is being stirred up. India has made several attempts to resolve it through dialogue, but there is a flaw in Pakistan's intentions; its intentions are not clear. The way in which the Pakistan army has recently expanded its military infrastructure in areas adjacent to Sir Creek reveals its intentions,"" Rajnath said.The defence minister added that the Indian Army is consistently protecting the borders and any attempt by Pakistan will be met with strong measures.""The Indian Army and BSF are jointly and vigilantly protecting the borders of India. If any misadventure is attempted from the Pakistan side in the Sir Creek area, it will receive such a decisive response that both history and geography will change. In the 1965 war, the Indian Army had demonstrated the capability to reach Lahore. Today in 2025, Pakistan should remember that one route to Karachi passes through the creek,"" Rajnath said.Rajnath Singh also hailed Operation Sindoor , complimenting its capability to neutralise enemies hidden anywhere at any time, and condemned Pakistan’s “failed” attempt to breach India’s defence.""During Operation Sindoor, our armed forces demonstrated that the forces challenging India's sovereignty, no matter where they are hiding, we have the power to find them and eliminate them. No power in the world, if it challenges our sovereignty, will find India sitting silently. Today's India says that whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat it. During Operation Sindoor, Pakistan made a failed attempt to breach India's defence system from Leh to this area of Sir Creek. India's armed forces completely exposed the Pakistani air defence system and sent a message to the world that India's armed forces can inflict heavy damage on Pakistan whenever, wherever, and however they wish,"" said Rajnath.He added that, despite India’s capabilities, escalating or waging war is not the nation's intention.Rajnath said, ""Despite our capabilities, we exercised restraint because our military action was directed against terrorism. Escalating the situation and waging war was not the objective of Operation Sindoor. I am pleased that Indian forces have successfully achieved all of Operation Sindoor's military objectives. However, our fight against terrorism continues.""","The sir creek dispute is a long-standing boundary issue between india and pakistan.

India-China cooperation Will Make The 21st Century a Genuine Asian Century: Chinese Envoy Xu Feihong

NEW DELHI: In the middle of Dussehra festivities, India Thursday announced resumption of direct air services with China from late Oct, marking another significant step in efforts to normalise the relationship that saw PM Narendra Modi visiting Tianjin last month for the SCO summit and also having a bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping.This is the second major step taken by India to facilitate regular exchanges between the two countries, after govt resumed tourist visas for Chinese nationals.Govt said in a statement that the agreement between civil aviation authorities would further ease people-to-people contact between India and China, contributing towards gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges, and economic cooperation.Direct flights remained suspended since early 2020, initially because of the pandemic and later because of military and political tensions. India’s efforts to normalise the relationship have acquired a greater sense of urgency because of its recent experience with the Trump administration. Both countries had agreed in principle to resume air services in Jan during foreign secretary Vikram Misri’s visit. Since then, said MEA, civil aviation authorities had been engaged in technical-level discussions on resuming direct air services and on a revised Air Services Agreement.Shortly after MEA’s announcement, IndiGo said it would start a daily nonstop between Kolkata and Guangzhou from Oct 26. The airline will fly between Delhi and Guangzhou, the date for which will be announced shortly. Air India is likely to resume China flights with a nonstop between Delhi and Shanghai by the year-end, say sources.IndiGo said its “familiarity with local partners” enabled it to resume these flights swiftly. IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said: “This will once again allow seamless movement of people, goods, and ideas, while also strengthening bilateral ties between two of the world’s most populous countries and fast-growing economies...” The flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou will open for sale from Friday.","Direct flights remained suspended since early 2020, initially because of the pandemic and later because of military and political tensions.

NAGPUR: RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday warned about environmental degradation and its intensified effects in the Himalayas, linking them to “faulty global development models and materialist and consumerist approaches” that disrupt climate balance.He flagged these ecological threats in his annual Vijayadashami address, coinciding with the centenary of the Nagpur-headquartered RSS. Former President Ram Nath Kovind attended as chief guest, along with Union minister Nitin Gadkari and Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis.“We need to review our policy if current development models are aggravating these issues. The Himalayas’ situation is a warning bell. Irregular rainfall, landslides, and glacier drying have intensified over the last 3-4 years,” Bhagwat said, speaking weeks after nature’s fury struck large parts of northern India.Since Southeast Asia’s water supply originates in the Himalayas, which also act as a protective wall for India, Bhagwat cautioned that disasters in the region should serve as a wake-up call. He said the present development model, based on a “materialist and compartmentalised approach,” is directly linked to recent ecological disasters. “The adverse effects of our lifestyle are now visible in India, with inconsistent rainfall and increasing natural disasters,” Bhagwat added.Bhagwat also expressed concern over regional turmoil, including Nepal, and referenced the Pahalgam terror attack and US tariff hikes to stress the need for stronger security and economic self-reliance. “The Pahalgam attack tested our unity, leadership, and armed forces. US tariff policy is self-interested; we must strengthen economic freedom and ensure global interdependence never becomes a compulsion,” he said.He cited regime changes in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal, attributing them to public anger and warning that forces aiming to create disturbances in India are active inside and outside the country. He stressed importance of stability, and prosperity in neighbouring nations, reflecting India’s natural affinity with them.Bhagwat acknowledged signs of growth in India but warned against systemic flaws: “The widening rich-poor gap, concentration of economic power, environmental degradation, and rising transnationalism over genuine human relationships cannot be ignored.”Recalling the April 22 Pahalgam strike that killed 26 tourists, he lauded India’s Operation Sindoor in May as a reflection of leadership, armed forces readiness, and societal unity. He emphasized vigilance, enhanced security, and the inherent strength of Hindu society as an inclusive force that guarantees national unity and development.","Rss chief mohan bhagwat warns about environmental degradation and its intensified effects in the himalayas.

'Demonetisation, GST destroying small, medium businesses'



'Cowardice at heart of RSS-BJP ideology'



'Rahul wants to fight Indian state!'



NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , accused the BJP-led central government of mounting a “wholesale attack on Indian democracy” during an interaction at EIA University in Colombia. The BJP hit back, calling him a “Leader of Propaganda” and criticising him for ""once again"" denigrating Indian democracy on a foreign platform.""The single biggest risk is the attack on democracy that is taking place in India because India has multiple religions, multiple traditions, multiple languages. And India actually is a conversation between all its people and different traditions, different religions, different ideas require space. And that the best method for creating that space is the democratic system. And currently there is a wholesale attack on the democratic system in India,"" Rahul said during a recent interaction with students.Contrasting Indian political system with that of China's, he said, ""This other big risk is risk between different conceptions, different parts of the country, right? Some 16, 17 different languages, different religions. So allowing these different traditions to thrive, giving them space to express themselves is very important for a country like India. We can't do what China does, which is suppress people and run authoritarian system.Our design just will not accept that.""""Most of the people, for example, who are creating polarisation in the US with Mr Trump are those who lost their jobs because of manufacturing. China has demonstrated to the world how you can manage production in a non-democratic setup, but we cannot do that; we are a democratic setup. The challenge is whether we can develop manufacturing like China but within a democratic setup,"" he added.Targeting the central government's policies, including demonetisation and GST, Rahul said that these economic policies ""destroyed small and medium businesses and allowed very large monopolies to control a big section of our economy.""""The Government of India brought two policies - first, the demonetisation of our currency, which essentially destroyed small and medium businesses and allowed very large monopolies to control a big section of our economy; and second, GST, which was again designed to harm medium and small businesses. We believe that supporting these small businesses is the way forward for entrepreneurship, and that’s the difference between us and those in power who believe that a few monopolies should control the economy,"" he said.""In India, we have a huge level of corruption at the centralised level. Three or four businesses are taking over the whole economy, having a direct relationship with the Prime Minister, and it is rampant in India,"" he added.Citing past statements by foreign minister S Jaishankar about China and Hindu ideologue VD Savarkar about beating up a Muslim man, Rahul said that ""cowardice was at heart of RSS-BJP ideology.""""This is the nature of BJP-RSS. If you notice a statement of the foreign minister, he said, 'China is much more powerful than us. How can I pick a fight with them?' At the heart of the ideology is cowardice,"" he said.""In his book, Savarkar has written that once he and his few friends beat up a Muslim man, and they felt very happy that day. If five people beat up a single individual, which makes one of them happy, it is cowardice. This is RSS ideology, to beat weak people,"" he added.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla criticised Rahul for making such statements abroad.""Once again Rahul Gandhi behaves like LoP - Leader of Propaganda Goes abroad and attacks Indian Democracy! After all he wants to fight Indian state! Sometimes Demands US UK should intervene into our affairs and now this From Sena to Judiciary to Sanvidhan to Sanatan!"" he said in a post on X.Moreover, BJP's Pradeep Bhandari accused ""Gandhi-Vadra family"" of keeping India ""poor.""""Rahul Gandhi is anti-India. The one who hates India and its progress can speak such things on foreign soil that India can't be a leader. The Gandhi-Vadra family kept India poor due to such a mindset. When they see that India has emerged as a global leader and a four trillion-dollar economy under PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi is attacking India's progress and its democracy out of jealousy and disgust,"" Bhandari told ANI.""This makes it clear that Rahul Gandhi's remote control is in foreign hands. Those who don't want India to progress push Rahul Gandhi to say such things. He is not a political opponent, but leader of opposing India. He is against India's unity and integrity. 140 crore Indians are witnessing Rahul Gandhi's attempt to defame India from foreign soil,"" he added.Ravi Shankar Prasad also took aim at Gandhi saying that instead of greeting Indians on the occasion of Vijayadashami, he chose to ""speak against India.""“Rahul Gandhi is abroad. It would have been better if, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, he had extended greetings to the people of the country. But instead, he chooses to speak against India.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said there was currently a “wholesale attack on the democratic system” in India. He argued that India had to allow different traditions to thrive and “we cannot do what China does, which is to suppress people and run an authoritarian system”.Rahul, who is on a four-nation tour of South America, was speaking at EIA University in Medellin, Colombia.The MP said India had a much more complex system than China, and its strengths were different from that of the neighbouring country, reported PTI. “I am very optimistic about India, but at the same time, there are fault lines within the Indian structure, there are risks that India has to overcome. The single-biggest risk is the attack on democracy that is taking place in India,” he said, adding, “Different ideas, religions and traditions require space. The best method for creating that space is the democratic system.”BJP Thursday lashed out at Rahul Gandhi for his remarks in Colombia, accusing him of insulting India on foreign soil because its people had “rejected him 90 times”.BJP senior Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “It would have been better if, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, Rahul Gandhi had extended greetings to people of the country.

""This will provide employment to millions of people and bring light into their lives...when we adopt the vow of swadeshi, we also align ourselves with the ambitious campaign to take India to the top position in the world by 2047,"" he stated.

He said the khadi and swadeshi were synonymous with the freedom movement and Mahatma Gandhi, by giving these two concepts to the country, not only accelerated the freedom movement but also positively changed the lives of many poor people in the country.Stating that the ideas of khadi and swadeshi were ""forgotten"" for a long time, he said Narendra Modi, during his tenure as the Gujarat chief minister, launched a focused campaign to revive khadi in 2003. ""That marked the beginning of the movement to revive khadi. Khadi has once again become an item of common use among people,"" he said.Shah mentioned how the prime minister, through his 'Mann Ki Baat' program, has been promoting the idea of Swadeshi, inspiring the people of the country to connect with economic development and the ' Make in India ' campaign. Inspired by this, millions of families across the country have decided not to use any foreign goods in their households, he said.

Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade open up about their surrogacy journey

Former NBA star Dwyane Wade and his wife Gabrielle Union have been married for over a decade. They celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary on August 30 and even shared a montage of videos on Instagram marking their special day. Despite showcasing the bright sunny side on social media, the Wade couple has been through one of the toughest times. Gabrielle Union revealed her biggest fear when the former NBA star was diagnosed with Cancer.During an interview with the reputed media outlet Marie Clare, Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union opened up about one of the most toughest time in their life. While talking about the Miami Heat alum’s cancer diagnosis, Gabrielle Union shared one of her biggest fears. She said,""It was hard to navigate publicly the things that were happening privately. Even though we all know plenty of survivors, immediately you go to death, immediately we all internalize his cancer. It's our cancer.""According to Union, she was scared and even worried that she would have to raise the kids in Dwyane Wade’s absence. The Bring It On star further mentioned,""I'll speak for myself when I say that the decisions that he was making hurt me about his cancer. It felt like, 'Oh, you're trying to kill me.And I'm going to be alone raising these kids. It's a very selfish response that I had, and it caused all kinds of problems, but [so did] his need for secrecy about his cancer decisions. It just starts sowing the seeds of distrust.""After coming across the life-threatening tumor in Wade’s kidney, Gabrielle Union felt as if the NBA icon was almost near to death. She explained,""It just felt like he was trying to leave us—not in a marital sense, but a life and death sense. By the time he got it removed, I felt like we were more on the same page.""Dwyane Wade underwent a kidney removal surgery in December 2023. Reportedly, his 40% right kidney was removed due to the cancer diagnosis. During this particular period of time, Gabrielle Union-Wade and the Heat's alum went through a lot in terms of trauma and anxiety. However, after leaving behind the tumor with a successful surgery, the Wades' make the most of their time along with their daughter Kaavia. Dwyane Wade and his wife Gabrielle Union have been through one of the darkest times of their life while supporting one another like a rock.During an appearance on Today with Jenna & Friends, Gabrielle Union revealed how her husband Dwyane Wade’s cancer diagnosis took a toll on their relationship. According to the Hollywood star, within 9 years of marriage their marriage almost hit rock bottom when the NBA star was diagnosed with kidney cancer. She revealed,“It was year nine of our marriage and ... year nine was very hard. When you mention year nine being hard, he hadn’t revealed his cancer diagnosis and his own cancer journey, so now we can put it in more context.”She further elaborated,""Obviously him getting that diagnosis was traumatic for him: Being faced with your own mortality in your early 40s, and you’re like, ‘Am I going to be here to see my family? Who am I without this big life, and without this healthy body? But you also don’t understand the journey and the toll that it takes on your marriage, on your family, on your kids.”After being married for 11 long years, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union share a daughter named Kaavia via surrogacy. The Hollywood star has struggled with health issues which left her with no option but to go ahead with surrogacy. After embracing the bliss of motherhood, Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade’s world revolves around their little daughter.Also Read: “I see what yall saw""- Dwyane Wade reflects on the 'actual reason' behind his crazy fan following with a throwback clip","Former nba star dwyane wade and his wife gabrielle union have been married for over a decade.

Implications for MLB and New York

The 2025 MLB offseason is shaping up to be one of the most exciting in recent memory, particularly for fans in New York. Two of the city’s biggest stars - Cody Bellinger of the New York Yankees and Pete Alonso of the Mets - are both expected to hit the open market. With MVP résumés, strong recent seasons, and major contract decisions looming, the coming months could define the direction of New York baseball and the broader league landscape.Cody Bellinger, who joined the New York Yankees after signing a three-year, $80 million deal with the Cubs, has reestablished himself as a premier offensive and defensive force. In 2025, he delivered a strong season, slashing .272/.334/.480 while adding 29 home runs and 97 RBIs. His versatility in the outfield and improved consistency at the plate have made him one of the New York Yankees’ most valuable contributors alongside Aaron Judge.However, Cody Bellinger’s contract includes an opt-out clause, and all signs point toward him exercising it. League insiders believe he is aiming for a much larger deal this winter, with projections suggesting he could command upwards of $180 million.While Bellinger has expressed interest in staying with the New York Yankees due to their championship aspirations, his free agency will likely generate heavy competition. The Yankees’ front office faces the challenge of balancing their already massive payroll, which ranks among the top three in baseball, with the need to retain a player who has become central to their offensive attack.Meanwhile, Pete Alonso - the Mets’ beloved “Polar Bear” - has officially opted out of the final year of his two-year, $54 million deal. The first baseman is coming off another powerful season, smashing 38 home runs, driving in 126 RBIs (the second-highest total in the National League), and posting a .272 batting average with an .871 OPS. Beyond the numbers, Alonso’s improved Statcast data, including his exit velocity and hard-hit rate, underline his continued dominance as one of the game’s premier power hitters.Alonso also enters free agency without draft-pick compensation attached, boosting his appeal to prospective suitors. His offensive production and status as a fan-favorite cornerstone make him one of the most coveted players available. A long-term, high-value contract is all but guaranteed, and while the Mets will undoubtedly attempt to re-sign him, the competition for his services is expected to be fierce.The simultaneous free agency of Cody Bellinger and Alonso sets the stage for one of the most compelling offseasons in years. For the New York Yankees, the priority lies in keeping Bellinger to ensure their lineup remains among the league’s most potent, especially after missing out on big-name targets last offseason. His presence alongside Judge gives New York a formidable middle order, but the financial weight of a new deal may complicate negotiations.For the Mets, Alonso’s decision forces the franchise to confront tough questions about its future core. Losing their most consistent power threat would create a major void, not just on the field but also in terms of fan engagement. At the same time, Alonso’s free agency will drive up the market for first basemen, influencing other clubs’ plans and adding further intrigue to the winter ahead.As the curtain falls on the 2025 MLB season, attention shifts squarely to a free agency period defined by two stars: Cody Bellinger and Pete Alonso. Both are opting out of their current contracts in pursuit of long-term, high-value deals, and their decisions will reverberate throughout the league. For fans in New York, this offseason carries heightened stakes, as the futures of two franchise-defining players hang in the balance.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Toronto Blue Jays All-Star Shortstop Predicted to Land $180 Million Contract With bidding wars on the horizon and teams eager to land elite talent, the stage is set for a dramatic and high-stakes winter.

Judge denies summary judgment in Jerry Jones sexual assault case



Case heads toward trial after years of delays



A five-year-old sexual assault lawsuit involving Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones will move forward after a Dallas County judge denied his request for summary judgment. The ruling, delivered on Thursday, keeps the case on track for a jury trial scheduled for July 20, 2026. The plaintiff, a South Carolina woman, alleges that Jones assaulted her during a private event at AT&T Stadium in 2018.Jerry Jones’ legal team, led by attorneys Levi McCathern and Ty Sheaks, argued that the claims lacked credibility and that no assault occurred. They presented photographs from the night in question, showing the plaintiff and her grandson smiling alongside Jones and former linebacker Jaylon Smith. Metadata revealed the photos were taken within minutes of the alleged incident, which Jones’ attorneys said contradicted the claim that both appeared distraught immediately afterward.Several witnesses, including former Cowboys coach Jason Garrett and ex-running back Ezekiel Elliott, testified they did not witness inappropriate conduct. McCathern described the lawsuit as “hogwash” and insisted Jones “didn’t do anything wrong.”He also challenged the credibility of a key witness who came forward years later, suggesting her testimony was fabricated.In contrast, the plaintiff’s attorneys argued that multiple witnesses, including the woman’s grandson, support the claim that an assault occurred. Lawyer Antwone Cobbin dismissed the summary judgment motion as “frivolous,” stressing that the jury should decide. Cobbin noted that several individuals observed the commotion that followed, with Jones allegedly being rushed out of the room.Originally filed in 2020, the lawsuit was dismissed in 2022 but reinstated on appeal. The case has faced repeated delays, with multiple trial dates rescheduled. Thursday’s ruling signals that the court believes the dispute centers on credibility and should be resolved by a jury.Although the trial is set for July 2026, legal experts note the case could settle before then. Often, a denial of summary judgment pushes both sides closer to a resolution. For now, the case stands as one of the most high-profile legal challenges involving an NFL owner in recent years, ensuring it will continue to draw national attention as the trial date approaches.Also Read: Legendary broadcaster slams Tom Brady’s Fox NFL commentary, says it’s so 'distracting' he can’t listen anymore","Dallas cowboys owner jerry jones' sexual assault lawsuit will move forward.

Yes No

'Sole purpose of the Hamas-Sumud flotilla is provocation'



Flotilla condemns inception, calls it 'illegal'







The Israeli navy intercepted several boats from a flotilla trying to bring humanitarian goods to the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, detaining activists on board—including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg , the Israeli Foreign Ministry confirmed.The flotilla is the latest sea-borne attempt to break Israel's blockade of Gaza, much of which has been turned into a wasteland by almost two years of war.In a post on X, the Israeli foreign ministry said that they have already stopped several vessels of the Hamas-Sumud flotilla and their passengers are being transferred to an Israeli port and added that Greta and her friends are ""safe and healthy.""The foreign ministry claimed that the Flotilla was not interested in aid, but in provocation. It further said that the group had been informed it was ""violating a lawful naval blockade"" covering the waters adjacent to Gaza, though it remains unclear if the boats entered the blockade zone.""The sole purpose of the Hamas-Sumud flotilla is provocation. Israel, Italy, Greece, and the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem have all offered and continue to offer the flotilla a way to peacefully deliver any aid they might have to Gaza.The flotilla refused because they are not interested in aid, but in provocation,"" the ministry wrote in a post on X.""The Israeli Navy has reached out to the Hamas-Sumud flotilla and asked them to change course. Israel has informed the flotilla that it is approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade. Israel reiterated the offer to transfer any aid peacefully through safe channels to Gaza,"" it added.Footage released by the ministry showed Thunberg on the deck of a boat, being handed water and a jacket by an Israeli military member. Livestreams from the boats indicated that not all of the 44 vessels had been boarded and evacuated.Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) condemned the interception as ""illegal"" and ""not an act of defence"" but described it as ""a brazen act of desperation.""The group alleged that one vessel within the flotilla was ""deliberately rammed at sea"" and reported that additional boats were struck by water cannons.""Multiple vessels ... were illegally intercepted and boarded by Israeli Occupation Forces in international waters,"" the organisers said in a statement.""It clearly reveals the extreme lengths to which the occupier will go to ensure Gaza remains starved and isolated,"" GSF wrote on social media. ""They will attack a peaceful civilian mission because the success of humanitarian aid means the failure of their siege.""The GSF reported that multiple ships, including the Alma, Surius, and Adara, were intercepted and boarded. Prior to the interception, the group accused the Israeli military of ""intentionally damaging ship communications, in an attempt to block distress signals and stop the livestream of their illegal boat boarding.""The flotilla was reportedly 70 nautical miles from Gaza's shoreline when the intervention occurred, with the group aiming to arrive in Gaza on Thursday morning. Protests against Israel's interception of the flotilla have taken place in Greece, Italy, Tunisia, and Turkey.While the Israeli govt characterised the flotilla as a ""selfie yacht,"" Thunberg countered the criticism, telling the BBC on Sunday, ""I don't think anyone would risk their life for a publicity stunt.""Last week the flotilla was attacked by drones, which dropped stun grenades and itching powder on the vessels, causing damage but no injuries.Israel did not comment on the drone attack, but has said it will use any means to prevent the boats from reaching Gaza, arguing that its naval blockade is legal as it battles Hamas militants in the coastal enclave.","The israeli navy intercepted several boats from a flotilla trying to bring humanitarian goods to the gaza strip on wednesday.

Here are 10 key points about US govt shutdown :

What happens next







24 hours into the latest US government shutdown, the political deadlock shows no sign of easing, as Republicans and Democrats remain locked in a tussle over health care funding. The impasse has forced hundreds of thousands of federal workers off the job, while iconic national sites from the Liberty Bell in Pennsylvania to Pearl Harbour in Hawaii have been shuttered.At the heart of the dispute is a fight over whether subsidies under the Affordable Care Act should be extended. Democrats insist the support is vital to prevent insurance premiums from spiking, while Republicans argue that the spending bill must not include what they frame as “handouts” connected to immigration and health care.The shutdown stems from a deadlock between Senate Democrats and President Donald Trump ’s Republican majority. Democrats refused to support a short-term spending bill unless it included funding to extend subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.They argue that without them, millions of families face sharp rises in health insurance premiums. Republicans, however, have labelled this an unacceptable expansion of Obamacare. President Trump has insisted he will not be “held hostage” by Democrats tying broader healthcare demands to government funding.While some moderate senators have signalled openness to talks, neither side has budged. With no compromise reached before the deadline, the government’s funding lapsed, triggering the current shutdown.According to the Congressional Budget Office, the shutdown is costing roughly $400 million every single day. Around 750,000 federal workers are furloughed, while “essential” staff such as military personnel, border security, and air traffic controllers are working without pay.The economic costs come not only from lost wages but also from suspended government contracts, delayed projects, and reduced consumer spending. For every day of closure, billions in federal payments for services, research, and local projects are put on hold. Even a short shutdown can damage investor confidence, weaken growth, and disrupt critical services. The longer it continues, the harder it becomes for the economy to recover quickly.Both parties are pointing fingers. The Trump administration has accused Democrats of putting “illegal immigrants’ healthcare before the American people,” a claim Democrats call false. Vice President JD Vance amplified the attack in the White House briefing room, even as House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of playing politics with people’s livelihoods. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, said Trump is “using the American people as pawns. ” The clash has even descended into online memes, with Republicans using doctored videos of Democrats and Jeffries firing back with satirical images of Vance. Beneath the mockery lies a serious deadlock with little sign of compromise.The immediate impact is being felt by nearly three-quarters of a million federal workers. Many have been furloughed without pay, while others—deemed essential—are required to keep working with the promise of back pay once the shutdown ends. However, President Trump has suggested that this time furloughs could be used as a pretext for permanent layoffs. That prospect has fuelled anxiety among workers already hit by mass cuts across departments such as Education, which has seen its staff halved since Trump returned to office. For families living paycheque to paycheque, even a few missed weeks of salary could prove devastating.Essential services such as the military, Medicare and Medicaid continue, but many civilian services are either suspended or disrupted. National parks, museums, and monuments have closed, from the Gateway Arch in Missouri to the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston.Families visiting Pearl Harbour have been turned away, while popular parks such as Acadia in Maine remain deserted without staff. Civil rights investigations in schools are paused, and federal grantmaking has halted. For ordinary citizens, this translates into everything from missed student aid processing to cancelled tours, and for businesses it means suspended contracts and delayed payments.Aviation has become one of the most visibly affected sectors. Over 13,000 air traffic controllers and thousands of other aviation safety staff are working without pay. The Department of Transportation confirmed that 11,300 of its 44,800 employees have been furloughed, affecting rulemaking, inspections, and oversight. Aviation unions warn that fatigue and morale issues could compromise safety if the shutdown continues. In the past, prolonged shutdowns saw increased delays and staffing shortages at airports. Key upgrades to the air traffic control system have also been postponed. Airlines warn that passengers and the industry at large will bear the brunt of political deadlock.The shutdown has rattled financial markets. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones each fell 0.6% immediately after funding lapsed, while global markets reacted cautiously. Investors fear disruption to key data releases, including the monthly jobs report, which could be delayed. In 2018–19, a 35-day shutdown cost the economy $3 billion in lost GDP; analysts warn the toll this time could be higher if it drags on. Beyond direct costs, the uncertainty weakens business confidence, delays investment, and threatens consumer spending. As Rachel Snyderman of the Bipartisan Policy Centre said: “Shutdowns inflict economic cost, fear and confusion across the country.”The last major shutdown, under Trump in 2018–19, stretched for 35 days—the longest in history. That standoff, over border wall funding, eventually ended under public pressure after airport chaos and unpaid workers dominated headlines. Earlier shutdowns in 2013 and 2018 also showed how difficult it is to extract concessions. In each case, the political side seen as intransigent bore the brunt of public blame. This time, polls suggest Americans oppose shutdowns regardless of political goals. About one-third of voters blame both parties equally, but Trump and Republicans could face heightened risk as the party in power.The Department of Education, already weakened by layoffs, has furloughed nearly 90% of its workforce. While student aid and federal loan disbursements will continue, investigations into civil rights complaints in schools are frozen, and new grants cannot be issued. Programmes such as Impact Aid, which supports school districts near military bases or federal land, could soon face delays. Head Start preschools, run by Health and Human Services, remain largely unaffected for now, but several centres risk losing funding if the shutdown extends beyond a month. Parents reliant on subsidised childcare may struggle, affecting both education and employment.The path out of the shutdown is uncertain. Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson, insist they will not allow spending to resume without healthcare concessions. Democrats, meanwhile, argue that funding the government should not be conditional on rolling back health subsidies. Some moderate senators from both parties are in talks, but the gulf remains wide. If the shutdown drags on for weeks, it risks not just economic damage but also permanent cuts, as Trump has openly suggested using the crisis to downsize the federal workforce.","The shutdown stems from a deadlock between senate democrats and president donald trump ’s republican majority.

Your logo is already trademarked by American Eagle and Travis Kelce.”Fans pointed out the resemblance could cause legal trouble or spark public backlash.

Melvin Eng caught after Ryder Cup stunt spirals out of control



Trump Security Breach: Secret Service Fooled By 'FAKE GUARD' At Ryder Cup | WATCH

Donald Trump’s Ryder Cup appearance complicated security



A bizarre incident occurred at the Ryder Cup in Farmingdale, New York, when an NYPD detective allegedly disguised himself as part of Donald Trump ’s security team to slip into the tournament. The officer, later identified as Det. Melvin Eng, 46, reportedly managed to bypass tight layers of Secret Service and state police before his plan unraveled in embarrassing fashion. He is now suspended without pay and facing administrative charges.According to multiple reports, Melvin Eng, who was on sick leave at the time, arrived at Bethpage Black in full tactical gear. He claimed he was part of Donald Trump’s detail as the president attended Friday’s opening matches with his granddaughter, Kai.The elaborate ruse nearly worked until Eng dropped a gun magazine in front of actual security personnel. That blunder immediately drew suspicion and ultimately exposed his deception.“He got in there with his gun, past the Secret Service, past the state police,” one law enforcement source said. “What if he was looking to hurt someone?” Another veteran officer added, “You’re out sick, what are you doing at the Ryder Cup? You can’t do that.And it’s theft of service because you went in for free and then you lied and said you worked for Donald Trump.”Eng, who also serves as president of the NYPD Asian Jade Society, has been accused of theft of services and suspended for his actions. Sources told The New York Post that he even went so far as to claim he was working for federal agents.Trump’s presence at Bethpage Black already meant heightened security across the grounds. The president, accompanied by his 18-year-old granddaughter, drew chants of “USA” as he greeted supporters before watching matches from a fortified glass enclosure near the first tee. At one point, he even walked out alongside Bryson DeChambeau to the delight of the pro-American crowd.The measures surrounding Trump’s visit were extensive. Snipers were stationed atop the grandstands, TSA-level checkpoints were set up at multiple entry points, and drones, bomb-sniffing dogs, and chemical detection units were deployed. Even medical staff responding to emergencies faced delays until cleared by authorized personnel. Spectators endured bag checks and bans on electronic devices.Despite these precautions, Eng managed to slip inside. His suspension has raised questions about how he bypassed multiple layers of protection during such a high-security event. The NYPD has yet to release a formal statement on the matter.Also Read: Is Frankie Edgar alright? New Jersey legend suddenly removed from BKFC 82 Newark fight card lineup","Det.
