Optimism tempered by war on the ground





US President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, even as Russia intensified its attacks on Kyiv. Both leaders struck an optimistic tone, repeatedly suggesting that a peace deal was closer than at any previous point, yet they also acknowledged that several issues particularly territory, security guarantees and the future of occupied infrastructure remain unresolved.“I think we’re getting a lot closer, maybe very close,” Trump said after the meeting. Zelenskyy, thanking Trump for a “great meeting”, said Ukraine was “ready for peace” and that talks had yielded “significant results”, even if final decisions were still pending.The talks came just hours after the 47th POTUS held a lengthy phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin , and against the backdrop of fresh Russian missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities.Zelenskyy’s visit followed what Trump described as an “excellent” phone call with Putin earlier the same day. The Kremlin later said the call was “friendly, benevolent and businesslike”, adding that Trump and Putin agreed to speak again promptly after Trump’s talks with the Ukrainian leader.Trump insisted Putin still wants peace, despite Russia launching new attacks on Ukraine as Zelenskyy travelled to the US.“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, adding that Putin had been “very generous in his feelings toward Ukraine succeeding”.That framing has alarmed some of Ukraine’s supporters, who note a pattern in which Trump speaks to Putin before meeting Zelenskyy. However, unlike previous encounters, this sequence did not lead to an openly tense exchange between the US and Ukrainian presidents.At the centre of the talks was a revised 20-point peace framework that US and Ukrainian teams have been refining for weeks. Zelenskyy said the plan was “90% agreed”, while Trump said he did not like using percentages but suggested the deal was nearly complete.“We discussed all aspects of the peace framework,” Zelenskyy later wrote. “We agreed that security guarantees are a key milestone in achieving lasting peace.”The two sides also agreed that their teams would meet again as early as next week to finalise remaining details, and that Trump would host Ukrainian and European leaders in Washington in January.Both leaders acknowledged that the fate of the eastern Donbas region remains unresolved. Trump described it as “a very tough issue”, though he said it was getting closer to resolution. Zelenskyy was blunt about the divide. “Our attitude is very clear,” he said, adding that Ukraine and Russia hold fundamentally different positions.Trump suggested that making territorial concessions sooner rather than later could be pragmatic. “Some of that land has been taken,” he said. “And are you better off making a deal now?”Zelenskyy has shown new flexibility, saying any territorial settlement would require either a referendum or parliamentary approval, but only after a ceasefire, something Moscow has so far rejected.Security guarantees emerged as the clearest area of convergence. Zelenskyy said US-Ukraine security guarantees were “100% agreed”, calling them essential to preventing future Russian aggression. Trump was more cautious, saying the talks were about “95% done” and stressing that European countries would need to shoulder much of the responsibility with US backing.During recent negotiations, Washington has floated Nato-like guarantees for Ukraine, even as Zelenskyy signalled he could drop Kyiv’s bid to formally join the alliance if equivalent protections were provided. Russia, however, has repeatedly rejected any Nato role and warned it would view allied troops as legitimate targets.Another unresolved issue is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, which has been under Russian control since early in the war. Trump said the plant was discussed “at length” and suggested Putin was open to cooperation. “President Putin is actually working with Ukraine on getting it open,” he said.Under US proposals, the plant could be jointly run by the US, Russia and Ukraine, with shared profits. Zelenskyy is known to oppose any Russian commercial role, making this a potential flashpoint as talks continue.After their meeting, Trump and Zelenskyy spoke jointly by phone with a broad group of European leaders, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Finland.Von der Leyen later said progress was “good” but stressed that “ironclad security guarantees from day one” would be essential. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office said leaders underlined the urgency of ending the war and commended Trump for driving talks forward.Trump repeatedly warned that negotiations could still collapse. “In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other,” he said. “It’s possible it doesn’t happen.”The US president, who once claimed he could end the war in a day, now openly acknowledges its complexity. “This is not a one-day process deal,” he said. “This is very complicated stuff.”Even as diplomacy intensifies, fighting continues. Russia launched major attacks on Kyiv and other regions ahead of the talks, knocking out power and heating for hundreds of thousands. Ukrainian officials described the strikes as evidence of Moscow’s true intentions.Still, both Trump and Zelenskyy emerged keen to project momentum. “I do think we’re getting a lot closer,” Trump said. Zelenskyy echoed that sentiment, thanking Trump and his team and reiterating: “Ukraine is ready for peace.”","Us president donald trump hosted ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy at his mar-a-lago estate in florida.

Digvijaya Singh's Modi-RSS Praise Draws Jibes From BJP Amid CWC Meet

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing controversy over Digvijaya Singh 's remarks praising the RSS’s organisational strength, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Revanth Reddy hailed Sonia Gandhi 's role in Congress leadership, citing examples of elevation of Manmohan Singh and P V Narasimha Rao to the post of Prime Minister.In a social media post on X, Reddy, on the 140th foundation day of the Congress, said that the party “has shaped every defining chapter of modern India.”“Congress: a force for the people of India was born 140 years ago on this day. The story of the Indian National Congress is the story of Indian democracy in motion. When one reflects on the leadership of Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji, we find service, commitment, ethics and values,” Reddy said.“Under Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji’s leadership, it became possible for Shri P V Narasimha Rao garu, who started his public career from a remote village in Telangana, to rise to become Prime Minister of the country. Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji also made an economist like Dr Manmohan Singh Ji the Prime Minister. From leading India’s freedom struggle to framing the Constitution, from building democratic institutions to uniting a diverse nation, the Indian National Congress has shaped every defining chapter of modern India,” he added.This comes after Digvijaya Singh stirred a controversy by sharing a black-and-white photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi sitting on the floor near senior BJP leader L K Advani in Gujarat.Singh commented on the ability of grassroots workers to ascend through the ranks to become chief minister and eventually Prime Minister, attributing it to the “power of organisation.”He tagged several senior Congress leaders, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, MPs Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jairam Ramesh, Prime Minister Modi, and the official Congress handles.Reportedly, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister rued “over-centralisation” in the Congress and pushed for decentralisation in the presence of top leadership at the CWC meeting held on Saturday.He also complained that district and state chiefs were appointed by the AICC and questioned why decisions taken at the Udaipur Chintan Shivir, including setting up an election management department, had not been implemented.Last week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him “full marks,” while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, “Rahul ji, you are absolutely ‘bang on’ in matters of socio-economic issues. Full marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like the Election Commission needs reforms, so does the Indian National Congress. You have started with ‘Sangathan Srijan’, but we need more pragmatic, decentralised functioning.”He added, “I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. The only problem is that it is not easy to ‘convince’ you!!”","Andhra pradesh chief minister revanth reddy hailed sonia gandhi's role in congress leadership.

Shiv Sena (UBT) J&K unit chief Manish Sahni on Monday demanded a public apology from PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti for terming India “lynchistan” over the killing of a labourer from Bengal in Odisha’s Sambalpur and a tribal MBA student in Uttarakhand.“Mehbooba has no right to abuse the country,” Sahni said, questioning her silence on the carnage of Hindus in Bangladesh and the continued persecution of Hindus and other minorities in Pakistan.The PDP chief on Sunday alleged that the India of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru had been turned into a “lynchistan”.Sahni said abusing one’s own country because of a handful of mischievous elements is like biting the hand that feeds you. He also reminded Mehbooba of the PDP’s silence when Islamists forced the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley in the 1990s.“It is no secret which community was involved in the white-collar terrorist module that was exposed after the Delhi bomb blast,” Sahni said, alluding to the Nov 10 fidayeen attack by Pulwama-based doctor Umar Mohammed near Red Fort.He further reminded Mehbooba that this is the same country which, on Dec 8, 1989, released five dangerous terrorists in exchange for the release of her sister, Rubiya Saeed, when her father, Mufti Mohammad Saeed, was Union home minister.",Shiv sena (ubt) j&k unit chief manish sahni on monday demanded a public apology from pdp chief mehbooba mufti.

Press release by the defence ministry

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday cleared a major tranche of defence procurements worth about Rs 79,000 crore, approving missiles, rockets, radar systems, drones and support platforms aimed at significantly strengthening the combat capabilities of the armed forces. The approvals were granted by the defence acquisition council chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh.As per a statement by the defence ministry, the DAC accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for a wide range of proposals across the Army, Navy and Air Force. The approvals cover the procurement of Loiter Munition Systems for artillery regiments, Low Level Light Weight Radars, Long Range Guided Rocket Ammunition for the Pinaka Multiple Launch Rocket System (MRLS), and the Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System Mk-II.Following the meeting, Rajnath Singh said the decisions reflected the government’s focus on defence preparedness. In a post on X, he wrote, “The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) meeting held today accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for various proposals of the three Services amounting to a total of about Rs 79,000 crore.”He added, “The MoD under the leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi is working tirelessly to strengthen India’s defence preparedness.The decisions taken today will help in enhancing operational capabilities of the Armed Forces.”The ministry said loiter munition will be used for precision strikes against tactical targets, reflecting the growing emphasis on stand-off and high-accuracy weaponry. The low level lightweight radars are designed to detect and track small-sized, low-flying unmanned aerial systems, a capability that has become increasingly critical in modern battlefields.For the Indian Navy, the DAC approved procurement of Bollard Pull (BP) tugs, High Frequency Software Defined Radios (HF SDR) Manpack, and the leasing of High Altitude Long Range (HALE) Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). The ministry said induction of BP tugs will assist naval ships and submarines in berthing, unberthing and manoeuvring in confined harbour waters.The Indian Air Force will receive approvals for the procurement of Automatic Take-off Landing Recording Systems, Astra Mk-II missiles, Full Mission Simulators and SPICE-1000 long-range guidance kits.“Induction of the automatic take-off landing recording system will fill the gaps in the aerospace safety environment by providing high definition all-weather automatic recording of landing and take-off,” the ministry said.It added that Astra Mk-II missiles, with enhanced range, will improve the ability of fighter aircraft to neutralise adversary platforms from large stand-off distances.","Defence minister rajnath singh said the decisions reflected the government’s focus on defence preparedness.

DRDO Completes User Trials Of Akash-NG Air Defence Missile System, Ready For Induction

Importance of Pinaka

NEW DELHI: Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) on Monday successfully conducted the maiden flight test of the Pinaka Long Range Guided Rocket (LRGR 120). It was conducted at the Integrated Test Range in Odisha's Chandipur.""The rocket was tested for its maximum range of 120 km, demonstrating all in-flight manoeuvres as planned. The LRGR impacted the target with textbook precision,"" reported news agency PTI.Earlier, the day the Centre also cleared a fresh set of defence procurements worth around Rs 79,000 crore, giving the armed forces a significant boost in combat capability. The approvals were taken at a meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh According to the defence ministry, the council granted Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for a range of equipment to be inducted by the Army, Navy and Air Force.The cleared proposals include loitering munitions for artillery units, low-level lightweight radars, long-range guided rocket ammunition for the Pinaka multiple launch rocket system, and the Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System Mark-II, among other systems.The Pinaka Long Range Guided Rocket (LRGR 120) is an extended-range, precision-guided rocket developed for the Indian Army ’s Pinaka Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). The “120” denotes its maximum strike range of around 120 kilometres.Unlike earlier unguided Pinaka rockets, the LRGR is equipped with a guidance system that significantly improves accuracy, enabling it to engage targets such as enemy artillery positions, command nodes and logistics installations at long distances. The rocket is fired from the existing Pinaka launcher, allowing the Army to enhance capability without inducting a new launch platform.The LRGR 120 is part of India’s effort to increase indigenous, long-range precision firepower. Guidance is achieved through a combination of inertial navigation, with mid-course updates and terminal correction, reducing circular error probable (CEP) compared to earlier variants.The system provides the Army with a stand-off strike option, allowing targets to be hit from well behind forward areas, improving survivability of launch units. The rocket is intended for deployment across artillery regiments operating the Pinaka system, strengthening deep-strike and counter-force capabilities.","The rocket was tested for its maximum range of 120 km, demonstrating all in-flight manoeuvres as planned.

Live-fire war games: China launches drills around Taiwan; Taipei mobilises forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/live-fire-war-games-china-launches-drills-around-taiwan-taipei-mobilises-forces/articleshow/126227109.cms,"ON CAM: Chinese Warships, Fighter Jets & Troops Encircle Taiwan; PLA Moves In For Invasion?

China on Monday launched large-scale live-fire military drills around Taiwan, deploying warships, fighter jets, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles in what Beijing described as a stern warning to supporters of Taiwanese independence and foreign powers, as the island placed its forces on high alert and vowed to defend its democracy.Taiwan’s defence ministry said that as of 3 pm, it had detected 89 Chinese military aircraft and drones, with 67 entering Taiwan’s response area.China’s People’s Liberation Army said the exercises, code-named “Justice Mission 2025”, included live-fire training on maritime targets to the north and southwest of Taiwan. The PLA Eastern Theatre Command said the drills involved destroyers, frigates, aircraft and rocket forces and would continue into Tuesday, including simulated strikes and exercises aimed at blockading key ports.“This (the drills) serves as a serious warning to ‘Taiwan Independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces,” said Shi Yi, spokesperson for the Eastern Theatre Command.Taiwan’s military said it had activated its response mechanisms and deployed forces in reaction to the drills. “A response centre has been established, and appropriate forces have been deployed,” the military said, adding that its armed forces had carried out a rapid response exercise.A senior Taiwan security official told Reuters that dozens of Chinese military aircraft and vessels were operating around the island, with some “deliberately closing in” on Taiwan’s contiguous zone, defined as 24 nautical miles from its coast.Taiwan’s defence ministry said Chinese aircraft and ships had been detected operating around the island over the past 24 hours and that the military remained on high alert. “All members of our armed forces will remain highly vigilant and fully on guard, taking concrete action to defend the values of democracy and freedom,” the ministry said.Taiwan’s government condemned the exercises, while the defence ministry posted a video on Facebook showcasing weapons including US-made HIMARS rocket systems, which could strike coastal targets in China’s Fujian province in the event of a conflict.The coast guard said it had dispatched large vessels to respond to Chinese coast guard activity near Taiwan’s waters and was coordinating with the military to minimise disruption to shipping lanes and fishing areas. Taiwan’s aviation authority said China had designated a temporary danger zone in Taipei’s airspace for live-fire drills scheduled for Tuesday and that alternative flight routes were being assessed.The drills mark China’s sixth major round of war games around Taiwan since 2022 and come 11 days after the United States announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to the island. Beijing had protested the package and warned it would “take forceful measures” in response.Analysts say China’s exercises are increasingly blurring the line between routine training and preparations that could be used to mask an actual attack, reducing warning time for Taiwan and its allies.China’s state media said the drills would focus on sealing off key ports including Keelung in the north and Kaohsiung in the south. The PLA released posters depicting targets locked across the island, accompanied by slogans such as “Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions” and “Arrows of Justice: Control and Denial”.“Any foreign interference that touches the shield (of justice) shall perish!” one poster read. “Any separatist scoundrels who encounter the shield shall be destroyed!”The exercises follow rising tensions between Beijing and Tokyo after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could warrant a military response from Japan. Beijing summoned Japan’s ambassador and warned its citizens against travelling to the country.China claims Taiwan as part of its sovereign territory and has not ruled out using force to bring the self-governed island under its control. Taiwan rejects Beijing’s claims, insisting that only its people can decide the island’s future.“I think these drills are just meant to scare us,” said Lin Wei-ming, a 31-year-old teacher in Taipei. “Similar drills have happened before ... the political side of things can only be handled by Taiwan's current government and how they choose to respond.”Taiwan’s stock markets were largely unaffected by the drills, rising 0.8% to a record high in morning trading.","China launches large-scale live-fire military drills around taiwan.

NEW DELHI: From French and Israeli-origin missiles to 'Make in India' kamikaze drones and counter-drone systems as well as range extension of existing missiles and artillery rockets, the defence ministry on Monday gave the preliminary nod to a slew of military modernisation projects worth Rs 79,000 crore.The biggest project to get acceptance of necessity, first step in long-winded procurement process, from the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council was Rs 30,000 crore purchase of a large number of missiles for Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile system, jointly developed with Israel, for IAF and Navy, sources told TOI.These missiles, with an interception range of over 70km, were used as part of the multi-layered air defence network that thwarted the multiple waves of Turkish drones and Chinese missiles fired by Pakistan during the cross-border hostilities in May.The DAC also approved the Rs 1,600-crore lease of two more MQ-9B 'Predator' high-altitude long endurance drones, which will add to the existing two being operated by the Navy for long-range surveillance missions, for three years. They will fill the gap till India gets the 31 armed MQ-9B remotely-piloted aircraft systems in 2029-30 under the $3.8 billion deal with the US in Oct last year. Another major project to get the nod was the long-pending over Rs 9,000-crore acquisition of six mid-air refuelling aircraft for IAF to extend operational reach of its fighter jets.""Under it, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) will modify six second-hand Boeing 767 commercial planes into tankers. A fresh approval was required because the competition resulted in a single vendor situation,"" a source said.Two crucial home-grown design and development projects to get the AoN were for range extensions of the Astra Mark-2 air-to-air missiles and Pinaka guided rocket ammunition. The Pinaka multiple launch artillery systems currently fire multi-calibre rockets with a variety of warheads up to ranges of 75 km. ""Pinaka's deep strike lethal capability is now being increased to 120 km. It was tested successfully on Sunday. In the future, it will be extended to 300 km,"" a source said.DRDO is already working on enhancing the range of Astra missiles from the existing 100-km to 200-km. ""IAF will initially order 600-700 Astra-2 missiles. There will also be a 350-km Astra-3 in the future. Indigenous long range air-to-air missiles are crucial,"" another source said. ""DAC also approved some additional French Meteor air-to-air missiles (120 to 150-km range) for Rafale fighters as well as Israeli guidance kits for Spice-1000 precision-guided bombs (125-km),"" he added.AoN was also accorded for 850 kamikaze drones or loitering munitions for precision strikes for the Army's new 'Shaktibaan' and 'Divyastra' artillery batteries for around Rs 2,000 crore. ""They will be made in India either by domestic companies or with foreign collaboration,"" the source said. The indigenous integrated drone detection & interdiction system Mark-2 (IDD&IS) systems, with 30-kilowatt lasers to disable, degrade or destroy small remotely-piloted aircraft and swarm drones at ranges up to 3.5-km, also got the green light.The overhauls of Mi-17 helicopters in Russia and T-90S main-battle tanks in India were also approved. So was the acquisition of low-level light weight radars, bollard-pull naval tugs, full mission simulators for Tejas jets, automatic take-off landing recording systems for IAF, and high-frequency software defined radios for long-range secure communications.","The defence ministry on monday gave the preliminary nod to a slew of military modernisation projects worth rs 79,000 crore.

Spiritual leader Sadhguru on Monday said that the Siliguri corridor was an anomaly created by partition, which should have been corrected in 1971.He further said that today, as the nation faces a threat to its sovereignty, India must develop the chicken into an elephant, referring to extremist policies by the Bangladeshi regime.He said, ""Siliguri Corridor is a 78-year-old anomaly created by Bharat's partition, which should have been corrected in 1971.

Those who migrated after the cut-off date are considered illegal immigrants under Indian law.Meanwhile on December 27, amid the ongoing protests against the atrocities faced by the minorities in Bangladesh, the BJP workers on Friday held a torchlight rally in Siliguri.BJP leader Anita Mahato, who also participated in the rally, stated that until Hindus unite, such violent incidents will continue to occur.""We (BJP workers) held a torchlight rally against the way sanatani Hindus are being tortured in Bangladesh in Siliguri.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes

NEW DELHI: According to Sun Tzu's ‘The Art of War’, “all warfare is based on deception.”In the wake of the Pakistan conflict in May when the enemy forces attempted to target Indian military assets like air defence systems, including Russia-imported S400 Triumf missile system, with their missiles and drones, India’s elite R&D wing Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has transferred two key indigenous technologies to the Army that will help its soldiers and their military equipment evade enemy detection.Defence Laboratory, Jodhpur (DLJ), DRDO, handed over Camouflage Pattern Generation Software Sigma 4.0 (CPGSS4.0) and a full-scale Multispectral Signature Tank Mock-up to the Indian Army’s Corps of Military Engineering (CME) in Pune in the first week of December.“CPGSS4.0 was launched today (Dec 3) by Lt Gen A K Ramesh, SM, Comdt CME in the presence of V S Shenoi, Director, DLJ and will be available for use by tri-services,” DRDO recently posted on X.“A full scale multispectral signature tank mock-up will be use (sic) for training the service personnel in camouflaging and deception technology,” it stated.CPGS 4.0 is an advanced software developed to create highly effective, multi-spectral camouflage patterns for military equipment, helping soldiers blend into diverse terrains by countering detection across visible light, infrared (IR), and radar sensors, thereby significantly boosting battlefield deception and survival training for the Indian Army.Whereas a multispectral signature tank mock-up is a full-scale, realistic decoy of a battle tank, designed not just to look like a tank in visible light, but to mimic its physical and electromagnetic properties (heat, radar reflection) across various sensor spectrums, allowing soldiers to test and train with advanced camouflage materials to hide tanks from modern threats like thermal, infrared and radar detection.Developing multispectral deception capabilities is the need of the hour as traditional camouflage measures have become less effective in modern warfare.These advanced systems are designed to enhance the Army’s capabilities in camouflage and deception, which are key for survival on modern battlefields where surveillance and sensor technologies are fast advancing.The integration of sophisticated software with a realistic mock-up helps tackle challenges posed by modern detection systems, including thermal imaging, UAV reconnaissance and radar technologies.With the introduction of these technologies, the Army now has the capacity to indulge in concealment methods more effectively, thereby enhancing operational survivability.","Defence laboratory, jodhpur(dlj), drdo handed over camouflage pattern generation software sigma 4.0 (cpgss4.0) and a full-scale multispectral signature tank mock-up.

‘Hindu Lives Matter’: Protest Outside Bangladesh High Commission In London Over Minority Killings

BSF dismisses Bangladesh claim, says no proof of any fugitive crossing the border into India

DHAKA/SHILLONG: Bangladesh claimed on Sunday that the two prime suspects in the murder of radical Inqilab Moncho leader Sharif Osman Hadi had found sanctuary in neighbouring Meghalaya, inviting instant rebuttals from Indian security agencies about what they said were ""fabricated and malicious"" statements suggesting lapses in BSF's border vigil.""Suspects Faisal Karim Masud and Alamgir Sheikh crossed into the Indian state of Meghalaya with the help of local associates,"" Dhaka Metropolitan Police's additional police commissioner (crime and operations) S N Md Nazrul Islam said at a presser. ""According to our information, the suspects entered India via the Haluaghat border.""Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s additional police commissioner (crime and operations) S N Md Nazrul Islam said his department had received “informal reports” about two men identified as “Purti and Sami” being detained in India for assisting the fugitives.BSF inspector general (Meghalaya frontier) Om Prakash Upadhyay said in Shillong that “there is no evidence to suggest any individual crossed the international border from the Haluaghat sector into Meghalaya” from Mymensingh in Bangladesh. “BSF has neither detected nor received any report of such an incident,” PTI quoted Upadhyay as saying. He said the international border was under constant surveillance & any attempt at illegal cross-border movement would be promptly detected and dealt with.Meghalaya DGP Idashisha Nongrang, too, issued a statement contradicting the Dhaka police officer’s claim about two alleged collaborators of the fugitives being detained in West Garo Hills. She said reports emerging from Bangladesh about the whereabouts of the killers of 32-year-old Hadi, whose shooting on December 12 plunged the country into another cycle of violent unrest, were “unfounded”.Bangladeshi media quoted Islam as alleging that local contacts helped the fugitives travel by taxi to Tura, the headquarters of West Garo Hills district. He insisted the Bangladesh govt was “actively working” to bring the suspects back. “We are maintaining communication with Indian authorities through both formal and informal channels to ensure their arrest and extradition,” Islam said.The unsubstantiated claims come in the wake of Inqilab Moncho’s 30-day ultimatum to the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt to arrest his killers.The countdown started on December 19, a day after Hadi died in a Singapore hospital of bullet injuries to the head. Hadi was among those who led the July-Aug 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh that led to Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League govt being toppled.He was a candidate for the upcoming February 12 parliamentary elections and was shot while campaigning in Dhaka. Hadi’s brother Omar recently accused some within the interim govt of orchestrating the killing to derail the polls.","Bsf dismisses bangladesh claim, says no proof of any fugitive crossing the border into india.

Dwight Howard calls on President Donald Trump to enforce mandatory measure for all U.S. citizens



Dwight Howard responds to talk of NBA comeback



Dwight Howard has made a request to President Donald Trump that sparked a huge conversation online. The newly inducted Hall of Famer used his platform to float a nationwide policy idea aimed at civic service, just a day after his response that reignited speculation about a possible NBA comeback.The former No. 1 overall pick has largely stayed away from political discourse since stepping out of the NBA spotlight. Hours later, Howard was back in familiar territory, responding to a fan who suggested one more run on an NBA floor. Howard has been active on social media, especially on X. His posts often spark conversation, be it anything regarding basketball, his personal opinion, or his personal life.Dwight Howard took to X on Sunday night with an idea he said came to him organically. He called on President Donald Trump to mandate one year of service for every person born in the United States. In his view, the policy could strengthen discipline and structure across society.He wrote: “Random. I honestly feel like the president should make one year of service mandatory for everyone born in America. A lot of other countries do it. And I think it would help with discipline and structure. I’m curious what y’all think would this help America or nah.”Howard later clarified that he believes military service would be the most effective option. “I think military service would be better. Learn how to defend yourself. Shoot and handle guns properly. The bond and respect for each other would go up.”The post triggered mixed responses, including questions about Howard’s own experience. When pressed, he shared an image of himself in military gear, later explaining it was from a reality show. He responded to criticism by saying, “We got set on fire, tear-gassed, had to do every single thing that people in special forces do only supporting my case that people should get the necessary training.”Just prior to his post for Trump on X going viral, Howard also addressed basketball chatter that has followed him since his final NBA season in 2022. A fan suggested teams sign him to a short-term deal so he could move up the NBA’s all-time rebounding list. Howard replied with a simple message: “That would be fire.”Howard finished his NBA career with 14,627 rebounds, placing him tenth all-time. He trails Kevin Garnett by 35 boards. His career includes eight All-Star selections, three Defensive Player of the Year awards, an NBA title with the Lakers, and a Hall of Fame induction in 2025.Howard has played overseas and in the Big3 since leaving the league.Also Read: Inside Vanessa Bryant’s daughter Natalia Bryant’s glamorous life: Career, education, and more","Dwight howard called on president donald trump to mandate one year of service for every person born in the united states.

On an episode of The Tim Dillon Show, Dillon said many people feel confused by how Erika Kirk has been showing up in public after reports surrounding her husband, Charlie Kirk , circulated online.

He said:“Erika Kirk, God bless, tragic. I am sorry for what happened, but nobody knows why she’s out there in a glittering pant suit in a recreated tent that her husband tragically was murdered in throwing merch out.

The appearance came weeks after Minaj publicly voiced support for Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.On stage, Minaj praised both leaders and made a slip of the tongue while speaking about Vance.

Zo Caswell keeps the focus on Dillon Gabriel, not the Browns’ QB shuffle

From custom game-day fits to engagement plans, Zo Caswell shows up consistently

Dillon Gabriel turned 25 on Dec. 28, and the moment did not pass quietly. His fiancée, Zo Caswell, marked the day with a public message that landed straight in the middle of NFL social media.Caswell shared a beach photo of the couple on Instagram, both dressed in white, locked in a kiss. The caption was short and direct. No branding. No long caption. Just the point.“Happy birthday to the love of my life!! Can’t imagine doing life without you.”The timing mattered. Gabriel’s birthday came during a turbulent stretch for the Cleveland Browns quarterback room. Gabriel, drafted in the third round with the No. 94 pick out of the Oregon Ducks, opened the season as part of the rotation. He later took over after Joe Flacco, then suffered a concussion that ended his year. He finished 1-5 as a starter.Rookie Shedeur Sanders eventually took over as QB1. Cleveland entered Week 17 with four wins and sat fourth in the AFC North. The Browns beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 13-6, their fourth victory of the season, but the bigger picture stayed unchanged.The year never stabilized.Caswell did not address depth charts, injuries, or roles. She didn’t need to. Her post stayed personal and narrow. It framed Gabriel as her partner first, quarterback second. That distinction mattered given the noise around Cleveland’s quarterback decisions.Caswell’s birthday post followed another recent moment that caught attention. She attended Cleveland’s Week 17 game and shared a mirror selfie on Instagram with a single-word caption. “Gameday.”She wore a white long-sleeve top and blue pants customized with Gabriel’s name and No. 8. The message was not subtle. It was support, spelled out in fabric. Cleveland won that afternoon, though the season remained difficult.The couple’s timeline is long and documented. They have been together since high school. When Gabriel transferred to Oklahoma in 2022, Caswell moved with him. She stayed through his college stops and into the NFL transition. Gabriel proposed on Sept. 1 last year in Eugene, Ore., by the river on the day of his debut with Oregon. They plan to marry in the summer of 2026.At a moment when Gabriel’s on-field future remains uncertain, Caswell’s public support has stayed steady. In the middle of a messy season, that clarity stood out.","Cleveland browns quarterback dillon gabriel turned 25 on dec. 28.

'Very angry': Trump on alleged Ukrainian drone attack on Putin's residence; Zelenskyy calls it 'lies',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-attacked-vladimir-putins-residence-russias-big-charge-against-kyiv/articleshow/126235219.cms,"Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Vladimir Putin (AP)

'Very angry': Donald Trump on 'drone attack'





Russia on Monday claimed that Ukraine fired drones at Vladimir Putin's residence between Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Reuters reported citing foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.Lavrov added that the Kremlin would ""revise"" its negotiating position on ending the Ukraine war after the ""terrorist attack"". Lavrov further said that Russia had chosen targets in Ukraine for ""retaliation strikes"" and that Moscow's ""negotiating position will be revised"". As per the report, Lavrov said that Ukraine targeted the Russian president’s state residence in the Novgorod region on December 28–29, with 91 long-range drones, all of which were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defences.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed the accusation as ""lies"", saying Moscow was laying the groundwork for attacks on government buildings in Kyiv.""This alleged 'residence strike' story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies. Furthermore, the Russians have already targeted Kyiv in the past, including the Cabinet of Ministers building,"" he said.""Ukraine does not take steps that can undermine diplomacy. To the contrary, Russia always takes such steps. This is one of many differences between us. It is critical that the world doesn’t stay silent now. We cannot allow Russia to undermine the work on achieving a lasting peace,"" he added.This comes after Putin claimed that Russia was making progress in its plans of ""liberating the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions"".""The goal of liberating the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions is being carried out in stages, in accordance with the plan of the special military operation ... The troops are confidently advancing,"" AFP quoted Putin saying.Zelenskyy said that Russia’s attacks on Ukraine and Putin’s messaging to the domestic audience contradicted the “peaceful rhetoric” he has used in conversations with US leader Donald Trump.""On the one hand, he tells the president of the United States that he wants to end the war and that this is his desire,"" Zelenskyy said.""And on the other hand, he openly communicates in the media all his messages about being ready and wanting to continue the war -- he strikes us with missiles, openly talks about it, celebrates the destruction of civilian infrastructure, gives instructions to his generals about where to advance and what to seize, and so on,"" he added.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump criticised the alleged Ukrainian drone attack, saying he was informed by Putin during their conversation regarding Ukraine, which the White House described as a ""positive"" one.""President Trump has concluded a positive call with President Putin concerning Ukraine,"" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X.""You know who told me about it? President Putin, early in the morning, he said he was attacked. It's no good. I'm very angry,"" Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, according to AFP.""It's a delicate period of time. This is not the right time. It's one thing to be offensive because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that,"" he added.","Russia claims that ukraine fired 91 long-range drones at vladimir putin's residence between moscow and saint petersburg.
