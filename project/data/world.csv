NEW DELHI: Congress Saturday condemned the attacks launched on Iran by the US and Israel, and called upon Indian govt to help bring the hostilities to an “immediate end” and ensure the safety of all Indians in West Asia.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said, “For weeks President Trump maintained the charade of diplomacy and negotiations with Iran. Egged on by the Israeli PM Mr Netanyahu and hawks in the US, he has launched a military offensive aimed at achieving regime change.” Ramesh said Congress “condemns this attack” and “calls upon the govt to help bring the hostilities to an end.”MP Rahul Gandhi said, “The rapidly escalating hostilities between US-Israel and Iran are concerning.“The safety and security of every Indian citizen across the Middle East must be our highest priority.”Meanwhile, Congress termed PM Modi’s visit to Israel “shameful” and “ill-timed,” saying it creates perception of a political endorsement of military escalation.

India, as part of the northern hemisphere, follows this guidance each year to decide which strains are covered in the flu shot.The new strain appears to spread more easily than the earlier versions. While it is not necessarily more severe for each infected person, its higher transmissibility has led to increased case numbers and earlier-than-usual flu activity in many regions.“The updated recommendations are timely, given the rapid global spread of the new variant,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine at Max Hospital, Saket. “H3N2 strains are often linked to more severe illness, especially in the elderly and those with medical conditions. Since influenza viruses keep changing, updating the vaccine each year is critical. High-risk groups’ early vaccination can reduce complications and hospital admissions.WHO has recommended updated components for H1N1, H3N2 and B/Victoria strains.

AJMER: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday sharpened his election-season attack on Congress , accusing it of divisive politics over its youth wing's 'shirtless protest' at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi.Addressing a rally in Ajmer, Modi said Congress leaves no ""opportunity to malign India"", charging that it had abandoned national interest. ""Kabhi Congress INC yaani Indian National Congress thi... aaj wo INC ke bajay MMC ban gayi hai (INC no longer exists in that form. Today, it has become MMC - Muslim League Maoist Congress),"" he said.""History is witness that Muslim League hated India and divided the nation.

""Defaming the country and weakening the armed forces has been an old habit of the party.

NEW DELHI: Airlines that fly to, from, and through the regions impacted by the US-Israeli strikes against Iran are now steering clear of the same and trying to find ways to evacuate their crew from there. Going ahead, flights between the west and India, among other places in the east, will now get longer and fuelling stops are likely for North America routes.When the combat operation in Iran began, hundreds of commercial flights were either overflying or just about to enter the impacted airspaces from Iran to Israel. Among them was Air India ’s Delhi-Tel Aviv flight (AI 139) which was in Saudi airspace at that time. The airline asked the pilots to turn back & head to Mumbai.AI’s Chicago-Delhi flight (AI 126) was about to enter Iraq airspace and it instead turned towards Syria to take a longer route home. AI is now working to evacuate its crew from Tel Aviv.“AI139 operating from Delhi to Tel Aviv on Feb 28 is air returning to Mumbai due to closure of air space in Israel and in the interest of safety of passengers and crew. Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers due to this unforeseen situation and remains committed to maintaining the highest standards of safety.We will continue to assess the safety and security environment for our flight operations and adjust operations proactively as needed,” an Air India spokesperson said.People in the know say AI had stopped overflying Iraq on its night flights to and from Europe from Friday night itself. The US flights used to overfly Iraq during the day and now that is stopped too. AI’s North America flights could now take a fuelling halt in Vienna or Rome. IndiGo is also working on the impact on its flights.Airlines have also warned their crew of intensified GPS spoofing and jamming in the conflict areas.For Indian carriers, the entire airspace to the west from Pakistan till Iraq is a no-go area which will impact all the flights to and from Europe, UK and North America.

India walks tightrope amid Iran conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-walks-tightrope-amid-iran-conflict/articleshow/128897313.cms,"'Moral Cowardice': PM Modi's Israel Visit Faces Oppn Heat As US-Israel Launch Strikes On Iran

NEW DELHI: India is deeply concerned over the recent developments in Iran and the Gulf region, govt said Saturday, hours after US-Israel joint military action against Iran and the latter’s retaliatory targeting of Gulf states where Washington has military assets. While seeking safety of civilians in a region that is home to a nearly 10-million-strong Indian diaspora, the govt also stressed in its tough balancing act that sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states must be protected.External affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke to his Iranian and Israeli counterparts, Seyed Abbas Araghchi and Gideon Sa’ar, respectively, to express deep concern and to reiterate India’s call for dialogue and diplomacy to de-escalate tensions.Late in the evening, Jaishankar also spoke to his counterparts from the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain and sought their cooperation in ensuring the well-being of the Indian community.India’s response in the form of a statement by the ministry of external affairs was carefully calibrated as it said that dialogue and diplomacy should be pursued to de-escalate tensions and address underlying issues. “We urge all sides to exercise restraint, avoid escalation and prioritise the safety of civilians,” said MEA, adding that Indian missions across the Gulf were in touch with Indian nationals and had issued appropriate advisories asking them to remain vigilant and follow local security guidance.There are close to 40,000 Indian citizens in Israel and anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 in Iran.With the US and Israel reportedly looking to precipitate a regime change in Iran, India was again forced to walk a diplomatic tightrope, caught between its steady ties with Iran that are based on common regional interests and strong signs of improvement in the critical relationship with the US after a period of extreme turbulence.The attack on Iran also came barely 48 hours after a bilateral meeting between PM Narendra Modi and his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel that saw the leaders discussing US-Iran tensions and Modi offering, if required, India’s support for any efforts towards a peaceful resolution. Significantly, in his media remarks during the visit which took place amidst mounting US-Iran friction, Modi said that peace and security in West Asia is directly linked to India’s security interests.The Gulf region is also one of India’s most significant and reliable sources of oil and gas. The diaspora, whose well-being is a major priority for the govt, is one of the largest sources of remittances for India. The GCC countries — Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates — are together also India’s largest trading partner bloc.While India has deepened its strategic partnership with Israel in the past decade or so, its ties with Gulf states have also undergone a complete transformation during this period. India, in fact, now has a strategic partnership with five out of the six GCC countries, moving from the traditional energy buyer-seller relationship to other domains like defence and security, investment, connectivity and tech.India will be worried about the likely impact of a full-blown regional war on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) project that has already been delayed by the instability in West Asia. During his visit to Israel, Modi had said that both countries will move forward with renewed momentum on initiatives like IMEEC and India–Israel–UAE–USA (I2U2) to promote regional connectivity.For India, Iran remains a key regional partner, one that New Delhi has not given up on despite President Donald Trump’s restoring a maximum pressure campaign against Iran. In Jan this year, India joined China, Pakistan and four other countries in voting against a UN Human Rights Council resolution that strongly deplored the crackdown on protests in Iran and extended the mandate of a fact-finding mission for the country.According to Indian authorities, it is in India’s interests to maintain a functional relationship with Iran, not least because of the strategic Chabahar port in the country that India has helped develop for access to Central Asia and Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan – though the US muddied the picture last year with its decision to revoke a sanctions waiver for the port that is expected to come into effect in late April.","India is deeply concerned over the recent developments in iran and the gulf region, govt said saturday.

India closely monitoring Af-Pak escalation; backs Taliban but wary of full-blown conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amidst-afghanistan-pakistan-escalation-india-keeps-a-close-watch/articleshow/128869368.cms,"Pakistan Army Blames India Again For 'Open War' Against Afghanistan, Calls Taliban Delhi’s Proxy

India was closely monitoring the situation as Afghanistan and Pakistan seemed poised for a dangerous escalation, with Islamabad declaring that the two countries were in an “open war” following Pakistan’s airstrikes on “terrorist hideouts” in Afghanistan and the latter’s retaliatory action. Unconfirmed reports said that senior Taliban leaders were killed in Pakistan’s latest air assaults on Kabul but the Indian side could not independently verify such claims.The relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan has unravelled dramatically in the past few years, after the initial euphoria in Islamabad over the return of the Taliban in 2021. Pakistan has blamed Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) or Pakistan Taliban for terrorist attacks on its soil and on several occasions launched targeted strikes against TTP or its splinter groups’ alleged hideouts in Afghanistan.According to Islamabad, Baloch insurgents also find sanctuary in Afghanistan. Kabul has mostly responded with what it calls necessary and measured military action.On this occasion though, Pakistan has directly targeted the not just terrorist infrastructure but also Afghanistan military facilities in Kabul and other cities. What happens next, and if there’s a full-blown war or not, will likely depend on whether the Taliban are prepared to go further up the ladder of escalation.India’s own ties with the Taliban have seen a stunning turnaround during this period, initially on the back of its large-scale humanitarian assistance to Kabul and now the commitment to fulfil the development needs of the Afghan people, circumventing the lack of international recognition for the regime. India’s response so far to the Pakistan-Afghanistan crisis so far has been a manifestation of this new reality that Islamabad must contend with.India has continued to maintain that Pakistan’s cross-border adventurism resulting in civilian casualties is nothing but a ploy to deflect attention from its domestic failures. The Indian government called Pakistan’s airstrikes earlier this week an attempt to externalise its internal failures. India also strongly backs Afghanistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. The Taliban reciprocated suitably to these gestures as they endorsed, much to Pakistan’s chagrin, a mention of J&K as a part of India in a joint statement issued after Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s unprecedented visit to India last year in October. The Taliban have also dismissed Islamabad’s claims that India is using Afghanistan and its alleged links with the TTP to target Pakistan.However, while an antagonistic relationship between the two countries allays fears about Pakistan’s longstanding policy of using Afghanistan for strategic depth, a major military escalation that would imperil regional stability is more than what India would bargain for. In fact, it would come at the least opportune time for India as the government, after a period of relative peace, looks to resume its development work in the country including through the launch of new projects.Following Muttaqi’s visit, and based on assurances from the Taliban that Afghanistan will not allow its soil to be used for anti-India activities, India restored its embassy in Kabul to further augment its development, humanitarian and capacity-building initiatives for the Afghan people. India has undertaken several projects in Kabul and other areas, including construction of hospitals and trauma centres while also looking to expand trade and investment ties with Afghanistan.Importantly, India is considering an offer from the Taliban to invest in the mining sector, something which China is already actively pursuing. India is also looking to work with Afghanistan on hydroelectric projects to fulfil the local energy needs. For India, this is the time to reap the benefits of a strong working relationship it has built with the Taliban and a regional war, or its possible spillover effects like a humanitarian or refugee crisis, will likely stymie India’s nascent but expanding footprint in a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.",India was closely monitoring the situation as afghanistan and pakistan seemed poised for a dangerous escalation.

Donald Trump Praises Sharif, Munir Amid Af-Pak War, Afghanistan Blasts Pakistan For Blaming India

.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Jairam Ramesh on Saturday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi after US President Donald Trump praised Pakistan ’s leadership amid the ongoing conflict between Islamabad and the Taliban Reacting to Trump’s remarks praising Pakistan’s leadership, Ramesh took to X to express his disapproval.He wrote, “President Trump’s full-throated and categorical support for Pakistan in its war with Afghanistan is another setback for Indian 'huglomacy.' He has once again gone out of his way to praise the man whose inflammatory remarks provided the backdrop to the terrorist attacks in Pahalgam on April 22nd, 2025 that were orchestrated by Pakistan.”Ramesh also pointed to economic concerns arising from India-US trade engagements.“Our economic diplomacy with the US has failed badly, as evinced by Mr. Modi suddenly surrendering to a clearly one-sided trade deal in which India has made firm pledges especially to import from American farmers, while the US has made vague commitments to allow for greater exports from India. Not only that, days after the agreement, the US imposed a 125.87% import duty on solar modules from India,” he wrote.On strategic diplomacy, Congress leader added, “Our strategic diplomacy has received repeated blows by President Trump repeatedly cozying up to the Pakistani establishment and reverting to the hyphenation of India and Pakistan. The Prime Minister may, through his means, manage to get awards. But the fact is that the self-declared Vishwaguru has been exposed and the world, especially the US, has got his measure. ”The remarks come after Trump praised Pakistan’s Chief of Defence Forces, Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif amid Islamabad’s ongoing conflict with the Taliban.At a White House briefing, Trump said, “Well, I would [intervene], but I get along with Pakistan, as you know, very well. Very, very well. You have a great prime minister, you have a great general there, you have a great leader. I think two of the people that I really respect a lot. I think Pakistan is doing terrifically well.”Following Trump’s comments, US Under Secretary of State Allison Hooker also expressed Washington’s backing for Islamabad.She wrote on X, “Spoke today with Pakistan Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch to express condolences for lives lost in the recent conflict between Pakistan and the Taliban. We continue to monitor the situation closely and expressed support for Pakistan’s right to defend itself against Taliban attacks.”The escalation comes after Pakistan carried out airstrikes on Afghan cities this week, marking its most significant military action since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Subsequent Taliban retaliation triggered further Pakistani strikes, with defence minister Khawaja Asif declaring that Pakistan was now in an “open war” with Afghanistan.While countries like the UK have urged de-escalation, China called for a ceasefire and Iran offered to mediate, India has maintained a close watch over developments. The New Delhi government has repeatedly denied any US role in facilitating ceasefires between India and Pakistan, attributing progress to direct bilateral talks.","Congress mp jairam ramesh criticised prime minister narendra modi after us president donald trump praised pakistan’s leadership amid the ongoing conflict between islamabad and the taliban.

Jairam Ramesh Questions Modi Govt On US Trade Deal, Tariffs And Russia Oil Claims

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Saturday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s recent visit to Israel after Israel and the United States launched a joint military strike on Iran.In a post on X, Ramesh said, “Two days after Mr. Modi celebrated his visit to Israel, Israel and the US have begun their joint assault on Iran. This was fully expected given their military build-up in the last few months. Mr. Modi nevertheless chose to go to Israel, where he displayed the highest moral cowardice. He declared that India stood with Israel and got himself an award for saying so. This Israel visit was shameful, and it is even more so in light of the war that has been launched by two of Mr.Modi's ‘good friends’.”Israel and the United States launched a joint military strike on Iran on Saturday, codenamed Operation Roaring Lion. The strikes targeted military sites, missile production facilities and areas near the office of Iran’s supreme leader Khamenei.Several ministries in southern Tehran were reportedly struck, and residents heard powerful blasts. Israel declared a nationwide state of emergency, moved hospitals underground and activated sirens.Iran, Israel and Iraq closed their airspace and suspended flights.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had concluded his visit to Israel on Thursday. During the visit, India and Israel agreed to elevate their relationship to a special strategic partnership. The two sides signed 27 agreements in areas including innovation, cultural exchange, manufacturing and artificial intelligence.PM Modi and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed cooperation in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, economic and security collaboration. The prime minister also said that India and Israel would soon finalise a mutually beneficial free trade agreement and announced a critical and emerging technology partnership.","Congress leader jairam ramesh criticised prime minister narendra modi’s recent visit to israel after israel and the united states launched a joint military strike on iran.

India, in fact, now has a strategic partnership with 5 out of the 6 GCC countries, moving from the traditional energy buyer-seller relationship to other domains like defence and security, investment, connectivity and technology.India will be worried about the likely impact of a full-blown regional war on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) project that has already been delayed by the instability in West Asia. During his visit to Israel, Modi had said both countries will move forward with renewed momentum on initiatives like IMEEC and India–Israel–UAE–USA (I2U2) to promote regional connectivity.For India, however, Iran remains a key regional partner, one that New Delhi has not given up on despite President Donald Trump restoring a maximum pressure campaign against Iran. In January this year, India joined China, Pakistan and 4 other countries in voting against a UN Human Rights Council resolution that strongly deplored the crackdown on protests in Iran and extended the mandate of a fact-finding mission for the country.According to Indian authorities, India’s interest lies in maintaining a functional relationship with Iran, not least because of the strategic Chabahar port in the country that India has helped develop for access to Central Asia and Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan. The US muddied the picture though last year with its decision to revoke a sanctions waiver for the port that is expected to come into effect in late April.","India is deeply concerned at the recent developments in iran and the gulf region, said the government hours after the us-israel joint action against iran.

From Epstein Files to Trade Deal, Rahul Gandhi Launches All-Out Attack on PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the timing of the Indo-US interim trade deal.Addressing the Mazdoor Kissan Maha Rally in Barnala, Punjab, Rahul said the deal had been stalled for four months due to disagreements over opening the agriculture sector.“So the question arises, the work which PM did not do for four months, why did he do it within 15 minutes?” he asked. “What was the pressure that the prime minister of India signed a death warrant for our country there. He signed a death warrant for our farmers. He gave away our data. He signed a death warrant for our small and medium industries,” he alleged.Rahul further said that the prime minister gave a guarantee to US president Donald Trump that India would buy US products worth Rs 9 lakh crore every year.He said opening the agricultural sector would allow American goods to enter the Indian market and harm farmers in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Odisha.“Narendra Modi has opened the door of the agricultural sector. American goods will flow in, and our farmers will be ruined,” he said. “No prime minister of India, whether from the Congress Party, the BJP, or any other party, can open the agricultural sector.No prime minister can.”Rahul further claimed he was not allowed to speak in the Lok Sabha after the president’s address because he wanted to refer to an unpublished book by former army chief general Manoj Naravane (retd). He alleged that the memoir described a lack of response from the political leadership during Chinese troop movements near the border.“Only the prime minister of the country can give the order to fire upon the Chinese army. Neither the army chief nor the defence minister can give it. Naravane ji asked the prime minister whether we can fire and stop them. There was no response for 2 hours. After that, Naravane ji gets the order to do whatever he deems appropriate,” he said.","Congress leader rahul gandhi questioned prime minister narendra modi over the timing of the indo-us interim trade deal.

Regulations must sync with other countries, says SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has said constitutional courts must be careful in exercising judicial review of laws so as not to create an anti-investment atmosphere and should weigh national interest against hypothetical fears about legislation.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi made these oral observations on Friday during preliminary hearing on a PIL by E A S Sarma, whose counsel Prashant Bhushan faulted the liability fastened on private players operating nuclear power plants under the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancing of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Act passed by Parliament in Dec. Bhushan said the private players' liability is capped at 3,000 crore even though a nuclear plant accident could cause damage running into lakhs of crores of rupees and cited the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters. The govt has allowed private players in the nuclear sector but absolves them of strict civil liability clauses, he said, adding that the govt's liability is also capped at 4,500 crore.CJI Kant said, ""There must be an atmosphere in the country where investors feel encouraged to invest.""CJI Kant said, ""Today, coal-based power plants are not encouraged. We cannot do without nuclear energy. So, there must be a balance in the approach - national interest vs hypothetical fears.""""We should not create an atmosphere where people will fear to invest in India because courts here interfere in everything. The litigation drags on and the projects become unviable despite huge investments.""Justice Bagchi said, ""These are policy decisions - what should be our energy basket. Whether the policy suffers bias or is unconstitutional could be determined on scrutiny.""""Show us the regulatory framework on civil liability in countries like the USA, Europe and Japan. When electricity is traded across borders, the regulatory framework in India must be compatible with those in other countries,"" he said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal attempted to interject in support of Bhushan, but the bench stopped him saying ""let Bhushan assist us.""

The Middle East is facing one of its most volatile moments in decades after US President Donald Trump announced that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had been killed in a joint US-Israel strike on Tehran.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “Khamenei, one of the most evil people in History, is dead.” He claimed the cleric was tracked using “Highly Sophisticated Tracking Systems” and described the assassination as “the single greatest chance for the Iranian people to take back their Country.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there were “many signs” that the 86-year-old leader was “no more”.Iran has not formally confirmed his death. However, senior official Ali Larijani warned that the United States and Israel would “regret their actions”, vowing an “unforgettable lesson” from Iran’s armed forces.Within hours, missiles and drones were launched at Israel and at US military bases across the Gulf.The Fars News Agency, which is affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has reported that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s daughter, son-in-law and grandchild were killed in the attacks, citing “informed sources” in the Supreme Leader’s office. Fars also said that one of Khamenei’s daughters-in-law is believed to have been killed in the strikes.Earlier reports had circulated claiming the deaths of his daughter-in-law and son-in-law, but those accounts were later denied.The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is pressing for the rapid appointment of a new leader of the Islamic Republic following the death of Ali Khamenei, sources familiar with the matter have told Iran International. Speaking anonymously, they said the remaining IRGC command aims to finalise the decision within hours, by dawn on Sunday, 1 March. With airstrikes continuing, it is reportedly impossible to convene the Assembly of Experts, the constitutional body tasked with selecting the Supreme Leader. The IRGC is therefore seeking to proceed outside formal procedures. Meanwhile, confusion is said to be growing within Iran’s security apparatus, with parts of the chain of command disrupted.Strikes began around 09:30 Tehran time, with explosions reported near Khamenei’s heavily guarded Leadership House compound. Satellite imagery showed blackened buildings and debris within a kilometre of the site. Israeli officials later said the compound had been destroyed in what they described as a “powerful, surprise strike”.Trump confirmed US participation, saying the operation aimed to eliminate “imminent threats” from the Iranian regime. The attack reportedly formed part of a months-long joint operational plan between Washington and Jerusalem. If confirmed, Khamenei’s death would mark the first killing of a sitting Iranian supreme leader and the most direct US intervention in Iran’s leadership structure since 1979.Khamenei had ruled since 1989, succeeding Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Over nearly four decades, he consolidated power over the clerical establishment, judiciary and armed forces.There is no publicly confirmed successor. Constitutionally, a panel of clerics selects the next supreme leader, but analysts warn that in wartime, power could shift to a temporary council or to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The absence of a clear transition plan risks internal rivalries. With tensions at boiling point, even minor factional splits could destabilise the political system that Khamenei spent decades fortifying.Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it had launched “Operation Truthful Promise 4”, targeting Israel and five major US facilities in Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and the UAE.Missiles and Shahed drones were fired in waves. In Israel, around 150 ballistic missiles were reportedly launched. Many were intercepted, though some struck open areas. Iran described the attacks as a proportionate response to what it called an “illegal and illegitimate” act of aggression.The headquarters of the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, Al Udeid airbase in Qatar and Ali Al Salem airbase in Kuwait were among sites reportedly targeted. US Central Command said forces had defended against “hundreds” of incoming missiles and drones.Washington reported no fatalities and only minimal damage. However, footage showed explosions near strategic installations, underlining vulnerabilities. The US has roughly 30,000–40,000 troops across about 13 bases in the region. Even with Patriot and THAAD air defence systems deployed, experts say defences cannot guarantee complete protection against mass drone and missile salvos.Iranian state media said at least 201 people were killed and more than 700 injured in the initial strikes across 24 provinces. Among the dead were reportedly dozens of schoolgirls in Hormozgan province, though independent verification remains limited.In the Gulf, falling debris and drone strikes injured civilians in Kuwait and the UAE. A luxury hotel in Dubai caught fire following an explosion nearby. Regional governments condemned the attacks as violations of sovereignty, even as they confirmed intercepting incoming projectiles.Trump went beyond military objectives, openly urging Iranians to overthrow their government. “When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take,” he said in a video address.He offered Iranian armed forces “complete immunity” if they laid down weapons, warning others would face “certain death”. The rhetoric signals that Washington sees strategic opportunity in Khamenei’s removal. Critics argue such language risks inflaming nationalist sentiment inside Iran and uniting factions that might otherwise compete for power.The strike came days after a failed round of nuclear negotiations. Trump had warned that military action would follow if Iran refused stricter limits on uranium enrichment.Iran insists its programme is peaceful. However, US officials say intelligence indicated Tehran had developed advanced centrifuge capabilities. Previous US and Israeli attacks last year damaged nuclear infrastructure but did not fully dismantle it. Saturday’s operation appears aimed at preventing further progress while also reshaping Iran’s political leadership.The Strait of Hormuz, through which roughly a fifth of global oil shipments pass, remains a flashpoint. Iranian forces reportedly warned vessels that no ships should transit the waterway.Airlines suspended flights across the Gulf, and several countries partially closed their airspace. Markets reacted nervously amid fears of prolonged disruption. Any sustained closure of Hormuz would send energy prices soaring and strain global supply chains.","Khamenei’s daughter, son-in-law and grandchild killed in attacks.

Strategic importance of Dubai airport and safety imperatives





Dubai International Airport (DXB), one of the world’s busiest travel hubs, was rocked by an incident early on March 1, 2026, that resulted in minor damage to a concourse and four people being injured, Dubai Airports has confirmed. Emergency response teams were quickly deployed, and authorities stressed the situation was contained rapidly, with most terminals largely cleared of passengers due to contingency measures already in place.In an official statement posted by Dubai’s media office, officials said the incident caused minor structural damage at DXB and that those hurt, identified as airport staff, received urgent medical care.The airport reassured the public that further updates would be issued as more information becomes available.While the exact cause of the incident has not been formally detailed in the initial reports, multiple global news outlets and aviation sources link it directly to broader regional hostilities involving retaliatory actions by Iran following strikes by the United States and Israel. According to witnesses and media reports, Dubai International sustained minor damage during overnight Iranian attacks, which included the firing of missiles at key Gulf aviation gateways, including DXB and Zayed International Airport.The ongoing conflict prompted a near-grounding of civil aviation in the region where airlines have suspended flights, airspace closures were implemented and many hubs remain temporarily inaccessible or operating under strict restrictions as safety assessments continue.Eyewitness accounts and social media posts show smoke and debris near sections of the airport following the incident, with travellers and staff rapidly evacuating terminal areas.
