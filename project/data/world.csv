NEW DELHI: European Council President Antonio Costa on Tuesday said he was “very proud” of his ancestral roots in Goa and described the connection between Europe and India as “something personal to me”, as New Delhi and the European Union announced the conclusion of an ambitious free trade agreement (FTA), described as the “mother of all deals. ”“Today is a historic moment. We are opening a new chapter in our relations – on trade, on security, on people-to-people ties,” Costa said at a press conference at the Hyderabad House in the presence of PM Modi and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen following the India–EU summit talksDuring his remarks, Costa highlighted his personal connection with India, saying he was “also an overseas Indian citizen,” and pulled out his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card from his suit pocket and showed it to the gathering.“Also because we conclude today our trade negotiations, we relaunched at the Leaders' meeting that I had the pleasure to host, in May 2021, in my previous capacity. Our summit sends a clear message to the world: at a time when the global order is being fundamentally reshaped, the European Union and India stand together as strategic and reliable partners,” Costa said.“Today, we are taking our partnership to the next level,” he added.“I am the President of the European Council, but I am also an overseas Indian citizen. Then, as you can imagine, for me, it has a special meaning. I am very proud of my roots in Goa, where my father's family came from. And, the connection between Europe and India is something personal to me,” he said.In line with their vision for a rules-based global order, India and the 27-nation EU bloc also rolled out a joint comprehensive strategic agenda for the next five years and finalised 13 agreements, including one related to the conclusion of FTA negotiations.The OCI scheme, meant for persons of Indian origin who are foreign nationals, was introduced through an amendment to the Citizenship Act, 1955, in August 2005. A registered OCI holder is granted a multiple-entry, multi-purpose, lifelong visa to visit India, though the status does not provide political rights, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.Goa was a Portuguese territory for several centuries before it was liberated from colonial rule on December 19, 1961. Costa was born in Lisbon, Portugal, on July 17, 1961, nearly five months before Goa’s liberation.Earlier, Prime Minister Modi hosted von der Leyen and Costa for the summit talks in New Delhi. The two EU leaders were also chief guests at the 77th Republic Day celebrations at Kartavya Path on Monday.“Thank you dear Prime Minister Modi, for welcoming us on this special occasion. We were privileged yesterday to be your Chief Guests for the Republic Day celebrations, such an impressive display of India's capabilities and diversity,” Costa said.",European council president antonio costa said he was ‘very proud’ of his ancestral roots in goa.

'Biggest In India's History': PM Modi Hails India-EU FTA, Says It Will Reshape Global Economy

NEW DELHI: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday that the political ties between Europe and India have never been stronger, pointing to closer cooperation after the conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement and the launch of a Security and Defence Partnership.Speaking at a banquet hosted in her honour at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Tuesday, von der Leyen said, “The political ties between Europe and India have never been stronger. Our scale gives us global influence, whether in trade, security or international relations. This is why India has risen to the top of global politics, a development Europe welcomes.”She said the partnership was entering a new phase. “Just imagine what we can achieve if we combine Europe’s and India’s resources. This is precisely why we are here today. It is a decisive moment in our partnership with our free trade agreement. And this is only the beginning,” she said.Von der Leyen said the agreements send a message at a time of global uncertainty. “We are sending a strong signal to the world. In a time when the world is becoming more fractured and fractious, India and Europe are choosing dialogue, collaboration, and cooperation.”She stressed that the partnership goes beyond trade. “Today is about more than economics. Europe and India are also stepping up strategically. This is why today we launched our security and defence partnership to protect Indian interests and European interests and to bring stability and reassurance in volatile times,” she said.India and the European Union formally announced the conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement and a Security and Defence Partnership earlier in the day, calling it a major step in bilateral ties.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the agreement would help stabilise the global order and boost growth on both sides.",European commission president ursula von der leyen says political ties between europe and india have never been stronger.

Why unions are striking

Government banks step in to limit disruption

Banking operations at public sector banks across the country are likely to be disrupted on Tuesday as bank unions go ahead with a nationwide strike to press for the immediate implementation of a five-day work week.The strike has been called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine unions representing bank officers and employees, after conciliation meetings with the chief labour commissioner on January 22 and 23 failed to yield any assurance on their demand, union leaders said.With banks already closed on January 23 (Basant Panchami), January 24 (fourth Saturday), January 25 (Sunday) and January 26 (Republic Day), the strike on January 27 is expected to disrupt branch-level services for five consecutive days.“Despite detailed discussions during the conciliation proceedings, there was no assurance on our demand. Hence, we have been compelled to proceed with the strike action,” C H Venkatachalam, general secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), a UFBU constituent, told PTI.Branch-level services such as cash deposits, withdrawals, cheque clearances and administrative work are expected to be hit at public sector lenders, including State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Baroda.However, operations at major private sector banks such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are expected to remain largely unaffected, as their employees are not part of the unions participating in the strike.Digital banking services, including UPI, mobile and internet banking, will continue to function, though ATM cash availability could face localised issues due to logistical delays.The unions are demanding that all Saturdays be declared holidays, a proposal they say was agreed upon during the 12th Bipartite Settlement signed with the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) in March 2024 but is yet to be notified by the government.“It is unfortunate that the government is not responding to our genuine demand. There would be no loss of man-hours as we have agreed to work an extra 40 minutes daily from Monday to Friday,” Rupam Roy, general secretary of the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), said.At present, banks remain open on the first, third and fifth Saturdays of every month.Union leaders said the strike was not aimed at inconveniencing customers. “This movement is not against customers, but for a sustainable, humane, and efficient banking system. A rested banker serves the nation better. A balanced workforce strengthens financial stability. 5-Day banking is not a luxury; it is an economic and human necessity,” L Chandrasekhar, general secretary of the National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE), said.An urgent meeting was held on Monday under the chairmanship of the secretary, department of financial services, with the chairman of SBI, managing directors and CEOs of nationalised banks, and the chief executive of the IBA, sources told ANI.Banks were advised to take all necessary steps to ensure smooth functioning of customer services, digital channels, clearing and settlement systems, government business and services delivered through business correspondents.Sources said banks have conveyed that ATMs are being adequately loaded with sufficient cash and arrangements made for timely replenishment. While branch operations may be impacted, digital banking services are expected to remain available seamlessly.Several public sector banks, including SBI, have also informed stock exchanges about the possible impact.“We advise that while the bank has made necessary arrangements to ensure normal functioning in its branches and offices on the day of strike, it is likely that work in the bank may be impacted by the strike,” SBI said in a regulatory filing on Friday.","Banking operations at public sector banks across the country are likely to be disrupted on tuesday as bank unions go ahead with a nationwide strike.

'Europe Will Retaliate': America's European Allies FIRE BACK At Trump Over Greenland Tariff Attack

US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent, accusing the ally’s legislature of failing to uphold its trade agreement with the United States.Trump added that South Korea’s legislature has not approved the trade deal he and President Lee Je Myung agreed to on July 30, 2025, and reaffirmed during his visit on October 29, 2025, questioning why it has not been ratified.""Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%."" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.""Our Trade Deals are very important to America. In each of these Deals, we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to. We, of course, expect our Trading Partners to do the same,"" Trump added.South Korea has been moving to implement a deal announced with Washington in November aimed at reducing US tariffs on its exports. More recently, Seoul has been in talks with US officials to clarify its investigation into US-based e-commerce company Coupang (CPNG.N), which was launched following a major data leak, as cited by Reuters.South Korea is a key trading partner for the United States, consistently ranking among the top 10 sources of US imports. American companies and consumers import nearly $150 billion worth of goods from South Korea each year.In July, Trump announced a trade deal with South Korea’s president, but progress stalled for months amid disagreement over an investment pledge sought by the United States. The two leaders later finalized the agreement in October during Trump’s trip to Asia, including a commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States.In November, the White House and the South Korean government released a ""fact sheet"" outlining the deal, which was intended to move the agreement forward, as cited by NBC News.The agreement included reduced tariffs for both countries, capping US import duties at 15 per cent. This marked a rollback from the 25 per cent tariff rate announced earlier in 2025 on South Korea’s ""Liberation Day"" in April, a move that had unsettled markets.Trump’s latest tariff announcement follows at least three previous threats that were never carried out. These included a proposed 10 per cent tariff on Canada after Ontario ran an anti-tariff World Series ad, threatened tariffs on European countries over Greenland, and a 100 per cent tariff on Canada that was announced last week.","Us president donald trump announced on monday that he is raising tariffs on south korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent.

Decline of Himalayan rivers could trigger nuclear war: UK report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/decline-of-himalayan-rivers-could-trigger-nuclear-war-uk-report/articleshow/127567910.cms,"ANI file photo

LONDON: The decline of rainforests and glacier-fed rivers could lead to global competition for food and water as early as the 2030s, UK intelligence chiefs have warned, adding that the decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan, potentially leading to nuclear war The British govt report warns that ecosystem degradation is occurring across all regions and “every critical ecosystem is on a pathway to collapse”.There is a realistic possibility that some ecosystems (SE Asia coral reefs, boreal forests and the Himalayas) will start to collapse from 2030, and others (rainforests and mangroves) start to collapse from 2050, it states.“Severe degradation or collapse would drive displacement of millions, change global weather patterns, increase global food and water scarcity, and drive geopolitical competition for remaining resources,” the 14-page report said.The impacts will range from crop failures, intensified natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks to conflict within and between states. Migration and organised crime will rise and terrorist groups will exploit political instability, it said.The report, titled “Global Biodiversity Loss, Ecosystem Collapse and National Security”, was published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).But TOI understands it was actually put together by the Joint Intelligence Committee, which coordinates MI5 and MI6. The report assesses how biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse impact UK national security and warns that the UK’s food security will be under threat as Britain imports 40% of its food and is not self-sufficient in fertilisers. “Both existing (plant pre-breeding, regenerative agriculture) and emerging technologies (AI, lab grown protein, insect protein) offer potential solutions,” it states.According to the UK Times newspaper, the report was due to be published last autumn but “was blocked by No. 10 for being too negative”. An “abridged version” has been published following a freedom of information request. The Times claims to have seen the “full internal version”, which states that the degradation of rainforests in the Congo and the drying up of rivers fed by the Himalayas could drive people to flee to Europe, leading to “more polarised and populist politics in the UK” and putting “additional pressure on already strained national infrastructure”.The internal version also warns of the risk of nuclear war from the decline of Himalayan rivers.“Critical ecosystems that support major global food production areas and impact global climate, water and weather cycles are the most important for UK national security. The Amazon and Congo rainforests, boreal forests, the Himalayas and Southeast Asia’s coral reefs and mangroves are particularly significant for the UK,” it states.The report notes that Britain’s large South Asian diaspora could make the UK an attractive destination for people from the region.“Countries best placed to adapt are those that invest in ecosystem protection and restoration, and resilient and efficient food systems. Restoration of some ecosystems (tropical forests) is more feasible than others (coral reefs, Himalayas),” it states.A Defra spokesperson said: “Nature underpins our security, prosperity, and resilience and understanding the threats we face from biodiversity loss is crucial to meeting them head on.”","Decline of himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between china, india and pakistan.

Interview slots for H-1B visas now only in 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/interview-slots-for-h-1b-visas-now-only-in-2027/articleshow/127503949.cms,".

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new h-1b stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

'Never Defied Cong In Parliament': 'Unapologetic' Shashi Tharoor Defends Modi Praise, Sindoor Stand

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who recently missed a crucial party meeting, sparking speculation about his future with the grand old party, missed another one on Tuesday, but stated he received the invitation at a very short notice, by when he had already made plans for a visit to Dubai.""As for not attending today's meeting, the invitation came only yesterday or the day before, by which time my travel plans were already finalised. With Parliament in session, I had booked my ticket directly from Dubai to Delhi,"" he told reporters.With the Budget session of Parliament starting on Wednesday, Congress legislative party (CPP) chairperson and former party chief Sonia Gandhi convened a meeting of the Congress' parliamentary strategy group at her residence to decide on the issues to be raised during the session.Sources confirmed that Tharoor, the four-time Thiruvananthapuram MP who has held the seat since 2009, could not attend the meeting as he was returning from Dubai. They added that the former diplomat had informed the party in advance about his inability to be present.Meanwhile, Tharoor said he would convey his ""issues"" directly to the Congress top leadership.""Whatever issues I need to raise, I will convey them directly to the party leadership.There is no doubt that I will get that opportunity, especially since everyone will be together during the Parliament session,"" he added.In recent months, Tharoor's repeated praise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government has irked the Congress, leading to him being ""sidelined"" from party affairs. He has been particularly vocal in his support for the government on Operation Sindoor , the five-day India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025. On the other hand, the Congress has sought to corner the Centre over alleged losses of Indian fighter jets during the conflict and US President Donald Trump's claims of mediating the truce between the two nuclear-armed rivals.","Congress mp shashi tharoor missed a crucial party meeting, sparking speculation about his future with the grand old party.

Ukrainian Envoy Hails PM Modi As Global Leader, Praises Ukraine Peace Efforts

NEW DELHI: After co-chairing the India-EU summit PM Narendra Modi said India and the EU were natural partners in a changing world and remained committed to strengthening multilateralism. However, Russia’s Ukraine war remained a vexing issue as the EU said it was counting on Modi’s support to end the conflict.European Council President Antonio Costa said in his media statement that the summit reaffirmed their commitment to supporting efforts towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine, one that fully respects Ukraine’s “independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity”.“This is a key moment. We are supporting all efforts to reach a just and sustainable peace. Ukraine has shown its readiness, including at the cost of difficult compromises. I know, dear Prime Minister, that we can count on you to help create the conditions for peace, through dialogue and diplomacy,” said Costa, addressing Modi at the joint media event.India’s ties with Russia have been a thorn in the side of the EU since the beginning of the conflict but Brussels didn’t allow it to stand in the way of the grounbreaking trade and defence pacts with India, recognising the need to work with New Delhi in a world marred by unpredictability and disruptions.The EU is also learnt to have urged India to provide more humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.Modi said in his own statement that the global order is undergoing profound turbulence and in that context the partnership between India and the EU will strengthen stability within the international system. “Against this backdrop, we held detailed discussions today on several global issues, including Ukraine, West Asia, and the Indo-Pacific,” said the PM, adding that respect for multilateralism and international norms remained a shared priority.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said EU leaders expressed their concerns about the conflict and the PM indicated to them he had been in close touch with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders. “We favor a negotiated solution between the parties most closely concerned with this conflict. The PM himself has advocated this to both leaders. He has publicly stated that India is ready to do whatever is needed to support the outcomes from such a negotiated solution. And that we are interested in seeing the earliest possible cessation of this conflict,” said Misri.The leaders also discussed the Gaza situation, calling for a just and lasting solution, based on the implementation of the two-State solution, through dialogue and diplomacy.According to the joint statement, they noted the adoption of the UN Security Council Resolution 2803 of 17 November 2025 which welcomes the establishment of the Board of Peace and authorizes an International Stabilisation Force, as outlined in the Comprehensive Plan, as a step forward to end the Gaza conflict.Both India and the EU have reservations about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace initiative which, unlike what is mandated by the resolution, will look to resolve conflicts all over the world and not just Gaza.In the statement, Modi and the EU leaders encouraged all parties to implement the resolution in its entirety, in line with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions. “Both sides restated their readiness to support efforts towards just and durable peace and stressed the need for unhindered humanitarian access,” said the joint statement.","Pm narendra modi said india and the eu were natural partners in a changing world.

White paper released to ensure safe and trusted AI ecosystem through techno-legal framework,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/white-paper-released-to-ensure-safe-and-trusted-ai-ecosystem-through-techno-legal-framework/articleshow/127640495.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of the India-AI Impact Summit scheduled next month, the office of the principal scientific adviser (PSA) to the central govt has released a white paper — Strengthening AI Governance Through Techno-Legal Framework — outlining the country’s approach to building a trusted, accountable and innovation-aligned AI ecosystem.Enabling “safe and trusted AI” across the full AI lifecycle is one of the key focus areas of the paper. It emphasises the contours of “techno-legal” AI governance framework that is necessary to mitigate risks while preserving flexibility and innovation.The 40-page paper also highlights India’s pro-innovation approach to AI governance, which integrates baseline legal safeguards, sector-specific regulations, technical controls and institutional mechanisms.“Developing a robust and responsive governance framework is not just a regulatory necessity but a prerequisite for sustaining the momentum of technological progress. The techno-legal approach offers a viable pathway by embedding legal, technical and institutional safeguards into AI systems by design,” said PSA Ajay Kumar Sood during the release of the white paper on Jan 23.In his foreword to the paper, he noted that while AI has significant “transformative potential”, it is essential to ensure that the associated risks and harm do not undermine trust or become a barrier to innovation and adoption.Exploring laws, rules and regulatory mechanisms, the framework suggests ways and means in which AI can be used securely without eroding public trust. The paper also signifies India’s contribution to making the entire ecosystem safe, of which its hosting of the AI Impact Summit 2026, the first-ever global AI summit to be held in the Global South, is an indicator.India as the summit’s host will shape a future-oriented agenda for impactful AI cooperation and help mark a strategic shift from ""action"" to ""Impact"".The upcoming summit aims to ensure that AI serves as a catalyst for inclusive human development, environmental sustainability and equitable progress worldwide, bridging the Global AI Divide through concrete multilateral action.The publication is the second in the White Paper series on ‘Emerging Policy Priorities for India’s AI Ecosystem’ that aims at deepening understanding and fostering informed discussion on critical AI policy issues.The first White Paper in the series, released in Dec 2025, focused on “democratising access to AI infrastructure”, highlighting the need to treat AI infrastructure as a shared national resource and identifying key enablers such as access to high-quality datasets, affordable computing resources and integration with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), said the office of PSA in a statement.","India-ai impact summit scheduled next month in new delhi.

Nepal Gen Z Protest EXPLODES For 2nd Time, Curfew Imposed, Cops Use LETHAL Force | Watch

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: An Indian national from Gujarat, who escaped from a jail during last year’s ""Gen Z"" protests in Nepal, has been apprehended by Ahmedabad Police, officials said on Tuesday.Dharmesh Chunara, a resident of Thakkarbapa Nagar Road in Ahmedabad, was arrested by the Special Operation Group (SOG) Crime Branch, according to a police release.He had fled Bhadra Jail in Kathmandu, the capital of the neighbouring Himalayan country, during last year’s protests.Chunara, who had arrived in Kathmandu from Thailand's Bangkok, was caught with 13 kilograms of hybrid ganja valued at around Rs 13 crore. Following legal action by Nepalese authorities, he was sent to Bhadra Jail.During the protests, demonstrators vandalised the jail, leading to the escape of all inmates, including some Indian nationals. Chunara entered India via the Sonauli border in Uttar Pradesh, from where he came to Ahmedabad.According to police, the Nepal government released a list of escaped prisoners, based on which the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Delhi, circulated the details to all Indian states, including the CID Crime unit in Gujarat's Gandhinagar.Chunara, whose full name and address were not immediately available, was traced through a combination of human intelligence and technical analysis.In September 2025, Nepal was shaken by large-scale youth-led demonstrations, known as the “Gen Z protests.” The immediate trigger was the government’s ban on social media platforms, which escalated into violent clashes following a crackdown. The protests grew into a broader movement addressing multiple grievances, ultimately leading to the toppling of the KP Sharma Oli-led government and the formation of a caretaker administration.Nepal is now scheduled to hold its next parliamentary elections on March 5.","Dharmesh chunara, a resident of thakkarbapa nagar road in ahmedabad, was arrested by the special operation group (sog) crime branch.

What triggered the movement in South Korea?



Do we have parallels in India?

Crime in India 2023

Is there a possibility of 4B in India then?



These lines are not lifted from the script of an ultra-feminist film where the protagonist finally walks away from patriarchy in the closing scene.They are spoken to real women, in real classrooms, playgrounds, homes, and workplaces, in response to the question: 'What is it that you got to hear because you are a woman?'When asked if they took any action against it, the answer was mostly negative.And yet, in some parts of the world, women have begun doing something radical: they have stopped trying to negotiate with patriarchy altogether. In South Korea, a small but radical feminist movement emerged in the late 2010s that rejected not just misogyny, but the social institutions built around it. Called 4B — short for— the movement is where women opt out of four things entirely.No marriage.No childbirth.No dating.No sex.The terms sound radical, but they are, at their core, a language of refusal to participate in patriarchal norms.Known as the 4B movement, the name comes from four Korean words beginning with, meaning “no”:(no marriage),(no childbirth),(no dating), and(no sex). Together, they form a clean break from heterosexual relationships as they are traditionally structured in South Korea.“Patriarchy breaks every sense of one's existence. As much as you might want to resist you somehow see yourself being a part of it. It's a sad state because then you don't feel honest but also can't help,” said Varalika Aditya Singh, who studied law, and is currently “figuring out new normal after marriage”.“Breakthrough from the entire conditioning is important. I don't believe we can resist and also be a part of it,” she added.Like earlier “separatist” feminist movements, 4B is not about personal lifestyle branding so much as political resistance: a rejection of institutions many women see as pipelines to unpaid labor, diminished autonomy, and systemic inequality.“Patriarchy’s hold on women runs so deep that from the moment they are born until they die, the dark, unyielding shadow of men follows them everywhere,” said Bhagya Luxmi, a former journalist.There’s no exact incident that triggered the movement, no single spark that neatly explains why some South Korean women began collectively opting out of marriage, motherhood, dating, and sex. Instead, 4B coalesced through accumulation—years of online hostility, public violence, and institutional indifference layering into something heavier than outrage: resolve.The backdrop was already hostile. In the early 2010s, the rise of Ilbe Storage, a notoriously misogynistic online forum, helped harden what became known as South Korea’s “gender wars,” normalising slurs, rape jokes, and open contempt for women in mainstream digital culture. Against this tide, feminist counter-spaces began forming. By 2015, ideas that would later define 4B—no marriage, no childbirth, no dating, no sex—were circulating within the Megalia community, which became known for its use of “mirroring” tactics: reflecting misogynistic language back at men to expose its violence and absurdity.In mid-2016, resistance took on a physical form with the emergence of the “escape the corset” movement. Young women rejected South Korea’s rigid beauty standards by cutting their hair short and destroying makeup on camera, reframing appearance as a site of control and reclaiming bodily autonomy—an ethos that would feed directly into 4B’s refusal of gendered expectations.Later that year, the Gangnam Station femicide, in which a woman was murdered by a stranger who said women had ignored him, shattered any lingering illusion that misogyny was merely rhetorical. Mass protests followed. Around the same time, the release of a so-called “pink birth map,” which reduced women to their reproductive potential, further inflamed feminist anger by rendering women as demographic tools rather than citizens.By 2017, the term “4B” itself began appearing on Daum Cafe forums and Twitter, as South Korea’s own #MeToo movement gained traction and feminist networks tightened. Through 2017 and 2018, these online circles solidified the movement, propelled by the aftershocks of the Gangnam murder and a growing wave of sex crime scandals, including illegal filming and image-based abuse. By 2019, 4B had achieved broader recognition on social media, peaking in visibility before declining domestically—even as its ideas continued to reverberate beyond South Korea’s borders.In that sense, 4B was not born of a moment but of momentum: a slow, collective decision that participation itself had become a liability.The conditions that produced 4B in South Korea are not exceptional—and in India, the parallels are often stark.As in South Korea’s “gender wars,” India’s digital spaces have increasingly normalised misogyny. In 2020, theincident exposed a private Instagram group of teenage boys sharing morphed images of underage girls, issuing rape threats, and casually discussing sexual violence.What unsettled many observers was not just the content but its ordinariness: the ease with which entitlement and cruelty flourished in supposedly liberal, urban spaces. Much like South Korea’s Ilbe Storage, the episode revealed how online ecosystems can incubate misogyny long before it escalates into physical harm.India’s reckoning with gendered violence, however, predates social media scandals. The 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder in Delhi remains a defining rupture—a moment comparable to South Korea’s Gangnam Station femicide. The crime triggered mass protests, legal reforms, and global attention. Yet the burden of change fell unevenly. Women were urged to be vigilant and resilient; institutions were reformed on paper, while everyday patriarchy remained structurally intact.The scale of violence women face in India remains stark. According to the NCRB’sreport, cases of crimes against women rose slightly by 0.7% in 2023, from 4.45 lakh to 4.48 lakh cases. As in previous years, the most common crime was cruelty by husband or relatives, which made up nearly 30% of all cases—about 1.33 lakh incidents, affecting 1.35 lakh women. While this category saw a small dip from 2022, it continues to dominate the data, underscoring how violence is often rooted inside the home. The NCRB also recorded 29,670 rape cases in 2023, involving 29,909 victims, with over 10,700 cases still pending from the previous year. Most victims were young: nearly 20,000 were between 18 and 30 years old, and 852 were children, including some below the age of six.Shravya Singh, a teenager who studies in a co-ed school in Ranikhet, recalled the differences in treatment meted out to boys and girls in her school""I remember once, when I was standing with a friend, a teacher came up to us and said that your body looked 'heavy' and the shirt looked ‘odd’ and asked to go sit in the medical room instead,” she recalled.Asked if she saw a possibility of “ditch the sweater” as a protest in her school, she said that if we try to do any such thing, it would mean “direct suspension”.“Too far fetched,” said Varalika Aditya Singh, however, adding that she agreed with the concept “of sort of abstinence from every possible aspect where patriarchy does play a huge role”.“But in India I still believe we only do things to please, a lot under pressure to be accepted, validated and to be looked at a certain way. Women might choose to live this way but secretly,” she said.“In India it's mostly vocal, nothing in action,” Neeraja Nath, who works as a news writer said.Given the fact that marriage is something so ingrained in Indian culture, when asked if it was a patriarchal institution, Singh “absolutely” agreed.However, she added that “marriage might not be entirely patriarchal but the conditioning has always been that.”“I cannot and also don't want to defy an entire institution because patriarchy has seeped everywhere. Marriage is just more convenient also because there's a lot of stigma attached if in the longer run the relationship doesn't work out,” she said.","In south korea, a small but radical feminist movement emerged in the late 2010s that rejected not just misogyny, but the social institutions built around it.

'I’m Also An Overseas Indian': When Antonio Costa Sparked Laughter During India-EU FTA Summit

NEW DELHI: India and the European Union have concluded long-running negotiations on a landmark free trade agreement, a move leaders on both sides described as historic, as European Council President António Luís Santos da Costa highlighted his personal connection to India through his Goan roots.Costa, who led the EU delegation alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, underlined the emotional significance of the visit. “I'm the President of the European Council, but I'm also an overseas Indian citizen.

His father, Orlando da Costa, was a noted writer whose work reflected strong Goan influences. He is still known by the Konkani nickname ‘Babush’.The diplomatic engagement came as von der Leyen announced the conclusion of the trade deal. “Europe and India are making history today.

"India carries Asia’s heaviest lung disease burden, Lancet study finds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-carries-asias-heaviest-lung-disease-burden-lancet-study-finds/articleshow/127604539.cms,"NEW DELHI: India accounts for more than 43% of Asia’s chronic respiratory disease–related disability, the highest share in the region, according to a new analysis published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine on Wednesday. The study identifies air pollution as a major factor behind India’s persistently high lung disease burden.The study, based on estimates from the Global Burden of Disease 2023, found that Asia as a whole contributed nearly 67% of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to chronic respiratory diseases in 2023. India alone accounted for 43.3% of Asia’s DALYs, while China contributed 27.8%, together making up over 70% of the regional burden, largely driven by population size and sustained exposure to risk factors.In 2023, India’s age-standardised DALY rate from chronic respiratory diseases remained above 2,040 per 100,000 population, among the highest in Asia, reflecting a substantial burden of disability and premature mortality linked to respiratory conditions, despite a gradual decline since 1990.Explaining what this translates to on the ground, Dr G.C. Khilnani, pulmonologist and Chairman, PSRI Institute of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, said respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia, asthma and COPD are now among the most common conditions seen in clinical practice, with children and the elderly particularly vulnerable.He said delayed diagnosis worsens outcomes, while air pollution has emerged as a major driver—accounting for nearly half of COPD cases and a growing share of lung cancers, including among non-smokers.South Asia, driven largely by India, recorded the highest age-standardised prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Asia at 3,044 cases per 100,000 population. While prevalence across Asian regions was broadly similar, the analysis found that disability and deaths were significantly higher in lower-income regions, pointing to poorer outcomes rather than higher disease occurrence.Dr Ujjwal Parakh, Senior Consultant in Chest Medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said chronic respiratory diseases—particularly COPD—are steadily increasing in India and are often diagnosed late due to low awareness and limited access to spirometry. With air pollution damaging lungs much like tobacco smoke, he said controlling pollution and improving early detection are critical.The study identified ambient particulate matter pollution and household air pollution from solid fuels as major contributors to India’s respiratory disease burden. Household air pollution in South Asia was associated with an age-standardised DALY rate of 658 per 100,000 population, among the highest globally.Researchers cautioned that although age-standardised DALY rates for most chronic respiratory diseases have declined across Asia over the past three decades, uneven progress, persistent pollution exposure and gaps in access to care threaten to slow or reverse gains. Without sustained improvements in air quality, cleaner household energy use and equitable respiratory care, the study warned, India’s lung disease burden is likely to remain high.",Study identifies air pollution as a major factor behind india’s persistently high lung disease burden. Asia as a whole contributed nearly 67% of global disability-adjusted life years due to chronic respiratory diseases in 2023. South asia recorded the highest age-standardised prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) in asia.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127604522,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1139258,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India delivered a sharp rebuke to Pakistan at the United Nations Security Council , accusing Islamabad of pushing a “single point agenda – to harm the country” and presenting a “false and self-serving account” of Operation Sindoor In a sharp retort to Pakistan, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, said the facts surrounding the operation were clear and rooted in terrorism emanating from across the border.“Pakistan-sponsored terrorists killed 26 innocent civilians in a brutal attack in Pahalgam in April 2025,” Harish told the council during an open debate on international law and multilateralism.“This august body itself called for holding the perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and brought to justice. That is exactly what we did.”He described India’s military response under Operation Sindoor “measured, non-escalatory, and responsible”, aimed at “dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and disabling terrorists”. Harish added that until 9 May, Pakistan had been “threatening more attacks on India”, but “on the 10th of May, the Pakistani military called our military directly and pleaded for a cessation to the fighting”.He pointed to “images of destroyed runways and burnt-out hangars” at Pakistani airbases, saying the damage was “in the public domain”.Rejecting Pakistan’s hoax about a ""new normal"", Harish said, “Terrorism can never be normalised as Pakistan wishes to do. It is not normal to tolerate Pakistan’s continued use of terrorism as an instrument of state policy. This hallowed chamber cannot become a forum for Pakistan to legitimise terrorism.” He added that India “will do whatever required to protect and ensure the safety and security of our citizens”.Harish also used the debate to call for sweeping reform of the Security Council. He argued that the UN’s current structure reflects a “geopolitical reality of a bygone era” and warned that multilateralism is under strain due to paralysis in addressing conflicts.“The rule of law is barren without enforceability,” he said, urging a shift towards “pragmatic solutions and outcomes that positively impact the daily lives of our citizens”. He pressed for expansion of the Council in both permanent and non-permanent categories, saying global governance must evolve to remain “effective and credible” in a rapidly changing world.Operation Sindoor was carried out in the early hours of May 7 eliminating at least 100 terrorists in response to the horrific Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 innocent civilians.","India delivered a sharp rebuke to pakistan at the united nations security council.
