"Eye on China, India inks SL deal for energy hub in Trincomalee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-india-inks-sl-deal-for-energy-hub-in-trincomalee/articleshow/120027773.cms,"Among the important takeaways from Narendra Modi's fourth visit to Sri Lanka as prime minister was a tripartite agreement - also involving the UAE - to develop the coastal district of Trincomalee in the country's northeastern part as an energy hub. Announcing the project in the traditionally Tamil-majority area, which will include a multi-product pipeline, Modi said all Sri Lankans will benefit from it.With its natural harbour and energy facilities, Trincomalee is of great strategic value for India as a strong presence there will also allow it to ramp up influence in the northeast Indian Ocean. The announcement follows Sri Lanka's securing of investments worth $3.7 billion from China's oil giant Sinopec, the largest foreign direct investment to date in the country, for an oil refinery in the southern Hambantota region during Lankan President Anura Dissanayake's visit to Beijing earlier this year. For India, it's imperative that China, which has in the past explored energy projects in islands off the Jaffna peninsula, is not allowed to make inroads into northern and eastern parts of the country.India already has an agreement with Sri Lanka for developing some of the Trincomalee oil tank farms and India could develop more under the new MoU. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the proposed energy hub is an initiative designed to ensure Sri Lanka's energy security, provisioning of energy at affordable rates, and also to possibly contribute revenue for the country through export of energy. As a major strategic and energy partner, the UAE was an ideal partner for the first of its kind project in the region.In line with their growing strategic convergence, India and the UAE had agreed in 2018 to jointly work on development projects in third countries.Also read: Modi assures Sri Lanka help in dealing with Trump tariff fallout ""And what the exact contours of the UAE role will be is something that is going to be elaborated once the B2B discussions kick off under this MoU,"" said Misri.""The immediate next step that will be enabled by this framework MoU is the identification and the nomination of specific agencies and entities that could be govt entities or private sector entities or could be entities related to the govts themselves that will try and realise the business-to-business part of this agreement,"" added the official.",Narendra modi announced a tripartite agreement to develop the coastal district of trincomalee in the country's northeastern part as an energy hub.

China's growing influence

Why PM Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka matters now

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday welcomed Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake ’s assurance that the island nation “will not permit its territory to be used in any manner inimical to the security of India,” calling the gesture a reaffirmation of the deep trust between the two neighbours and a statement that appeared to assuage concerns about China's growing influence over neighbours.“Tamil saint Thiruvalluvar said—what could be bigger protection against the enemy if not the shield of a true friend and his friendship?” PM Modi said, adding, “President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had chosen India for his first foreign visit. Today, I am his first foreign guest here in Sri Lanka. It shows the depths of our special relationship. Sri Lanka has a special place in our neighbourhood first policy and mission SAGAR.”Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri added context to the growing strategic partnership: “The President of Sri Lanka stated very clearly that Sri Lankan territory will not be used or be allowed to be used in any manner that is inimical or detrimental to India’s interests. During discussions today, he said that neither Sri Lanka's land nor the oceans around it will be allowed to be used in any manner inimical to India’s security.”He said the remarks set the stage for a milestone development. “This is the background of the signature of the Defence MoU between the two countries for the first time, and the MoU is in itself an umbrella framework document that will make existing defence cooperation initiatives more structured.”President Dissanayake also acknowledged India’s regional role and sought its support in key bilateral issues. “I reaffirmed Sri Lanka's stand that it will not permit its territory to be used in any manner inimical to the security of India as well as towards regional stability,” he said. “I requested Prime Minister Modi's intervention in convening early bilateral technical discussions pertaining to Sri Lanka's claim to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf for the establishment of the outer limits of the Continental Shelf beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone.”He also highlighted the countries’ collaboration in technology and digital transformation . “Sri Lanka recognizes the importance of developing a digital economy to drive growth, innovation and efficiency. Furthering this policy initiative, Prime Minister Modi and I discussed possible collaboration in digitalization in multiple domains,” he said. “I thank the Government of India for the financial grant of Indian Rupees 300 crores to implement Sri Lanka's unique Digital Identity Project.”Chinese investments and infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka to develop its economy have raised concerns ranging from sovereignty and security issues.Beijing’s control of the Hambantota Port—secured on a 99-year lease after Colombo defaulted on loan repayments—has enabled Chinese surveillance vessels, such as the Yuan Wang 5, to operate near India’s southern coast. Despite protests from New Delhi in 2022, Sri Lanka allowed Chinese ships to dock at Hambantota for “replenishment,” a practice that continues.China has also pledged a record $3.7 billion investment in Sri Lanka following President Dissanayake’s recent visit to Beijing. The funds will be used to build a new oil refinery at Hambantota as part of an upgraded Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) agreement.PM Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka is more than a goodwill gesture—it marks a pivotal step in deepening defence and strategic cooperation between the two nations at a time of growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean region.The visit is expected to culminate in the signing of a key defence cooperation agreement, signalling a reset in India-Sri Lanka military ties that have remained cautious since the withdrawal of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) from the island nearly 35 years ago.PM Modi arrived in Colombo on Friday evening and was welcomed at the Bandaranaike International Airport by five senior Sri Lankan ministers, including Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa, and Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar.On Saturday morning, he received a ceremonial welcome at Independence Square by President Dissanayake, underlining the importance both nations attach to their long-standing ties.",Pm narendra modi welcomed sri lankan president anura kumara dissanayake ’s assurance that the island nation “will not permit its territory to be used in any manner inimical to india’s security” the statement appeared to assuage concerns about china's growing influence over neighbours.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120009491,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2264994,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Amid growing Chinese footprint in the Indian Ocean, India signed its first ever MoU for defence cooperation with Sri Lanka that will help both sides formalise and enhance cooperation between their armed forces. The agreement was one of the highlights of PM Narendra Modi's ongoing visit to the strategically-located neighbour that also saw a major boost for energy ties in the form of a grid inter-connectivity agreement that will allow Sri Lanka to export electricity and another MoU for developing Trincomalee as an energy hub.The bilateral meeting was followed by signing of seven MoUs and agreements. The leaders acknowledged that the security interests of India and Sri Lanka are interlinked and the President reassured India that he won't allow Lankan land or, as foreign secretary Vikram Misri recalled after the bilateral meeting, the oceans around it to be used in any way inimical to India's security interests or regional stability.""We believe that we have shared security interests. The security of both countries is interconnected and co-dependent,"" said Modi, thanking Dissanayake for his sensitivity towards India's interests.Modi also announced a debt restructuring agreement that he said will provide immediate assistance and relief to the people of Sri Lanka, along with reduced interest rates on loans. ""Today, we have also decided to reduce interest rates. It symbolises that even today, India stands with the people of Sri Lanka. For the social and economic development of the Eastern Provinces, a support package of approximately 2.4 billion Lankan rupees (around Rs 70 crore) will be provided,"" he said. India had earlier extended an aid package worth $4 billion to Sri Lanka to help the Indian Ocean country from a food and fuel crisis.Modi, the first foreign leader to visit Sri Lanka since the President assumed office last year, quoted Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar to say that in the face of challenges and enemies, there is no stronger assurance than a true friend and the shield of his friendship.On the sensitive issue of fishermen, the two decided to handle it with a humane approach with Modi emphasising on immediate release of fishermen and their boats.On the Tamil issue, Dissanayake briefed Modi about his “inclusive” approach and the Indian PM expressed hope that the Sri Lankan govt would meet the aspirations of the Tamil people and fulfil its commitment towards fully implementing the Constitution of Sri Lanka, and conducting provincial council elections. Like in their last meeting in Dec, when Dissanayake visited India, Modi did not specifically refer to the 13th Amendment for the devolution of power to the provinces.“Relations between India and Sri Lanka are based on mutual trust and goodwill. We will continue to work together to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of our people,” said Modi.Briefing the media about the defence MoU, Misri said it will make existing defence cooperation initiatives more structured. “There will be activities related to, of course, the continuing and even intensifying the tradition of high-level visits between the two countries, more joint exercises, capacity building in various areas, exchanges in HADR related operations, increasing port calls by naval units of both countries, and also to explore defence industry cooperation between the two sides,” said Misri.On conclusion of the debt restructuring process, Misri said India has been pursuing an investment-led strategy with Sri Lanka, together with a grant assistance-oriented approach to ensure that Sri Lanka is firmly on the path to sustainable and long-term economic recovery.

NEW DELHI: In regard to remarks by the Press Secretary to Bangladesh chief adviser about the meeting of the Bangladesh leader Muhammad Yunus with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sources have dismissed the account as mischievous and politically motivated.Sources said on Saturday that the characterisation of PM Modi's remarks regarding the relationship between Yunus and the previous government was also inaccurate.The sources said underlined that PM Modi spoke of the progress in our bilateral relationship since 2014 and characterized it as a deep friendship between our societies and peoples.They said PM Modi also mentioned the importance of elections as the basis of legitimacy in any democracy.""A continued procrastination in this regard would damage the chief adviser's reputation.

The leaders agreed to enhance consultations and cooperation to advance regional integration, including under the Bimstec framework.Prime Minister expressed his conviction that all issues of mutual interest between the two countries would continue to be addressed and resolved bilaterally through constructive discussions, in the interest of their long standing and mutually beneficial bilateral relationship.PM Modi also said in a post on X that he expressed serious concern for the safety of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh.""Met Mr. Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh.

As the leader of a giant neighbour, Sri Lanka has benefitted from his support. It was fantastic to meet him.”Aravinda de Silva said, “He is a person well respected around the world. His leadership has done so much for India. Being Prime Minister for three terms running is remarkable.”Chaminda Vaas shared that he and Modi spoke about the 1996 Cricket World Cup win. “Prime Minister Modi is the most powerful leader in South Asia, and his knowledge of cricket is very good,” he said.Sanath Jayasuriya added, “It was a great experience meeting PM Modi.

Despite a strong US jobs report, panic selling swept Wall Street and Europe, as investors braced for what many now see as an economic reckoning.The S&P 500 nosedived 5% in morning trading, on track for its worst day since the pandemic crash in 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,656 points, or 4.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 5.5%. Crude oil prices sank to 2021 levels, and industrial metals like copper dropped on worries of slowing global growth.The sell-off accelerated after China announced it would match President Donald Trump’s 34% tariff hike on Chinese imports with its own 34% tariffs on all US goods, effective April 10. The tit-for-tat escalation comes just a day after Trump warned Americans might feel “some pain” from his trade strategy, comparing the economic disruption to surgery.“For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.The US jobs report provided a brief pause to the carnage. Employers added more jobs than expected in March, reinforcing hopes that the US economy remains resilient. But analysts warned the data is backward-looking and does little to address forward risks.“Markets are now focused on what comes next. This is no longer about how strong the US was—it’s about whether it can withstand a trade war-induced slowdown,” said Rick Rieder, Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock.Some of the sharpest losses were among US companies exposed to China. DuPont fell nearly 17% after China’s regulators launched an anti-trust probe into its Chinese subsidiary. GE Healthcare, which gets 14% of its revenue from China, sank 13.3%. United Airlines, heavily reliant on Asia-Pacific routes, dropped 12.6%.On his social media platform Truth Social, Trump dismissed China’s move: “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!”Bond markets also flashed red. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 3.90%, down from 4.06% the previous day, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to cut interest rates to cushion the blow.But with tariffs driving up prices, the Fed could face a tightrope: lower rates may ease economic pressure but risk stoking inflation, leaving US households squeezed by rising costs.Abroad, the damage was widespread. Germany’s DAX index fell 5.2%, France’s CAC 40 lost 4.6%, and Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.8%.Vietnam and the European Union have both signaled intentions to negotiate with the US, but for now, the world’s two largest economies remain locked in economic combat — and markets are running scared.","The s&p 500 nosedived 5% in morning trading, on track for its worst day since 2020.

NEW DELHI: The legal and political battle over the Waqf Amendment Bill , 2025 has reached the Supreme Court, with AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi joining Congress MP Mohammad Jawed in challenging the bill’s constitutional validity.Both leaders have alleged that the proposed amendments infringe on the fundamental rights of Muslims and introduce discriminatory state control over Islamic religious endowments.The petitions, filed through advocate Anas Tanwir, come even before the Bill has received Presidential assent.It was passed by both Houses of Parliament amid sharp opposition.Jawed, a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that reviewed the bill, argued that the amendments violate Articles 14, 25, 26, 29, and 300A of the Constitution, which relate to equality, religious freedom, minority rights, and property. He said the bill introduces arbitrary restrictions, including one based on the duration of religious practice, which could prevent recent converts from dedicating property under waqf — a condition he said is alien to Islamic law, reported Bar and Bench.Another contentious change flagged in the petition is the proposed inclusion of non-Muslim members in Waqf Boards and the Central Waqf Council. “This selective intervention lacks any reasonable justification and constitutes an arbitrary classification,” the plea mentioned, noting that similar interference is absent in the governance of Hindu or Sikh religious trusts.Speaking to the media, Jawed said, “Several people in India will file this petition, several parties will do this... In the Parliament, everyone in the Opposition said that this is unconstitutional... How can you snatch away our right? If you have numbers, it doesn’t mean you get passed anything you want and do something unlawful.”AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi has also called the Bill a “brazen violation” of the Muslim community’s rights.During the debate in Parliament, he tore a copy of the legislation, comparing his act to Mahatma Gandhi’s civil disobedience in South Africa. “Like Gandhi, I am also tearing up this law. This is unconstitutional. The BJP wants to create divisiveness in this country in the name of temples and mosques,” he said.He also urged the government to consider the 10 amendments he proposed during the debate, warning that the Bill would curtail Muslim rights.The Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to revise the Waqf Act, 1995, which governs religious endowments under Islamic law in India. It defines the roles of Waqf Boards, Tribunals, and administrative structures overseeing waqf properties. While the government says the amendments are aimed at better regulation and transparency, critics argue the bill introduces state interference not applied to other religious institutions and undermines community autonomy.","Aimim chief asaduddin owaisi joins congress mp mohammad jawed in challenging the bill’s constitutional validity.

"In counter to Yunus's remark, PM Modi says Northeast integral to Bimstec",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-counter-to-yunuss-remark-pm-modi-says-northeast-integral-to-bimstec/articleshow/119956816.cms,"Modi to meet Yunus today, claim top Bangladesh officials

Poll Should the Indian government invest more in the Northeast for Bimstec collaboration? No, we need to focus elsewhere Yes, definitely

As he departed for Thailand to participate in the 6th Bimstec summit, PM Narendra Modi asserted India's Northeast lies at the heart of the inter-regional group, underlining the primacy of the northeastern states in the region, days after Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said in China the ""7 sisters"" are landlocked with no way of reaching the ocean. Modi's remark came ahead of a likely bilateral meeting between the two on Friday on the summit's margins.Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.Modi was seated between Yunus and Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli. An Indian govt source speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting, as sought by Dhaka, is ""in the works"". Senior officials in Dhaka were quoted as saying that the leaders would meet on Friday afternoon, shortly after the Bimstec summit. The meeting, if it happens, would be the first between the leaders since the interim govt took charge in Bangladesh in Aug 2025.Separately, in a Bimstec ministerial, Jaishankar said that the North-East had emerged as a connectivity hub for the Bimstec and the completion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway will connect the region all the way to the Pacific Ocean. This, he said, would be a veritable game-changer.Yunus's office had clarified on Wednesday that his remarks about India's North-East had been made with ""honest intentions"" but were interpreted wrongly. The fact that he was speaking in China, while inviting Beijing to take advantage of Bangladesh's geographical location, raised eyebrows in India.Modi had last week written to Yunus on Bangladesh National Day, extending his felicitations and underlining the significance of working together on the basis of mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns. India also remains concerned about the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh, and the threat to minorities amid increasing radicalisation in the country.According to govt sources, bilateral meetings are likely also with Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli and Myanmar junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is undertaking a rare visit abroad amid the civil war in the country for Bimstec.In his departure statement, Modi also said that Bimstec has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region. ""I look forward to meeting the leaders of the Bimstec countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interest of our people in mind,"" said Modi.Bimstec or the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation is an inter-regional grouping comprising five South Asian countries and two Asean states, lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh will take over as the chair of Bimstec at the Bangkok summit.At the last summit in Colombo in 2022, the leaders adopted the Bimstec Charter, completing its transition from a grouping to a regional organisation. With Saarc now non-functional because of the lack of any diplomatic engagement between India and Pakistan, the Indian govt has pushed Bimstec as an alternative for regional trade, connectivity and security. Addressing the Colombo summit, Modi had also called for expediti ng ongoing talks for a Bimstec free trade agreement (FTA) that would enhance mutual trade.The PM will also visit Sri Lanka from Bangkok. ""This follows the highly successful visit of President Dissanayaka to India last Dec. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of fostering partnerships for a shared future and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,"" he said in his departure statement.","Modi and yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by thailand pm paetongtarn shinawatra.

US Visa News: Anyone who isn't a US citizen should think twice before traveling outside especially if...: Experts warn amid crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/anyone-who-isnt-a-us-citizen-should-think-twice-before-traveling-outside-especially-if-experts-warn-amid-crackdown/articleshow/120023858.cms,"Experts feel green card holders should think twice now before traveling outside the US if they have criticized Trump on social media.

Having correct documents is most important

Green card holders and visa holders in the country need to think twice before traveling outside the country, lawyers warn amid the massive crackdown on international students and migrants. ""Anyone who isn't a U.S. citizen should think hard about the need to leave the United States, especially if they have made statements on social media that are critical of political positions that the Trump administration supports or have had even minimal contact with police,"" César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, the Gregory Williams Chair in civil rights & civil liberties at Ohio State University College of Law, told Newsweek.""The Trump administration has given permanent residents and visa holders plenty of reason to worry about running into problems trying to get back into the United States from a trip abroad,"" the immigration law expert said, though the administration asserted that those who have not broken any laws have nothing to fear about anything.Shannon Shepherd, chair of the media committee for the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) told Newsweek that overall there's no guarantee that a person coming back to the US will be granted entry and that's been the case always. ""But what we're seeing lately is more negative exercise of discretion, I guess is the way to put it, where people are being denied entry that we wouldn't necessarily have been denied before or people being detained instead of just allowed to withdraw their request for entry.""According to these experts, having the correct documentation is of utmost importance. For green card holders, the documents are a valid passport and the green card. If the green card is up for renewal, then one must vatty the receipt from the US Citizenship and Immigration Service.Past criminal convictions, even minor infractions, could now be taken into account at the discretion of CBP officers at the border, along with social media comments or text messages, in order to deny entry even if the traveler has all the correct paperwork, Shepherd said.If an individual is in the process of applying for a green card, known as Adjustment of Status (AoS), then they generally can't leave the country without Advance Parole. This is a travel document that has to be granted by USCIS before travel. CBP website mentions that those with valid H-1B or L-1 visas going through AoS are allowed to travel without Advance Parole, as are V- and K-3/4 nonimmigrant visa holders.","Experts feel green card holders should think twice now before traveling outside the us if they have criticized trump on social media.

Jim Cramer predicts 1987 'Black Monday' style stock market crash because of Trump tariffs in viral video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jim-cramer-predicts-1987-black-monday-style-stock-market-crash-because-of-trump-tariffs-in-viral-video/articleshow/120024490.cms,"Jim Cramer's prediction of 'Black Monday' on live television went viral.

CNBC host Jim Cramer predicted a 1987-like ' Black Monday ' coming week because of the tariffs Donald Trump imposed on countries. ""If the president doesn't try to reach out and reward these countries and companies that play by the rules, then the 1987 scenario...the one where we went down three days and then down 22% on Monday, has the most cogency. We will not have to wait too long to know. We will know it by Monday,"" Cramer said.“It’s tough to build a new, weaker, world order on the fly.

Those who bottom-fished are sleeping with the fishes …so far,' Cramer posted on XThe market blood bath continued for two consecutive days on Thursday and Friday after Trump's tariff announcement on Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by more than 2,200 points after China unveiled stiff retaliatory taxes to President Trump’s tariffs. The Dow tanked 2,231 points — a day after suffering a 1,679-point drop, its previous worst session since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted by 962.82 points, or 5.8%, while the broad-based S&P 500 was down 322.44 points, or 5.97%.China’s foreign ministry slammed the United States for using tariffs as a weapon for “extreme pressure and self-interest,” saying US “economic bullying will ultimately backfire.” “We do not seek conflict, nor do we fear it. Pressure and threats are not the correct ways to engage with China,” the foreign ministry said in a lengthy statement today.Trump maintained his stance on tariffs and urged Americans to ""hang tough"" as the tariffs are not going to be easy. China and “many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,” Trump said, accusing them of using the United States as a “whipping post,” reiterating his rationale for the tariffs as he has accused other countries of “taking advantage” of the United States.","The market blood bath continued for two consecutive days on thursday and friday after trump's tariff announcement on wednesday.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s return to the UK for Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee in June 2022 was anything but a warm homecoming. According to Daily Mail, the couple’s appearance at the National Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral was carefully stage-managed by royal aides to avoid awkward interactions with senior royals, especially Prince William.Tensions were still running high after the Sussexes’ explosive 2021 Oprah interview, in which they accused an unnamed royal of making a racist remark and Harry claimed his father, King Charles, had cut him off financially.As per Daily Mail, royal officials were determined to prevent a repeat of the frosty atmosphere from the pair’s last joint appearance with the family at Westminster Abbey in 2020. The seating plan at St Paul’s was therefore designed to place Harry and Meghan far from William, Charles, and the Queen’s close working royals.Although logistical concerns were handled with precision, the Sussexes arrived and left separately from senior royals and were seated on the opposite side of the aisle—the public’s reaction proved less predictable.As Harry and Meghan stepped out of the cathedral, a mix of cheers and boos rang out.According to Daily Mail, it was their first public royal engagement together since stepping back from duties and the jeering signalled how dramatically public sentiment had shifted.Royal correspondents, including Sky’s Kay Burley and Rhiannon Mills described the crowd’s response as “mixed,” though others, such as MailOnline’s reporter on the scene, said cheering for William and Kate was the “biggest of the day by some margin.” AFP footage also captured audible boos as the couple exited.Inside the cathedral, their second-row placement, behind non-working royals, underscored their diminished status. Charles and Camilla, representing the Queen, were seated prominently in the front row alongside William and Kate. Meanwhile, Harry and Meghan were seated between Lady Chatto and Princess Eugenie’s husband, Jack Brooksbank. There was no visible interaction between the brothers, highlighting the depth of their rift.According to Daily Mail, a palace source described the seating as “a typically elegant solution,” explaining, “The Queen wants her family there and they are still part of it. But in a carefully controlled fashion.”The day also offered no sign of the Netflix crews that had followed the couple during previous engagements, a relief to royal courtiers wary of media exploitation. Yet tensions lingered over privacy.The Sun reported at the time that Harry and Meghan were denied permission to bring a personal photographer when introducing their daughter Lilibet to the Queen, due to fears the image might be leaked to US media.Later, the Sussexes left for Frogmore Cottage and skipped a royal reception. For Harry, who once topped polls as Britain’s most popular royal, the experience marked a fall from grace.As per Daily Mail, he once symbolised the perfect modern prince, charming, brave and down-to-earth. But the 2022 jubilee underscored how much that image had changed.The couple have since remained largely in California, with no sign of reconciliation with the royal family or of a turnaround in public opinion. For Harry, the once-familiar cheers have been replaced by boos, and it remains to be seen whether that distance, both literal and emotional, will ever be bridged.",Prince harry and meghan markle faced an icy homecoming at queen's jubilee in 2022.
