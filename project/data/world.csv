NEW DELHI: During the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) debate, India flayed Pakistan over its ""delusional tirade"" over Kashmir and highlighted the 1971 ""systematic genocide"" campaign that sanctioned a mass rape of 40,000 women by the Pakistani army.Parvathaneni Harish, Permanent Representative of India to the UN , said India was ""unfortunately fated to listen to the delusional tirade of Pakistan"" that ""distract the world with misdirection and hyperbole"".""Every year, we are unfortunately fated to listen to the delusional tirade of Pakistan against my country, especially on Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian territory they covet. Our pioneering record on the Women, Peace and Security agenda is unblemished and unscathed,"" Harish said at the UNSC while speaking on the Open Debate on Women, Peace and Security.He further said: ""A country that bombs its own people, conducts systematic genocide, can only attempt to distract the world with misdirection and hyperbole. This is a country that conducted Operation Searchlight in 1971 and sanctioned a systematic campaign of genocidal mass rape of 400,000 women citizens by its own army. The world sees through Pakistan’s propaganda.""Pakistan’s army launched a brutal crackdown in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) under Operation Searchlight in 1971, killing up to 3 million people and raping over 40,000 women citizens.The campaign targeted Bengali civilians and minorities. India intervened, leading to Pakistan’s defeat and Bangladesh’s creation.The ""bombing its own people"" remark was in the backdrop of the Pakistani air force killing over 30 people in an overnight air strike in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa village last month.In September, representing India at the 60th session of the Human Rights Council, Kshitij Tyagi, Counsellor, Permanent Mission of India, Geneva, said Pakistan should ""focus on rescuing an economy on life support, a polity muzzled by military dominance, and a human rights record stained by persecution"".""A delegation that epitomises the antithesis of this approach continues to abuse this forum with baseless and provocative statements against India,"" he said.Tyagi futher said: ""Instead of coveting our territory, they would do well to vacate the Indian territory under their illegal occupation and focus on rescuing an economy on life support, a polity muzzled by military dominance, and a human rights record stained by persecution, perhaps once they find time away from exporting terrorism, harbouring UN-proscribed terrorists, and bombing their own people.","Parvathaneni harish, permanent representative of india to the un, said india was ""unfortunately fated to listen to the delusional tirade of pakistan"" harish highlighted the 1971 ""systematic genocide"" campaign that sanctioned a mass rape of 40,000 women by the pakistani army.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124351645,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70410,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

India’s Growth And Resilience Unshaken Despite Global Tariff Pressures, Says Nirmala Sitharaman

Poll Have you ever tried to claim any unclaimed money that may belong to you? Yes, successfully No, I haven't thought about it

AHMEDABAD: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets lying with banks, RBI , insurance firms, mutual funds, provident fund accounts and other institutions to their rightful owners.The three-month programme also seeks to raise awareness. ""These unclaimed amounts are not government property but belong to individuals and families,"" Sitharaman said. ""Decades have passed when people voiced the need to return unclaimed monies from banks, RBI, or the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF). This is their money.""She said such funds often arise due to missing documentation, forgotten policies or lack of awareness. ""It is like a ripe fruit hanging within reach but not falling into the hands of those to whom it belongs,"" she remarked.The campaign rests on three pillars - Awareness, Access and Action. Awareness means informing people about unclaimed money; Access through RBI's UDGAM portal; and Action, where officials act on even small clues to help claimants.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets.

'You were not able to demonstrate...'







An Indian student recently received a visa rejection letter from the US that said they were not convinced that he had sufficient ties to India that would compel him to return to India after his time in the United States. In an interview with the Washington Post, Kaushik Raj revealed that he made it clear during the application process that he was born and brought up in India and that his entire family lives in India. Kaushik Raj told Post that he feels the rejection came after the US officials went through his social media profiles, which is now a mandatory process for a visa.Kaushik Raj said he was not active on social media and did not post anything on controversial issues, but he spent four years working as a journalist and posted links of his stories. The rejection letter, however, did not mention social media profiles as a reason for rejection.The 27-year-old applied for a visa as he won a $100,000 scholarship to pursue a graduate degree in journalism at Columbia University.The rejection letter said: ""You were not able to demonstrate that your intended activities in the United States would be consistent with the classification of the nonimmigrant visa for which you applied.""It said that an applicant has to demonstrate that they have a residence in a foreign country which they have no intention of abandoning.""Applicants usually meet this requirement by demonstrating that they have strong ties overseas that indicate they will return to a foreign country after a temporary visit to the United States.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged more than 4% on Monday, hitting record highs after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) elected Sanae Takaichi, an ultra-conservative and close ally of late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as its new leader, paving the way for her to become Japan’s first female prime minister.The broader Topix index also advanced 2.3%, buoyed by investor optimism that Takaichi will continue Abe’s pro-market and stimulus-heavy economic policies.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index edged 0.1% lower to 27,119.36, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was largely unchanged at 8,984.70.Markets in mainland China, Taiwan, and South Korea remained shut for holidays, AP reported.The yen weakened against the US dollar, falling to 149.79 per dollar from 149.33 a day earlier, amid expectations that Takaichi could introduce higher public spending measures, potentially adding to inflationary pressures. The euro dipped slightly to $1.1720.Takaichi, 64, is seen as a protégé of Shinzo Abe and has long admired former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Known for her hawkish views, she has vowed to strengthen Japan’s defence, boost industrial competitiveness, and implement measures to address demographic challenges such as the country’s ageing population and rising debt burden.""The Nikkei was on course to reach as high as 48,000 by year-end, but because Takaichi was chosen as the LDP leader, it shot up toward that level already,"" Hitoshi Asaoka, the chief strategist at Asset Management One told Reuters.""The market welcomes her spending policy, but whether she can achieve that goal is not certain, as the LDP is still a minority party.

'India Is Firmly In Favour Of Free, Fair And Inclusive Elections In Bangladesh': Foreign Secy Misri

NEW DELHI: India firmly supports a free, fair, inclusive and participatory national election in Bangladesh at the earliest possible time, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Monday while noting that matters related former PM Sheikh Hasina are “judicial and legal” in nature and requires “consultations” between the two neighbours.In December last year, Bangladesh sent a note verbale to India requesting the extradition of Hasina, who fled on Aug 5 amid massive protests against her Awami League government.“We are examining these issues. We look forward to working together with Bangladesh authorities on these issues,” he said while responding to a question during an interaction with members of the Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh, here.Recently, Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus had slammed India for “backing” Hasina, saying ties are strained because New Delhi didn’t like last year’s developments. “They are hosting Hasina who created all the problems and killed young people (to quell protests),” he said.On whether the events of last year — which led to a decline in India-Bangladesh ties — hindered “engagements” with the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt, Misri said, “That hasn’t prevented us from working with or engaging authorities.”Asked about reports of New Delhi trying to reinstate Hasina — being tried in absentia for “crimes against humanity” back home — and her banned party, Misri said India is only in favour of an early election in Bangladesh for an opportunity for people to express their mandate to the popularly elected govt. “We remain ready to engage with any government that emerges from this election with a popular mandate,” he said.Though Misri acknowledged there are “some issues” in the India-Bangladesh relationship, he said it is rooted in strong cultural, linguistic, religious and historical ties, and is “time-tested”. He said India’s approach towards Bangladesh has always been pragmatic.Referring to the Feb timeframe to hold the poll, Misri said the next steps in Bangladesh’s internal political process will be closely watched regionally and globally.On Dhaka’s stake in regional peace, progress and stability, he expressed confidence that Bangladesh recognises its importance. He denied commenting on the uptick in ties between Dhaka and Islamabad.","Hasina issue needs consultations, says vikram misri.

'India's rise taking place in turbulent era': EAM on new world order; challenges lie ahead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-rise-taking-place-in-turbulent-era-eam-on-new-world-order-challenges-lie-ahead/articleshow/124345183.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday described India’s rise as “an exceptional journey unfolding in a turbulent global era” as he pushed for India's autonomy in a multipolar world. Speaking at the inaugural Aravalli Summit 2025 at Jawaharlal Nehru University, he said the evolving world order demanded strategic autonomy, multi-alignment, and intellectual renewal.“It appears that it is India’s destiny that its rise take place in an exceptionally turbulent era,” Jaishankar said, reflecting on how global transformations today are far swifter than those that followed the World Wars. “When I look back at my research on the evolution of a global order in the aftermath of a World War, it seems almost glacial in comparison to the mega changes that we are witnessing today.”Jaishankar detailed several forces reshaping the world — from supply chains concentrated in one region to geopolitical rivalries over technology and energy. “A third of global manufacturing has moved to a single geography, with attendant consequences for supply chains. There is rising anti-globalisation sentiment in many societies. Trade calculations are being overturned by tariff volatility,” he said.He said India must continue to navigate this volatility with confidence and foresight.“While the majority are struggling to cope or busy defending their interests, India has to strategise and continue rising amidst such volatility,” he said. “This is by no means a defensive stance. We have to safeguard our interests and yet, continuously advance up the global hierarchy.”Jaishankar further added that India’s foreign policy should be guided by its national interest above all. “Our national interest comes above all, and that should be the final test in foreign policy making,” he said. Defending the country’s doctrine of strategic autonomy, Jaishankar posed a rhetorical question: “Imagine if today, you were not adopting strategic autonomy. Please tell me which country you would like to join up with and put our future in their hands. I can’t think of anybody.”He added that “the more turbulent and unpredictable the global order becomes, the stronger the case for multi-alignment or strategic autonomy. It actually becomes stronger, not weaker.”Expanding on India’s neighbourhood and geopolitical posture, Jaishankar said: “We have multiple neighbours and some are better than others. The hyphenation happens with a neighbour who is not so nice. From our perspective, the best way of de-hyphenation is to outstrip the other party in terms of power and capability.”Calling for greater intellectual and institutional readiness, Jaishankar urged JNU’s School of International Studies to help shape India’s next phase of engagement with the world. “SIS has been at the forefront of developing India’s capability. It has served as an inspiration for the proliferation of international relations studies in the rest of the country,” he said.He also cautioned that new threats to sovereignty were emerging from technology and information flows. “We see an erosion in sovereignty facilitated by tech penetration and manipulation. Global rules and regimes are being revisited and at times even discarded. Cost is no longer the defining criteria for economic transactions; ownership and security are equally so,” he warned.Concluding his address, Jaishankar said India’s ascent would depend not only on strategic agility but also on intellectual self-confidence. “We have to create ideas, terminologies and narratives for the journey to 2047,” he said.","External affairs minister s jaishankar spoke at the inaugural aravalli summit 2025 at jawaharlal nehru university.

Activist Sonam Wangchuk Arrested, Internet Snapped In Leh After Deadly Ladakh Clashes

SRINAGAR: Leh Apex Body (LAB), a grouping of religious and political organisations in Ladakh, rejected Monday government’s claims of normalcy in the region and accused authorities of harassing village heads (gobas) by summoning them for questioning“In our villages, gobas (nambardars) play a vital role. Nothing happens without their consent. When LAB began its hunger strike on September 10, village heads informed their villages about it. Now they are being summoned and questioned. We see this as an attack on our culture and will not accept it,” LAB co-chairman Chhering Dorje Lakruk said at a presser in Leh.Environmental activist and LAB member Sonam Wangchuk led the fast demanding Sixth Schedule status and statehood for Ladakh before the protests snowballed into violence on Sept 24, killing four people and injuring over 70. Wangchuk was arrested on Sept 26 and remains jailed under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).In Ladakh, a goba is a village headman chosen periodically by villagers through voice vote. The system remains effective as people traditionally follow the gobas’ guidance. “Some gobas were detained earlier but released due to our intervention. It is their job to inform people about the issues and the hunger strike of LAB.They shouldn’t be harassed for it,” Lakruk said.He questioned the government’s claims of normalcy, pointing to the gobas’ questioning and continued internet suspension. “The restrictions are still in place and people are being harassed,” Lakruk said. Govt should restore internet, stop arrests, lift restrictions and rebuild public confidence if it wants to normalise the situation, the LAB co-chairman said.On Saturday, Ladakh authorities had asserted that the situation was returning to normalcy while reaffirming the Centre’s commitment to a dialogue to address the aspirations of the people. The government had lauded the people of Ladakh were known for their peace-loving nature, fierce patriotism and their contribution to nation-building in securing its frontiers.After the violence of Sept 24, the authorities had imposed curfew-like restrictions, suspended internet, and arrested more than 60 people. While the administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the violence, LAB and another umbrella group Kargil Democratic Alliance have rejected it, reiterating their demand for a judicial probe by a retired Supreme Court judge.The two groups also withdrew from talks scheduled for Monday with a Union home ministry high-powered committee, seeking Wangchuk’s release and an impartial investigation.",Leh apex body (lab) rejects monday government’s claims of normalcy in the region.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Key details have emerged following the investigation of Mohammad Yousuf Katari, 26, who was arrested for his role in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Officials said on Sunday that Katari met the three terrorists behind the attack—Sulieman alias Asif, Jibran, and Hamza Afghani, four times and provided them logistical support, including an Android phone charger, which became a key piece of evidence leading to his capture, reported PTI.Katari, a resident of South Kashmir’s Kulgam district, reportedly told investigators that he had met the attackers in the Zabarwan hills outside Srinagar. He had also guided them through the difficult terrain.His arrest followed weeks of investigation, including forensic analysis of items recovered during Operation Mahadev in July, which killed the three terrorists linked to the Pahalgam massacre. Security agencies tracked the partially destroyed phone charger to Katari, confirming his connection to the attackers.Authorities indicated that Katari’s interrogation may uncover further links in the terror support network in the Kashmir Valley. The case could be transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is already probing the broader conspiracy behind the Pahalgam attack.The NIA has arrested two individuals so far in connection with the April 22 terror attack for allegedly offering logistical support and shelter to the terrorists.The April 22 attack in Baisaran, a popular tourist spot often called “mini Switzerland,” marked the deadliest terror attack in the Valley since the 2019 Pulwama attack. TRF, a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), had claimed responsibility.","Mohammad yousuf katari, 26, was arrested for his role in the april 22 pahalgam terror attack.

‘U.S. Tariffs Unfair, Actively Working To Resolve Trade Issues’: EAM Jaishankar





US President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States, effective November 1, 2025.“Beginning November 1st, 2025, all Medium and Heavy Duty Trucks coming into the United States from other Countries will be Tariffed at the Rate of 25%. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.Trump had earlier indicated that new duties on heavy truck imports would take effect on October 1, but the timeline was pushed back. The new announcement marks the latest step in his broader tariff agenda aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing.As per Bloomberg, the 25% duties are part of Trump’s expanding trade measures designed to “protect domestic industries.” The decision follows a probe launched in April by the US commerce department under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the government to impose import taxes on goods considered vital to national security.The investigation focused on medium- and heavy-duty trucks weighing over 10,000 pounds and their components, noting that a “small number” of foreign suppliers dominate the market due to “predatory trade practices.”Last month, Trump introduced a series of tariff announcements — including 100% on pharmaceutical products, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 30% on upholstered furniture — set to begin in October.At the time, he said the 25% tariff on heavy trucks would safeguard major American truck manufacturers such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner and Mack Trucks.“In order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition, I will be imposing a 25% Tariff,” Trump wrote then, describing the move as essential to keeping the nation’s truckers “financially healthy and strong” for “national security purposes”.Trump has defended his protectionist measures as a strategy to promote domestic production, despite criticism that higher import duties could increase costs for consumers and businesses.","Us president donald trump on monday announced a 25% tariff on all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported into the united states.

Trump had earlier indicated that new duties on heavy truck imports would take effect on october 1, but the timeline was pushed back.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124347493,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-707581,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

US President Donald Trump repeated the claim that he solved the conflict between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan earlier this year with the help of tariffs.While talking to reporters, Trump said, ""If I didn't have the power of tariffs, you would have at least four of the seven wars raging. I use tariffs to stop wars. If you look at India and Pakistan, They were ready to go at it. Seven plays were shot down. They were ready to go at it. And then nuclear powers. I don't want to say exactly what I said, but what I said was very effective. They stopped. And that was based on tariffs.""He also said that the United States is a peacemaker be cause of the tariff, which not only making them billionaire.""Tariffs are very important for the United States. We are a peacekeeper because of tariffs. Not only do we make hundreds of billions of dollars, but we're a peacekeeper because of tariffs,"" Trump added.This isn’t the first time Trump has made such a claim Last month, while speaking at a private dinner with Republican lawmakers at the White House, Trump said, ""We stopped a lot of wars. And these were serious, India and Pakistan, that was going on… These are two serious nuclear countries, and they were hitting each other.You know, it seems like a new form of warfare.""""Planes were being shot out of the air… five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down, actually,"" he added.However, India has been consistently maintaining that the understanding on cessation of hostilities with Pakistan was reached following direct talks between the Directors General of Military Operations of the two militaries.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear in Parliament that no leader of any country asked India to stop Operation Sindoor Tensions had sharply escalated between India and Pakistan following a deadly terror attack on April 22 in Jammu and Kashmir’s Anantnag district. The strike, carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists in Pahalgam, killed 26 people.In response, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, with the Indian Air Force (IAF) targeting nine major terror hubs inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Pakistan attempted to retaliate with drones and missile strikes, but Indian air defence systems successfully intercepted all incoming threats. As tensions rose, the IAF carried out precision strikes on 11 Pakistani airbases, including strategic sites such as Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan.While there were no casualties or structural damage reported in India, the Indian military released visual proof of the damage caused by its cross-border strikes.The IAF’s strong air defence capabilities played a crucial role in safeguarding Indian airspace during the exchange, neutralising multiple UAV and drone threats.","'stopped india-pakistan nuclear war': trump's explosive claim, repeats 'five jets were shot down' last month, while speaking at a private dinner with republican lawmakers at the white house, trump said, ""we stopped a lot of wars""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124350818,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-44386,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Trump’s 20-point plan and hostage deal



Hamas, Israel still at odds over key issues



Next round of talks set in Egypt



Bridging gaps will be crucial to final deal







Despite Hamas formally partially agreeing to key elements of US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to implement the first stage, a full resolution to the Gaza war remains uncertain. The partial acceptance by Hamas and Israel’s initial moves have raised hopes for a breakthrough, but critical gaps over disarmament, governance, and troop withdrawal continue to keep the conflict unresolved. The conflict’s human toll, and the political stakes for Netanyahu and Hamas, make even tentative steps fraught with tension and uncertainty.US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Sunday that there is finally a framework for ending the war in Gaza and freeing the remaining hostages. ""What gives you hope here is that at least there now is a framework for how all of this can come to an end, and those hostages can be released,"" Rubio told Fox News, a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was close to finalizing a hostage deal with Hamas. He indicated that Israel was preparing to take the first steps outlined in President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war.President Trump on Sunday also urged Hamas and Israeli negotiators to ""move fast"" as they are set to meet in Egypt for talks aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza.""There have been very positive discussions with Hamas, and Countries from all over the World (Arab, Muslim, and everyone else) this weekend, to release the Hostages, end the War in Gaza but, more importantly, finally have long sought PEACE in the Middle East,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.""These talks have been very successful, and proceeding rapidly. The technical teams will again meet Monday, in Egypt, to work through and clarify the final details. I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST,"" he added.Rubio said progress had been made but cautioned that the war was not yet over. Asked whether the conflict had ended, he said, ""Well, not yet. There's some work that remains to be done.""A day before the indirect talks were scheduled to begin in Egypt, Israel said it had shifted its forces in Gaza to a defensive posture.Trump presented a 20-point plan last Monday to free the remaining hostages held in Gaza and end Israel’s military campaign against Hamas. Around 20 hostages are believed to be alive and another 25 dead in Gaza.On Friday, hours after Trump said that an agreement must be reached within days or Hamas would face ""all HELL,"" the group announced that it was ready to release all hostages under the plan’s terms.Trump’s proposal calls for hostages to be exchanged for 250 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel and 1,700 Gaza residents detained during the war. Trump welcomed Hamas’ statement, saying the group was ""ready for a lasting PEACE.""Several hours after Hamas released its statement, Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for ""the immediate release of all the hostages"" and would continue working with Trump ""to bring the war to an end in accordance with the principles set forth by Israel.""Netanyahu said Saturday that he hoped to tell Israelis ""in the coming days"" that the remaining hostages were coming home. Israeli negotiators were expected to travel to Egypt for talks on finalizing the deal, he added.Israel’s military remains positioned at key locations in the Gaza Strip. It launched an expanded ground offensive in Gaza City in September, leading to mass displacement of Palestinians to southern Gaza. Israel maintains that Gaza City remains one of Hamas’s last strongholds.It remains uncertain whether Hamas would agree to disarm. The group has not said whether it accepts having no future role in Gaza’s administration, only stating that it would transfer governance ""to a Palestinian body of independent technocrats.""Netanyahu has repeatedly said Israel would not accept any deal that leaves Hamas in control of Gaza. ""This will happen either diplomatically, according to Trump's plan, or militarily — at our hands,"" he said on Saturday. ""This will be achieved the easy way or the hard way, but it will be achieved.""While Hamas’ response to Trump’s plan has been welcomed by the US and several other countries, key questions about the end of the war remain unresolved.Trump’s 20-point plan requires Hamas to release all hostages within 72 hours, surrender power to a transitional international authority led by Trump, and disarm. In exchange, Israel would withdraw its troops from Gaza in stages and release more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.The plan also includes large-scale humanitarian aid to Gaza and reconstruction support for areas destroyed by the war.Hamas has agreed to three points — the release of hostages, the surrender of administrative power, and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. However, it said other elements of the deal would need to be discussed collectively with other Palestinian factions as part of a ""collective national stance.""This means Hamas wants further negotiations on contentious issues, including the disarmament clause and a concrete timeline for Israeli withdrawal.A new round of talks between Israel and Hamas is set to begin Monday in Egypt. The two sides will negotiate indirectly, with Qatari and Egyptian mediators relaying messages.Tuesday will mark two years since the Hamas-led attack that triggered the war.An Israeli delegation led by chief negotiator Ron Dermer is expected to leave for Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, Netanyahu’s office said. Egyptian officials confirmed that the Hamas delegation had already arrived. Talks will focus on the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, according to Egypt’s foreign ministry.Both sides are entering the talks with reservations.Hamas has previously refused to disarm, and it has not indicated any change in its stance. Trump and Israel have both said there is little flexibility on this issue, emphasizing that disarmament must be part of any deal.Hamas has said it is willing to hand over power to a Palestinian technocratic government, but not to the international transitional authority outlined in Trump’s plan.Israel, meanwhile, has left its troop withdrawal timeline vague. Just hours after Trump announced the peace plan, Netanyahu released a video assuring Israelis that troops would stay in most of Gaza.On Saturday night, Netanyahu again said Israeli forces would remain ""deep inside the strip"" even as hostages were released. His statement conflicts with Trump’s plan, which requires full Israeli withdrawal. Hamas is likely to seek guarantees that Israeli forces will leave and that international mechanisms will ensure compliance.Negotiators will have to close the gaps by obtaining firm commitments on Hamas’ disarmament and Israel’s withdrawal. The US is expected to push both sides toward a final agreement.However, both parties remain cautious. Previous negotiations over the past two years have repeatedly collapsed at the final stage, leaving diplomats wary of predicting success until a formal agreement is signed.","Us secretary of state marco rubio said on sunday that there is finally a framework for ending the war in gaza and freeing the remaining hostages.

With only a month left for the mayoral election, Zojran Mamdani visited the two oldest temples of the city in Flushing, Queens, where he spoke about his Hindu connection. Before his mayoral run, Mamdani was in the news for leading a hate mob in NYC that targeted Ram Mandir. On Sunday, he said the Hindu community has been showcasing what 'seva' (service) looks like for decades, oftentimes without any recognition.""I am proud that I would be the first Indian-American mayor of this city. I am proud of the fact that my mother's family is Hindu. And I grew up with a keen understanding, whilst myself being a Muslim, what Hinduism means. The stories that I learned, the tradition, the faith, the practises, whether it's Raksha Bandhan, Diwali, Holi...it's one thing that taught me many of the values that I hold so dear today,"" Mamdani said.Mamdani also said that his mother Mira Nair told him that he was named Zohran because it means the first star in the sky.""For Gujaratis, Punjabis, for Indians across the city and the world, I would not be here, were it not the family that raised me and the family that taught me the values, the ideals I hold. Those are values and ideals that make me proud to be an Indian-American,"" Mamdani said, adding that the temple safeguarded the freedom of religion not only for the Hindus of New York but all New Yorkers.The mayoral poll is now tilted in favor of Mamdani after he received endorsements from top Democrats, including former VP Kamala Harris, and the exit of Eric Adams from the race. Mamdani and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo are now the frontrunners; Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa is still in the fray.","Zohran mamdani visited two oldest temples of nyc sunday and spoke about his connection to hindu faith.

What is a Humanitarian and Compassionate Application for Canada PR ?







Canadians are outraged over a viral video of an Indian influencer suggesting people to get their babies born in Canada so that they can get Canadian PR on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Speaking in Hindi, the influencer said this could be the last option when all other routes to get permanent residency in Canada. He advised that this is ot a fool-proof route and rejections can happen and so one should take this route only after proper planning and legal consultation.""This should be your last option,"" the man said, asking his viewers to comment 'baby' to get more information.While the date of the video is not clear, it has now surfaced -- riding on the anti-India wave across US-Canada -- irking Canadians about the detailed scheming going on to get permanent residency in Canada.""The parasite class is now promoting to have a baby in Canada as a way to get Permanent Residence. Liberal's BillC3 will turn this into chain mass citizenship handouts. We need every loophole closed and mass deportation immediately,"" one wrote.One blamed the liberal government for allowing such loopholes and said that the liberal government is the real parasite. Many exclaimed how this route can be advertised like this.The Humanitarian and Compassionate (H&C) grounds application is a special pathway that allows a person already living in Canada without permanent status to apply for PR based on exceptional personal circumstances. It is not a standard immigration stream, but a discretionary decision made by IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada). People who are already in Canada and do not qualify for other PR programs can apply for this, showing that leaving Canada would cause hardship for the family -- the case becomes strengthened if there is a Canadian citizen child.Parents of Canada-born children do not become Canadian citizens automatically, though the baby automatically becomes a Canadian citizen. To get Canadian PR, parents have to qualify through Express Entry (for skilled workers), Provincial Nominee Programs, family sponsorship, study or work permits.","Canadians slam video promoting giving birth in canada to get permanent residency in the country.

A tragic end has come for Marcus Fakana, a 19-year-old British teenager who was released from a Dubai prison earlier this year after serving time for having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl while on holiday. Just three months after regaining his freedom, Fakana died following a police pursuit and subsequent car collision in Tottenham, north London.Marcus Fakana’s story is marked by legal troubles overseas, emotional hardship, and a sudden fatal incident back home. In 2024, while vacationing with his parents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Fakana entered a relationship with a girl who was almost 18 at the time. The relationship, which began as a “holiday romance,” was reported to authorities by the girl’s mother after she discovered messages between the two upon their return to the UK. Under Emirati law, having a sexual relationship with someone under 18 is illegal, despite the UK’s age of consent being 16. Fakana was arrested and sentenced to one year in prison in Dubai. He was later granted a royal pardon by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai’s ruler, in July 2025.Only three months after his release—from July 3 to October 3—Fakana’s life was cut short in a car accident following a police chase in London.He was a passenger in a car which failed to stop after being requested to by the Metropolitan Police. The collision occurred shortly after midnight on Pretoria Road, Tottenham, when officers attempted to stop a “vehicle of interest.” The police pursued the vehicle for about 60 seconds before losing sight of it. The car was later found on The Roundway, having collided with another vehicle. Fakana was rushed to the hospital but died in the early hours of Friday.The driver of the vehicle involved in the crash, Marwaan Mohamed Huseen, 19, from Argyle Road, Tottenham, has been charged with several offences:Huseen appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court on Saturday and has been remanded into custody. His next court appearance is scheduled for October 30 at the Old Bailey. Following the incident, the Metropolitan Police’s Directorate of Professional Standards and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) were notified to investigate the circumstances around the police chase and crash.Radha Stirling, CEO of the campaign group Detained in Dubai, which supported Fakana during his imprisonment, expressed deep sorrow over his passing. She highlighted the severe emotional toll Fakana endured:“Marcus spent the majority of this year in a Dubai prison which no doubt caused him long-lasting mental anguish. It’s sad that of all of 2025, he was only free for the three months from the 3rd of July until the 3rd of October.”Stirling further noted that Fakana was “grateful for the compassion shown to him by the British public” and that his experience led him to embrace Christianity and prayer. Despite the hardships, he was hopeful about his future and thankful for his regained freedom.Raphaella Stirling, crisis manager at Detained in Dubai, echoed these sentiments on social media, saying:“Marcus had only been released from prison earlier this year. Despite everything he endured, he embraced his freedom with renewed faith, joy, and hope for the future. His loss is a painful reminder of how precious life is and how unnecessary imprisonment robs people of time they can never regain.”Friends and supporters also paid tribute to Fakana online, with many expressing heartbreak and sorrow over his untimely death. One comment reflected the frustration felt by those who had campaigned for his release: “I fought for you to be released from prison in Dubai, I did my best and this is how it ended.”Fakana’s arrest and imprisonment stemmed from differing legal standards between the UAE and the UK. While the UK permits consensual sexual relationships from age 16, the UAE enforces stricter laws where sex under 18 is illegal. Fakana and the girl involved kept their relationship secret due to her family’s strictness and had planned to continue seeing each other back in the UK.The emotional consequences of the case have been profound. Fakana’s mother and family remain supported by specialist officers after his death. His story highlights the significant impact of overseas imprisonment on mental health and the devastating loss of a young life just as it was beginning to regain normalcy.","Marcus fakana, 19, was a passenger in a car that failed to stop during a brief police chase, leading to a fatal collision in london.

The Peace Prize Paradox







If Donald Trump could trademark “peace,” he would. Ahead of the Nobel Peace Prize announcement on October 10, the president is campaigning harder for Oslo’s approval than he ever did for Wisconsin’s votes. His newest pitch? A “20-point Gaza peace plan” that he claims could end one of the world’s most intractable conflicts — and win him the most coveted medal not made in Mar-a-Lago.He calls it “the greatest peace deal of all time.” The Nobel Committee is unlikely to agree.Trump’s obsession with the Nobel isn’t new. He’s been demanding it since the Abraham Accords, arguing that if Barack Obama got one for “showing up,” he should get at least two for “saving the Middle East.” This year, though, his lobbying has gone full diplomatic theatre.At the UN, he declared that “everyone says I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.” Behind closed doors, his envoy Steve Witkoff has been nudging European counterparts; Marco Rubio has been reminding allies; and Pfizer’s Albert Bourla has even chimed in, praising Operation Warp Speed as Nobel-worthy. The entire MAGA machine has turned into a PR agency for peace — peace, of course, defined by Trump himself.The timing of Trump’s Gaza initiative is not accidental. Days before the Nobel announcement, he unveiled a 20-point plan that supposedly guarantees ceasefire, reconstruction, and hostage release. Hamas agreed to free all captives but insisted the rest “requires negotiation” — which, in diplomatic language, means “we’ll see after the cameras leave.”For Trump, that’s enough to sell it as a historic breakthrough. For the Nobel Committee, which prefers long-term stability to press-conference theatre, it’s a tougher call.The Norwegians find themselves in an awkward spot. Their $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund recently divested from Israeli firms, triggering fury among US Republicans. Trump has already slapped 15 percent tariffs on Norwegian imports and could easily escalate if snubbed.Nordic political culture prizes understatement. Trump’s entire personality is a federal crime in Norway. As Professor Hilde Restad notes, “Culturally, Trump is very much an antithesis for Norway.” In simpler terms, you don’t shout your way to a Peace Prize.Yet Trump’s logic is pure branding: keep shouting until someone mistakes the noise for applause. Even if he loses, he wins the narrative — the victim of a “rigged Nobel,” wronged by “global elites,” and vindicated by “real Americans.”This year’s 338 nominees include journalists’ groups, Sudan’s aid volunteers, and Yulia Navalnaya. Trump’s nomination came courtesy of New York congresswoman Claudia Tenney, who has built an international support network lobbying for his win. Ukraine’s Oleksandr Merezhko also nominated him — then withdrew, saying he’d “lost trust” after Trump ignored Russia’s attacks on Kyiv.But withdrawals don’t trend on Truth Social.Online odds place Trump third, behind Navalnaya and Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms. But Nobel betting is notoriously unreliable — last year’s favourite was Navalny himself, despite posthumous awards being banned.If he loses, expect a digital onslaught. If he wins, expect a victory rally featuring the phrase “greatest Nobel in history.” Either way, Trump’s base will celebrate — because in MAGA world, perception is policy.The Nobel Peace Prize has never been about peace alone; it’s about symbolism. When Obama won, the committee bet on hope. When Liu Xiaobo won, it bet on defiance. When Trump lobbies, he bets on intimidation. The question for the Norwegian Nobel Committee is simple: reward the world’s loudest salesman for a peace plan still in beta, or uphold its century-old ideal of moral independence. If Trump doesn’t win, he’ll call it fake. If he does, he’ll call it destiny. Either way, come October 10, Oslo will once again prove Alfred Nobel’s greatest invention wasn’t dynamite.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH





The Hindu American Foundation Monday said they do not work as the spokesperson of any Indian government or any political party, reacting to MP Shashi Tharoor's allegation that the Indian-American community remained largely silent or absent as the US and India are caught in a quandary over several conflicting issues like tariffs and H-1B visas.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor recently met a delegation of Indian-American politicians in India and claimed that one of them told Tharoor that her office did not get any call from any Indian-American voter asking her to raise the issue with India.The silence of the Indian-origin tech CEOs has also come under scrutiny as they use the H-1B visa programs the most and now that the Donald Trump administration raised the H-1B visa fee to $100,000, these companies will have to pay the fee if they want to hire Indians or skilled people from any other countries.Tharoor's accusation triggered a debate with many Indian-Americans commenting that their situation is difficult as they are often considered as 'foreign agents' in India and 'deportable' in the US.""As American citizens of Indian origin we are indeed in a unique position to provide nuance to often one-dimensional narratives about India and Indians. We help elected leaders understand ground realities in India and dispel disinformation, not as mouthpieces for any Indian government or political party, but as Americans who straddle both cultures and are engaged in the democratic processes of our own country.And we do,"" the Hindu American Foundation said.Tharoor replied to the pushback and said he's happy that his questions got the diaspora thinking. ""Their challenges are indeed different from those of Jewish-Americans and Cuban-Americans, the examples I cited in my piece. But that doesn’t mean that within the rules of US democracy, they can’t make their voices heard — as these other groups so effectively do!"" he said.Earlier, HAF director Suhag A Shukla reacted to Tharoor's allegation and said the Indian government should not expect the diaspora to become their lobbyist. ""The Govt of India does not ask our approval for its oil policy or import duties, and so @shashitharoor and the GOI shouldn't be expecting us to champion their sovereign policy decisions with the U.S. government. They can hire lobbyists for that,"" she said.",The hindu american foundation said they do not work as the spokesperson of any indian government or any political party.
