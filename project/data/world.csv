Why Toronto Maple Leafs star Mitch Marner needs a clean NHL break



A Blizzard of Goals Puts Florida a Win Away From Glory | 32 Thoughts

Top NHL teams in the Western Conference could pursue Mitch Marner

The NHL offseason buzz is centered on Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner, and his teammates may have already revealed the biggest clue. Several Leafs players reportedly believe Marner’s next destination lies out West, away from the pressure cooker of Toronto and the emotional ties to the Eastern Conference.As NHL insider Elliotte Friedman recently shared, the belief in the Leafs locker room is that Marner wants a full reset, and a Western Conference team would offer just that. While the Carolina Hurricanes have shown interest, Friedman downplayed their chances, pointing instead to a desire for a clean break and long-term distance from his current team.Since entering the league, Mitch Marner has carried both the hopes and frustrations of Toronto Maple Leafs fans. Postseason disappointments and salary cap debates have often overshadowed a skilled playmaker and top-line winger, Marner’s regular-season consistency.The attention and pressure from the Canadian hockey market have seemingly taken a toll. After years of scrutiny, Marner is now believed to be craving something the Leafs can no longer provide, freedom from expectations.As trade talks heat up, several NHL teams in the Western Conference are emerging as potential fits for Mitch Marner.Though no official suitors have been named, teams like the Los Angeles Kings, Vegas Golden Knights, and Seattle Kraken have cap space and a desire to bolster their top-six forward groups.Early offseason chatter linked Marner to the Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers, but remaining in the Atlantic Division now appears unlikely. Facing the Maple Leafs multiple times each season while still in the Eastern spotlight runs counter to Marner’s apparent desire to fade from that narrative.According to teammate insight and league reports, this is about more than hockey. Mitch Marner wants control over his next chapter, and that next chapter seems destined to begin far from Toronto, in the quieter lanes of the NHL’s Western frontier. Don’t be surprised if talks stretch deep into the summer. Marner’s $10.9 million cap hit means any deal will require strategic balancing from both sides.In the meantime, fan opinion remains divided. Some still believe Marner deserves more time, while others see his exit as a necessary evolution for the franchise. Mitch Marner’s future with the Maple Leafs seems increasingly uncertain as trade rumors intensify. A move to the Western Conference could offer the reset he’s reportedly seeking. With emotional fatigue setting in and pressure mounting, Marner’s next chapter may unfold far from Toronto’s spotlight.Mitch Marner’s future with the Toronto Maple Leafs is shrouded in uncertainty, as teammates believe a Western Conference move is likely. Tired of constant scrutiny and emotional weight, Marner is reportedly seeking a full reset away from Toronto’s spotlight.

'Will Skin Them Alive': Iranians Make Huge DECLARATION Against Israel Amid Threat To Khamenei





Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in series of posts on early Wednesday warned the ""terrorist Zionist regime"" and said “the battle begins” amid escalating tensions with Israel. Khamenei's post came following escalating threats from US President Donald Trump, who had just hours before called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender.""Moments later, Khamenei posted on X: “We must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy.” The statement came shortly after Iran launched two rounds of ballistic missiles at Israel early Wednesday.Khamenei’s posts appeared to frame the attacks as part of a broader ideological struggle. In Farsi, he posted “the battle begins”, alongside an image of a man with a sword entering a castle gate, alluding to the historic battle of Khaybar, as per the Times of Israel.In a series of posts on his platform Truth Social Trump had claimed the United States had full control of Iranian airspace and warned that the country’s top leader was within reach. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump had wrote.“But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” He later followed up with a post calling for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”Iran fired the latest barrage of missiles around 12.40 am which triggered sirens across of Israel and included around 15 projectiles. A second wave of about 10 rockets followed roughly 40 minutes later, prompting alerts in central parts of the country and the West Bank. Although there were no reported casualties, a fire broke out in a central Israeli parking lot, damaging several cars.Warning sirens were also activated around the Dead Sea due to what officials described as a suspected drone infiltration.Read: How Iran’s Supreme Commander Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lost his top commanders Meanwhile, Israel continued its offensive inside Iranian territory. Early Wednesday morning, the Israel defense forces (IDF) called for residents of Tehran’s District 18 to evacuate, citing upcoming military action targeting strategic infrastructure. Soon after, Israeli forces confirmed a new wave of airstrikes in Tehran. Reports also emerged of explosions in the city of Karaj, previously the site of a nuclear centrifuge facility targeted by Israeli strikes.Israel launched its military campaign six days ago, calling the assault necessary to dismantle what it described as an “existential threat” posed by Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. According to Israeli officials, the ongoing operation aims to eliminate top Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists, missile launch sites and uranium enrichment centres.The conflict has already caused significant casualties. Iranian authorities report at least 224 people killed in Israeli strikes, while Israel says over 370 missiles and hundreds of drones have been launched by Iran.

US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early Tuesday, Trump made his stance clear. “I’m not too much in the mood to negotiate with Iran,” he said, adding that his goal is a permanent solution: “an end, a real end, not a ceasefire.”Later, on Truth Social, Trump doubled down, calling for Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” and stating that the US knows “exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”US defence officials had made arrangements anticipating Trump's potential directive for the US Air Force to support Israeli fighter aircraft with refuelling during their operations over Iran, two sources told CNN.These sources indicated that this consideration partly explains why more than 30 aerial refuelling tankers have been deployed to the region in recent days.Refueling Israeli jets midair would be one of the least aggressive forms of support.Still, CENTCOM has presented Trump with the possibility of joint US-Israel strikes on nuclear facilities.Vice President JD Vance echoed the urgency, posting on X that Trump “may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president.”Trump met with his national security team in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday. Israeli officials, who have been urging US involvement, expressed optimism but said no formal decision from the US had been conveyed yet.While Trump had previously avoided direct military involvement beyond missile defense and intelligence sharing, his recent statements — including “we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran” — suggest a shift.“Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn’t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured ‘stuff.’ Nobody does it better than the good ol’ USA,” he wrote on Truth Social.After Israel launched strikes on Iran early Friday, it claimed Iran was rapidly advancing toward building nuclear weapons.However, a US intelligence report earlier this year said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear bomb, though mounting pressure may be pushing the regime to restart its nuclear program.The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium in recent months. Iran continues to insist its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.While President Trump has not confirmed direct US involvement, his recent posts on Truth Social have stirred speculation. Trump’s increasingly aggressive tone and use of the term “we” in reference to military actions have raised questions about the extent of American involvement.And one of the key targets being considered is Iran’s Fordo nuclear site, a heavily fortified uranium enrichment facility buried deep under a mountain. According to Brett McGurk, a former US official who served under four presidents, “Fordo is the crux of this thing.” Destroying it would deal a major blow to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but only the US has the firepower to make that happen.Military experts agree that multiple precision strikes by American B-2 bombers would be needed in a carefully coordinated mission. The New York Times reports that the Pentagon has rehearsed this scenario, which involves dropping a series of bombs ""down the same hole"" to penetrate Fordo's deep underground structure.Fordo is located nearly 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by heavy air defenses. It is widely believed to be Iran’s most likely site for developing nuclear weapons, as it is where Iran has enriched uranium and expanded its stockpile.","Us president donald trump is weighing the possibility of us involvement in israel’s ongoing strikes on iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told cbs news.

Canada's British Columbia premier David Eby said that he will request Prime Minister Mark Carney to declare the Lawrence Bishnoi gang a ""terrorist organisation"" in the country, adding that it had been linked to many crimes.On Tuesday, the premier said he will write to Carney about it ""to enable police to be able to use the necessary tools to investigate.""He alleged that the gang had been linked to extortion and other crimes against South Asian community members in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.Canada's police had earlier reported that South Asian community members are being extorted under threat of violence or death. Adding that Lawrence Bishnoi gang has been linked to some of those threats.""This is a serious step,"" Eby said. ""We don't make this recommendation lightly, but this activity strikes at public confidence in the justice system, in our democracy.""As Eby stressed his demand, Balpreet Singh from World Sikh Organisation said he supports his request.""Extortions are at an all-time high here in Canada. That members of the Sikh community and now others as well are being extorted for money, and their houses are being shot up, and there are threats against their lives,"" said Singh.Meanwhile, Elenore Sturko, B C Opposition public safety critic, opposed Eby's demand, saying that other issues need addressing.Sturko asserted that she is unaware that police ""definitively"" linked Bishnoi gang to extortion cases, further questioning the timing of Eby's comment.""The police haven't come out and told my community that this gang is responsible for these incidents,"" she said. ""This is a very dramatic and headline-grabbing thing that the premier's done today, but I hope it doesn't distract from the fact that there are other issues at play here that need addressing,"" she added.This comes amid PM Modi's visit to Canada after a period of friction between New Delhi and Ottawa.

"Israel strikes Iran: Centrifuge site hit, 50 jets involved; why its a big blow to Tehran's nuclear programme",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-strikes-iran-centrifuge-site-hit-50-jets-involved-why-its-a-big-blow-to-tehrans-nuclear-programme/articleshow/121923651.cms,"(Image credits: AP)

Poll Do you believe military strikes on nuclear infrastructure reduce the threat of conflict? Yes, they help prevent greater danger No, they escalate tensions further

Why it matters

Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP):

Around 13,500 of 17,000 centrifuges operating

Site suffered power supply destruction, halting operations

Fordow Facility:

Deeply buried, largely undamaged

Produces most of Iran’s uranium enriched to 60%

Recently generated 166.6 kg of 60% enriched uranium, enough for nearly four bombs if further refined





Israel’s military on Wednesday said that more than 50 fighter jets carried out extensive overnight airstrikes on Iranian military infrastructure, including a centrifuge production site in Tehran, marking one of the most significant attacks in the ongoing conflict between the two countries. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the mission targeted Iran’s nuclear weapons development efforts and its missile production industry.“The IDF attacked a centrifuge production site and several weapons production sites of the Iranian regime last night,” the military said in a statement. “More than 50 Air Force fighter jets, under precise intelligence guidance from the Intelligence Branch, have completed a series of attacks on military targets in the Tehran area in recent hours.”Israel said the centrifuge site was intended to accelerate uranium enrichment specifically for nuclear weapons development. “The Iranian regime is enriching uranium intended for the development of nuclear weapons,” the IDF added, noting that the level of enrichment far exceeds what is needed for civilian purposes. Among other targets struck were facilities producing surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missile components.Centrifuges are critical to uranium enrichment, the process by which uranium is refined for civilian energy use or, at higher levels, for nuclear weapons. These delicate machines spin uranium hexafluoride gas at extremely high speeds using finely balanced rotors. Even minor disruptions, such as power cuts, can cause the entire cascade to collapse.The Israeli Defence Forces stated that they struck a centrifuge production site in Tehran, not an operational facility, aiming to disrupt Iran’s capacity to expand enrichment. The IDF said the site was ""intended to enable the Iranian regime to expand the scope and pace of its uranium enrichment for nuclear weapons development.""According to the IAEA, Iran had three enrichment plants active when Israeli strikes began. Notable developments include:The attack comes as the conflict between Israel and Iran enters its sixth day, with casualties mounting and hundreds of missiles exchanged. Human rights groups estimate that more than 580 people have been killed in Iran alone, including civilians. Tehran has yet to acknowledge the full extent of the damage, but explosions were heard across the capital in the early hours of Wednesday, prompting residents to flee.Read: If Khamenei is slain, who will rule Iran? Behind the scenes of Supreme Leader succession battle President Donald Trump, meanwhile, intensified his rhetoric, demanding Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” and warning that the US knows the location of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “He is an easy target, but is safe there—we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump said on social media. He also rejected Iranian claims that their nuclear programme is peaceful, insisting Tehran came dangerously close to developing a bomb.Trump cut short his participation at the G7 summit to return to Washington and has been in constant contact with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The US has repositioned military assets in the region, though Trump has so far resisted direct military involvement, despite calls from allies like Senator Lindsey Graham to deliver a decisive blow to Iran.Iran has vowed more retaliation. “The punishment operation will be carried out soon,” said General Abdul Rahim Mousavi, commander of Iran’s army. As new salvos of missiles were fired toward Israel, most were intercepted, but Israeli officials continue to warn citizens to stay near shelters. Tensions remain high, with the prospect of wider conflict looming.\Read: Iran's Khamenei hits back at Trump's threats; US may join strikes","More than 50 fighter jets carried out extensive overnight airstrikes on iranian military infrastructure, including a centrifuge production site in tehran.

Billionaire investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has rejected the concept of work-life balance for ambitious professionals, arguing that true success requires round-the-clock dedication and sacrifice.""There is no balance,"" Cuban told Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons during a recent episode of Sports Illustrated's ""The Playbook"" series. ""People are like, 'I need a work-life balance.' If you want to work 9-to-5, you can have work-life balance. If you want to crush the game, whatever game you're in, there's somebody working 24 hours a day to kick your ass.""The former Shark Tank investor, worth $5.7 billion according to Forbes, practiced what he preaches during his early entrepreneurial years. Cuban revealed he ""didn't take a vacation for the next seven years"" after launching his first technology company, MicroSolutions , at age 24.""I was broke as f-ck, where else was I going to go?"" Cuban explained, describing his living situation at the time as sharing a ""nasty"" three-bedroom apartment with five roommates.The intense focus proved profitable. During those seven vacation-free years, MicroSolutions grew to over $30 million in annual sales before Cuban sold the company to H&R Block for $6 million.""If I took the weekend, the whole thing could fall into the sh-tter,"" Cuban said, explaining his decision to work every day without breaks.Cuban's philosophy extends to modern workers, particularly in the AI era. ""If I was 16, 18, 20, 21 starting today, I would spend every waking minute learning about AI,"" he said at SXSW earlier this year. ""Even if I am sleeping, I am listening to podcasts talking about AI.""When Parsons expressed his desire to work ""non-stop,"" Cuban responded supportively: ""That's not a sacrifice.

Georgia football recruiting scores big with OT Ekene Ogboko

Ekene Ogboko's commitment boosts Georgia's offensive line future

“They made it clear I was a priority,” he said. “I wanted a place that can get me to the league, and Georgia does that.”

Four-star offensive tackle Ekene Ogboko, a top-tier 2026 lineman, chose to pledge to the University of Georgia. The 6-6’, 270-pound product from Durham, N.C., picked the Bulldogs over Clemson, Florida, and Notre Dame. The move provides a huge boost to Georgia's offensive line future and pairs him up with his older brother, Nnamdi Ogboko, who currently plays on the Bulldogs' defensive line.Ogboko had enjoyed an active spring with officials at Clemson, Georgia, and Florida before the decision. The standout offensive lineman became a major target for Georgia's coaches, especially head coach Kirby Smart, after the Bulldogs lost out on elite OT prospects early in the cycle. The Bulldogs held on and landed one of the most physically gifted and technically sound offensive linemen in the 2026 class.Georgia has the recruiting win by landing Ogboko, as the Bulldogs lost ground earlier in the process to Miami and USC for other elite tackles. His versatility and upside alone make him a candidate to compete for early playing time, considering Georgia's relative uncertainty in its offensive line depth chart at the moment.As the fourth top-50 recruit to commit to the Bulldogs this cycle, Ogboko joins quarterback Jared Curtis and defensive backs Justice Fitzpatrick and Zechariah Fort.From scouting reports, Ogboko is described as possessing size, raw power, and impressive footwork, all traits that give him high-end potential as an edge prospect. He should be a multi-year starter who plays his way into the NFL Draft as well, and he's an ideal fit in the Georgia pipeline of great offensive linemen. Having the ability to play on either side of the line allows him to provide some very important versatility to Georgia's trenches of the future.Also Read: 'Keep em coming': 4-star RB Javian Osborne reacts to prediction for Devin Fitzgerald to Notre Dame Family was another important aspect of his decision.

Iran Releases Second Video Of Hypersonic Missile Attack On Israel; Fattah-1 Fired Towards Tel Aviv





Israel may be running dangerously low on its stock of Arrow missile interceptors, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal that cites a senior US official.The warning comes as Israel faces an unprecedented volume of ballistic missile attacks from Iran in the sixth day of full-blown conflict between the two countries.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not confirmed any shortage and maintains that its air defence systems are successfully intercepting most incoming missiles. “The IDF is prepared and ready to handle any scenario. Unfortunately, we are unable to comment on matters related to munitions,” the military said in a statement.However, the American report suggests that the US has been aware of the problem for months and has quietly bolstered Israel’s defences with additional ground, sea, and air-based systems. The Pentagon has deployed assets including the Patriot and THAAD missile defence systems, while US Navy destroyers are assisting in intercept operations.Israel’s own Arrow system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries, plays a critical role in intercepting long-range ballistic missiles.But with Iran firing hundreds of missiles in recent days, including the advanced Fatah-1 which Tehran says can escape current defence systems, pressure on Israel’s Arrow missile stock is growing.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards claim these missiles move at hypersonic speeds, making them harder to stop.Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that US and Israel cannot intercept missiles forever.“Neither the US nor the Israelis can continue to sit and intercept missiles all day. The Israelis and their friends need to move with all deliberate haste to do whatever needs to be done, because we cannot afford to sit and play catch,"" Karako said.Meanwhile, Israel has launched a new wave of attacks on Tehran in broad daylight, using over 50 fighter jets. The IDF said these strikes targeted a centrifuge production facility in Tehran used to enhance uranium enrichment and multiple other military production sites.In response, alerts for hostile aircraft were triggered multiple times on Wednesday morning in the Golan Heights. The IDF reported intercepting seven drones launched from Iran, preventing them from reaching Israeli territory.The escalating crisis has also affected civil aviation. Israeli airline El Al landed its first “Safe Return” evacuation flight from Cyprus at Ben Gurion Airport on Wednesday morning, amid tightened security protocols.Adding fuel to the fire, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted on social media: “Force must be used against the Zionist terrorist entity. We will not show leniency toward the Zionists.”US President Donald Trump has said it would be ""easy"" for the superpower to locate and eliminate Iran’s leader.

Who are the seven men?







Seven men from California, including illegal immigrants, have been charged in thefts that the US Attorney's Office call the ""largest jewelry heist in US history"". Starting in March 2022, these men put a system in place where they just walked away with cargo load after cargo load with no bullets being fired or anyone witnessing them doing the massive plunder. And it continued for three years.Prosecutors said the robbery crew was scouting an international jewelry show on July 10, 2022, south of San Francisco in San Mateo when they saw the Brinks truck being loaded with a virtual treasure chest of goods. They followed the truck and when the truck stopped at a gas station about the driver and the guard went inside, these men quickly broke in and picked only some of the bags. Out of 73 bags containing millions of dollars worth of jewelry, they took 24, prosecutors said.Then these men disappeared, deactivated their cellphones and tried to cover their tracks the best.Before that, these men used the same modus operandi to rob a box truck containing Apple AirTags from China, and another semitruck with Samsung electronics.The investigators had a tough job cracking the case as there was no witness, making them rely mostly on surveillance footage and cell phone records. Prosecutors said they did not know how these men were spending any proceeds from the theft.""We don't have any information about them spending lavishly,"" Jena MacCabe, an assistant US Attorney, said. ""I think as we continue to investigate this and look into what's been going on the past few years with these defendants, we'll know more. But right now, I don't know what they've done with all the spoils from this.""Carlos Victor Mestanza Cercado, 31, Pasadena, California.Jazael Padilla Resto, a.k.a.

Standing beside a newly installed flagpole on the White House lawn, US President Donald Trump dropped a mix of warning and ambiguity on Wednesday, refusing to confirm or deny whether the United States will launch strikes on Iran amid its ongoing conflict with Israel.Pressed by reporters on possible US military action, Trump said with a smirk, “I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do.” He added, “You don’t seriously think I’m going to answer that question.”What Trump did confirm, however, was that Iran has reached out to negotiate. “Iran’s got a lot of trouble and they want to negotiate,” he said. “And I told them, why didn’t you talk to me two weeks ago? You could’ve done fine. You would’ve had a country.”The remarks come after nearly a week of escalating conflict in the region, with Israel claiming air dominance over Tehran and launching multiple strikes on Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure.While Trump initially distanced the US from the Israeli offensive, his recent statements and increased military deployments to the region suggest Washington may be positioning itself for deeper involvement, or using the threat of it as leverage. Either way, Trump appears content keeping Tehran, and the world, guessing.","Us president donald trump refused to confirm or deny whether the united states will launch strikes on iran amid its ongoing conflict with israel.

An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner carrying 242 people crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport on June 12, killing 241 on board and dozens on the ground. Among the uproar, a tweet from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk has resurfaced, in which he criticized Boeing’s management structure. In his post, Elon Musk said: “Although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner. Note, the crew capsule design of Dragon 2 has almost nothing in common with Dragon 1. Too many non‑technical managers at Boeing.”Musk’s post then highlighted Boeing’s $4.2 billion investment in the Starliner spacecraft, contrasting it with SpaceX’s (owned by Elon Musk) $2.6 billion for the Dragon 2, which completed four years earlier despite a near-complete redesign.

X argues that the New York State law infringes upon its First Amendment rights to free speech. The new law requires the social media platforms to disclose how they monitor and moderate misinformation, hate speech and extremism. The lawsuit is filed in the Manhattan federal court and it targets the Stop Hiding Hate Act .The lawsuit filed by X against New York, targets a state law which asks the social media companies to create and maintain a clear policy on how they moderate content and to provide a mechanism for users to report hateful conduct. Furthermore, it obligates platforms to explain their content moderation decisions to users who report such conduct.X's legal complaint asserts that this state legislation forces private companies to adopt specific viewpoints on content, thereby compelling speech and interfering with the platform's editorial discretion. The company contends that this governmental interference violates the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech, by dictating how X must manage user-generated content.The lawsuit also notes that the New York law closely mirrors a California statute that was partially blocked by a federal appeals court last year on similar free speech grounds.New York Attorney General Letitia James is named as the defendant in the case.
