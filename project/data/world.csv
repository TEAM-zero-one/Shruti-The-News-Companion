"Isro will usher in NY with PSLV C62 mission on Monday; will launch surveillance sat EOS-N1, 18 payloads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-will-usher-in-ny-with-pslv-c62-mission-on-monday-will-launch-surveillance-sat-eos-n1-18-payloads/articleshow/126405810.cms,"-

NEW DELHI: Isro will usher in the new year with the first launch of 2026 — PSLV C62 mission — on Monday (January 12) at 10.17 am from the first launchpad at the Sriharikota spaceport. The rocket will launch an advanced earth observation satellite EOS-N1 (codenamed ‘Anvesha’), another ‘eye in the sky’ that will boost India’s surveillance powers from space. Besides the primary payload EOS-N1, PSLV will also be carrying an European demonstrator satellite and 17 other satellites belonging to Indian and foreign agencies.EOS-N1 is a hyperspectral imaging satellite developed primarily for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). It is capable of “seeing” in hundreds of wavelengths to identify materials on the ground—making it a high-priority asset for national security and surveillance. It will help India secure its borders because of its advanced remote sensing capabilities and will also be used in various fields such as agriculture, urban mapping and environmental observation.Besides EOS-N1, 18 secondary payloads, including Europe’s Kestrel Initial Demonstrator (KID), will piggyback on the primary satellite and will be placed in space. The KID mission will feature an experimental re-entry of a small capsule in collaboration with a Spanish startup, with a planned splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean.Other secondary payloads are cubesats from Indian startups and universities, including OrbitAID's AayulSAT, CV Raman Global University's CGUSAT-1, Dhruva Space’s DA-1, Space Kidz India’s SR-2, Assam Don Bosco University’s Lachit-1, Akshath Aerospace’s Solaras-S4 and Dayanand Sagar University’s DSAT-1.Bengaluru-based space startup OrbitAID Aerospace is set to make history with AayulSAT, India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling payload. AayulSAT aims to extend satellite lifespans by enabling refuelling and servicing in orbit, addressing space debris and sustainability challenges.The upcoming PSLVC62 mission is also seen as a comeback for the PSLV programme following the earlier setback with PSLV-C61 in May 2025. The earlier PSLV-C61 mission had failed to launch EOS-09 earth observation satellite due to a technical issue in the rocket's third stage, specifically a drop in chamber pressure, preventing the satellite from reaching its intended sun-synchronous polar orbit. While the first two stages performed normally, the anomaly in the third stage led to the mission failure.","Isro will usher in the new year with the first launch of 2026 — pslv c62 mission.

Donald Trump Says PM Modi 'Not Happy With Me' Over Higher Russian Oil Tariffs

US President Donald Trump has said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is “not that happy” with him because of the tariffs Washington has imposed on India over its purchases of Russian oil, linking trade pressure directly to New Delhi’s energy ties with Moscow.Speaking at the House GOP Member Retreat, Trump referred to his interactions with the Indian leader while discussing US defence sales and tariffs.He claimed India had raised concerns over delays in receiving US military hardware and said the issue was now being addressed. “India ordered 68 Apaches,” Trump said, adding that India had told him it had been waiting for five years for the helicopters, as per PTI.During his remarks, Trump said he shared a good relationship with Modi but acknowledged the strain caused by tariffs. “He’s not that happy with me because, you know, they’re paying a lot of tariffs now because they’re not doing the oil, but they are — they’ve now reduced it very substantially, as you know, from Russia,” Trump said, according to PTI.Trump has imposed a 50 per cent tariff on India, which includes a 25 per cent levy linked specifically to India’s purchases of Russian oil, PTI reported. He also used the platform to defend his tariff policy more broadly, claiming the US was benefiting financially from the measures.The comments come amid repeated warnings from Trump to New Delhi over its continued oil trade with Russia.Earlier, Trump said the US could raise tariffs further if India does not “help on the Russian oil issue,” directly tying the threat to the Russia–Ukraine war.He has accused India of strengthening Moscow by buying discounted Russian crude and has cited this as the reason for sharply higher duties on Indian goods.Trump has also portrayed the tariff pressure as a tool to influence India’s behaviour, saying New Delhi knew he was unhappy and wanted to keep trade relations on track.At the same time, he has sought to position himself as a potential mediator in the Russia–Ukraine conflict, holding talks with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though without any concrete breakthrough.India, for its part, has previously rejected Trump’s claim that PM Modi had assured him New Delhi would stop buying Russian oil, clarifying that no such conversation took place.","Us president donald trump says pm narendra modi is 'not that happy' with him.

India Knows Pakistan Will Not Abandon Terrorism, Jaishankar Says Delhi Has Policy To Deal With It

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday took a dig at the western hypocrisy during India's military response under Operation Sindoor , declaring India does not need the West's free advice. ""Why don't you look at your own region for levels of violence?"" he remarked.Speaking to members of the Indian community in Luxembourg, Jaishankar recalled that several nations offered unsolicited advice to the country during Operation Sindoor, India's military response launched in May 2025 after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.""Sometimes you hear people say, like it happened during Operation Sindoor. Now if you ask them, say, ""oh really you're worried, why don't you look at your own region? And ask yourself, what are the levels of violence there.""""How much risks have been taken, how much worry the rest of us have about what you are doing. But that's the nature of the world. People, what they say is not what they do,"" he added.Jaishankar further underlined that India will engage differently with different actors. ""So those who are willing to work with us and be helpful, positive, we have to deal with them in that way,"" he said, adding ""those who do the kind of things which Pakistan does, we have to deal with it in a different way.""Jaishankar also took a jibe on how the western countries often advise others on handling their internal or regional conflicts, suggesting such commentary is frequently detached from ground realities and offered without much thought.""Now, to what extent do the developments in the rest of the world affect it? It's hard to say. People sitting far away will say things, sometimes with application of mind, sometimes not, sometimes with self-interest, sometimes carelessly. That will happen.""""I can tell you, whatever you might say, in this day and age, countries are more, I don't want to say they become more selfish, but they will do things only if it is of direct benefit to them. They'll offer you free advice. If something happens, say, no, please don't do that. It worries us if there is tension,"" he added.US President Donald Trump had repeatedly claimed that Washington mediated the May 2025 India-Pakistan ceasefire, an assertion India has rejected.New Delhi has maintained that the military pause followed a request from Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations to his Indian counterpart, not third-party intervention.Further on the Venezuela crisis , Jaishankar said India's primary concern is the safety of the people following US military operations there.""We are concerned about the developments, but we would really urge all the parties involved to now sit down and come to a position which is in the interest of the well-being and safety of the people of Venezuela, because at the end of the day, that is our concern,"" Jaishankar said.""We would want Venezuela as a country with whom, over many, many years, we’ve had very good relations. So we would like the people to come out well, whatever the direction of events,"" he added.His remarks came after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in Caracas and flown out of the country during a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement.","External affairs minister s jaishankar took a dig at the western hypocrisy during india's military response under operation sindoor.

'No Strategic Sense': Ex-NSA John Bolton Slams Trump Over India Tariffs

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of ""surrendering"" under ""pressure"" and contrasted his leadership with that of former prime minister Indira Gandhi Gandhi’s remarks came a day after US President Donald Trump , speaking at the House GOP Member Retreat, claimed that PM Modi had sought an audience with him. “Prime Minister Modi came to see me, ‘Sir, may I see you please’. Yes,” Trump said.Trump also referred to India facing steep tariffs, saying New Delhi was ""paying a lot of tariffs now"" and had ""reduced"" the purchase of Russian oil ""substantially"".Gandhi shared a video message on X with the caption ""Fark samjho sirji"".“I know these BJP–RSS people very well now. Put a little pressure on them, give them a little push and they run away in fear,” Gandhi said. “As soon as Trump signalled from there, they picked up the phone and said, ‘What are you doing Modi ji?’ Narendra surrendered and with ‘yes sir’, Narendra Modi ji followed Trump’s signal.”Drawing a comparison with the 1971 war, Gandhi said India had once stood firm despite US pressure.“You might remember a time when the phone call didn’t come — the Seventh Fleet had come. In the 1971 war, the Seventh Fleet came, weapons came, an aircraft carrier came. Indira Gandhi ji said, ‘I will do what I have to do.’ This is the difference,” he said, referring to the United States Seventh Fleet.Trump has imposed tariffs totalling 50% on Indian exports, including a 25% levy linked to India’s procurement of Russian oil.“I have a very good relationship with him. He’s not that happy with me because they’re paying a lot of tariffs now because they’re not doing the oil — but they are, they’ve now reduced it very substantially,” Trump said.The tariffs, imposed in August, have triggered multiple rounds of trade talks and at least four conversations between the two leaders, but have yet to yield a bilateral trade deal.Separately, Trump also said in his remarks that India had flagged delays in the delivery of Apache helicopters, claiming New Delhi has been waiting for the aircraft for five years.","Gandhi shared a video message on x with the caption ""fark samjho sirji"" gandhi’s remarks came a day after us president donald trump claimed that pm modi had sought an audience with him.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said the safety of people in Venezuela is India’s primary concern amid the crisis following US military operations in the country and the capture of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.Speaking in Luxembourg, Jaishankar urged all parties involved in the crisis to sit down and reach a position that serves the well-being of the people of Venezuela.“I think we put out a statement yesterday, so I would urge you to look at it. Obviously, what happened—if I can sum up the statement—is that we are concerned about the developments, but we would really urge all the parties involved to now sit down and come to a position which is in the interest of the well-being and safety of the people of Venezuela, because at the end of the day, that is our concern,” Jaishankar said.“We would want Venezuela as a country with whom, over many, many years, we’ve had very good relations.

We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” the MEA said in a statement.“We call upon all concerned to address issues peacefully through dialogue, ensuring peace and stability in the region. The Embassy of India in Caracas is in contact with members of the Indian community and will continue to provide all possible assistance,” it added.","Jaishankar expresses india's concern over venezuela, urges all parties to prioritise citizen safety.

As the dust settles on 2025, Parliament carries forward unfinished business, unresolved disputes,t and reforms still searching for their final shape.The Winter Session restructured key pillars of governance, but several high-stakes bills were deferred, diluted or sent for further scrutiny.The Budget Session of 2026 is expected to move beyond diagnosing problems to implementing solutions — laying out the governing blueprint for the government’s vision of “Viksit Bharat”.With a focus on higher education reforms, electoral synchronisation, capital market restructuring and insolvency resolution, the Budget Session of 2026 sets the stage for high-stakes legislative action.While the government pushed through several landmark reforms during the Winter Session, many bills were formally introduced but ran into procedural hurdles.Several were referred to Joint Parliamentary Committees or held back for further refinement, effectively shifting the legislative battleground to the Budget Session of 2026.Hailed by the government as a “constitutional moment” for India’s financial markets, the bill seeks to streamline three major laws governing investors and market regulation.For over three decades, investors and companies have navigated three separate laws — the SEBI Act (1992), the Depositories Act (1996) and the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (1956).Given its scale and potential impact on trillions of rupees in market wealth, the bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Finance in late 2025 for detailed scrutiny, before it returns to Parliament in 2026.Critics argue that merging these laws risks turning SEBI into “judge, jury and executioner”, with sweeping enforcement powers.The government, however, has argued that unified regulation is essential to reduce overlap, regulatory arbitrage and compliance confusion in a rapidly expanding market.The bill seeks to fine-tune India’s corporate bankruptcy exit framework.The bill aims to make the resolution faster so that companies do not lose the value of their assets during long legal proceedings. It also introduces a ""Cross-Border Insolvency"" framework to help banks recover money from defaulting companies that have hidden or kept assets in foreign countries.Critics argue that banks take big losses in recovering a very small percentage of the original loans, and that the bill does not hold the big promoters accountable enough.They also highlight the pending judicial cases in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) due to vacant judges' seats for the proceedings.Opposition has also flagged delays caused by vacancies in the National Company Law Tribunal, arguing that legislative fixes alone cannot address systemic capacity gaps.The One Nation One Election (ONOE) reform proposes to hold simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies, consolidating the voting process to occur at the same time instead of staggered intervals.The government initiated this plan in late 2024 with the introduction of the Constitution 129th Amendment Bill. While the bill gained majority votes in the Lok Sabha, it was not passed. This is because amending the Constitution requires a special majority where at least two-third of the members present in the House must vote in favour of the bill.The Lok Sabha approved a motion to refer both the two bills that shall pave the way for ""one nation one election"" to a 39-member Joint Parliamentary Committee. This committee has been granted an extension to submit its report until the first day of the last week of the Budget Session 2026.The primary objective of the bill is to conduct simultaneous elections—initially for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, and later potentially for local bodies—to reduce election expenses and prevent the repeated imposition of the Model Code of Conduct.The opposition rejected the bill as a ""heinous conspiracy"" against federalism, arguing it assaults the Constitution's basic structure and undermines regional autonomy.The bill is the main part of the government’s plan to modernise higher education by bringing several regulators under one system.It was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 15, 2025, and was later sent to a Joint Parliamentary Committee, the report of which is expected to be presented by the last day of the first part of the Budget Session 2026.The bill proposes setting up the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan, or VBSA, as a single umbrella regulator, meaning one main authority that will replace UGC, AICTE, and NCTE. The government has described this system as one with fewer controls but strict enforcement, in line with the National Education Policy 2020.The opposition, however, argued that it gives too much power to the Union government and could weaken the independence of universities, especially because the power to give financial grants will shift from the regulators to the ministry.Although the Digital Personal Data Protection Act was passed in 2023, it came into effect only in late 2025, when the government notified the detailed rules needed to put it into practice.The rules were officially notified on November 14, 2025, after wide public consultation.With implementation now underway, parliamentary oversight is expected on regulatory amendments, institutional capacity and funding for the Data Protection Board.Also, while the law itself was already in force, civil society groups and opposition voices focused their criticism on the rules, especially the 18-month compliance period, which they felt was too long and delayed real protection.One of the most socially and politically sensitive legislations in recent sessions, the bill was first introduced in August 2024 and was swiftly referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee following widespread protests.The committee, chaired by Jagdambika Pal, submitted its final report in late January 2025 after several contentious meetings. The report recommended mandatory registration of all Waqf properties on a centralised online portal and proposed 44 amendments to the original Waqf Act of 1995.The legislation introduces multiple legal changes, including renaming the Waqf Act as the UMEED Act — the Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act, 2025.While the bill is not formally listed on the agenda for the Budget Session of 2026, its implementation, set to begin this year, is expected to trigger renewed uproar.At its core, the legislation seeks to overhaul the governance and management of Waqf properties across the country.If Parliament were a 75-year-old house, the 2025 session resembled a noisy renovation. The government did not limit itself to cosmetic changes: labour laws were reworked, nuclear policy rewired, welfare delivery redesigned and decades-old statutes discarded. The result was a modernised legal framework — albeit amid sustained protest.With debates over worker rights, accountability and foreign participation dominating proceedings, the session concluded with several laws passed, but left many political and social questions unresolved as Parliament heads into 2026.Replacing MGNREGA, the VB–G RAM G Bill — Viksit Bharat–Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) — was tabled on December 15, 2025, and passed three days later through a voice vote amid opposition demands for a recorded division.The law increases guaranteed workdays from 100 to 125 annually but introduces fixed, state-wise allocations, replacing MGNREGA’s demand-driven funding model. Critics argue this risks weakening the programme’s role as a distress buffer.The removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name became a major flashpoint, alongside concerns over the use of AI and biometric attendance systems that could exclude workers in low-connectivity areas.Passed by voice vote in both Houses, the SHANTI Bill replaces the Atomic Energy Act (1962) and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (2010), allowing private and foreign participation in nuclear power generation.The law grants statutory status to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board and clears the path for small modular reactors. Opposition parties staged a walkout, objecting to diluted supplier liability provisions and warning that public risk would shift to the state in the event of an accident.Passed on December 16, 2025, the bill raises FDI limits in insurance from 74% to 100%, aiming to achieve universal insurance coverage by 2047.While the government argues this will deepen penetration and reduce costs, critics warn of foreign dominance, reduced focus on rural markets and potential pressure on domestic players like LIC.Unanimously passed, the bill introduces a capacity-based cess on pan masala manufacturing machinery to fund public health and national security needs.By taxing production capacity rather than declared sales, the law aims to curb under-reporting. Manufacturers, however, argue the model is inflexible, especially during machinery downtime, while opposition parties flagged concerns over Centre–state fiscal balance.Marketed as a clean-up exercise, the bill repeals 71 obsolete laws, some dating back to the 19th century, including the Indian Tramways Act (1886).While the government said this would simplify compliance, the opposition criticised the bulk repeal approach, arguing that several laws enacted as recently as the last decade were removed without adequate scrutiny.Though passed earlier, the four labour codes entered operational phase in November 2025, consolidating 29 laws into four frameworks covering wages, social security, industrial relations and workplace safety.The new 50% basic wage rule strengthens retirement benefits but reduces immediate take-home pay. Trade unions argue the codes tilt the balance in favour of employers, while the government maintains they modernise labour regulation for a changing economy.Several issues dominated debate without resolution.The opposition accused the Special Intensive Revision exercise in nine states and three UTs of selectively deleting voters. A 10-hour debate ended in deadlock, with no changes to election procedures.Despite repeated demands, Parliament saw no dedicated discussion on Manipur, where President’s Rule remains in place. Political blame-trading replaced consensus on a peace roadmap.Acknowledged as a national health emergency, air quality was debated but left without legislative follow-through or a national clean air framework.As Parliament heads into the Budget Session of 2026, the legislative record of the past year offers both momentum and caution. Several reforms have been passed, others deferred, and many now enter the more difficult phase of implementation. Whether the coming session delivers clarity, consensus and course correction — or repeats the disruptions of 2025 — remains to be seen.","The winter session restructured key pillars of governance, but several high-stakes bills were deferred, diluted or sent for further scrutiny. The budget session of 2026 is expected to move beyond diagnosing problems to implementing solutions. The bill is the main part of the government’s plan to modernise higher education by bringing several regulators under one system.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126391656,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1517297,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Pakistani diplomats, including its ambassador and defence attache, initiated over 60 points of contact - comprising meetings, calls and emails - with high-ranking US officials and media outlets to solicit international intervention. The details are part of the filings by Squire Patton Boggs, hired by Pakistan for lobbying and which, like other US lobbying firms, are mandated to share with the US Department of Justice, the details and nature of their dealings.A majority of meetings were sought between the onset of Operation Sindoor and the eventual suspension of India's military operations with requests to secure American mediation to ""somehow halt"" India's retaliatory military operations.While Pakistan tried to dismiss the impact of India's strikes, the records confirm a high-level of behind-the-scenes panic.Pakistan had hired lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs originally to help it steer away from FATF grey list. An email from its representative and former US ambassador Paul W Jones to US diplomat Elizabeth K Horst on May 14, 2025, sought a meeting with Eric (Garcetti, US ambassador to India) to ""discuss and hear his perspectives to move the relationship forward"".The email read: ""Squire Patton Boggs is a registered agent of the govt of Pakistan. We'd very much appreciate your feedback on the attached one-page outline of ways forward in US-Pakistan relationship - Did we miss anything or would anything sound off-key in Washington? Separately, do you think we could try again to schedule a meeting with Eric to discuss and hear his perspectives on how best to move the relationship forward? Finally, I'd appreciate the opportunity to speak with you or a member of your team on FATF, in order to better understand the lay of the land. ""The firm is said to have circulated documents in diplomatic circles on behalf of Pak ""appreciating constructive role played by US and President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of J&K"".

NEW DELHI: Linking the mounting trade tensions between India and United States with the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in the CIA-led operation, Maharashtra's former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Tuesday asked: ""Will Trump kidnap our Prime Minister?""Chavan said the central government has been making an effort to diversify the supply source to give a cushion to the exporters hit by the US President Donald Trump's 50 percent tariff on India.""With a 50 percent tariff, trade is simply not possible. In effect, this amounts to blocking India–US trade, especially exports from India to the United States. Since a direct ban cannot be imposed, tariffs have been used as a tool to stop trade. India will have to bear this,"" Chavan said in an interview to news agency IANS.He further said: ""The profits that our people earlier earned from exports to the US will no longer be available. We will have to look for alternative markets, and efforts in that direction are already under way"".""The question then is: What next? Will something like what happened in Venezuela happen in India? Will Mr. Trump kidnap our Prime Minister?"" Chavan asked.Criticising Chavan over his remark, BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said: Congress sinks to a new low every day. Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan shamelessly comparing India’s situation with Venezuela. By asking whether “what happened in Venezuela can happen in India”, Congress is making its anti-India mindset clear. Rahul Gandhi wants chaos in Bharat. Rahul Gandhi is seeking foreign intervention in Bharat’s affairs!""Earlier in the day, Chavan criticised the government for not taking a stand after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, saying such an incident could also happen to India.“Whatever has happened in Venezuela is against the UN Charter. An elected president has been kidnapped. It's a very grave concern that it could happen to any other country tomorrow. Tomorrow it can happen to India,” Chavan said.“India has not spoken as usual, not taken a stand on the Venezuela matter. Russia and China have taken a stand and criticised what America has done. The same thing happened in the Ukraine war. We did not take any side. We did not take a stand on the Israel-Hamas matter, and now here we are, so scared of Americans that we are not even trying to criticise what has happened,” he added.However, the ministry of external affairs on Sunday reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela as the situation in the country remains tense after the US strikes.""Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,"" the MEA said in a statement.Trump on Monday issued a fresh tariff warning to India, saying Washington could raise duties on New Delhi if it does not “help on Russian oil issue,” directly linking the threat to the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war.“We could raise tariffs on India if they don't have help on Russian oil issue,” said US President Trump, quoted by Reuters.US President Donald Trump added, ""They wanted to make me happy, basically... PM Modi's a very good man. He's a good guy. He knew I was not happy. It was important to make me happy. They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly...""Trump was referring to India’s continued oil trade with Russia, a point his administration has repeatedly opposed, and which he had cited as the basis for doubling tariffs on India to 50% in August 2025.India is already facing the 50% tariff imposed by Trump, who has been sharply critical of New Delhi’s ties with Moscow and has alleged India of strengthening Russia in the Ukraine war by purchasing Russian crude.",Prithviraj chavan said the central government has been making an effort to diversify the supply source to give a cushion to the exporters hit by the us president donald trump's 50 percent tariff on india.

My Two Cents on This Mock Trade





The Los Angeles Dodgers are being closely linked to Bo Bichette as free agency approaches. People around the league believe the Dodgers are willing to wait. The idea is simple: let the market settle, then step in with an offer that favors a shorter term and a higher yearly salary.Toronto’s chances of keeping Bichette appear to be shrinking. While a return is still possible, there is growing belief that Los Angeles sees an opening. The Los Angeles Dodgers have payroll flexibility, a clear plan, and a roster built to win now. That combination makes them a serious threat if Bichette reaches the open market without a deal in place.Most projections place Bo Bichette’s value between seven and eight years, with a total price of $200–210 million. That comes out to roughly $26 million per season. The Los Angeles Dodgers are not known for committing to long contracts unless the fit is perfect. Instead, they often prefer shorter deals that keep future options open.A four- or five-year contract with a higher annual value fits their pattern. There has been little noise about trade talks, which points to this being a free-agent play. Bichette has also indicated he is open to playing second base.That matters because Mookie Betts is expected to remain the Dodgers’ shortstop in 2026. One possible structure discussed around the league is an eight-year, $200 million deal with a fourth-year opt-out and front-loaded money to limit long-term risk.For the Los Angeles Dodgers, Bichette adds a right-handed bat to a lineup already built around Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman. His ability to hit for average and drive in runs strengthens the middle of the order during another title push.For Bichette, a move would mean leaving a team in transition with the Toronto Blue Jays and joining a consistent contender. He would hit with protection and play meaningful games deep into October. Toronto, if he leaves after rejecting a qualifying offer, would receive draft pick compensation and free up money to focus on younger players.Bichette is 27 years old, born March 5, 1998. Over 748 career games, he owns a .294/.342/.462 slash line with 111 home runs. In 2025, he hit .311, one of the best averages in the American League.Defense remains the concern. His metrics at shortstop have been negative throughout his career, including continued struggles in 2025. A move to second base helps, but his glove still lowers his overall value.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Toronto Blue Jays on the verge of singning $500 million Chicago Cubs superstar to get much-needed roster upgrade The Dodgers are in a strong position. Bichette fills a clear need without forcing changes elsewhere, and his bat raises the ceiling of an already elite lineup. Toronto may gain future assets, but Los Angeles gains a player who fits their timeline and their approach to winning now.","The los angeles dodgers are being closely linked to bo bichette as free agency approaches.

U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH

Republican firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene, long known for her staunch “America first” rhetoric, has introduced a bill in the House of Representatives seeking to completely terminate the H-1B visa program, a key pathway for skilled foreign workers, a significant number of whom are from India.The legislation, designated HR 6937, was filed in the House on January 2, and proposes to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to eliminate the H-1B visa category “and for other purposes.” According to immigration experts, while it is unlikely to secure the support needed to become law, it has ignited fresh debate on the H-1B program.According to a report issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), of the total H-1B applications (including extensions) approved in fiscal 2024, 71% or about 2.8 lakh were for Indian beneficiaries. Chinese nationals, next in line, accounted for roughly 47,000 approvals, or just 12% of the total. While chances of this bill becoming law are slim, if passed it would impact Indians aspiring to work in the US.The bare details that are currently available on the official government website, provides for relevant amendments to the INA but there are no details available on transitional arrangements or exemptions for existing visa holders.The bill was immediately referred to several House committees, including ‘Judiciary, Energy and Commerce’, and ‘Ways and Means’, where it will face initial review.Greene, a Republican congresswoman from Georgia, has been a vocal critic of the H-1B system for years, consistently arguing that it undermines American workers by enabling companies, particularly in the tech sector, to recruit foreign labour at lower wage levels. In statements accompanying the bill’s introduction, she reiterated this stance, framing the legislation as a necessary step to protect US jobs and counter what she describes as “outsourcing and wage suppression. ”On social media, Greene highlighted her long-standing commitment to reshaping immigration policy, asserting that the H-1B program has too often been abused by corporations that put profits over people.Introduction of this bill comes at a tumultuous moment in her political career. Once one of the most visible allies of President Donald Trump, Greene has recently experienced a very public falling out with him over a series of disputes, including her support for bipartisan efforts to release files connected to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The discord culminated in Greene’s resignation from the House effective January 5.","Republican firebrand marjorie taylor greene has introduced a bill in the house of representatives seeking to terminate the h-1b visa program.

Good moral character check





The US Citizenship and Immigration Services reminded new citizenship applicants that its neighborhood investigation before granting citizenship is back and not only neighbors but employers will also get visits by USCIS officials to verify moral character, assimilation into the US way of life etc.The neighbourhood investigation resumed in November 2025 as the agency overhauled the entire process of granting citizenship, putting America's protection at the top. ""The purpose of a neighborhood investigation is to verify aliens’ eligibility for naturalization by reviewing their residency, moral character, loyalty to the U.S. Constitution, and commitment to the nation’s well-being. These investigations are vital to maintaining the integrity of the naturalization process, assuring assimilation, and safeguarding the value of American citizenship,"" the agency announced before.Green card holders can become naturalized US citizens after five years of living in the US. Background checking has been always a process before granting US citizenship but that did not mean officials would visit the neighborhood or speak to the neighbors as this was an old and discarded process after the administration started relying on more high-tech screening like running the name in FBI, DHS databases to check whether there is any criminal history etc.They also look for tax compliance, if there is any child support issue, fraud, violations etc.In 2025, the Donald Trump administration announced that they were bringing back the old neighborhood checks as the absence of criminal record is not enough to qualify for citizenship -- the involvement in the community, good moral character is what they are now looking for and neighbors would be able to vouch for that.The agency has also revised the naturalization test expanding the question bank from 100 to 128 questions; increased the number of questions on each test from 10 to 20; raised the passing score from 6 to 12 correct responses; and revised the questions to ensure the test provides a more meaningful assessment of the alien’s knowledge and understanding of US history and government.Naturalization is a privilege, and new citizens must understand the rights and responsibilities that come with this privilege, the administration said.","Us citizenship and immigration services reminded new citizenship applicants that its neighborhood investigation before granting citizenship is back.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Trump Boasts Of 68 Apaches For India As Contracts And Delivery Data Expose The Claim As False





US President Donald Trump pulled another hyperbole out of his MAGA hat on Tuesday, claiming that India had ordered 68 Apache attack helicopters from the United States, the delivery of which was so slow that Prime Minister Narendra Modi deferentially sought a meeting with him to raise concern over the delays.A review of official contracts, delivery records, deployment details and conversations with military and diplomatic sources shows that the claim does not align with facts: India ordered only 28 Apache helicopters in total, and as of December 2025, all of them have been delivered.The discrepancy reinforces a pattern critics have frequently noted in Trump’s public remarks where numbers are often inflated and timelines simplified to emphasise US leverage or personal involvement, like for instance in his persistent claim that he forced India and Pakistan into a truce with threat of tariffs. In this case, while delivery delays were real and did frustrate New Delhi, the scale described by Trump was not; neither was his claim that PM Modi asked “Sir, may I see you, please?” to raise the issue.In Trump’s recalls, everyone – even foreign leaders (except Putin and Xi Jinping) – is always calling him “sir.”India’s acquisition of the Boeing AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters took place in two distinct phases, not one massive order.The first deal was signed in September 2015, during the final months of the Obama administration, when India signed an agreement to buy 22 Apaches for the Indian Air Force (IAF) in a contract worth about $2.2 billion. These helicopters were delivered on schedule, with the final units arriving by 2020 during the first Trump administration. They were inducted into two frontline squadrons and quickly became a central part of India’s attack helicopter capability.The second deal was signed in February 2020 during Trump’s visit to India. This follow-on contract, valued between $600 million and $800 million, covered six Apaches for the Indian Army Aviation Corps. This is the order that experienced repeated delays and became a talking point in US and Indian political discussions, including PM Modi flagging it during his visit to the White House in February 2025, one of many topics that were on the agenda. Combined, both deals amount to 28 helicopters—less than half of the figure cited by Trump.While the Air Force’s Apaches arrived on time, delivered at the end of Trump’s first term, the Army’s six helicopters were significantly delayed. Deliveries were initially scheduled to begin in early 2024. Instead, the first batch reached India only in July 2025—about 15 months late. The final three helicopters arrived in December 2025, completing the order nearly two years behind schedule.Several factors contributed to the delays. Boeing’s Apache production line in Mesa, Arizona, was affected by post-pandemic supply chain disruptions, including shortages of engines, gearboxes, and specialised electronics. In addition, India reportedly had a relatively low priority ranking within the US defence priorities and allocations system (DPAS) in 2024, meaning other customers—including the US. Army—were ahead in the queue for certain components.There were also technical and logistical complications. Boeing briefly paused some Apache deliveries worldwide due to electrical and power-generation concerns that required additional safety testing. In a final twist, the last batch bound for India in November 2025 had to turn back mid-flight after Turkey denied overflight clearance to the Antonov-124 transport aircraft carrying the helicopters, adding several more weeks of delay.Also read: 'If they don't help on Russian oil issue...'; Donald Trump's new tariff warning to India; praises PM Modi These genuine frustrations likely form the basis of Trump’s comments, but the numerical exaggeration undermines their credibility. Is it possible that Trump may have conflated two separate Indian helicopter purchases from Boeing: the AH-64E Apache attack helicopter and the CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopter? Both deals were signed around the same time, both involved Boeing (for which Trump claimed to be the all-time best salesman), but they still add up to only 43, since India ordered 15 Chinooks, all of which have been delivered between 2019 and 2020. There is no record in India’s ministry of defence or US foreign, military Sales (FMS) notifications of any additional Apache orders beyond the 28 units. While the Army originally projected a requirement for 39 Apaches, no new contracts have been signed.In fact, despite the Apache’s formidable firepower, India’s experience with dodgy US supply chains issues and increasingly mercurial strategic shifts vis-a-vis China and Pakistan is such that it is now peeling away from American, and for that matter, any foreign dependency. Instead, New Delhi is increasingly prioritising indigenous solutions under its “Make in India” policy. In this case, it is leaning on the HAL Prachand Light Combat Helicopter. A lighter chopper optimized for extreme altitudes, Prachand can operate where the heavier Apache struggles, including at heights above 20,000 feet like in Siachen. India plans to induct 156 Prachand helicopters across the Army and Air Force, gradually reducing reliance on foreign attack helicopters.The emerging strategy is clear: Apaches will remain India’s heavy strike platforms in plains and desert sectors, but the future of India’s rotary-wing combat power will be increasingly domestic. Trump’s claim of 68 helicopters may have overstated the scale, but it has inadvertently highlighted why India is determined to avoid dealing with a maverick.","Us president donald trump claimed that india had ordered 68 apache attack helicopters from the united states.

Jets defenseman Haydn Fleury hospitalized after first-period hit from Keegan Kolesar





Winnipeg Jets defenseman Haydn Fleury suffered a frightening injury early Tuesday night, leaving the ice on a stretcher during a 4-3 overtime loss to the Vegas Golden Knights at Canada Life Centre. The incident cast a long shadow over the game, shifting focus away from the result and toward player safety.The hit occurred in the first period and brought an immediate hush over the building, as teammates and medical staff quickly realized the seriousness of the situation.The injury happened at the 13:16 mark of the opening period as Fleury attempted to clear the puck from his defensive zone. Golden Knights forward Keegan Kolesar made contact as Fleury crossed over near the end boards, sending the Jets blueliner sliding awkwardly into the wall. Fleury’s head and upper body absorbed most of the impact, prompting an immediate stoppage as trainers rushed to his side.Fleury remained down on the ice for several minutes before being carefully placed on a stretcher and transported off. No penalty was assessed on the play, a decision that drew quiet scrutiny but little immediate protest, given the concern surrounding Fleury’s condition.After the game, Jets head coach Scott Arniel described the sequence as an unfortunate convergence of timing and positioning rather than a malicious play.Arniel noted that Kolesar was not directly on top of Fleury, but the defenseman lost balance while crossing over, which led to the violent collision with the boards. The coach acknowledged how unsettling the moment was, calling it a “scary situation” that no one wants to see.Arniel confirmed that Fleury stayed overnight in the hospital for further evaluation. The defenseman suffered a broken nose, along with injuries affecting his head, neck, and back. According to the Jets, Fleury is undergoing a series of tests to determine the full extent of the damage, with no immediate timeline provided for his return.From a hockey standpoint, Fleury has yet to record a point in 17 games this season for Winnipeg, but his role has gone beyond the scoresheet. He has provided depth on the blue line during a challenging campaign for the Jets, who now sit at 15-21-5.For Winnipeg, the loss to Vegas became secondary. The immediate concern remains Haydn Fleury’s health and recovery, a reminder of how quickly a routine play can turn dangerous in the NHL, and how fragile the line is between competition and risk.","Jets defenseman haydn fleury hospitalized after first-period hit from keegan kolesar.

Candace Owens’ claims about Charlie Kirk and the alleged shooting image







Candace Owens recently made strong claims about Charlie Kirk , but there is one very important thing readers need to know first. There is no verified or official record that Charlie Kirk was assassinated or shot. Still, Candace Owens shared what she said was a never-before-seen photo and talked about it during an episode of her show. Her comments quickly spread online and started new debates.According to Candace Owens, the image showed Charlie Kirk from behind at the moment she claims he was shot. She said there was no blood and no exit wound visible in the photo. This claim surprised many people and raised questions on social media. However, no police department, hospital, or university has confirmed such a shooting. Charlie Kirk has also appeared publicly after the time Candace Owens referred to.Candace Owens used this photo while explaining why she said she does not trust Terryl Farnsworth and Tyler Bowyer. Her words caught attention fast, but many people also questioned the accuracy of her statements.While speaking on her show, Candace Owens said the photo showed Charlie Kirk from behind with no visible blood after the alleged shooting.Pointing to the image, she said the only blood seen was on his hand.Candace Owens said, “This doesn’t make sense to me. It doesn’t make sense to the narrative. Doesn’t make sense to anybody that knows anything about guns. Charlie was in pretty good shape except for where he had the wound on his neck that we all saw.”She also mentioned a viral video that she claimed showed the moment Charlie Kirk was shot. That video was shared many times on social media, but there is no verified source confirming it shows a real shooting.During episode 242 of her YouTube channel, Candace Owens spoke about a man named Tyler Robinson, who she claimed was wrongly blamed. She said Tyler Robinson drove from Orem to Panguitch, Utah, and stopped at Cowboys Smokehouse on North Main Street. According to her, an employee recognized him and contacted authorities.Candace Owens questioned why someone would plan an attack but then use a credit card at a public place. She also claimed federal pressure was placed on Utah authorities. However, there are no official police statements or court records supporting these claims.Since then, Candace Owens has continued to speak about this topic, sharing different theories. Some people support her views, while others strongly criticize them. Even members of Charlie Kirk’s family have publicly asked her to stop spreading these claims.Also Read: “It’s So Stupid It Hurts”: Candace Owens Blasts CIA Narrative After Charlie Kirk Assassination Sparks Fresh Public Outrage","Candace owens shared what she said was a never-before-seen photo of charlie kirk.

Nikki Haley's son says his favourite hobby is 'ragebating Indians' as he takes a dig at 'Vifake Ramaslimey',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nikki-haleys-son-says-his-faborite-hobby-is-ragebating-indians-as-he-takes-a-dig-at-vifake-ramaslimey/articleshow/126381819.cms,"Maga 'Civil War': Nikki Haley's Son Nalin BLASTS Ramaswamy's 'Third World Parenting' Style

‘ Rage baiting Indians,’ Nalin Haley boasts





A social media clash involving Vivek Ramaswamy and Nalin Haley, the son of former UN ambassador and Republican leader Nikki Haley , has ignited backlash online after Nalin openly bragged about provoking racist responses while taking aim at the Indian-American politician.The controversy erupted after Ramaswamy announced that he was stepping back from social media, a move that quickly became fodder for critics on the American right, including Haley’s son.Ramaswamy said the hostility he faced online had reached a breaking point, prompting him to quit social media platforms personally. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, the former DOGE leader wrote that he deleted X and Instagram from his phone on New Year’s Eve.“I’ll spend my newfound time listening to more voters in real-world Ohio, developing more policies to make our state affordable, and being more present with my family,” he wrote.Ramaswamy added that while his campaign team would continue using social media to distribute messages, he himself would stop scrolling through posts. He described social media as “a tempting alternative” to costly polling but warned that it often distorts reality.“The messages you’re most likely to see are the most negative and bombastic,” he wrote. Ramaswamy also said online commentary is largely shaped by bots and foreign actors, which can mislead politicians about what real voters think.The decision drew attention because it appeared to contradict Ramaswamy’s own earlier rhetoric. In a previous post that resurfaced widely, he had written: “If you’re scared of your comment section, you are not fit to lead.”Nalin Haley seized on that contradiction. In a post on X, he shared screenshots of Ramaswamy’s old comment alongside the Wall Street Journal op-ed announcing his withdrawal from social media.“If you’re wondering why the emoji is white now it’s cuz there’s a random intern on the other side of the screen Vifake Ramaslimey said just a few weeks ago that if you can’t handle mean words on a screen you can’t govern. For once he’s right and should take his own advice,” Nalin wrote.The post quickly went viral, triggering a flood of replies, some amused, others sharply critical, many of which focused on Nalin Haley’s language and personal attacks.As the comment section filled up, one user replied to Nalin Haley with a racist remark: “You will be deported back to India.” Rather than distancing himself from the comment, Nalin responded by embracing the controversy.“My all time favorite hobby is rage baiting Indians and Leftists into being racist. Never gets old,” he wrote. The remark drew fresh outrage, with critics accusing him of deliberately encouraging racist abuse for engagement, while supporters framed it as trolling political opponents.",Ramaswamy quits social media after online abuse.

UAE weather: Temperatures to drop below 5°c during coldest winter stretch from Jan 10–22,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-weather-temperatures-to-drop-below-5c-during-coldest-winter-stretch-from-jan-1022/articleshow/126391411.cms,"UAE braces for coldest winter days as temperatures fall to 5°C / Image: File

Understanding “Der Al Sittin”

Current weather

Fog and reduced visibility have been reported in parts of Abu Dhabi and other inland areas, prompting caution for drivers and commuters.



Light rain and cloudy skies are possible in coastal emirates like Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, and Fujairah over the next few days, reflecting unsettled winter conditions.



Temperatures in cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi are dipping into the mid-teens at night — noticeably cooler than recent weeks.



Super ‘ Wolf Moon ’





If you thought the winter breeze was already crisp, it’s time to dig even deeper into your wardrobe. According to the latest forecasts from the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) and the Emirates Astronomical Society, the UAE is about to enter its most intense cold spell of the year.This period, which runs from January 10 to January 22, is historically recognized as the peak of the winter season, where the mercury takes its most dramatic dip.Experts like Ibrahim Al Jarwan, Chairman of the Emirates Astronomical Society, explain that this isn't just a random weather shift.It is a well-documented phenomenon that combines ancient regional folklore with modern atmospheric science to bring a ""real"" winter experience to the desert.This upcoming cold spell is tied to a traditional phase known locally as “Der Al Sittin”, a weather pattern embedded in Gulf folklore and long associated with the chilliest days of the year.Der Al Sittin, literally “the sixty days”, is a traditional term used to describe a sustained period of cold weather that has been recognised by locals for generations. Folklore even describes this chill as sharp as a knife’s edge, highlighting just how intense winter mornings can feel during this time.Meteorologists link this period to both solar and atmospheric patterns, including the culmination of the Thuraya (Pleiades) constellation in the evening sky, an event historically connected with winter cold in Arab culture. This mix of cultural wisdom and scientific forecasting gives residents a familiar signal that winter’s peak is near.While daytime temperatures are expected to remain comfortable for most of the UAE, mornings and nights will feel significantly colder, especially before sunrise. Cool breezes and the possibility of frost in open desert regions are likely for those early hours.Before the main cold stretch arrives, weather patterns in the UAE are already showing signs of change:Despite these early signs, forecasters warn that weather predictions become less certain beyond about five days, due to the complexity of atmospheric dynamics. This means residents should keep an eye on regular updates closer to mid-January for the most accurate details.The upcoming cold snap isn't just happening on the ground; it’s being signaled from the stars. This period coincides with the evening culmination of the Thuraya (Pleiades) constellation, a star cluster that has long served as a celestial weather vane for Arab astronomers.When Thuraya reaches its peak in the evening sky, it traditionally signals that the most severe winter conditions have arrived.Adding to the drama of 2026, the first full moon of the year, known as the ""Wolf Moon"", is set to appear during this cold stretch.This year, it will be a supermoon, meaning the moon will be at its closest point to Earth, appearing unusually large and bright.While the name ""Wolf Moon"" comes from North American and European folklore, where wolves were said to howl more during the freezing winter nights, it perfectly sets the mood for the UAE’s own chilly January evenings.This winter stretch presents a chance for residents to experience one of the UAE’s traditional weather phases, a period locals have long recognised as the heart of winter. While the cold may be surprising to some, especially those used to milder months, it also offers a reminder of the seasonal rhythms that mark this part of the year in the Gulf region.","Uae braces for coldest winter days as temperatures fall to 5°c.
