How a modern IADS works

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Aug 23 successfully carried out the maiden flight-tests of the Integrated Air Defence Weapon System (IADWS). Held off the coast of Odisha, the test validated the country's first fully indigenous multi-layered air defence shield.During the demonstration, IADWS engaged and destroyed three aerial targets simultaneously - two high-speed fixed-wing UAVs and a multi-copter drone. The targets were neutralised at varying altitudes and ranges, proving the system's versatility against different airborne threats.The system integrates three indigenously developed technologies - Quick Reaction Surface-to-Air Missiles (QRSAM), Very-Short Range Air Defence System (VSHORADS) missiles, and a high-power laser-based Directed Energy Weapon (DEW). Together, they create a layered shield capable of countering everything from low-flying drones to high-speed aircraft and missiles.Control of all components is exercised through a Centralised Command and Control Centre, developed by the Defence Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL). This ensures radars, communication networks, missile batteries, and directed-energy weapons function in unison, maximising reaction time and accuracy.At the heart of IADWS is the QRSAM, providing frontline protection to Army units on the move. Mounted on 8x8 high-mobility vehicles, it allows ""fire-on-the-move"" capability. Its dual-radar system - the Active Array Battery Surveillance Radar and Active Array Battery Multifunction Radar - provides 360-degree detection, tracking, and targeting of multiple threats. With a strike envelope of 25-30km and altitudes up to 10km, QRSAM can intercept aircraft, helicopters, drones, and missiles with precision.By filling the gap between man-portable short-range systems and long-range missile defences like the S-400, QRSAM forms the mobile first layer of the IADWS shield.Complementing QRSAM are the VSHORADS and DEW. VSHORADS, developed by DRDO's Research Centre Imarat, is a man-portable missile designed for low-altitude threats. Lightweight and field-deployable, it adds agility and flexibility to the IADWS framework.The most futuristic element is DEW. In April, DRDO showcased its 30-kilowatt laser against drones, helicopters, and missiles at ranges up to 3.5km. With 360-degree electro-optical sensors and jamming features, DEW marks India's entry into 'Star Wars'-style defence.DRDO chief Samir V Kamat said: ""This is just the beginning... We are also working on high-energy microwaves and electromagnetic pulses that will give us Star Wars capability.""Together, QRSAM, VSHORADS, and DEW provide India with a robust, multi-dimensional defence system.Tailored For Regional ThreatsGlobally, nations such as Russia, China, and Iran have developed sophisticated Integrated Air Defence Systems (IADS) to counter US airpower. These systems force US operations farther out to avoid detection. They link radars, mobile command posts, and space-based sensors to create a distributed, networked shield. Russia's S-400 is among the toughest, with radars reaching 400km and missiles of similar range. Though rarely fired to maximum distance, this capability enables flexible engagement within the given range. The challenge lies in neutralising not a single sensor or missile, but an interconnected web. India's IADWS mirrors this philosophy, tailored for regional threats.The IADWS test comes a few days after the successful trial of the Agni-V ballistic missile on Aug 20. It also draws lessons from Operation Sindoor in May, when India's multi-layered defences thwarted Turkish-origin drones and Chinese-supplied missiles used by Pakistan. The operation reinforced the need for homegrown systems tested in live combat scenarios.This renewed focus on indigenisation underlines a wider shift in India's defence ecosystem. From Operation Sindoor to the IADWS test, the pattern is clear: India is preparing to fight future wars with indigenous technologies.In his Red Fort speech on Aug 15, PM Modi urged Indian innovators and the domestic defence industry to develop jet engines indigenously - a technological gap that continues to haunt India's aerospace sector. Despite breakthroughs in missiles and radars, India still depends on foreign suppliers for engines, holding back projects like the Tejas fighter and AMCA stealth aircraft.While a HAL-GE joint venture is reportedly being discussed and the long-delayed Kaveri engine remains incomplete despite over Rs 2,000 crore invested, India's vulnerability in propulsion contrasts with its advances in air defence.This prolonged dependence on foreign jet engines, particularly from the US, France, and Russia, highlights a major vulnerability. While India has made breakthroughs in missiles, radars, and air-defence systems, its inability to master jet engine technology continues to hold back flagship projects like the Tejas fighter and the AMCA stealth aircraft. By situating the QRSAM success within this broader narrative, India's defence roadmap reflects both its recent achievements and the challenges that remain.","The integrated air defence weapon system (iadws) is india's first fully indigenous multi-layered air defence shield.

Significance of the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal

Who was Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?

The UAE has officially declared a public holiday for government employees to mark the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), which falls on Friday, September 5, 2025, according to the Islamic (Hijri) calendar.As this year’s observance coincides with a Friday, UAE residents may benefit from a long weekend (Friday to Sunday), providing a time for spiritual reflection and rest.The Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle, and key religious dates, such as the Prophet’s birthday, are determined by the sighting of the new moon.On Saturday, August 23, 2025, the International Astronomy Center in the UAE confirmed that the crescent moon marking the start of Rabi Al Awwal (the third month of the Islamic calendar) was not sighted anywhere in the Arab world.Due to this, the 12th of Rabi Al Awwal— the date traditionally recognised as the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday— will be observed on Friday, September 5, 2025, in the UAE and several other countries.The 12th day of Rabi Al Awwal holds profound significance in Islam as it commemorates the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Across the Muslim world, this day is marked with prayers, religious lectures, and community gatherings that celebrate the Prophet’s life, character, and teachings.It is a moment to reflect on the Prophet’s message of compassion, justice, and unity, which remains central to the Islamic faith.Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is regarded as the final messenger of Islam, following prophets such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He was born in Mecca in the year 570 CE, known as the Year of the Elephant, and passed away in 632 CE in Medina.Throughout his life, the Prophet played a transformative role— not only as a spiritual leader but also as a unifier and reformer of Arabian society. His teachings, preserved in the Qur'an and Hadith, form the foundation of Islamic belief and practice, continuing to influence over a billion Muslims worldwide","The uae has declared a public holiday on friday, september 5, 2025, for prophet muhammad’s (pbuh) birthday, enabling a long weekend.

Poll Do you support the proposed wage-based immigration system for H-1B visas? Yes No

The Donald Trump administration is planning a major overhaul of the United States’ H-1B visa and green card systems, signalling a shift towards wage-based immigration and merit-driven selection.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday said he is involved in the proposed reforms, which aim to replace the current lottery-based system with a more selective model.“We're going to change the Green Card. We give green cards - the average American makes $75,000 a year and the average green card recipient $66,000 a year,” Lutnick told Fox News, questioning, “Why are we doing that? It’s like picking the bottom core.”He added, “That’s why Donald Trump is going to change it - that’s where the Gold Card is coming, and with that we’re going to start picking the best people, and it’s time for that.”In a post on X, Lutnick called the current H-1B system “a scam that lets foreign workers fill American job opportunities” and said “hiring American workers should be the priority of all great American businesses.”The proposed changes are expected to include eliminating the H-1B lottery system and introducing a wage-based allocation, where visas are given to higher-earning applicants first.A draft rule to this effect was approved by the US office of information and regulatory affairs earlier this month.The “Gold Card” initiative, still in early stages, is positioned as an alternative to the current green card process, with a focus on attracting high-skilled, high-earning individuals. While details remain under discussion, the shift aligns with Trump's broader “America First” immigration approach.The move has drawn attention from Indian professionals, who form the majority of H-1B recipients. According to US immigration data, Indian nationals have consistently accounted for over 70% of new H-1B allocations annually.The proposed changes around suspending or ending the H-1B visa programme have also sparked online debate, with several users on social media arguing that such a move could backfire. Critics point out that restricting access to skilled foreign talent may lead to jobs shifting to countries like India through remote hiring or outsourcing, rather than resulting in American workers filling those roles.","Us commerce secretary howard lutnick on monday said he is involved in the proposed reforms.

Why PM Modi may not have taken Trump's calls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-pm-modi-may-not-have-taken-trumps-calls/articleshow/123550114.cms,"Photo/AP

TOI correspondent from Washington:

US President Donald Trump often uses his personal cell phone to call world leaders. It's a habit carried over from his life as a real estate magnate when he phoned and received calls from elites of the world. Coming to the White House tempered the practice but did not end it. He was using the cell phone from the get-go, driving both technical security boffins and his National Security Council staff nuts.While the technical folk worried about security breaches, the NSC folks fretted about being out of the loop about his exchanges with world leaders, which are otherwise carefully noted and annotated as per formal procedures, with calls typically patched through the White House situation room, with domain experts in the loop.Trump was eventually persuaded to have safeguards and security features on the phone -- an Android device -- well into his first term, similar to what Barack Obama, who was the first president to use a mobile device in office -- a Blackberry -- submitted to. But the random calls continued. When he returned to the Oval Office for a second term, he had added a second device -- an iPhone -- and possibly a third, with which he is said to post on social media, to his collection.A recent photo of him holding an iPhone showed a lockscreen with his own picture in his signature finger-pointing pose -- inviting jibes of narcissism --with a text message from his friend Roger Stone below it.According to administration insiders, Trump has given out his cell phone number to some half a dozen world leaders, including possibly Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman, French President Emanuel Macron, India's PM Narendra Modi, inviting them to call him directly if they needed to discuss important matters urgently. ""The president’s personal cellphone has become, in many ways, the most pivotal technological device in the federal government, directly linking Trump to the outside world,"" The Atlantic magazine wrote recently, adding that ""lawmakers, friends, family members, corporate titans, celebrities, world leaders, and journalists regularly call it. ""Atlantic writers Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer are among those who have Trump's personal phone number and have spoken about calling him for an interview. Among journalists who have received Trump's call from his personal number: Fox News' Sean Hannity and British journalist Piers Morgan.But security boffins are also believed to have persuaded Trump to change the numbers of one or two of his cell phones, because, as the Atlantic noted, more than 100 people now have the number, and he remains prone to picking up the phone, even when he does not recognize the incoming number. So if he phoned PM Modi from a new personal number, how would the latter, who is also known to use a cell phone, know who's calling unless they've exchanged updated numbers?That may explain why PM Modi apparently didn't take four calls from Trump in recent weeks, as reported by a German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. A Japanese newspaper, Nikkei Asia, carried a similar report about Modi not taking the US president’s calls, “heightening Trump’s frustration”. Officials in Washington declined to either confirm or deny if the calls were made.Another reason why Modi may not have taken Trump's purported calls is that the US President is now routinely accused of making up stuff -- from out-of-control crime in Washington DC and other Democrat cities with large black population to millions of criminals from prisons and mental asylums from all over the world infiltrating America.New Delhi, which is big on form, rulebook and protocol, now clearly believes Trump is a loose cannon who is prone to hyperbole and shooting off the cuff with little regard to discretion or accuracy. From throwing out random numbers about the number of fighter jets shot in the India-Pak spat to the imminence of it going nuclear, he has tossed out one verbal hand grenade after another, sometimes based on misrepresentation or misreading of the situation, frustrating his own bureaucracy. No one on the US side or Indian side has a clue how to contain this. The Indian side may also have been concerned about the possibility of Trump pulling a repeat of his antics with the Vietnamese president, where he announced a deal that hadn't been fleshed out, causing considerable confusion and embarrassment in Hanoi.",Us president donald trump often uses his personal cell phone to call world leaders.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

It’s not PM Modi’s style to negotiate details over phone, says diplomat

Poll Do you think Trump's approach towards India is more personal than policy-driven? Yes, it's personal. No, it's policy-focused.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to take four calls from US President Donald Trump in recent weeks amid a raging trade dispute, a German newspaper has reported, as ties between Washington and New Delhi have soured rapidly, testing what both sides repeatedly said was the most consequential relationship of the 21st century.The Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung did not cite the source of its claim, but opined that the trade clash between Trump and Modi illustrated that India will not bow to American pressure and New Delhi wants to manage its relations with both Washington and Beijing in its own way. A Japanese newspaper Nikkei Asia carried a similar report about Modi avoiding the US President's calls, ""heightening Trump's frustration. ""Officials in Washington declined to confirm or deny if the calls were made, but a key Indian diplomat said in a background conversation earlier this month that it is not PM Modi's style to negotiate details over the phone. Separately, another source said it is possible Modi ducked the call to be avoid the outcome of the conversation being misrepresented, something New Delhi suggests the US President has done on the India-Pakistan clash.Trump has claimed dozens of times over the past four months that he stopped a possible nuclear war between India and Pakistan by using trade, often throwing out random numbers about how close they were to it, how many jets were lost, and how many wars he prevented. In the latest riff on the subject, which many American analysts now characterize as a delusional attempt to cadge a Nobel Peace Prize, he said India and Pakistan were two weeks away from a nuclear war.The PM also declined Trump's impromptu invitation to visit Washington late June after the G-20 meeting in Canada -- when they did not meet in person as Trump left early. The US President ostensibly wanted Modi in the White House at the same time he had invited Pakistan's de facto military ruler Asim Munir for bragging rights that he had forged peace between them. India has expressed resentment about the false equivalence between a perpetrator of terrorism and a victim of terrorism, a difference that appears lost on a White House in thrall of business opportunities.Seasoned US analysts, even former officials who are not particularly well inclined towards New Delhi, suggest that Trump's personal pique, more than policy issues, is driving ties off the cliff, and are warning that his hostility towards India will drive it closer to the China and Russia.Former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who has fallen foul of the US President, said India too feels ""deeply aggrieved"" by Trump because it is the only victim of his threat to impose tariffs and sanctions, even as Russia and China remain largely untouched. ""The longer India hangs out to dry, the worse the New Delhi-Washington relationship gets,"" Bolton wrote, hours after he was subjected to an FBI raid in what was said to be a national security investigation.","Germany's frankfurter allegemeine zeitung says pm narendra modi refused to take four calls from us president donald trump in recent weeks.

Poll Which aspect of the Mission Sudarshan Chakra do you find most crucial? Missile defence shield for protection Advanced technology for counter-strikes

NEW DELHI: India will next year begin testing new interceptor missiles for an indigenous air and missile defence shield under Project Kusha, which will be a critical element of the ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra (MSC)’ announced by PM Modi to provide security cover to strategic as well as vital civilian areas in the country by 2035.The plan is to test the M1 missile, with an interception range of 150-km against incoming enemy aircraft, stealth fighters, cruise missiles, drones and precision-guided munitions, in 2026. It will be followed by M2 (250-km range) in 2027 and M3 (350-km range) in 2028 for the missile-based layered defence system being developed by DRDO, top sources told TOI.The aim is to complete the development of these three long-range surface-to-air missiles (LR-SAMs) and related systems under Project Kusha by 2028 to, hopefully, pave the way for their induction from 2030 onwards, the sources added.This fully-automated LR-SAM system, which will rival the expensive Russian-origin S-400 Triumf air defence system deployed by the IAF in limited numbers, will be a part of the overall MSC plan to build a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield around key locations.In this, it will be somewhat similar to the proposed `Golden Dome’ missile defence initiative of the US or the deployed Israeli `Iron Dome’, which only has to protect a very small country.It is estimated the expansive Golden Dome, with the capability to also shoot down missiles in space, will cost around $500 billion over the next 20 years.Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, at the `Ran Samwad’ conclave at Mhow on Tuesday, said he was sure India could build its own “Iron or Golden Dome” under the MSC at “an affordable cost” with a whole-of-nation approach.“It will act both as a shield and sword,” the CDS said, in tune with the PM’s statement that the defence shield will not only thwart aerial threats but also launch counter-strikes to hit the adversary “many times more”.This clearly implies India will go in for a major expansion of its conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of missiles like Pralay (500-km strike range), BrahMos (increased range from 450-km to 800-km) and land-attack cruise missiles (1,000-km range).Gen Chauhan, on his part, acknowledged the proposed defence shield will require “a colossal amount of integration” of myriad capabilities as well as development of infrastructure and processes for “detection, acquisition and neutralisation of enemy air vectors, using soft and hard kill options, including kinetic and directed energy weapons (like lasers)”.The shield, of course, will require multi-domain ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) through an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors deployed on land, air, sea, undersea and space.Then, robust land and sea-based batteries of a wide array of short to long range SAM missiles, high-power lasers and other weapons will be needed. Finally, reliable command and control posts to manage the sensors and weapons with an integrated air picture to effectively respond in real-time.A small beginning was made with DRDO’s maiden test of an integrated air defence weapon system (IADWS) on Aug 23. It included quick reaction surface-to-air missiles (QRSAMS, with 30-km interception range), very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS, with 6-km range) missiles and a 30-kilowatt laser-based directed energy weapon (DEW, with 3.5-km range).“Many of the building blocks for the MSC defence shield have either been developed or are being developed. The real challenge will be to integrate them all. It will cost a lot of money for a large country like India,” a source said.A comprehensive defence shield will also include the operational deployment of Phase-I of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which has been developed by DRDO to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, DRDO also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","The plan is to test the m1 missile, with an interception range of 150-km, in 2026. The aim is to complete the development of these three long-range surface-to-air missiles by 2028. Chief of defence staff general anil chauhan said he was sure india could build its own “iron or golden dome” under the msc.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123536546,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-392171,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Pallavi CT's post on X

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday latched on to US President Donald Trump's statement on the recent India-Pakistan conflict and attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying the PM stopped military action within five hours of Trump's 24-hour ultimatum.The Lok Saha leader of opposition claimed that Trump dialled PM Modi and said:(Listen… whatever you’re doing, stop it within 24 hours, and Narendra Modi stopped everything within five hours.)Hitting back at Rahul Gandhi's claim, BJP leader and Mumbai BJP's co-convenor Pallavi CT, asked: If Modiji had listened to Trump & halted Operation Sindoor , then why did Trump impose tariffs on India?""BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari wrote on X: ""Rahul Gandhi speaks like a local thug!""Trump, once again on Wednesday, without offering substantial proof, claimed that he brokered a truce between India and Pakistan by using trade as leverage.Addressing a cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump claimed he had spoken with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he described as a ""terrific man.""""I'm talking to a very terrific man, Modi of India. I said, what's going on with you and Pakistan? Then I spoke to Pakistan about trade. I said, what's going on with you and India? This has been going on for a hell of a long time, sometimes under different names for hundreds of years,"" the US president said without clearly stating if he spoke to the PM amid Operation Sindoor or after India's military action.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, during the Monsoon Session, has already debunked Trump's incessant claims that he spoke to PM Modi amid Operation Sindoor.Jaishankar said in the Lok Sabha that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump did not have any calls between April 22 (when the US leader called New Delhi to express condolences for the Pahalgam terror attack) and June 17 (when the Indian leader was in Canada for the G20 Summit).He futher said: ""But I said, what's going on? I said, I don't want to make a trade deal.... I said, no, no, I don't want to make a trade deal with you. You're going to have a nuclear war. You guys are going to end up in a nuclear war. And that was very important to them. I said, call me back tomorrow, but we're not going to do any deals with you, or we're going to put tariffs on you that are so high. I don't give a damn.

Modi's assertion came in response to the opposition's taunt that he should show the courage and call the US president out if he had made a false claim.","Congress leader rahul gandhi latched on to us president donald trump's statement on the recent india-pakistan conflict.

Singh: We must be ready for unforeseen challenges

NEW DELHI: The Indian armed forces and defence industry must be prepared for all kinds of security challenges from short-duration battles to even a five-year war amid the current unpredictable geopolitical situation, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday, citing examples from Operation Sindoor and the long-drawn Russia-Ukraine war.""India has never been a nation that seeks war. We have never initiated aggression against anyone. However, the present geopolitical reality is quite different. Even though we do not harbour any aggressive intent, if someone challenges us, it becomes imperative that we respond with strength. We do not want anybody's land but we are ready to go to any extent to protect our land,"" Singh said, speaking at the 'Ran Samwad' conclave at Mhow. The armed forces and defence industry must remain ready for new innovations. tnnThe armed forces and defence industry must remain ready for unforeseen challenges while mastering existing technologies to stay ahead of the curve to effectively tackle complexities of modern-day warfare that now extends to space and cyberspace, defence minister Rajnath Singh said.Describing Operation Sindoor as a ""striking demonstration"" of technology-driven warfare and ""a great example demonstrating the success"" of indigenous weapons, Singh said, ""Our endeavour must be to define the battlefield and the rules of the game ourselves, compelling the adversary to fight there, so that the lead advantage always remains with us.""The sheer numbers of soldiers or the size of weapon stockpiles are no longer enough because cyberwarfare, artificial intelligence, unmanned aerial vehicles, satellite-based surveillance and real-time intelligence are shaping wars of the future.""Technology is advancing at such a pace that by the time we fully grasp one innovation, another emerges to completely alter the course of warfare,"" he further said.With it also becoming difficult to predict how long a war will last, Singh said it is crucial to continuing strengthening the domestic defence industry. ""If any war stretches for two months, four months, a year, two years, even five years, then we should be fully prepared. We must ensure our surge capacity is sufficient...We have indeed made significant progressbut there is still a long way ahead,"" he said.""What we require today is not just defensive preparedness but also a proactive strategy. Future wars will not merely be battles of weapons; they will be a play of technology, intelligence, economy and diplomacy.

Pakistan Link In Pahalgam Confirmed: Funeral Of Attacker Neutralized In Op Mahadev Held In Pok

NEW DELHI: Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev, which saw Indian security personnel avenge the Pahalgam terror attack with targeted hits on Pakistani territory as well as the elimination of three Pakistani terrorists who had killed 26 innocent Indians in cold blood, have sent a clear message to the Pakistan-based terror masterminds about “the consequences of playing with lives of Indian citizens,” home minister Amit Shah said here on Wednesday.The comments came during Shah’s meeting here with Operation Mahadev bravehearts from the Indian Army , CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir police; during which he felicitated them on the successful neutralisation of Pahalgam mastermind Suleiman alias Faisal Jatt and his accomplices Afghan and Jibran, in an encounter in Dachigam forest area on the outskirts of Srinagar. “Technical analysis by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) conclusively established that the terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev were the ones who had unleashed the mayhem in Pahalgam,” said Shah.As part of Operation Mahadev, Indian Army para commandos, along with CRPF and J&K Police, had on July 28 eliminated the three Pahalgam attackers after cornering them in their temporary hideout, ending a long and painstaking manhunt to deliver justice to the 26 victims of Pahalgam attack.“I congratulate all the security personnel on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the public, for having fortified the sense of security among countrymen,” Shah told them.He noted that the personnel had shown the world that terrorists, irrespective of the change in tactics and strategy, cannot escape unscatched after harming Indian interests.Stating that Pahalgam attack was an attempt to derail the ‘Kashmir mission’ — defined by restoration of normalcy and boosting of development in the Valley — when tourism was at its peak, the home minister said the people of India were content with Operation Sindoor but this satisfaction turned into self-confidence with Operation Mahadev.“This trust in security forms the foundation of aspirations to see India take the lead globally, in every field,” said the home minister.Shah underlined that J&K police now take the lead in joint anti-terror operations conducted along with the Army and CAPFs in Kashmir.“Operation Sindoor and Operation Mahadev instilled a sense of joy and enthusiasm among those in power and the Opposition alike; both the sides expressed gratitude towards the forces,” Shah told the Operation Mahadev heroes.","Operation sindoor and operation mahadev have sent a clear message to the pakistan-based terror masterminds, says home minister amit shah.

Day of the Jackal

There are a number of reasons. After “Lady Doctors” did quite well, I received several offers to write about the first women lawmakers, engineers, lawyers and so on. But I didn’t want to be boxed in as a writer only covering forgotten women. I wanted to do something completely different in tone and subject.While exploring ideas, I came across the story of Virendranath Chattopadhyay, brother of Sarojini Naidu. Unlike Sarojini, who followed the Gandhian path, Virendranath was a revolutionary and anarchist, pursued by the British Secret Service across Europe. He lived in the UK, France, Berlin, Sweden, and finally the Soviet Union, where he was executed during Stalin’s Great Purge.I also discovered his rival, MN Roy, better known in West Bengal as a co-founder of Indian communism. He too had a dramatic life—pursued by intelligence agencies, becoming a protégé of Lenin, and escaping Soviet Russia just before Virendranath’s execution.Though there are scholarly works on both men, I realised no popular history combined their stories. So I set out to do just that—write an accessible, engaging book for the ordinary reader rather than an academic audience.That’s where it all began.I can’t take much credit for this—it wasn’t really investigative journalism. Scholars have long written about Chatto, and I acknowledge their work in my book. It’s not a secret, though perhaps not widely known in India beyond academic circles. There’s also been discussion on social media—long tweet threads, for instance—and that’s probably where I first came across the idea.What I realised, however, is that while his story is known in scholarly circles, we lack accessible popular histories of such figures. In India, when we talk about revolutionaries, most people know Bose or Bhagat Singh, but not others like Chatto, who were largely erased or forgotten.From there, most of my research happened at the British Library in London, where I’m fortunate to have access. I found valuable material on both men—particularly Roy, who wrote prolifically and left behind books and letters that gave me another important source.My own background of moving around a lot drew me to stories of people who lived across borders, and both Chatto and Roy were true cosmopolitans and internationalists. They spoke multiple languages—Chatto knew 14 or 15—and moved in circles with figures like Lenin, Stalin, Sun Yat-sen, Rosa Luxemburg, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gandhi and Nehru. That immediately fascinated me.As for why they were overlooked, there are several reasons. First, Chatto’s execution in Stalin’s Great Purge in 1937 was concealed for decades; his fate only came to light in 1991 when the KGB archives were opened. Even his family thought he had simply died. Second, both men lived abroad and wrote largely in foreign languages, so their work was inaccessible to most Indians. Third, they clashed with Gandhi, Nehru, and even Sarojini Naidu—Chatto once called his sister a puppet of Gandhi and Nehru—so naturally they were pushed to the margins.Ultimately, both were brilliant but uncompromising, and I describe them as “magnificent failures.” They achieved a great deal, but their refusal to play the political game ensured they were sidelined from mainstream Indian history.This book was a huge challenge because of its vast scope—three main countries, but also Mexico, Germany, France, Sweden and others. I don’t think I’ve entirely succeeded in capturing everything, simply because there were too many strands. My aim was not to include every single thing Chatto or Roy said, or every major character they encountered—otherwise the book would become unreadable. I kept it to under 300 pages and focused instead on conveying their human side.For me, this book is about what it is to be human: to try, to fail, to try again, to make mistakes, to have toxic relationships and repeat them, to struggle and still keep going. That was the essence I wanted to bring out in Chatto and Roy.I was especially glad about a review by Vappala Balachandran. As a former officer of the Indian secret service, he had known some of these figures personally, like ACN Nambiar. He wrote that the book captured both the tragic plight of Chatto—trapped and eventually executed by Stalin—and the humanity of these two men. That meant a lot to me, because my goal was not to overload the reader with detail, but to make these complex lives accessible and deeply human.Honestly, I don’t quite know how I managed. I worked with index cards and structured the book so that one chapter focused on Chatto and the next on Roy. That back-and-forth was intentional—I wanted readers to see what each was doing at opposite ends of the world. The chapters aren’t strictly chronological either; I begin each one with an anecdote to hook the reader before moving into the narrative.It was difficult to keep track of so many strands, and in hindsight I think the book could have used aor a timeline. I may add that in the next edition. But by the time you finish a book, you’re so exhausted you just want to hand it over to the publisher.This was also a huge project written on a very tight deadline—about 15 months. I know some factual slips and typos crept in, which I hope to correct in the next edition. It really was a challenging endeavour, and I’m not sure one ever feels fully satisfied.I hope so. I mean, the book is still sort of, you know, having reviews and finding its feet. And one thing I'm noticing is that I think it's mostly men who are reading this book, which I have no objection to, but it's a change from Lady Doctors, which I think mostly women read.A. I’m not sure, but a lot of dads are reading this book. Some call it a dad book and say they’ll give it to their fathers. I intended it for everyone, but many readers tell me their dads would love it. That’s fine—I have no issues with dads or anyone else reading it.I am obsessed with crime fiction. Most of what I read is crime fiction. But this book was influenced mostly by journalism, because I tried to make it very readable and simple. There is a lot of communist philosophy in Roy’s life, but I did not want this to be a book about philosophy.Every chapter starts with an anecdote, and then I go on to the factual things like where they were born or what they did. Anecdotes make popular history readable. My past in journalism influenced that, because in journalism you always need interesting anecdotes and quotes. Roy had many, as did others around him. For example, when he founded the Mexican Communist Party, which is unusual since he was an Indian, an observer wrote there were “six men and a calico cat. ” Quotes like these convey whole relationships.Crime fiction influenced the pacing. With history, you need to keep it fast and snappy, or the reader will stop. So, I avoided long philosophy, endless dates, or proceedings of the Communist International. That’s why I began the book with Chatto’s execution. A review of the book said I borrowed this opening from. I found this criticism odd because I haven’t copied anybody; I was just writing it as it was. I didn’t realise the similarity, since those are novels and mine is history.","Day of the jackal is a biography of indian revolutionary virendranath chattopadhyay. Chatto was executed during stalin’s great purge in the soviet union. His rival mn roy, better known in west bengal as a co-founder of indian communism, also had a dramatic life.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123548047,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34016,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

From this land of Ahmedabad, I will tell my small entrepreneurs, my small shopkeeper brothers and sisters, my farmer brothers and sisters, my animal husbandry brothers and sisters and I am saying this on the land of Gandhi ... be it the small entrepreneurs, farmers, or animal keepers of my country, for everyone, I promise you again and again, your interests are paramount for Modi,"" he said while addressing a rally in Ahmedabad.""My government will never let any harm come to the small entrepreneurs, farmers, and animal keepers. No matter how much pressure comes, we will keep increasing our strength to withstand. Today, the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan is getting a lot of energy from Gujarat and behind this are two decades of hard work,"" PM Modi said.The strong-worded remark comes just days before Trump's 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods comes into effect from August 27.Since Donald Trump hiked tariffs on Indian goods to 50 per cent, including an extra 25 per cent, penalty for India’s discounted Russian crude purchases - ties between New Delhi and Washington have soured.The US accuses India of indirectly funding Moscow’s war in Ukraine through these oil imports, a claim New Delhi has flatly dismissed. India began buying Russian crude at cheaper rates after Western nations sanctioned Moscow following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Foreign minister S Jaishankar, speaking in Delhi on Saturday, mocked Washington’s stance.""It’s ironic for a pro-business American administration to accuse others of doing business,"" he quipped, when asked about the US criticism.Taking a sharper swipe, he added: ""If you don’t like Indian oil or refined products, don’t buy them. Nobody is forcing you. But Europe buys, America buys.
