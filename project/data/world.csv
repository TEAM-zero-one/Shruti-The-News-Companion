'Unfortunate occurrences can be avoided': BSF-BGB talks flag border row; vow zero tolerance on insurgents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unfortunate-occurrences-can-be-avoided-bsf-bgb-talks-flag-border-row-vow-zero-tolerance-on-insurgents/articleshow/123575179.cms,"ANI file photo

DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Border Security Force (BSF), at the DG-level talks with Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) in Pilkhana, Dhaka, took up the recurrent border attacks, assault and stone-pelting incidents against its personnel and Indian nationals by the Bangladeshi miscreants, saying that these had left 68 BSF personnel injured last year and another 35 until June 30 this year.BSF DG Daljit Singh Chawdhary and his BGB counterpart Major General Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Siddiqui, during the talks held from Aug 25 to 28, discussed the issue of construction of single-row-fence (SRF) within 150 yards of the international border (IB) on the Indian side. While BGB DG raised concern over what he termed as “illegal construction work within 150 yards of IB”, Chawdhary underlined that SRF has no defence potential and is purely aimed at curbing and preventing trans-border crime.“Both sides mutually agreed to constructively engage the respective higher authorities for concurrence on the pending work within 150 yards of IB....(they) agreed to follow the laid-down procedure while erecting SRF,” said the joint statement issued by BSF and BGB at the end of the biannual talks, the last leg of which was held in February 2025 in New Delhi.At their joint press conference in Dhaka, Siddiqui objected to the use of lethal weapons by BSF against Bangladesh nationals intercepted on the international border.Chawdhary however clarified that a BSF personnel fires only in self-defence, that too as a last resort in the face of “imminent threat” to his life. “Such unfortunate occurrences can be avoided if a proper fence is put up in place on the border from both the sides,” he said.To maintain transparency in any such retaliatory action by BSF, the force will be providing around 5,000 body-worn cameras to its border personnel, a source told TOI.Another official said BSF response to attacks by border misadventures by Bangladeshi miscreants is always graded, and added that BGB must control potential intruders and trans-border criminals on its side, to prevent these mishaps.BSF and BGB chiefs meanwhile agreed to step up coordinated border patrols and undertake joint efforts to bring down the incidents of assault by intensifying public awareness about the sanctity of international border.Chawdhary elaborated on his concern regarding the delay on part of BGB and Bangladeshi authorities in taking back illegal Bangladeshi intruders apprehended by BSF. As per data shared with TOI, 2,404 incoming and 3,102 outgoing Bangladeshi nationals were apprehended by BSF within a year of the regime change in Dhaka.As regards trans-border insurgent groups and their camps, both sides agreed to adopt a zero-tolerance approach and take concurrent action based on real-time information.The next DG-level conference is provisionally scheduled to be held in New Delhi in March 2026.","Border security force (bsf) held talks with border guard bangladesh (bgb) in pilkhana, dhaka.

India–Canada Relations Set For Reset; Modi And Carney Seek To Mend Broken Ties | G7 Summit

NEW DELHI: After an ugly diplomatic spat over the killing of a Khalistan separatist that saw bilateral ties hit rock bottom last year, India and Canada took a significant step forward Thursday to normalise the relationship as they announced appointments of high commissioners in each other's capitals. This followed the agreement in June, when PM Narendra Modi met his counterpart Mark Carney, to take ""calibrated and constructive"" steps to stabilise ties.India announced the appointment of senior diplomat Dinesh Patnaik as the new high commissioner to Canada. Patnaik is presently India's ambassador to Spain and is expected to take up his new assignment shortly, according to the ministry of external affairs. Shortly after that, Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand announced the name of veteran diplomat Christopher Cooter, who has experience of having served in India earlier, as the new high commissioner to India.Modi had met Carney on the margins of the G7 summit in Alberta in June, agreeing to take steps to rebuild the relationship based on shared democratic values, respect for the rule of law, and commitment to upholding the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.The two sides had then agreed to pursue a balanced partnership grounded in ""mutual respect for concerns and sensitivities, strong people-to-people ties, and growing economic complementarities"".Official sources said India will continue to pursue with Canadian authorities the need to act against Khalistan separatists who seek to hurt Indian interests.India had expelled dozens of diplomats earlier, as the relationship took a nosedive over the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar for which Ottawa blamed the Indian govt. India always maintained that the govt led by Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau never provided any evidence to back its claim. While Canada expelled Indian high commissioner Sanjay Verma and five other Indian diplomats accusing them of running a campaign of violence in Oct last year, India had said Verma and others were withdrawn because Canadian authorities had failed to ensure security for him and other Indian diplomats in an ""atmosphere of extremism and violence"".Ottawa Thursday described the fresh appointments as an important step towards restoring necessary diplomatic services to citizens and businesses in both countries.""The appointment of a new high commissioner reflects Canada's step-by-step approach to deepening diplomatic engagement and advancing bilateral cooperation with India. This appointment is an important development toward restoring services for Canadians while strengthening the bilateral relationship to support Canada's economy,"" said Anand. In line with the understanding reached in the Modi-Carney meeting, the two sides are also considering restarting talks for Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA) that could clear the path for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).According to Canada, Cooter has 35 years of diplomatic experience, having served most recently as Canada's charge d'affaires to Israel and as Canada's high commissioner to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Mauritius and Madagascar. He has also served as first secretary in the Canadian high commission to India, Nepal and Bhutan, in New Delhi, from 1998 to 2000.","India and canada announce appointments of high commissioners in each other's capitals.

US President Donald Trump was ""not happy"" but ""not surprised"" by Russia’s latest missile and drone strikes on Kyiv that killed at least 19 people, the White House said on Thursday, while urging “both sides” to move toward ending the war.“He was not happy about this news, but he was also not surprised. These are two countries that have been at war for a very long time,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during her daily briefing.Leavitt added, “Russia launched this attack on Kyiv, and likewise, Ukraine recently dealt a blow to Russia's oil refineries.”The Russian barrage hit residential apartment blocks, a European Union mission, and a British government cultural centre in one of the largest attacks since the war began in February 2022, reported AFP,Trump, who had pledged to end the Ukraine conflict “within 24 hours” of taking office, has since acknowledged the situation is more complex than anticipated. A summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month in Alaska failed to yield any breakthrough.Leavitt said the president may issue further remarks on the Kyiv attack and reiterated Trump’s stance on seeking a negotiated end to the war.“Perhaps both sides of this war are not ready to end it themselves,” she said. “The president wants it to end, but the leaders of these two countries... must want it to end as well.”Leavitt also claimed Trump had worked “harder than anyone” to secure peace, echoing recent remarks from the administration pointing to diplomatic efforts as ongoing.Meanwhile, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, warned that the latest strikes could set back the president’s peace efforts.“These egregious attacks threaten the peace that @POTUS is pursuing,” Kellogg posted.","Us president donald trump was ""not happy"" but ""not surprised"" by russia's latest missile and drone strikes on kyiv that killed at least 19 people.

Navarro Weighs In on Bolton, Lisa Cook and India Tariffs

US President Donald Trump’s trade counsellor Peter Navarro on Thursday sharply escalated his criticism of India, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of fuelling Russia’s war in Ukraine through discounted oil purchases and warning that India’s growing economic links with Moscow and Beijing risk undermining global stability. In an interview with Bloomberg, Navarro accused India of playing a double game on trade and energy, alleging that its actions amounted to “Modi’s war”.“If India stops buying Russian oil, it can get 25% off tomorrow,” Navarro said when asked whether Washington was still in talks with New Delhi. “What’s troubling to me is that Modi is a great leader, India is a mature democracy, and yet they look us bald-faced in the eye and say they don’t have the highest tariffs in the world, when in fact they do. Then they say we’re not going to stop buying Russian oil. Now what does that mean? Russia uses the money it gets to fund its war machine, kill more Ukrainians, and then Ukraine comes to us and Europe and says give us more money. So American taxpayers lose because we’ve got to fund Modi’s war.”Navarro argued that Indian refiners were taking advantage of cheap Russian crude to turn a profit, worsening the conflict.“When India buys Russian oil at a discount and then Indian refiners, in partnership with Russian refiners, sell it at a premium to the rest of the world, everybody in America loses,” he said. “The road to peace runs at least partly through New Delhi’s war. I mean, Modi war.”Navarro also dismissed India’s claims of sovereignty over its oil imports, accusing the government of arrogance. “India, you’re the biggest democracy in the world. Act like one. Side with the democracies. You’re getting in bed with the authoritarians. China invaded Aksai Chin and all your territory. These are not your friends, folks.” He added that Indian purchases of roughly 1.5 million barrels of Russian oil per day were enough to bankroll “a lot of drones and bombs to kill Ukrainians”.The comments come as the United States this week imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods. The measure is expected to hit 66% of India’s exports to America. In 2024-25, the bilateral trade in goods stood at $131.8 billion ($86.5 billion exports and $45.3 billion imports), as reported by PTI.Exporters have warned of closures, job losses, and orders being cancelled, with one apparel industry executive telling PTI that the move has “effectively driven the Indian apparel industry out of the US market”.Navarro defended the tariff escalation, calling Indian trade policies unfair. “In India, 25% tariffs were put in place because they cheat us on trade. Then 25% because of the Russian oil,” he said. “That hurts American workers and businesses. Then they use the money that they get from us when they sell us stuff to buy Russian oil… and the Russians use the money to build more arms and kill Ukrainians. So American taxpayers have to provide more aid. That’s insane.”His hard line contrasts with others in Washington. Former US ambassador Nikki Haley has urged Trump to rebuild ties with India, calling it a “prized free and democratic partner” against China. Economist Jeffrey Sachs has branded the tariffs “bizarre” and “self-destructive”, warning they could drive Brics countries closer together.New Delhi has pushed back strongly. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said it was “perplexing” to target India when China and the EU remain Russia’s largest buyers of oil and gas. “We are a country where the Americans have said for the last few years that we should do everything to stabilise the world energy market, including buying oil from Russia,” Jaishankar said, calling the extra tariffs “extremely unfortunate” and pledging to “take all actions necessary to protect national interests”.","Us president donald trump’s trade counsellor peter navarro sharply escalated his criticism of india.

Why PM Modi may not have taken Trump's calls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-pm-modi-may-not-have-taken-trumps-calls/articleshow/123550114.cms,"Photo/AP

TOI correspondent from Washington:

US President Donald Trump often uses his personal cell phone to call world leaders. It's a habit carried over from his life as a real estate magnate when he phoned and received calls from elites of the world. Coming to the White House tempered the practice but did not end it. He was using the cell phone from the get-go, driving both technical security boffins and his National Security Council staff nuts.While the technical folk worried about security breaches, the NSC folks fretted about being out of the loop about his exchanges with world leaders, which are otherwise carefully noted and annotated as per formal procedures, with calls typically patched through the White House situation room, with domain experts in the loop.Trump was eventually persuaded to have safeguards and security features on the phone -- an Android device -- well into his first term, similar to what Barack Obama, who was the first president to use a mobile device in office -- a Blackberry -- submitted to. But the random calls continued. When he returned to the Oval Office for a second term, he had added a second device -- an iPhone -- and possibly a third, with which he is said to post on social media, to his collection.A recent photo of him holding an iPhone showed a lockscreen with his own picture in his signature finger-pointing pose -- inviting jibes of narcissism --with a text message from his friend Roger Stone below it.According to administration insiders, Trump has given out his cell phone number to some half a dozen world leaders, including possibly Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman, French President Emanuel Macron, India's PM Narendra Modi, inviting them to call him directly if they needed to discuss important matters urgently. ""The president’s personal cellphone has become, in many ways, the most pivotal technological device in the federal government, directly linking Trump to the outside world,"" The Atlantic magazine wrote recently, adding that ""lawmakers, friends, family members, corporate titans, celebrities, world leaders, and journalists regularly call it. ""Atlantic writers Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer are among those who have Trump's personal phone number and have spoken about calling him for an interview. Among journalists who have received Trump's call from his personal number: Fox News' Sean Hannity and British journalist Piers Morgan.But security boffins are also believed to have persuaded Trump to change the numbers of one or two of his cell phones, because, as the Atlantic noted, more than 100 people now have the number, and he remains prone to picking up the phone, even when he does not recognize the incoming number. So if he phoned PM Modi from a new personal number, how would the latter, who is also known to use a cell phone, know who's calling unless they've exchanged updated numbers?That may explain why PM Modi apparently didn't take four calls from Trump in recent weeks, as reported by a German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. A Japanese newspaper, Nikkei Asia, carried a similar report about Modi not taking the US president’s calls, “heightening Trump’s frustration”. Officials in Washington declined to either confirm or deny if the calls were made.Another reason why Modi may not have taken Trump's purported calls is that the US President is now routinely accused of making up stuff -- from out-of-control crime in Washington DC and other Democrat cities with large black population to millions of criminals from prisons and mental asylums from all over the world infiltrating America.New Delhi, which is big on form, rulebook and protocol, now clearly believes Trump is a loose cannon who is prone to hyperbole and shooting off the cuff with little regard to discretion or accuracy. From throwing out random numbers about the number of fighter jets shot in the India-Pak spat to the imminence of it going nuclear, he has tossed out one verbal hand grenade after another, sometimes based on misrepresentation or misreading of the situation, frustrating his own bureaucracy. No one on the US side or Indian side has a clue how to contain this. The Indian side may also have been concerned about the possibility of Trump pulling a repeat of his antics with the Vietnamese president, where he announced a deal that hadn't been fleshed out, causing considerable confusion and embarrassment in Hanoi.",Us president donald trump often uses his personal cell phone to call world leaders.

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat addressed the media on Thursday at the event that marked the centenary of the organisation.On the first day of the lecture series, Bhagwat had shared his vision for the future of India and the role of 'swayamsevaks' (RSS volunteers) in shaping it. The speech was translated live in English, French and Spanish for the foreign delegates.On the second day, he pitched for Swadeshi, saying its true spirit lay in the nation engaging internationally by choice, not under pressure. The RSS chief said the fanaticism has increased in the current world order as people tend to cancel those who speak against their views.Speaking on the RSS's coordination with the ruling BJP, the RSS chief said there may be a struggle, but there's no quarrel.""No quarrel anywhere, but being on the same page on all issues is not possible; we always trust each other. I am an expert in running 'shakhas', the BJP is an expert in running the government; we can only give suggestions to each other,"" he said.He said even if a man in the chair ""is 100 per cent for us, he knows what the hurdles are"" and that ""we have to give him that independence"".""We are having good coordination with every government, both state governments and the central government. But there are systems which have some internal contradictions. The system in general is the same, which was invented by the British so that they can rule. So, we have to have some innovations,"" Bhagwat said.He further added, ""Then, we want something to happen. Even if the man in the chair is 100% for us, he has to do it, and knows what the hurdles are. He may or may not be able to do it. We have to give him that independence. There is no quarrel anywhere.""Mohan Bhagwat said that he never advocated for retirement at the age of 75, nor did he ever say someone should retire, putting an end to the buzz that his reference was meant for PM Modi, as the BJP has a practice of encouraging leaders to step down after the age of 75.""I never said I will retire or someone should retire. In Sangh, we are given a job, whether we want it or not. If I am 80 years old, and Sangh says go and run a 'shakha', I will have to do it. We do whatever the Sangh tells us to do...This is not for anyone's retirement. We are ready to retire or work - as long as the Sangh wants us to,"" he said on the question of 'should Indian leaders retire at the age of 75 years'.Mohan Bhagwat said the RSS supports reservation ""as provided in the Constitution"".""Caste-based reservation must be approached with sensitivity. Deendayal Ji had a vision -- those at the bottom should strive to rise, and those at the top should extend a hand to pull them up. The Sangh supports reservation as provided in the Constitution,"" he said.He also referred to the All Hindu Dharmacharyas, who declared in the Udupi Sammelan in 1969 that untouchability does not have acceptability in Hindu Dharma.Mohan Bhagwat said it is generally suggested for a family in India to have three children. However, he said that resources should be managed accordingly.""To keep a civilisation alive, 2.1 is mentioned; it basically means three children. But, resources also have to be managed, so we must restrict to 3,"" Bhagwat said, adding that having three silbings ""helps a child in an ego management"".The RSS chief said infiltration should be stopped as every country has their own rules and regulations with limited resources.He said conversion and illegal migration are key reasons for demographic imbalance.""Religion is an individual's own choice. No one should be forcefully converted. We have to stop it. The second issue is infiltration. Every country has their own rules and regulations, limited resources. So, infiltration should be stopped, and the government is making efforts to stop this... It is important to give employment to the citizens of our country,"" he said.He further said: “Every nation has its rules and regulations. The world is ‘Kutumb’, but every place has its own standards. Freedom is discipline also…Not allowing illegal immigrants in the country doesn't contradict the concept of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'.”Asked how the Sangh views the challenge of preserving values and traditions in an era of technology and modernisation, Bhagwat said: ""Technology and modernity are not opposed to education. Education is not just about information; it is about shaping a cultured individual. The new education policy provides foreducation (five-fold holistic learning).""Bhagwat said education is not just about cramming information.""It is to make a person cultured with values. Education should impart our values based on our tradition and culture,"" he said.Responding to a question on whether Sanskrit should be made compulsory, Bhagwat said: ""To understand self & our knowledge, tradition, basic knowledge of Sanskrit is necessary. It needn't be made compulsory. But, to understand Bharat in the true sense, it is essential to study Sanskrit. That urge is to be created.""""No point in having any dispute over languages, all should together decide on a common transactional language. Everyone should be fluent in a mother tongue, language of state and common transactional language; no bar in learning more,"" the RSS chief said.In a massive public outreach, the RSS has planned to organise several events, including more than one lakh 'Hindu sammelans', across the country to mark its centenary year, starting with Bhagwat's address at the organisation's headquarters in Nagpur on Vijaya Dashami, which falls on October 2 this year.","Rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) chief mohan bhagwat addressed the media on thursday at the event that marked the centenary of the organisation. On the third day, he took questions on a wide range of topics concerning society. He said there may be a struggle, but there's no quarrel.

NEW DELHI: Author Arundhati Roy on Thursday said that ""almost all the people who we call ‘antinationals’ are the ones who care"" while those who project themselves as nationalists often work only to protect their own wealth.""Almost all the people who we call 'antinationals' are the ones who care. And then the people who call themselves great nationalists, I can bet you that 99 per cent of them are dodging taxes, have sent their kids to America, or are doing everything to make sure that what goes on in this country doesn't affect their personal wealth or their whatever bullshit,"" Roy was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI.She was speaking at the launch of her memoir. The book is centred on her relationship with her mother, Mary Roy, a women’s rights activist who fought the landmark inheritance case for Syrian Christian women in Kerala.Roy said she wrote the memoir after Mary’s death in 2022, describing it as ""born out of the onrush of memories and feelings provoked"" by her mother’s passing. ""I wrote this book because I feel that my mother is someone who deserves to be shared with the world,"" she said, as quoted by PTI.The 63-year-old, who won the Booker Prize in 1997 for, said her writing has always come from ""a place of love and caring about something"".""I write when it becomes harder to keep quiet than to write,"" Roy told PTI in an interview. She added, ""People don't understand why one gets so upset? Why do I write? Because it comes from a place of love. It comes from caring about something. Otherwise, why should I bother? Like, why shouldn't I enjoy my Booker Prize or whatever it was.""She said she does not see herself as both a writer and activist. ""It’s a label I find absurd, something like the clunky term sofa-bed,"" she remarked.Roy described writing itself as a risky pursuit. ""The most dangerous place in the history of time has been writing. I've never been under any illusion that it was a safe place. So I'm okay here. Because it's the safety that suffocates me,"" she said.The memoir details her difficult relationship with her mother, who, she recalls, insisted her children address her as “Mrs Roy” like other students at her school in Kerala. “It was almost as though for her (Mary) to shine her light on her students and give them all she had, we — he (the brother) and I (Roy) — had to absorb the darkness,” Roy writes.She added, “She was rough, and that roughness was what put some steel into my spine... So when all those people were around me — protesting and calling me names — I’d just be going like, 'Do you know whose daughter I am?' Like, my needle isn't moving at all.”Over the years, Arundhati Roy has faced cases, protests, and even a day in jail for supporting the Narmada Bachao Andolan.

Poll Do you agree with Arvind Kejriwal's claim that PM Modi has betrayed farmers by removing the import duty on American cotton? Yes, I agree No, I disagree

मोदी सरकार ने किसानों के साथ किया बहुत बड़ा धोखा। | Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party leader and former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of ""betraying farmers"" after the government removed an 11% import duty on American cotton. Linking the decision to mounting trade tensions with the United States, Kejriwal also called US President Donald Trump “a coward” for imposing steep tariffs on Indian goods.Earlier today, the centre extended duty-free import of cotton by three more months till December 31 to support textile exporters facing steep 50% tariffs in the US.“PM Modi has taken some decisions behind our backs which are a huge betrayal of the farmers of the entire country,” Kejriwal said at a press conference in Delhi. “Recently, under the pressure of Trump and America, it has been decided that the cotton that comes to India from America, till now, there was an 11 per cent duty on it. In the last few days, the Modi government has decided that the 11 per cent duty has been removed. Now, no duty will be imposed on the cotton coming from America from 19 August to 30 September, for 40 days. ”The AAP chief warned that American cotton would now be around Rs 15–20 cheaper per kilo than Indian produce, leaving domestic farmers at a disadvantage.“In the past few days, PM Modi has taken some decisions that are very harmful for the farmers of our country and ninety percent of farmers are not even aware. Once these decisions are implemented, they will be left with no option but to commit suicide,” he claimed.Kejriwal also directly targeted Trump, calling him weak in the face of countries that resisted Washington’s pressure. “Trump is a coward. Trump has bowed before countries which have stood firmly against him. I don’t know what compulsions PM Modi has that he is not saying anything,” he said.The remarks come after Washington announced a 50% tariff on Indian goods, citing India’s continued purchases of discounted Russian oil. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has described the Ukraine war as “Modi’s war” and argued that India’s oil imports are helping Moscow fund its offensive. New Delhi has dismissed the additional tariffs as “unjustified and unreasonable”, insisting it will take necessary measures to safeguard national interests.Kejriwal demanded that India respond with even tougher trade measures. “If Trump has imposed 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods, we should have imposed 100 per cent tariff on American goods. Are we a weak nation? This is a country of 140 crore people. We have a huge market. No country can afford to offend India,” he said, adding that the whole country would support higher tariffs on US imports.","Aam aadmi party leader and former delhi cm arvind kejriwal launched a sharp attack on prime minister narendra modi.

The agency said the target was also chosen considering the ""response time"" from the security agencies, news agency PTI reported, quoting a NIA spokesperson.The April 22 attack left 26 people dead, including men, women and children, who were gunned down while enjoying picnics, pony rides, or meals at local eateries in the meadow often described as 'Mini Switzerland'.According to the NIA, three Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operatives from Pakistan directly carried out the assault. The choice of location, officials said, was a calculated move to inflict maximum civilian casualties while exploiting the terrain’s distance from quick reinforcements.In June, the NIA arrested two local residents, Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar of Batkote and Bashir Ahmad Jothar of Pahalgam, for providing food, shelter and logistical aid to the terrorists. Their disclosures helped investigators confirm the attackers’ identities as Pakistani nationals linked to LeT.The three militants were eventually tracked down and killed on July 28 in Operation Mahadev, an encounter in the Dachigam-Harwan forest belt on the outskirts of Srinagar, where they had been hiding since the Pahalgam assault.In retaliation to the Pahalgam attack, the Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, carrying out precision strikes on terror hideouts across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The coordinated strikes hit at least nine sites, including training centres and headquarters of LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed, both accused of directing attacks against India.","Terrorists deliberately targeted the scenic baisaran meadow in jammu and kashmir ’s pahalgam.

Rangers face difficult decision with Artemi Panarin ’s contract and performance

New NHL Offseason Rumors | Insider Notebook 🏒

A possible extension could reshape New York’s roster core

Artemi Panarin has been the face of the New York Rangers since arriving in 2019 on a seven-year, $81.5 million contract. But as the superstar forward enters the final year of that deal, his future in New York is far from guaranteed. NHL insider Frank Seravalli suggested that if the Rangers fail to reach the postseason in 2025-26, management could be forced to put their highest-paid player on the trade block.Now 34, Artemi Panarin is not expected to command the same $11.6 million AAV he currently carries, though his offensive pedigree still makes him one of the league’s elite. Just last season, he came off a 120-point campaign with 49 goals, proving he can still dominate. However, his most recent year was a step back, with 89 points and a -9 rating — his lowest output in a full season as a Ranger.That inconsistency has fueled speculation about his long-term role. Seravalli explained the situation bluntly: “I could for sure see that happening if the New York Rangers are out. But I’m going to tell you this, I don’t think the Rangers are going to be out. I have the Rangers as a playoff team.”Cap space will play a major role in the Rangers’ decision. With just under $30 million projected for 2026, re-signing Panarin to a double-digit AAV extension would commit the team to a veteran-heavy top six.Alongside Mika Zibanejad, Vincent Trocheck, and J.T. Miller — all in their 30s with multiple years left on their contracts — New York would be doubling down on experience over youth.Seravalli believes that outcome remains likely if Panarin produces. “I’ve got lots of faith in Artemi Panarin, and I think there’s a deal on the table that makes sense for both sides or will be at some point during this upcoming season,” he said.Also Read: Winnipeg Jets captain Adam Lowry shocks fans with stunning recovery from hip surgery ahead of schedule For now, Panarin’s performance may determine whether the Rangers build around him once more — or cash in on his value before time runs out.","Rangers face difficult decision with artemi panarin ’s contract and performance.
