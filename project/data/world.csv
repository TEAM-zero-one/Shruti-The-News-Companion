'Business-like approach unlikely to succeed': India cautions UNGA over Afghanistan; abstains on draft resolution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-cautions-against-business-like-approach-for-afghanistan-abstains-in-unga-draft-resolution-passed/articleshow/122309439.cms,"India's UN envoy P Harish (File Photo)

India on Monday abstained in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on a draft resolution on Afghanistan, with its envoy to the UN noting that a “business as usual” approach is unlikely to deliver outcomes which the global community envisions for the Afghan people.The UNGA adopted the Germany-introduced draft resolution on the situation in the Asian nation. It was passed with 116 votes in favour; two against and 12 abstentions, including India.Explaining the decision, the country's UN Permanent Representative P Harish said, ""Any coherent policy to address a post-conflict situation must combine a mix of policy instruments – incentivising positive behaviour and disincentivising harmful actions. A 'business as usual' approach, without new and targeted initiatives, is unlikely to deliver the outcomes the international community envisions for the Afghan people. ""The diplomat added that no new policy instruments have been introduced to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan since August 2021, when the Taliban again took over the reins in Kabul.“An approach focused only on punitive measures, in our view, is unlikely to succeed.The United Nations and the broader international community have adopted more balanced and nuanced approaches in other post-conflict contexts,” Harish asserted.Further, he stressed that New Delhi is ""closely monitoring"" the security situation in Afghanistan, and underscored that the international community must direct its coordinated efforts towards ensuring that entities and individuals designated by the UN Security Council no longer exploit the Afghan territory for terrorist activities - a veiled reference to Pakistan.Reiterating India’s historic ties with the people of Afghanistan and its enduring commitment to meeting their humanitarian and developmental needs, he stated that while New Delhi remains committed to continued engagement with all relevant stakeholders and broadly supports the international community’s efforts towards a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan, “India has decided to abstain on this resolution. ”","The unga adopted the germany-introduced draft resolution on the situation in the asian nation.

Defense manufacturing can drive India's rise as global power: Ram Madhav,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/defense-manufacturing-can-drive-indias-rise-as-global-power-ram-madhav/articleshow/122309558.cms,"Ram Madhav (File photo)

In your new book, 'The New World: 21st Century Global Order and Bharat', you speak about a global churn. What is the biggest priority for India in this new world order?

Ram Madhav:

What will drive national growth in this new environment?

Madhav:

What about defense manufacturing?

Madhav:

You spoke of building “Brand Bharat.” What does that entail?

Madhav:

You’ve also used the term ‘dharmocracy’. Can you explain that?

Madhav:

Can foreign universities in India help promote Brand Bharat?

Madhav:

RSS is entering its 100th year. What is the vision going forward?

Madhav:

You have worked extensively in the Northeast. What explains the political shift there?

Madhav:

And RSS's role there?

Madhav:

In a wide-ranging conversation with the Times of India, Ram Madhav , senior RSS member, outlines the strategic reorientation India must undertake to navigate a changing global order. From foreign policy to technology, economic growth to ideological values, and the Northeast to dharmocracy, Madhav, who also heads the think tank India Foundation, reflects on India's opportunities and challenges in the coming decades.There is a big churn happening globally. The world is heading towards a completely different order after seven decades of a certain kind of geopolitical atmosphere. When you're confronted with a new order, you must shed some of the old habits and practices. I often cite Mao's infamous Cultural Revolution — not to endorse it, but as a metaphor. You need to think afresh.Historically, Indians have been very comfortable looking West — towards Europe and America. We do have strong ties with them. But a shift began with Narasimha Rao and taken further by Vajpayee through the Look East policy, which Modi upgraded to Act East. However, we still remain predominantly westward-facing. Meanwhile, the entire Eurasian region is in turmoil — the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Gaza-Israel tensions, and the Iran-Israel-US confrontation. These conflicts may end, but their impact will last for decades. In such a scenario, India must turn to its immediate and extended neighbourhood — Southeast Asia, ASEAN, and then the Global South, including Africa and Latin America.In the past, trade — especially in goods — powered national growth. Now, it will be technology. Prime Minister Modi has rightly focused on this with initiatives like the National Research Foundation and an emphasis on areas like quantum technology. But we still have a lot of ground to cover. Domestically, we must prioritise the economy over the next 20 years — something like what Bill Clinton famously said: “It’s the economy, stupid. ”Take China — between 1980 and 2000, it focused solely on economic growth. Deng Xiaoping even put communism on hold to prioritise economic development. India must aim for sustained 9–10% growth. The current 8% is good, but we must aspire for more.That’s a massive opportunity. Everyone talks about India's weakness in manufacturing, and it's true. But manufacturing has saturated globally, defense manufacturing has huge potential. India itself is a major consumer of defense equipment. Given the current global war-like environment, every nation is ramping up its defense. This is a golden opportunity not just for ‘Make in India’ but ‘Make for the World’. That’s where we can become a manufacturing powerhouse.In the outgoing world order — post-World War II — Western powers created institutions aligned with their interests and were able to set their agenda. But today, the West is no longer in a position to dictate the global agenda. If India doesn’t take a proactive role, others like China will. India must assert itself not just as an economic and technological power, but also ideologically.Democracy is one such idea. The Chinese model offers economic freedom but not political freedom. Ours is different — full freedoms, rooted in pluralism, respect for sovereignty, patriotism, and sustainability. These are values India must articulate. Take yoga — that’s one idea we gave to the world. The last profound political idea from India was Gandhi’s non-violence. We must now think of the next idea. That’s what I mean by Brand Bharat.Democracy, in its Western sense, often equates to majoritarianism — majority wins, period. In a dharmocracy, the majority may form a government, but governance must be through consensus. Gandhi’s idea of Ram Rajya was not a theocracy — it was a model where the weakest had as much power as the strongest. Deendayal Upadhyaya also said that elections are majoritarian, but governance must be consensus-driven. That’s the Indian model — dharmocracy.Absolutely. Earlier, foreign dignitaries visiting India were taken to Qutub Minar or Red Fort — symbols of our subjugation. Today, they also visit temples, attend Ganga Aarti. That’s our civilizational identity. But we can build up on that. With nearly 100 foreign institutions now allowed to open campuses in India, they will engage with India from the inside. However, they will mostly teach Indian students. So our education system must consciously integrate Brand Bharat thinking.Formal centenary celebrations begin in October. The Sarsanghchalak will share the vision then. But as someone associated with RSS for decades, I can say this: it’s a unique organisation. In 100 years, there has been no split, no dissidence, no weakening — only growth. It's entirely voluntary. No one is paid. It’s run by those who see it as a duty.Its openness, adaptability, and relevance in every era are its strengths. Whether during the 1962 war, the Emergency, or the Ram Janmabhoomi movement — RSS remained central to India’s national life. It is an organisation that deserves academic study in itself.I don’t believe in right-left binaries. But yes, the rise of BJP and nationalist sentiments in the Northeast, especially in the last 10 years, has brought emotional integration with the rest of India. Earlier, people there felt Delhi was another country. That has changed. Under PM Modi, every week a minister visited some state. This continuous engagement built a sense of belonging.When we contested in Nagaland in 2017, even in remote villages, BJP flags were seen. We won 12 out of 20 seats we contested. Such change signals, besides representing BJP’s appeal, a deep emotional integration.RSS has worked there under extremely difficult conditions. Cadres were kidnapped, tortured, even killed. Yet they went from across India — from Kerala, Maharashtra — to serve those areas, often with no knowledge of local languages or familiarity of food habits. Organisations like Vivekananda Kendra and Ramakrishna Mission played vital roles in tribal education and cultural pride.Today, Arunachal Pradesh, for instance, communicates in Hindi. That wasn’t imposed — it evolved naturally due to years of engagement. That silent foundational work held the region together in its most fragile times.","Ram madhav, senior rss member, outlines the strategic reorientation india must undertake.

Poll Should India take a stronger stance against unilateral economic sanctions? Yes, absolutely. No, it's not our business.

PM Modi joins BRICS leaders for family photo at 17th BRICS Summit in Rio

NEW DELHI: The 11-member BRICS comprising key emerging economies condemned in “the strongest terms” the Pahalgam terrorist attack, seeking concerted action against UN-designated terrorists and terrorist entities, and unambiguously backed a comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council (UNSC), in 2 significant takeaways for India from the Rio Summit.Among other highlights was India joining BRICS in condemning attacks on Iran since June 13 (without naming Israel), expressing grave concern about the situation in “Occupied Palestinian territory” with the resumption of “continuous Israeli attacks” against Gaza, obstruction to humanitarian aid and use of starvation as a method of warfare – something which Israel has rejected.According to the Rio Declaration, BRICS nations expressed serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures which distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules.While this was an obvious message to the Trump administration, the declaration stopped short of naming the US because some members were not comfortable with it. The declaration also said that the imposition of unilateral coercive measures are contrary to international law and measures like unilateral economic sanctions have far-reaching negative implications.At India’s behest, there was ample focus on terrorism in the declaration that urged zero tolerance for terrorism and rejected double standards in countering terrorism. India uses the same language to counter Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism and also China’s shielding at the UN of UN-banned terrorists based in Pakistan.“We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 22 April 2025, during which at least 26 people were killed and many more injured. We reaffirm our commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations, including the cross-border movement of terrorists, terrorism financing and safe havens,” said the declaration, while calling for an expeditious finalization and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the UN framework.According to Indian government officials, the Rio summit also adopted “strongest-ever language” for UN reforms by calling for a comprehensive reform of the Security Council with a view to making it more democratic, representative, effective and efficient, and toincrease the representation of developing countries. Recalling the 2022 Beijing and 2023Johannesburg Declarations, China and Russia, as permanent members of the UNSC, reiterated their support to the aspirations of Brazil and India to play a greater role in the United Nations, including its Security Council. Interestingly, the Beijing declaration had only said in the UN, and not 'including in UNSC'. The Rio Declaration also said a reformed UNSC will amplify the voice of the Global South.While condemning the attacks on Iran – and expressing concern over “deliberate” attacks on “peaceful” nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards – the declaration was also littered with references to the Israel-Palestine issue, something which continues to test India’s balancing exercise. In the case of Iran, there was no mention of Israel like in an earlier statement by BRICS last month, which too was endorsed by India, but on this occasion the declaration didn’t just express concern but also condemned the military strikes.In the case of Gaza, the declaration explicitly mentioned “continuous Israeli attacks” calling for adherence to international law and recalling that the Gaza Strip is an inseparable part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It also called for full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip while seeking talks for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.However, while the Rio summit cranked up the pressure on Israel by mentioning allegations like the use of starvation, this is not the first time that India has joined BRICS in condemning some of Israel’s actions in Gaza. It did so in a meeting of the foreign ministers in June last year and again at the Kazan summit where BRICS denounced Israel’s attacks against humanitarian operations and facilities.",The 11-member brics comprising key emerging economies condemned in “the strongest terms” the pahalgam terrorist attack.

""We've built eight LUHs there already. LCH will move there in a phased manner. Eventually, even IMRH, our 12-tonne-class helicopter, will be built there,"" he said.

'An enduring symbol of love, compassion, patience': PM Modi on Dalai Lama

India says only Dalai Lama can pick successor

China on Monday protested against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday wishes to the Dalai Lama and the participation of senior Indian officials at his 90th birthday celebrations in Dharamshala, warning that India should not interfere in its internal affairs.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in a media briefing on Monday that New Delhi should “fully appreciate the great sensitivity of Xizang-related issues and recognise the separatist nature of the 14th Dalai Lama”.“The 14th Dalai Lama is a political exile, who for a long, has been engaged in separatist activities and attempted to separate Xizang from China under the cover of religion,” Mao said, as quoted by news agency PTI.“India should act and speak prudently and stop using this issue to meddle in China’s internal affairs,” she added.She confirmed that Beijing had lodged an official protest with the government. China refers to Tibet as Xizang and maintains that the Dalai Lama is part of a separatist movement, though he has long maintained that he only seeks greater autonomy for Tibetans within China.PM Modi, who was attending the Brics Summit, had posted a message on X on Sunday: “I join 1.4 billion Indians in extending our warmest wishes to His Holiness the Dalai Lama on his 90th birthday.He has been an enduring symbol of love, compassion, patience and moral discipline. His message has inspired respect and admiration across all faiths. We pray for his continued good health and long life.”The birthday event saw the attendance of Union ministers Kiren Rijiju and Rajiv Ranjan Singh, Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu, and Sikkim minister Sonam Lama, among others. Hollywood actor Richard Gere and political leaders from around the world also joined the celebrations, signalling strong support for the Tibetan spiritual leader.India has strongly rejected China's assertion that it has a role in selecting the next Dalai Lama, insisting the decision lies solely with the Tibetan spiritual leader and traditional Buddhist practices. “The Dalai Lama’s position is of immense importance, not just for Tibetans but for millions of his followers across the globe. The right to decide on his successor rests solely with him, in accordance with centuries-old Buddhist customs,” said Kiren Rijiju, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs and Minorities. He condemned Beijing’s stance as “unwarranted interference”.Also read: Dalai Lama cannot decide on reincarnation, says China; India maintains neutrality The response follows the Dalai Lama’s statement that his reincarnation would be determined by the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a body he established, and not by Chinese authorities. The Dalai Lama has previously indicated his successor would come from outside China, contradicting Beijing’s desire to select a pro-China figure from Tibet. China insists the process must include the 'Golden Urn' method and government approval.China has long maintained that any future reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must go through a process approved by the Chinese government, including the drawing of lots from a golden urn. Chinese ambassador to India Xu Feihong echoed this view, posting that “he has no authority to abolish or continue the system”.The ministry of external affairs also clarified India’s position. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “Government of India does not take any position or speak on matters concerning beliefs and practices of faith and religion.”",China lodges official protest against pm modi's birthday wishes to the dalai lama.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan army chief general Asim Munir on Monday rejected claims that Islamabad relied on external support during the recent four-day conflict with India, calling assertions ""factually incorrect"" and ""irresponsible. ""His response came days after Indian Army deputy chief Lieutenant General Rahul R Singh alleged that China provided active support to Pakistan during the operation, using the conflict as a “live lab” to test weapon systems, with Turkiye also supplying military equipment.Speaking at the national defence university in Islamabad during a graduation ceremony, Munir said, “Insinuations regarding external support in Pakistan's successful Operation Bunyanum Marsoos are irresponsible and factually incorrect and reflect a chronic reluctance to acknowledge indigenous capability and institutional resilience developed over decades of strategic prudence.”He criticised India for involving other countries into what he described as a ""purely bilateral military conflagration.""“Naming other states as participants in the purely bilateral military conflagration is also a shoddy attempt at playing camp politics,” he said.Munir warned that any future provocation would be met with full force. “Any misadventure or attempt to undermine Pakistan's sovereignty will be met with a swift, and resolute response without any constraints or inhibitions,” he said.He further added, “Any attempt to target our population centres, military bases, economic hubs and ports will instantly invoke a deeply hurting and more than reciprocal response.”Munir rejected claims that Pakistan had to plead for an end to the fighting, saying wars are not decided by media headlines or imported weapons.“Wars are not won through media rhetoric, imported fancy hardware, or political sloganeering, but through faith, professional competence, operational clarity, institutional strength and national resolve,” he said. Operation Sindoor was launched by India on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which killed 26 civilians.The operation targeted 9 terrorist infrastructure sites in areas controlled by Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Pok).The operation led to four days of intense military exchanges, ending on May 10 after both sides agreed to halt the hostilities.Last week, deputy chief of army staff (capability development and sustenance), lieutenant general Rahul R Singh provided details on how China was helping Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.Speaking at the 'New Age Military Technologies' event organised by FICCI, the general said, ""When the DGMO level talks were going on, Pakistan was getting live inputs of our deployment from China. So that is one place we really need to move fast and take appropriate action.""""When the DGMO level talks were going on, Pakistan actually was mentioning that we know that your such and such important, sort of vector is primed, and it is ready for action. I would request you to perhaps, you know, pull it back. So he was getting live inputs from China,"" Singh added.Furthermore, the general explained how India was fighting three adversaries at the same time, naming Pakistan, China, and Turkey.The general said, ""We had one border and two adversaries, actually three. Pakistan was in the front. China was providing all possible support. 81% of the military hardware with Pakistan is Chinese... China is able to test its weapons against other weapons, so it's like a live lab available to them. Turkey also played an important role in providing the type of support it did; they gave Bayraktar. We saw numerous other drones also coming in during the war.

Can't allow weaponisation of critical minerals: PM Modi at Brics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-allow-weaponisation-of-critical-minerals-pm-modi-at-brics/articleshow/122305970.cms,"PM Modi at Brics

NEW DELHI: Brics countries should work to make supply chains for critical minerals and technology secure and reliable, so that no country can use these resources for its own ""selfish gain or as a weapon"" against others, said PM Narendra Modi at the Rio summit. The remarks are significant as they come at a time the global community is grappling with China's dominance of critical minerals. Quad recently announced a critical minerals initiative to secure and diversify supply chains to prevent any economic coercion or price manipulation.Modi was speaking in the presence of Premier Li Qiang who represented China at the summit in the absence of President Xi Jinping . In April this year, amid a raging trade war with the US, China suspended export of some rare earth minerals sparking global concerns about its impact on advanced technology and security industries.The call for ensuring secure and reliable supply chains was one of the suggestions the PM made at the Brics session on strengthening multilateralism, economic issues and AI to turn the grouping into a guide for the multipolar world in the future. He said Brics' diversity and multipolarity is its greatest strength.Strengthening internal systems like the Brics New Development Bank (NDB) that would lend more credibility to the call for reformed multilateralism, collaboration in agricultural research for the benefit of Global South, creation of a Brics Science and Research Repository, and ensuring responsible AI were some of the other suggestions made by Modi in his address.The PM underlined that the NDB must follow demand ""driven principle and long-term sustainability"" for granting projects.""Global standards must be created that can verify the authenticity of digital content, so that we can identify the source of the content and maintain transparency and prevent misuse,"" said Modi, adding that India will organise an AI Impact Summit next year for improved cooperation between all countries.Modi said at a time when the global community faced uncertainty and challenges, the relevance of Brics was evident. ""Global South has many hopes from us. To fulfil them, we must follow the principle of 'Lead by Example'. India is fully committed to working shoulder-to-shoulder with all our partners to achieve our common goals,"" Modi said.Addressing another session on climate, Modi said that under India's Brics presidency next year, the Indian govt will work to define Brics in a new form. ""Brics will mean - Building Resilience and Innovation for Cooperation and Sustainability,"" he said, adding that for India, climate justice is no alternative but a moral duty. He underscored India's position that without tech transfer and affordable financing for countries in need, climate action will remain confined merely to climate talks.",Pm narendra modi said brics countries should work to make supply chains for critical minerals and technology secure and reliable. The remarks are significant as they come at a time the global community is grappling with china's dominance of critical minerals.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of batting for Chinese military hardware and said that Raebareli MP has a knack for ending up on the wrong side of the patriotic discourse.BJP IT chief Amit Malviya on Monday claimed that in 2021, Rahul Gandhi questioned why Indian forces did not use Chinese-style surveillance drones and even praised the PLA’s tactics during the Ladakh standoff.""At an academic interaction in London (2023), he claimed China is winning the “technology race” and urged India to learn from Chinese military innovation, including drone warfare,"" Malviya said in a post on X and added that Rahul Gandhi has a curious obsession with Chinese military tech.""During a 2022 closed-door discussion with defence ‘experts’, Rahul reportedly pressed for India to 'explore options' similar to China’s tactical drone deployment in border areas.

Now, SEBI itself is admitting that Jane Street manipulated thousands of crores. Why did SEBI remain silent for so long?""BJP IT department head countered that SEBI's ban on a global entity demonstrates robust regulatory measures to protect small investors.He noted that the investigation itself disproves Gandhi's claims of SEBI's silence.Malviya emphasised that the Modi government's reforms have strengthened SEBI's transparency and independence. He pointed out that major financial scandals occurred during Congress rule, citing Harshad Mehta, Ketan Parekh, and the UTI incident.The BJP representative highlighted India's stock market growth, noting a USD 1 trillion increase in market capitalisation since March 2025. He detailed the mutual fund industry's 576 per cent growth over a decade, with AUM rising from Rs 8 lakh crore to Rs 54 lakh crore.Referring to Gandhi as ""Balakbudhhi"", Malviya criticised him for spreading market misinformation whilst maintaining his own investment portfolio. He cited increased SIP contributions and successful IPO launches, benefiting ordinary investors.Malviya concluded by questioning Gandhi's understanding of market operations, suggesting that the Congress party's credibility was diminishing while India's markets continued to provide opportunities for millions of new investors under the Modi government's leadership.","Bjp it chief amit malviya claims that in 2021, rahul gandhi questioned why indian forces did not use chinese-style surveillance drones.

NEW DELHI: India's education system continues to struggle with critical gaps in foundational literacy and numeracy, teacher training and financing, even as it shows consistent gains in gender parity, school completion rates and digital infrastructure. As per the 2025 Unesco SDG 4 scorecard, the country remains off-track in upper secondary and tertiary participation, lags behind global spending benchmarks, and has significant shortfalls in training qualified pre-primary teachers, though it has nearly universalised primary and lower secondary education and is improving internet connectivity in schools.India's performance on foundational learning is a key area of concern, with the report saying that countries, including India, are ""off track by 11 percentage points"" from the benchmark for achieving minimum reading proficiency by the end of primary education. India's benchmark for this indicator is 56%, but the actual achievement is substantially lower.In contrast, high-income countries reported reading proficiency levels nearing 99%, while South Asia's regional average stood at 49%. ""The large gap...is likely result of limited experience in setting realistic targets on learning outcomes, which reflects low data availability,"" it said.Gender parity is one area where India has made notable progress.The report classifies India among countries that have shown ""fast progress"" in narrowing the gender gap in upper secondary completion. India's 2025 benchmark reflects a gap of 2.3 percentage points, compared to a regional average of 3.4. ""Countries which started with a disadvantage at the expense of girls are moving towards parity,"" the report said, adding that India is aligned with this trend.Upper secondary and tertiary participation remains a serious concern. India's 2025 benchmark for upper secondary completion is 67%, but the projected out-of-school rate for youth in the 15-17 age group is still 21%. South Asia performs slightly better with a projected 13% out-of-school rate, while high-income countries have nearly achieved universal participation with rates under 2%. The report observed that ""already by 2025, it is projected that countries were off track by. ..six percentage points for upper secondary school age youth"".India's public expenditure on education was 3.1% of GDP in 2023, below the SDG benchmark of 4% and far from the National Education Policy's aspirational target of 6%. This places India below the South Asian average of 3.4% and significantly behind high-income countries, which spend between 4.8% and 5.5% of GDP. The scorecard showed, ""Countries are moving backwards in terms of public education spending, which was further away from the twin thresholds of 4% of GDP and 15% of total public expenditure in 2023 than in 2015. ""India has also not met its target for trained pre-primary teachers. The 2025 benchmark is set at 88%, but progress is slow and data limited. The report said, ""Countries are furthest behind from their 2025 national targets in training pre-primary school teachers"", with a global shortfall of seven percentage points.However, India's primary and lower secondary completion rates remain strong. The 2025 benchmarks for completion are 92% and 84%, respectively, placing India above the South Asia average of 91% for primary and 88% for lower secondary, though trailing high-income countries where completion is near-universal.While many low- and lower-middle-income countries struggle with data and implementation, India has submitted benchmarks for net connectivity in schools and is moving forward through programmes aligned with NEP. As 2030 SDG deadline approaches, the report urged countries to accelerate action.","India's education system continues to struggle with critical gaps in foundational literacy and numeracy.

NEW DELHI: Hailing the armed forces for the valour they displayed during Operation Sindoor post the Pahalgam terror attack , defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday that “peace time is an illusion and India must remain prepared for any uncertainty”.The defence minister praised the armed forces for Operation Sindoor but said the larger geopolitical situation leaves no scope for complacency in the effort to enhance preparedness. “A single delay or error in financial processes can directly affect operational preparedness,” said the minister while addressing the Controllers Conference of the Defence Accounts Department (DAD).Talking about rising demand for desi weapons of late, Rajnath said, “The world is looking at our defence sector with new respect. Operation Sindoor has boosted global demand for our indigenous armaments. Most of the equipment we once imported is now being made in India. Our reforms are succeeding because of the clarity of vision and commitment at the highest level. Sudden developments can force a complete shift in our financial and operational posture. ” The minister spoke in the presence of Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi, Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K.Tripathi, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh and defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh at the conference.The govt has over the past few years allowed the armed forces to procure arms and ammunition through the “emergency” route. Post-Operation Sindoor, it cleared a range of acquisitions for the armed forces.The armed forces have consistently complained, often publicly, about acquisitions being delayed because of the rigid approach of the bureaucracy and auditors. Rajnath called on DAD to evolve from a “controller” to a “facilitator” in sync with increasing participation of the private sector in defence. He praised DAD’s new motto “Alert, Agile, Adaptive” and noted that these are not mere words, but a reflection of the work culture required in today's rapidly evolving defence environment. “Whether it’s stepping up equipment production or adapting financial processes, we must be ready with innovative techniques and responsive systems at all times,” the minister said.Citing the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute report, which said global military expenditure reached $2.7 trillion in 2024, Rajnath said, “This opens up tremendous opportunities for India's indigenous defence industries.”The minister also said that gone were the days when expenditure in the defence sector was only considered necessary and never viewed as an economic catalyst. “Now, it is being seen as a spending which has a multiplier impact on the economy,” he said. “Earlier, there was no assessment of the economic impact of expenditure on security but things have changed now when investment in re-armament is rising exponentially. We need to pay special attention to defence economics,” he said.Singh said India, along with the rest of the world, is entering a new phase of re-armament, marked by capital-intensive investments in the defence sector. He called upon DAD to incorporate defence economics in their planning and assessments, including social impact analysis of R&D projects and dual-use technologies.Highlighting the increasing strategic and economic significance of the defence sector, Rajnath called for a shift in perception from defence spending as mere expenditure to an economic investment with multiplier impact. “Until recently, defence budgets were not seen as part of the national economy. Today, they are growth drivers,” he said.",The defence minister praised the armed forces for operation sindoor but said the larger geopolitical situation leaves no scope for complacency.

India's Reach Now Deep Into China, Pak As Russia Offers Deadly R37M Hypersonic Missile

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir on Monday rejected Indian claims that China supported Islamabad in the recent conflict as a “desperate distortion” to cover up what he claimed was India own military failure.He warned that any future aggression against Pakistan would be met with a “more than reciprocal” and “deeply hurting” response.Addressing the National Defence University in Islamabad, Munir claimed India’s assertion of Chinese assistance during Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos was “factually incorrect and irresponsible”. “Such insinuations expose a chronic Indian inability to accept Pakistan’s institutional strength, indigenous military capability, and strategic foresight,” Munir said. “Dragging third countries into a bilateral confrontation is a poor attempt at face-saving and narrative-building,” he said.China, too, sought to downplay Indian Army deputy chief Lt Gen Rahul R Singh’s assertion that Beijing provided active military support to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, using the conflict as a “live lab” to test various weapon systems. “I am not familiar with the specifics you mentioned. Let me say that China and Pakistan are close neighbours enjoying traditional friendship.Defence and security cooperation is part of the normal cooperation between the two countries and does not target any third party,” PTI quoted Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning as saying in Beijing in response to a question on Gen Singh's remarks. At the same time, Mao said the India-China relationship is in a “critical moment of improvement and development” and Beijing would like to promote steady growth of bilateral ties with New Delhi.India has claimed that China provided Pakistan with covert logistical and intelligence support during the recent clashes – an allegation not publicly endorsed by Beijing. Pakistan, however, maintains the operation was “purely indigenous”, carried out with high-level coordination across the military chain of command.Munir accused India of “camp politics” and seeking to position itself as a regional power by invoking global rivalries.Munir’s remarks come amid elevated tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, with troop deployments reinforced along the Line of Control (LoC) and diplomatic channels largely inactive.Inter-Services Public Relations, which released Munir’s remarks, framed the address as part of a broader message to both domestic and international audiences that Pakistan remains militarily prepared, politically united, and unwilling to tolerate threats to its sovereignty.",Pakistan army chief field marshal asim munir rejects indian claims that china supported islamabad in the recent conflict.

Poll Do you agree with Kiren Rijiju's statement that minorities in India enjoy more benefits than the majority community? Yes, I agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday lashed out at Union Minister Kiren Rijiju after the BJP leader claimed that minorities in India enjoy more benefits and protections than the majority.In a long post on X, Owaisi said Rijiju was not showing the true picture of what Indian Muslims go through and reminded him to follow his duties as a minister under the Constitution.Rijiju on X had stated that “India is the only country where the minorities get more benefits and protections than the majority community!”This remark triggered a strong response from Owaisi.Owaisi claimed that Rijiju was speaking like a ruler instead of someone holding a constitutional post.""You are a Minister of the Indian Republic, not a monarch. Kiren Rijiju, you hold a constitutional post, not a throne. Minority rights are fundamental rights, not charity,"" he said.He questioned Rijiju’s idea of ‘benefits’ by pointing to the abuse and violence Muslims face.""Is it a ‘benefit’ to be called Pakistani, Bangladeshi, jihadi, or Rohingya every single day? Is it ‘protection’ to be lynched? Is it protection that Indian citizens were kidnapped and pushed into Bangladesh?"" Owaisi questioned.The Hyderabad MP also raised concerns over the bulldozing of Muslim properties.""Is it a privilege to watch our homes, masjids, and mazaars being bulldozed illegally? To be made socially, politically, and economically invisible?"" he wrote.He further alleged that hate speeches were being made by top leaders.""Is it an ‘honour’ to be the target of hate speeches from no less than the Prime Minister of India?"" he said.Owaisi claimed that Muslims in India were no longer treated equally as citizens.""India’s minorities are not even second-class citizens anymore. We are hostages,"" he said.Owaisi alleged that Rijiju should answer why there is no religious parity in board memberships.""If you want to talk about ‘favours’, answer this: can Muslims be members of Hindu Endowment Boards? No. But your Waqf Amendment Act forces non-Muslims onto Waqf Boards — and allows them to form a majority,"" Owaisi said.The AIMIM leader accused the government of slashing key scholarships for Muslim students. He cited government data and said that Muslims are being left behind.""You discontinued the Maulana Azad National Fellowship. You defunded the pre-matric scholarship. You limited the post-matric and merit-cum-means scholarships. All because they benefited Muslim students,"" he wrote.""Muslims are now the only group whose numbers have fallen in higher education. Their presence in the informal economy has gone up. They have been among the worst-hit by your economic policies. This is your own govt’s data,"" Owaisi said.Furthermore, Owaisi said Muslim families are seeing a decline in progress across generations.""Indian Muslims are the only group whose children are now worse off than their parents or grandparents. Intergenerational mobility has reversed. Muslim-concentrated areas are the ones most starved of public infrastructure and basic services,"" he stated.He ended by saying that minorities in India are only asking for the justice promised by the Constitution.""We are not asking to be compared with other minorities of other countries. We are not asking for more than what the majority community gets. We are demanding what the Constitution promises: social, economic, and political justice.""",Aimim chief asaduddin owaisi lashed out at union minister kiren rijiju on monday.

Maple Leafs expected to trade defenseman for a forward



The Toronto Maple Leafs are navigating a pivotal offseason. General manager Brad Treliving and the front office are assessing every possible option to retool their lineup. With the need to create space for potential additions; possibly even a reunion between Auston Matthews and a former teammate, Toronto may need to make significant roster moves in the coming weeks.Friedman mentioned David Kampf and Calle Jarnkrok as two notable Maple Leafs who could be on the way out. Kampf, a depth center signed through 2027, carries a $2.4 million annual cap hit. While reliable on the penalty kill and defensively sound, his offensive contributions have been limited, potentially making him a expendable player.Although not directly confirmed, Friedman also hinted at the possibility that Nicholas Robertson might be a trade candidate, but refrained from mentioning his name due to personal reasons. Still, it suggests that younger talent may also be in play, especially if the Leafs aim to bolster their roster with more seasoned options.A third area of focus could be on the blue line. Friedman noted that the Maple Leafs may be looking to swap a defenseman for a forward, though he did not specify who. Previous trade chatter included links to Buffalo Sabres winger JJ Peterka, suggesting Toronto's intent to boost their offensive depth.The Leafs’ back end has long been considered a concern. If the right opportunity arises to exchange a defenseman for a more impactful forward, it’s a route management seems willing to take. Toronto has no urgency with training camp still months away, but if a new signing is imminent, the front office may need to accelerate trade discussions.The Toronto Maple Leafs have several key players to address this offseason. With names like David Kampf and Calle Jarnkrok reportedly on the trading block and whispers of a defenseman possibly being moved, Toronto’s roster could look significantly different by opening night. The strategic reshuffle is expected to create cap space and bring in the right fit for a deeper postseason run in 2025.Also Read: Johnny Gaudreau’s wife, Meredith Gaudreau Meredith Gaudreau hosts a river cruise bachelorette for Odette Frye",David kampf and calle jarnkrok reportedly on the trading block.

What is the Einstein visa? How Melania Trump qualified for a visa reserved for Nobel-level talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-einstein-visa-how-melania-trump-qualified-for-a-visa-reserved-for-nobel-level-talent/articleshow/122204926.cms,"

What is the EB-1 or 'Einstein' visa?

How did Melania Trump qualify for the Einstein visa?

The larger debate: Loopholes, privilege, and policy





When Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein visa,” in 2001, it raised eyebrows and continues to stir debate. Reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, arts, education, business, or athletics, the EB-1 green card is typically associated with Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, or globally recognized experts. Melania, a Slovenian model at the time, was not widely known for groundbreaking accomplishments, prompting questions about how she met the high bar required. So, what exactly is the Einstein visa, and how did the former First Lady qualify for a program meant for the world’s best and brightest?The EB-1 visa is a US employment-based green card designed for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in specific fields, or who are recognized as outstanding professors, researchers, or multinational executives. Applicants must prove “sustained national or international acclaim” and either win a major international award (like a Nobel Prize) or meet at least three of ten criteria set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include published work, media recognition, contributions to a field of major significance, or commanding a high salary compared to others in the same field.While the standards are rigorous, the process is subjective.Immigration officers ultimately decide if the evidence supports a claim of extraordinary ability. This subjectivity has sparked debate over how consistently the criteria are applied and who benefits most from its loopholes.Melania Trump, then known as Melania Knauss, was living in New York as a model when she applied for the EB-1 visa in 2000. It was approved the following year. Though she was featured in magazines and had some runway experience, she had not received prestigious modeling awards or reached the supermodel status typically associated with international acclaim. Critics argue her qualifications were modest compared to the visa's intent.Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett recently reignited the controversy, questioning whether Melania’s case truly exemplifies merit-based immigration. Her approval has drawn comparisons to other questionable EB-1 recipients, including Playboy models and niche artists who managed to craft narratives aligning with the visa’s requirements.Experts note that while the visa is often seen as exclusive, it can be awarded to applicants whose accomplishments, though not widely known, are well-documented and strategically framed within a narrow field. In Melania’s case, her successful petition may have emphasized uniqueness in her modeling niche, media presence, or professional trajectory.The EB-1 program, limited to around 40,000 visas annually, has been praised for attracting top global talent. But its subjective evaluation process has also made it vulnerable to exploitation. Legal experts and immigration attorneys admit that certain applicants with the right legal guidance can tailor their portfolios to meet the criteria, even without widely celebrated achievements.Adding to the irony, Melania later used her citizenship to sponsor her parents for green cards through “chain migration,” a policy her husband, Donald Trump, has publicly opposed. This contradiction has further politicized her immigration journey and raised broader questions about fairness, privilege, and transparency in the US immigration system.","Melania trump received an eb-1 visa, often dubbed the ‘einstein visa,’ in 2001.

Elon Musk's America Party: Laura Loomer predicts these people may join to spite Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-america-party-laura-loomer-predicts-these-people-may-join-to-spite-donald-trump/articleshow/122291639.cms,"ELON MUSK Forms New 'AMERICA PARTY', Declares War On Trump & Republicans | US News

Laura Loomer predicts defections to undermine Donald Trump

A bold move from Elon Musk

Cracks within the Republican base



Conservative activist Laura Loomer has reignited political tensions by claiming that several prominent conservatives may align with Elon Musk’s newly launched America Party, not necessarily out of shared ideology, but to undermine US President Donald Trump. Loomer’s remarks, shared publicly on social media, come in the wake of Musk’s official announcement of the America Party. Musk framed it as a bold alternative to the entrenched two-party system. The tech billionaire’s increasing political activity, combined with high-profile disagreements with Trump, is stirring speculation about a growing split on the American right.The timing of Loomer’s prediction is especially notable. It came just after President Trump signed off on the controversial “Big, Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping tax and spending package that drew criticism from fiscal conservatives and Musk alike. As ideological fault lines widen, Loomer’s comments reflect growing discontent within Republican ranks and hint at a possible political realignment ahead of 2026.Shortly after Musk’s announcement, Laura Loomer took to X (formerly Twitter) to make a striking prediction. She named Tucker Carlson, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG), and Rep. Thomas Massie as potential defectors to Musk’s America Party, a move she believes would be aimed at undercutting Donald Trump’s influence. “I predict Tucker Carlson, MTG, and Thomas Massie will join the new ‘America Party’ to spite President Trump,” Loomer wrote.Loomer, a longtime Trump supporter known for her hardline views, has frequently called out fellow conservatives whom she believes are disloyal or politically opportunistic. Her latest comments add fuel to speculation about rising fault lines within the GOP.Elon Musk officially launched the America Party on July 4, declaring it a response to public frustration with the current political establishment. In a widely shared post, Musk wrote, ""By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""His decision followed a public fallout with President Trump over the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” Musk had strongly opposed the legislation, criticizing its size and scope. His move to form a new party signals an effort to reshape the political conversation, particularly among conservatives dissatisfied with Trump-era policies.Tensions between Trump and various Republican figures have been escalating, especially over issues like government spending and party direction. Rep. Thomas Massie, a libertarian-leaning Republican from Kentucky, has frequently clashed with Trump, including during the pandemic when he opposed Covid relief packages. Trump once referred to him as a “pathetic loser.”Marjorie Taylor Greene, although once a close Trump ally, has recently voiced support for some of Musk’s positions. Tucker Carlson, meanwhile, has maintained a complicated relationship with Trump and may be open to political shifts that align with his populist brand. Loomer’s naming of these figures underscores growing uncertainty about where influential conservatives will place their loyalty going forward.Whether or not Carlson, Greene, or Massie will formally align with the America Party remains to be seen. But the speculation itself is already shifting political dynamics, raising new questions about Trump’s grip on the GOP and whether Musk can truly disrupt the conservative power structure.As the 2026 elections approach, the right is poised for internal battles that may define its future. One thing is clear. Elon Musk is no longer just a disruptor in tech. He is now a force reshaping the landscape of American politics.","Laura loomer predicts defections to undermine donald trump.
