NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will arrive in Jeddah today for a two-day official visit to Saudi Arabia, marking his first-ever visit to the Kingdom’s commercial capital. Invited by Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman, this trip will be PM Modi’s third to the Kingdom after earlier visits in 2016 and 2019. It comes as part of the ongoing high-level diplomatic engagements between the two nations, following the Crown Prince’s own state visit to New Delhi for the G20 Summit in September 2023.PM Modi and the Crown Prince will co-chair the second meeting of the India-Saudi Arabia Strategic Partnership Council during the visit. According to Indian Ambassador Suhel Ajaz Khan, a large number of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) are expected to be signed, with key discussions centred on strengthening economic ties, bolstering defence cooperation and addressing regional political challenges.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Jeddah, India and Saudi Arabia are set to sign at least six MoUs on Tuesday, with talks ongoing to finalize more. Key agreements are expected in space, energy, health, science, culture, and advanced technology, news agency PTI reported quoting sources. PM Modi will also discuss the Hajj quota for Indian pilgrims with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Sources said over a dozen MoUs are under discussion, with efforts underway to conclude additional deals in trade, investment, and defence.""Jeddah is a very, very significant city in terms of connectivity between India and Saudi Arabia because for centuries, Jeddah was the port for the trade between the two countries, and it is also a gateway to Mecca. So anyone who is coming for Umrah and Hajj lands up in Jeddah and then goes to Mecca,"" Indian ambassador to Saudi Arabia Suhel Ajaz Khan told PTI ahead of the prime minister's visit.""Hajj is a very important activity and the Government of India gives it a lot of importance. Ministry of Minority Affairs has been arranging this activity... There are various issues discussed in the bilateral talks. There has always been a great coordination between the Saudi government and India on Hajj,"" the ambassador said.India’s Haj quota for 2025 has increased to 175,025 from 136,020 in 2014, with arrangements in place for 122,518 pilgrims. However, around 42,000 Indians may miss the pilgrimage this year due to delays by Combined Haj Group Operators in finalizing contracts.Ambassador Khan highlighted that around 2.7 million Indians reside in Saudi Arabia, significantly contributing to the Kingdom’s development while maintaining close cultural and familial ties with India.On the defence front, the visit is expected to provide further momentum to an already robust partnership. India and Saudi Arabia signed a bilateral defence cooperation MoU in 2014, and have since conducted joint naval and land exercises.Plans are underway for another round of naval drills soon, as per Khan.Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri noted that regional and international issues such as the situation in West Asia, the Israel-Palestine conflict, and maritime security concerns related to Houthi attacks will also be discussed.Bilateral trade between the two nations currently stands at around $43 billion, and PM Modi’s visit is seen as a key step in not only boosting economic ties but also strengthening India’s engagement with the broader Gulf and Islamic world.","Prime minister narendra modi will arrive in jeddah today for a two-day official visit.

The missed visit



Canonisations that inspired a nation



A papacy marked by both unity and discord



NEW DELHI: Pope Francis and India shared a deep yet distant relationship of spiritual milestones, gestures of recognition of cardinals, and an unfulfilled dream—a papal visit that never came to pass.The visit that was most likely to be held this year- the Jubilee Year - could not materialize as the Pope passed away on Easter Monday at the age of 88.His departure attracted condolence from leaders across political ideologies with Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalling his meeting him. ""I fondly recall my meetings with him and was greatly inspired by his commitment to inclusive and all-round development. His affection for the people of India will always be cherished. May his soul find eternal peace in God’s embrace,"" he said.Despite his long-standing desire to visit India, Pope Francis never made the journey. Hopes were high that his visit would align with PM Modi’s trip to the Vatican, but the plan ultimately didn’t materialize. Still, his efforts to strengthen ties with India’s Catholic community never waned.Just months before his passing, Francis elevated Indian priest George Jacob Koovakad to the rank of Cardinal—a significant moment that underscored his recognition of the country’s vibrant Catholic presence. The 51-year-old from Kerala’s Archdiocese of Changanassery became the sixth Indian cardinal, appointed during a grand consistory at St Peter’s Basilica on December 7, 2024. Koovakad, a key Vatican figure responsible for coordinating the Pope’s international travels since 2020, also serves as the Prefect of the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue.PM Modi and senior church leaders welcomed the announcement with pride, with Union minister George Kurian leading a delegation to witness the historic ceremony in Rome.Pope Francis's tenure saw several landmark canonisations that brought joy to the Indian faithful. In 2014, he elevated Fr Kuriakose Elias Chavara and Sister Euphrasia Eluvathingal—both from Kerala—to sainthood. This was followed in 2019 by the canonisation of Mariam Thresia, another Kerala-born nun, adding to the growing list of Indian saints .Perhaps most notably, in 2022, Pope Francis canonised Devasahayam Pillai, an 18th-century Hindu convert to Christianity from Tamil Nadu. He became the first Indian layperson to be declared a saint, an event celebrated by both the Catholic Church and the wider Indian Christian community.However, Pope Francis’s papacy also faced challenges within the Indian Church, particularly surrounding the contentious issue of liturgical uniformity in the Syro-Malabar Church. A Vatican-endorsed directive—known as the ""50:50 formula""—required priests to face the altar for the bulk of the Holy Mass, diverging from the tradition in some dioceses of facing the congregation throughout.The directive sparked ongoing protests in the Ernakulam–Angamaly Archdiocese, with a strong section of priests and laity refusing to adopt the change. The dispute led to the resignation of Cardinal George Alencherry as the Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church in 2023. He was succeeded by Bishop Raphael Thattil, as the Church continued grappling with internal divisions.","Despite his long-standing desire to visit india, pope francis never made the journey.

No, it's not a concern. Yes, it is a significant concern.

NEW DELHI: Bharaitya Janata Party on Monday resurfaced a decades-old video of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi questioning judicial overreach , amid controversy over party MP Nishikant Dubey 's recent criticism of the Supreme Court and CJI Sanjiv Khanna. BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya posted a snippet from the interview on X, saying, ""Indira Gandhi — the Congress must know its own past"".In the video, Gandhi questions Justice Shah's competence to assess political dynamics and economic threats, arguing for the primacy of democratic institutions over judicial oversight.“How does Mr. Shah know what is happening in the political world? What are the forces at work which want to destroy a developing economy? Is a judge competent to decide that? Then why have democracy? Why have elections? Why have political people in power? How does Mr. Shah know what is happening in the political world? What are the forces at work which want to destroy a developing economy? Is a judge competent to decide that?” Indira Gandhi can be heard saying in the video.The footage dates back to Gandhi's response to the Shah Commission, established in 1977 to investigate Emergency-era excesses. The commission, led by Justice J.C. Shah, had criticised the centralisation of power under Gandhi’s rule and examined censorship, police violence, and forced sterilisation campaigns.Earlier this week, Nishikant Dubey lashed out at the judiciary, suggesting that if the Supreme Court continues to act like a legislative body, “Parliament should be shut down.” In an X post, Dubey wrote, “Kanoon yadi Supreme Court hi banayega to Sansad Bhavan bund kar dena chahiye."" The comments triggered criticism from opposition parties with the BJP distancing itself from the remark.Speaking to the media later, Dubey escalated his criticism, blaming the top court for “inciting religious wars” and “crossing constitutional boundaries.” He questioned recent Supreme Court directives, saying, “How can you give direction to the appointing authority? The President appoints the Chief Justice of India. You will dictate that Parliament? You want to take this country towards anarchy.”He also revisited the Court’s decriminalisation of homosexuality under Article 377, asserting that it contradicted the beliefs of major religions. “There are only two sexes in this world, male or female. Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh — all believe homosexuality is a crime,” Dubey said, claiming the Supreme Court had overturned a long-standing societal norm without parliamentary discussion.","Bharaitya janata party resurfaced a decades-old video of former prime minister indira gandhi questioning judicial overreach.

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday, while addressing members of the Indian diaspora in Boston, alleged that Election Commission is ""compromised"" and claimed there is ""something very wrong with the system.""Citing the example of the Maharashtra assembly elections , former Congress president said, ""More people voted in Maharashtra than the total number of people in Maharashtra, and this is a fact... the Election Commission gave us a figure in the evening around 5:30pm, and in two hours around 7:30pm, 65 lakh voters had voted, which is physically impossible.""""It's very clear to us that the Election Commission is compromised, there is something very wrong with the system."" he added.This is not the first time Gandhi threw allegation on EC. Gandhi, along with many other opposition leaders had questioned the credibility of poll body repeatedly.Earlier, the sources in the Election Commission had told ANI news agency that the allegations of manipulated electoral rolls were unfounded. They mentioned that during the recent Special Summary Revision (SSR) published in January 2025, there were very few appeals or corrections sought under Sections 22 to 24 of the Representation of People Act.The SSR is a routine process to update electoral rolls, ensuring the inclusion of new voters and removal of duplicates or deceased individuals. According to officials, only 89 appeals were filed in Maharashtra, despite the presence of over 13.8 million Booth Level Agents (BLAs) across the country. With such low contestation, sources said the final electoral rolls must be considered undisputed.During his speech, Rahul Gandhi also spoke about India-US relations , expressing optimism about continued cooperation between the two nations.""We have a partnership with the US, and hopefully we will continue to work together,"" he said.He also thanked members of the diaspora for supporting the Congress party abroad. ""You believe, you listen to other people, and you respect them. This is what runs in the Congress party and in our family....

PM Modi and JD Vance hail 'significant progress' in trade talks; PM says ready to host Trump this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-jd-vance-lay-roadmap-for-trade-talks-welcome-progress/articleshow/120497966.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi and US Vice President JD Vance welcomed “significant progress” in the ongoing negotiations for a mutually beneficial Bilateral Trade Deal (BTA) focused on the “welfare of the people of the 2 countries,” as the PM hosted Vance, second lady Usha Vance and their children who are on a 4-day visit to India. According to the US, they formally announced the finalisation of the Terms of Reference for the negotiations, laying down a roadmap for further discussions about shared economic priorities.Both sides backed an early conclusion of the agreement, which will allow India to stave off the threat from the Trump administration’s reciprocal tariffs , as Vance underscored the US pursuit of a fair and balanced trade relationship with India.“The BTA presents an opportunity to negotiate a new and modern trade agreement focused on promoting job creation and citizen well-being in both countries, with the goal of enhancing bilateral trade and supply-chain integration in a balanced and mutually beneficial manner. Guided by their respective visions of ‘ Amrit Kaal for India ’ and ‘ Golden Age for America ,’ BTA is expected to create new opportunities of growth for workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs in both countries,’’ said an American readout of the meeting.There was also talk about the Quad summit that India will host later this year and PM Modi said he was looking forward to hosting Trump for the meeting. However, while the US readout recalled the “positive and successful” meeting between PM Modi and Trump in February, it was silent on the proposed Trump visit to India.Vance and family, accompanied by senior US officials, landed in Delhi on Monday morning and were received at the airport by union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. The delegation left for Jaipur after the dinner meeting with PM Modi, which was described by the Vance delegation as pleasant and productive, in the evening.According to an Indian statement, PM Modi and Vance reviewed and positively assessed the progress in various areas of bilateral cooperation, while taking note of continued efforts towards enhancing cooperation in energy, defence, strategic technologies and other areas. The US is looking to ramp up its defence exports to India, hoping it will help bridge its trade deficit with India. Cooperation in critical and emerging technologies, and also small and advanced modular reactors, is also on top of the Indian agenda with the US.The two leaders also exchanged views on various regional and global issues of mutual interest and called for dialogue and diplomacy as the way forward, according to the Indian government. There was a discussion on the situation in both Ukraine and Gaza, with the PM reiterating India’s support for peace talks involving all stakeholders.PM Modi was said to have fondly recalled his visit to the US in February, within weeks of Trump’s return to the White House, and his “fruitful discussions with President Trump which laid down the roadmap for close cooperation between India and the US, leveraging the strengths of Make America Great Again (MAGA) and Viksit Bharat 2047”. The US side too recalled that during that meeting, the leaders had reaffirmed the strength of the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership and jointly launched the India-U.S. COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology) for the 21st Century, an initiative anchored in mutual trust, shared interests, goodwill, and robust engagement of their citizens.“Prime Minister extended his best wishes to the Vice President, Second Lady and their children for a pleasant and productive stay in India,’’ said the Indian government.",Pm narendra modi and us vice president jd vance welcomed “significant progress’ in the ongoing negotiations for a mutually beneficial bilateral trade deal.

Bureaucracy must be ‘active facilitator’ of growth not just ‘keeper of rule books’: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bureaucracy-must-be-active-facilitator-of-growth-not-just-keeper-of-rule-books-pm-modi/articleshow/120497133.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the global churn has thrown up opportunities for India and that it was the responsibility of bureaucracy that these don't go to waste.Addressing Civil Services Day celebrations, PM Modi said bureaucracy and policymaking cannot function on outdated frameworks in a rapidly changing world, and stressed that as the world is eager to invest in India, it is essential to take all necessary steps to ensure these opportunities are not missed.Bureaucracy must evolve into an “active facilitator” of growth rather than merely being the “keeper of rule books”, he added, urging bureaucrats to ensure comprehensive and inclusive development.“There was a time when the role of bureaucracy was primarily that of a regulator — one that controlled the pace of industrialisation and entrepreneurship. But the country has now moved far beyond that mindset. Today, we are creating an environment that promotes enterprise among citizens and helps them overcome every barrier. Therefore, the civil services must become an enabler — not merely the keeper of rule books but an active facilitator of growth,” PM Modi said.The remarks came against the backdrop of the anticipation that the volatility US President Donald Trump has injected into global trade may result in opportunities for India and, simultaneously, the apprehension that a well-entrenched mindset of bureaucracy might come in the way .On the crucial role of bureaucracy in achieving goals related to energy security, clean energy, sports, space and others, the PM said it has a great responsibility to ensure that there is no delay in achieving the goal of making India the world’s third-largest economy. “We must evaluate every sector: is our current speed sufficient to achieve the targets we’ve set? If not, we must accelerate. We must remember that we now have access to technologies that didn’t exist before — we must move forward with the power of technology,” he said.Referring to progress made in the past decade and the tasks ahead such as building more houses for the poor, tap water connection to every household, better waste management and free medical treatment up to Rs 5 lakh, PM Modi said now there is a need to fulfil new commitments for nutrition across the country. “Our single goal should be: 100% coverage, 100% impact. This very approach has helped bring 25 crore people out of poverty in the past 10 years. And, this same approach will lead to a poverty-free Bharat,” the PM said.He added that true progress doesn’t mean minor changes but full-scale impact. Clean water in every home, quality education for every child, financial access for every entrepreneur and digital economy benefits reaching every village, this is what holistic development truly means, the PM said. “I believe that quality in governance doesn’t come just by launching schemes. Rather, quality in governance is defined by how deeply a scheme reaches people and what real impact it creates,” PM Modi said.","Bureaucracy must evolve into an ‘active facilitator’ of growth, pm narendra modi says.

Harvard University announced on Monday it has filed a lawsuit to stop the administration of US President Donald Trump from blocking its federal funding of more than $2.2 billion.The funding freeze is ""unlawful"" and ""beyond the government's authority,"" the university said in a statement on its X handle.""Moments ago, we filed a lawsuit to halt the funding freeze because it is unlawful and beyond the government’s authority,"" the statement quoted Harvard University president Alan Garber as saying.Harvard University has filed its lawsuit in a Massachusetts federal court, and named several other universities targeted by the US president.""This case involves the government's efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decision making at Harvard. The government's actions flout not just the First Amendment, but also federal laws and regulations,"" according to the lawsuit.Earlier, Harvard president Garber said, ""No government, regardless of which party is in power, should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.""This was in response to the federal government's list of demands which Harvard would have to ""satisfy"" to continue receiving federal funds.Trump and his White House team have publicly justified their campaign against Harvard and other universities as a ""reaction"" to what they say is ""uncontrolled anti-Semitism"" on campuses, and the need to ""reverse"" diversity programmes aimed at addressing ""historical oppression of minorities.""The administration claims that anti-Israel protests, which swept across US college campuses last year, were ""rife with anti-Semitism.""Universities, including Harvard, had cracked down on the protests over the allegations at the time, with the Cambridge-based institute placing 23 students on probation and denying degrees to 12 others, according to protest organizers.Other institutions, including Columbia, have bowed to less far-ranging demands from the Trump administration, which claims that the educational elite is ""too left-wing.""",Harvard university has filed a lawsuit to stop the administration of us president donald trump from blocking its federal funding of more than $2.2 billion.

Justin Blackmon was arrested for public intoxication: A fallen star, another headline, and a fanbase still wishing for redemption

Fans react with shock, disbelief, and sadness as the viral mugshot reignites debate around wasted NFL potential

NFL fans woke up this weekend to a jarring throwback to a name many haven’t heard in years—Justin Blackmon, the former Oklahoma State sensation and No. 5 overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft. He wasn’t trending for a comeback or highlight reel. Instead, a new mugshot surfaced online following his arrest Saturday morning for public intoxication, and it immediately sent shockwaves through the football community.According to reports, Blackmon was arrested early Saturday morning in Payne County, Oklahoma, and charged with public intoxication. However, the publicly available information does not provide specific details about the circumstances leading to his arrest.Blackmon’s football story began with greatness. At Oklahoma State, he was a two-time Biletnikoff Award winner, known for his elite hands and aggressive play style. The Jacksonville Jaguars saw him as a franchise cornerstone and took him 5th overall in 2012.But after a solid rookie season, the problems quickly mounted. Blackmon faced multiple substance abuse suspensions, including a season-long ban in 2014. He never returned to the league.By 2015, he was arrested for DUI, and in 2016, he was sentenced to a year in jail though the sentence was suspended pending probation. Since then, he’s lived largely out of the spotlight… until now.The newly surfaced mugshot which spread rapidly on X (formerly Twitter) led to a wave of stunned reactions. Some fans said they didn’t even recognize him, while others remembered his talent and wondered how things could’ve gone so wrong.To add to the emotional weight of the news, Oklahoma State had reportedly planned to induct Blackmon into its Ring of Honor this year, according to fans and alumni. That moment, once seen as a redemption arc or a celebration of his college brilliance, now feels awkwardly timed amid his latest legal troubles.Also read - Fans go wild over Tom Brady’s throwback roast of Eli Manning only for the edit to roast him right back","Jacksonville jaguars wide receiver justin blackmon was arrested for public intoxication on saturday.

Soon after the desecration of a Gurdwara in Vancouver, British Columbia, the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey was defaced with pro-Khalistan graffiti , marking another alarming incident targeting religious institutions in Canada.Images shared online showed the temple walls sprayed with pro-Khalistan slogans, drawing widespread condemnation from community leaders and elected officials. Indian-origin Canadian Member of Parliament Chandra Arya strongly condemned the act, calling it “yet another chilling reminder of the growing influence of Khalistani extremism .”“The attacks on Hindu temples that began several years ago continue unabated today, this latest graffiti on the Hindu temple is yet another chilling reminder of the growing influence of Khalistani extremism,” Arya posted on social media platform X. “Well-organized, well-funded, and backed by significant political clout, Khalistani elements are brazenly asserting their dominance and successfully silencing Hindu voices across Canada.”The incident in Surrey followed the vandalism of the Ross Street Gurdwara, operated by the Khalsa Diwan Society in Vancouver, where walls were defaced with slogans like “Khalistan Zindabad” and graffiti containing the word “murdabad.” The slogans reportedly included threats aimed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Vancouver Police Department confirmed an investigation is underway.“This Khalistani extremists have targeted Khalsa Diwan Society (Ross Street Gurdwara) in Vancouver with pro-Khalistan graffiti and intimidation tactics,” Arya added. “In a statement issued after the desecration, KDS said that a small group of Sikh separatists, advocating for Khalistan, defaced our sacred walls with divisive slogans like ‘Khalistan Zindabad’.”The Khalsa Diwan Society condemned the act, calling it part of “an ongoing campaign by extremist forces that seek to instill fear and division within the Canadian Sikh community.”“We call on all Canadians, Sikhs, and people of goodwill to stand together in the face of this extremism,” the Society said. “We must denounce these acts and reaffirm our shared commitment to the values of peace, unity, and respect. This attack is an attack on all of us — on the very unity that makes Canada strong.”Calling for unity, Arya urged Hindu and Sikh communities in Canada to “rise with urgency and demand immediate, decisive action from authorities at all levels of government.”“Silence is no longer an option,” he said.Canada has seen a rise in religious vandalism in recent years. Earlier this year, the Sri Krishna Brundavana Temple in the Greater Toronto Area was targeted. In 2023, PM Modi had condemned the defacement of a temple in Brampton, saying, “I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve.
