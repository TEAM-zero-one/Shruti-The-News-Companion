US President Donald Trump 's senior trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday continued his rant and this time trained his guns at the member countries of Brics , calling them ""vampires"".Navarro claimed the member countries of Brics cannot survive without trading with the United States.""They’ve long hated each other—and none survive without selling to the United State."" he added.Trump's adviser raked up several examples where he tried to convince that the alliance is not working out.""The bottomline is that none of these countries can survive if they don't sell to the United States, and when they sell to the United States their exports, they're like vampires sucking our blood dry with their unfair trade practices. Let's see what happens. But I don't see how the BRICS stays together since historically they all hate each other and kill each other,"" he said.""Let's see how this is going to work out... Russia is getting into bed with China. China claims they own Vladivostok- the Russian port, and they're already through massive illegal immigration into Siberia, basically colonizing Siberia, which is the biggest landmass of the Russian semi-empire, so good luck with that, Putin, and then India, of course, is at war with China for decades.It was China that gave Pakistan a nuclear bomb. You got ships flying around the Indian Ocean now with Chinese flags. Modi, see how you kind of worked that out. Meanwhile, the Brazil economy is going down the tubes because of Lula's socialist policies- well, they keep the real leader of that country in a cell. Let's see what happens,"" he added.Earlier, Navarro had accused India of driving Moscow's war machine by importing discounted Russian crude.""FACTS: India highest tariffs costs US jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins,"" Navarro wrote in a late-night post.X users flagged Navarro's post with multiple community notes, correcting his assertions.The fact-checks stressed that India's Russian oil purchases are made for ""energy security"" and do not violate any international sanctions.This comes as US is in a tense trade and foreign policy standoff with India, following Washington's decision to impose punitive secondary tariffs on Indian exports for buying Russian oil.India has termed the tariffs imposed on it as “unjustified and unreasonable.”“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” India has said.","Peter navarro claimed the member countries of brics cannot survive without trading with the united states.

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports. The move covers offering exemptions covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to a Reuters report.Since assuming power in January, Trump has unleashed a global trade war, announcing reciprocal tariffs on most major countries around the world. After announcing high tariffs on most countries in April, the Trump administration later used these as tools to negotiate trade deals which it says are favourable to the US. While some trade deals have been announced, exact details of many are yet to emerge.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","Us president donald trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports.

NEW DELHI: A group of 25 senior legal luminaries on Monday strongly criticised joint opposition vice-presidential candidate B. Sudershan Reddy for meeting Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav , arguing that the engagement with a convicted politician casts doubts on his judgment and allegiances.Yadav had shared on X last week photographs of his meeting with Reddy, a former Supreme Court judge who has been nominated as the opposition’s candidate against the National Democratic Alliance ’s (NDA) nominee, CP Radhakrishnan, in the September 9 polls.“It is dismaying to note that B Sudarshan Reddy recently had a private meeting with Lalu Prasad Yadav who stands infamously convicted in the fodder scam case which involved the embezzlement of about Rs 940 crore of public funds from the state of Bihar,” the group said in a joint statement.“For someone of Reddy’s stature, a former Judge of the Supreme Court of India , and his ambition, which is to occupy one of the nation's highest constitutional offices, an engagement of such dubious nature raises serious questions about his judgment and propriety,” they added.The statement argued that Reddy’s decision to associate with convicted individuals who have “demonstrably harmed national interests through corruption, speaks volumes about his intentions and allegiances.”“This consultation cannot be justified by citing electoral considerations, as Yadav is neither a Member of Parliament nor is he eligible to vote in the Vice-Presidential electoral college,” the signatories said, stressing that the meeting “appears to serve no legitimate political purpose.”Among those endorsing the statement are senior advocates Pinky Anand, Sanjay Jain, Sonia Mathur and Anil Soni, as well as Motising Mohta, Milind Patil, Parijat Pande and Subhash Ghatge, former chairpersons and members of the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa.The group termed the meeting “worrying” and described it as “a fundamental error in judgment” by a candidate aspiring to hold one of the nation’s highest constitutional offices.Without naming anyone, they also criticised the silence of “certain factions” over Reddy’s actions.“What is equally telling is the silence of certain factions, who are usually up-in-arms at far lesser allegations. This incident only re-confirms the partisan nature of those who position themselves as self-proclaimed custodians of constitutional morality,” they said.Such silence, they added, reveals a willingness to ignore “serious lapses for self-serving interest and political convenience.”","B sudershan reddy met rashtriya janata dal (rjd) chief lalu prasad yadav.

The PM, a source said, gave the example of the need to pump air in a vehicle's tyres even if the wind is blowing in the right direction. In the same way, one has to work on the ground to take message forward despite a favourable atmosphere.Turning to the VP election, he asked MPs to ensure they vote correctly, noting that it does not send out a good message when parliamentarians make a mistake while voting.NDA VP candidate C P Radhakrishnan was present at the meeting.

NEW DELHI: The Taliban have backed high-level engagement with India, amid efforts by the Indian government to host Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi despite the travel ban imposed on him by the UNSC. India remains in touch with the Taliban for an early visit by Muttaqi.The Taliban head of political office and Afghan ambassador to Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, told TOI there’s a need for both countries to upgrade and strengthen their ties.“For that, high level visits of the foreign ministers’ level is a need. It will pave the way for exploring various fields of cooperation including trade between the two countries,” said Shaheen, who this week urged the UN to give Afghanistan’s seat to the Taliban-led Islamic Emirate.India is likely to approach the UNSC with a request to waive the travel ban on Muttaqi to allow him to visit the country, once the dates for the visit are finalised.The Afghan media had reported late last month that the visit was called off after the Security Council denied him waiver. However, it’s learnt that while dates were discussed for a visit by Muttaqi in August last week, these eventually didn’t work out.TOI had reported on August 28 that Muttaqi was likely to travel to India soon, for what would be the first such high-level visit from Afghanistan to India since the Taliban took control of Kabul in August, 2021.India’s ties with the Taliban have improved dramatically in the past few years with the Taliban fully appreciating India’s continued humanitarian assistance, consistent with its historical relations and friendship with the Afghan people. India sent more humanitarian aid to Afghanistan last week after the country was hit by a 6.0 magnitude earthquake.With Taliban not wavering in its security guarantees to India, including assurances that it won’t allow Pakistan-based terror groups to use Afghanistan for anti-India activities, India believes it’s now time to further expand its footprint in the country, despite remaining in consonance with the international community on the issue of recognition.India had already upgraded its engagement with the Taliban as foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Muttaqi in Dubai this year and external affairs Jaishankar spoke to him twice. The visit by Muttaqi will still be a landmark event, as it will signal India’s intention to take the development partnership, which includes over 500 projects spread across the country in critical sectors, to the next level.","India remains in touch with the taliban for an early visit by afghan foreign minister amir khan muttaqi.

Poll Do you think India-US relations will remain strong despite tariff tensions? Yes, the partnership is strong No, tensions may affect ties

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday hailed India-US relations after Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded to the compliments given by US President Donald Trump Amid the ongoing tussle over tariffs, Jaishankar said that PM Modi attaches ""enormous importance"" to the partnership between New Delhi and Washington.""PM Modi attaches enormous importance to our partnership with the US,"" Jaishankar said.""Where President Trump is concerned, he (PM Modi) has always had a very good personal equation with President Trump. But the point is that we remain engaged with the US, and at this time, I can't say more than that. But that's really what I would say,"" he added.This comes after Trump said that he will always be friends with the Prime Minister but added that he does not ""like what he is doing at this particular moment.""While talking to reporters at the Oval Office, Trump said that the Washington and New Delhi shares a ""very special relationship"" and adding that there is ""nothing to worry about"" in the ties between the two countries.""I always will. I'll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He's a great Prime Minister. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment. But India and the United States have a very special relationship,"" Trump said.""There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,"" he added.PM Modi responded by saying he “deeply appreciate and fully reciprocates” Trump’s sentiments.In a post on X, PM Modi wrote: “Deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump’s sentiments and positive assessment of our ties. India and the US have a very positive and forward-looking Comprehensive and Global Strategic Partnership.”The remarks by the two leaders came at a time of strained bilateral ties, following Washington’s move to impose a 50% tariff on India.Trump has imposed 25 per cent reciprocal tariffs on India and an additional 25 per cent for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.India has termed the tariffs imposed on it as “unjustified and unreasonable.”“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” India had said.","Pm modi responds to donald trump’s 'will always be friends' remark, says india-us ties remain strong.

""""I don't think we have anything to say sorry about at all. India has behaved with a great deal of maturity on all of this,"" Tharoor told ANI, noting that even past US administrations had ""encouraged"" New Delhi to buy Russian oil in order to ""stabilise global prices.""Tharoor's remarks came in response to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who claimed that ""India is going to be at the table, and they're gonna say they're sorry and eventually strike a deal with US President Donald Trump.""Countering Lutnick's claim, Tharoor pointed out that larger economies were more deeply tied to Moscow than India.""China buys more Russian oil and gas than we do. Turkey buys more Russian oil and gas than we do. Europe doesn't buy oil and gas, but they buy other Russian items, so they're putting more billions of dollars into Russia's kitty than we do. It seems bizarre that we are alone being singled out for allegedly financing the Russian war effort when others are doing far more than we are,"" he said.Calling it a ""mistake in American policy,"" the Thiruvananthapuram MP said such criticism of India was ""not warranted or justified.""""I think Mr Lutnick has to understand that we are a sovereign nation, just as they are. They can take their own sovereign decisions, we will take our own sovereign decisions,"" he added.Lutnick on Friday took a cue from Trump’s hardline tariff stance warning India to ""stop buying Russian oil, stop being a part of BRICS, and support the United States and the dollar or face a 50% tariff"" even likening India’s position to Canada’s retreat after economic pressure.""In a month or two months, I think India is going to be at the table, and they're gonna say they're sorry, and they're going to try to make a deal with Donald Trump and it will be on Donald Trump's desk how he wants to deal with Modi, and we leave that to him. That's why he's the president,"" Lutnick said.He also labelled India as ""the vowel between Russia and China"" in BRICS, saying, ""If that's who you want to be, go, be it... ....and let's see how long this lasts.""Lutnick's remarks came after Trump himself softened his tone on his social media post, calling India-US ties ""very special"" and affirming his friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after the SCO summit in Tianjin.Trump said, ""I always will. I'll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He's a great Prime Minister. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment.""""But India and the United States have a very special relationship. There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,"" he added.Following Trump’s statement, PM Modi responded warmly on Saturday, saying he ""deeply appreciates and fully reciprocates President Trump's sentiments and positive assessment of our ties.""Tharoor also urged caution over PM Modi’s warm response to Trump’s remarks on India-US ties saying, ""The Prime Minister was very quick to respond, and the foreign minister has also underscored the importance of the basic relationship that is a comprehensive global strategic partnership, which is still there. And that message is an important message for us to give. I don't think we can just completely forget either the 50% tariffs or the insults that have accompanied it from both the President and his staff. ""The Congress MP further warned that Trump's ""mercurial temperament"" and the ""real consequences"" of punitive tariffs demanded caution.""One can't just forget and forgive so quickly because there are real consequences that Indians are facing on the ground and those consequences need to be overcome,"" he added.","Congress mp shashi tharoor said that india has ""nothing to say sorry about"" as it has acted with ""a great deal of maturity"" while criticising the us for unfairly singling out new delhi and pointing out that ""europe is putting more billions of dollars into russia's kitty than we do""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123749861,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39250,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Tom Brady seeks peace amid emotional challenges of divorce

Tom Brady remains focused on fatherhood and personal growth

Tom Brady’s decision to sell his $150 million Miami mansion marked a major step in his life after parting ways with supermodel Gisele Bündchen.

The two finalized their divorce in 2022 after a 13-year marriage, and while they maintained a respectful co-parenting relationship, the proximity of their homes complicated his ability to move forward emotionally.""Every time he looks out across the water,"" an insider told RadarOnline, ""he sees Gisele's refurbished home and perfect life with her martial arts hunk and their new baby, and it gets him down.""This emotional struggle appears to have driven Brady’s decision to downsize and relocate. His goal was clear: to establish a more private space where he could focus on fatherhood and his professional life as a Fox Sports analyst. The move wasn’t about leaving Miami altogether but about distancing himself from painful memories embedded in the lavish mansion’s walls.Brady’s public image remains composed, but those close to him say he has been privately struggling.He continues to co-parent three children – Benjamin and Vivian with Bündchen, and Jack with actress Bridget Moynahan.His focus on fatherhood is unwavering, and amid this personal transition, he posted a cryptic yet poignant quote on Instagram: ""I really think the secret to being loved is to love.

NHL Trade Rumors: Boston Bruins exploring bold Mason McTavish trade to transform their center ice depth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-boston-bruins-exploring-bold-mason-mctavish-trade-to-transform-their-center-ice-depth/articleshow/123765285.cms,"Mason McTavish (Amy Irvin / The Hockey Writers)

Why Mason McTavish could be the perfect fit for the Bruins



What the Bruins might have to give up and the potential payoff

As the Boston Bruins look to bounce back from a lackluster 2024–25 season, bold trade strategies are gaining attention among hockey insiders. Connor Ryan of the Boston Globe suggests the Bruins should pursue Anaheim Ducks center Mason McTavish to strengthen their roster and boost their playoff chances next season.Mason McTavish, the third overall pick in the 2021 NHL Draft, had a strong showing last year with 22 goals and 30 assists. At just 22 years old, McTavish offers a blend of youth, skill, and untapped potential, making him a highly valuable asset.Boston’s current center depth has raised questions about its ability to support a deep playoff run, especially with rising star James Hagens already carrying significant responsibility. Ryan emphasizes, “If the Bruins want to build a new core alongside the usual suspects, they’re going to need to form a 1-2 punch with Hagens.”Pairing McTavish with Hagens could unlock a dynamic duo capable of dominating both ends of the ice. Their complementary styles—McTavish’s offensive creativity and Hagens’ two-way play—would offer the Bruins a significant upgrade at center ice.Landing McTavish won’t come cheap. Reports indicate Boston may have to part with multiple first-round picks, along with high-potential prospects like Fraser Minten or Matthew Poitras, and possibly other young NHL players.Furthermore, McTavish’s expected salary demand of $7–8 million annually could strain the Bruins’ cap space.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Could trading Brandon Carlo be the Maple Leafs’ only path to a top-six forward? Despite the risk, the potential reward is substantial. Adding McTavish could speed up Boston’s rebuild and position them as serious contenders in the Eastern Conference. The real question remains: how aggressive are the Bruins’ management and ownership willing to be to gamble on McTavish’s future star power? The coming weeks will be crucial as the NHL trade market heats up.","Mason mctavish, the third overall pick in the 2021 nhl draft, had a strong showing last year with 22 goals and 30 assists.
