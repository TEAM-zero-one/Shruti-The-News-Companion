India-China air travel resumes after 5 years: IndiGo operates Kolkata-Guangzhou flight; first since 2020,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kolkata-calling-guangzhou-after-5-yrs-1st-direct-flight-to-china/articleshow/124834796.cms,"Kolkata-Guangzhou IndiGo flight

KOLKATA: Monica Liu lives and breathes Beijing, the 'Tangra-style' Chinese restaurant that is the beating heart of weekends in Kolkata's Chinatown. But on Sunday night, Guangzhou was on her mind. For the first time in five years, she was on a direct flight from the city she calls home to the country of her ancestors.Liu was among the first of 176 passengers to board IndiGo's resurrected Kolkata-Guangzhou flight that bridged the gap in direct air connectivity between India and China, triggered by Covid pandemic and extended by the diplomatic frost following border clashes in 2020.For someone who once travelled frequently between the two countries to visit relatives, the wait felt longer than five years for Liu. ""I am flying to meet some of my relatives back in China. I was a frequent flyer between Kolkata and China prior to Covid. Now that direct connectivity is back, I wish to resume regular travel,"" she said.The Airbus A320 Neo departed at 10pm, just over a fortnight ahead of IndiGo starting its Delhi-Guangzhou service on Nov 10. China Eastern Airlines is scheduled to resume its Shanghai-Delhi flight a day earlier.More than 40 weekly flights once linked Indian metros with Shanghai, Guangzhou and Kunming.All were suspended in 2020. Union govt's decision to reopen tourist visas for Chinese nationals paved the way for flights to resume, with Delhi and Beijing agreeing in principle to restore air services during foreign secretary Vikram Misri's trip in Jan.PM Narendra Modi's visit to China in late-Aug, his first in seven years, saw him and Chinese President Xi Jinping stress that the two countries should be seen as partners in development rather than competitors.For Arjun Gupta, a New Town businessman running a restaurant and electronics unit in China, resumption of direct flights translates into saving time and money. ""Past five years, we were forced to take a detour via Delhi and Bangkok to reach China. It was not only tiring but also extremely costly. I had to limit my travels. This direct flight takes only three-and-a-half hours and is also considerably cheaper.""Pinal Gandhi flew in from Ahmedabad just to catch the inaugural flight. ""This is the best thing that could have happened to my business in recent weeks. I have to travel frequently to China because of a business expansion.""IndiGo chief executive Pieter Elbers said, ""This will once again allow seamless movement of people, goods and ideas, while also strengthening bilateral ties between two of the world's most populous countries and fast-growing economies. With this very important step, we are looking at introducing more direct flights to China.""Kolkata airport director Pravat Ranjan Beuria and many senior IndiGo officials attended a ceremony before departure, where Liu lit a ceremonial lamp.","Kolkata-guangzhou indigo flight was first direct flight between india and china in five years.

’Naxal-Maoist Terror Nearly Wiped Out Across India’: PM Modi Hails Police, CRPF, BSF

NEW DELHI: Rejecting the CPI(Maoist) central committee's (CC) ""traitor"" tag thrown at him and fellow Naxal leader Bhupathi alias 'Sonu' in view of their recent surrender, CC member Rupesh has said they laid down arms in line with slain general secretary Basavaraj 's final call to 'partymen' to cease armed operations against security forces and explore talks with Centre.In a video statement shared with TOI, Rupesh, currently in Chhattisgarh, can be heard rejecting CPI(Maoist)'s latest claim that Basavaraju had a rethink on his stance favouring a ceasefire ""to save the party, cadre and movement"" - communicated in multiple statements since March 2025 - after Centre had refrained from toning down anti-Naxal operations in 'core' areas of the Maoists.""It is true that till B R Dada (Basavaraj) was killed in May, he maintained the view that conditions are ideal for abandoning armed struggle and starting talks with govt about our future,"" Rupesh said, adding that every PB/CC member had received this message. ""I had personally met Dev ji (current CPI Maoist general secretary) and another CC member after that,"" he said but added that Dev ji was not in favour of ceasefire and talks.""Why is it that when a meeting of Dandakaranya Special Zonal committee was held recently in south Bastar, the surrender plan of north sub-zonal bureau, though known to the leaders, was never brought up? Why is it that Basavaraj's final letter to PB/CC members has not been shown to the cadres?"" Rupesh asked.This, a Chhattisgarh police officer indicated, suggests that Devji and CC members Sangram and Hidma, along with senior cadres Barse Deve and Pappa Rao, have failed to communicate to the lower ranks the collective decision of the CPI(Maoist) - taken under Basavaraj - to end armed struggle. Rupesh said the letter sent to him by Basavaraj, was shared by him and deliberated upon by cadres of north sub-zonal bureau of DKSZC, who passed it down to divisional committee and area committee members.","A total of 21 maoist cadres, including 13 women, surrendered with 18 weapons, in north bastar kanker on sunday.

What did Salman say?



NEW DELHI: Bollywood actor Salman Khan has been labelled a ""terrorist"" by the Pakistani government after his recent remarks at the Joy Forum 2025 in Riyadh, where he mentioned Balochistan and Pakistan separately while speaking about the global reach of Indian cinema As per multiple media reports, the Pakistani government has placed Salman under the 4th Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act (1997), a list usually reserved for people suspected of having links to terrorism.A notification widely shared on social media reportedly issued by the home department of the government of Balochistan on October 16, 2025stated that Salman Khan was placed on the watchlist and the reason mentioned is that Salman is an 'Azad Balochistan Facilitator'.At the Riyadh event, attended by Salman, Shah Rukh Khan, and Aamir Khan, he said: ""Right now, if you make a Hindi film and release it here, it will be a superhit.

Seats less reclining: Boeing 787 pilots want duty time cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/less-reclining-cockpit-seats-indian-pilots-urge-dgca-to-reduce-duty-time-for-boeing-787-planes/articleshow/124830730.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian pilots have expressed a fresh concern over the Boeing 787 Dreamliners — extended flight duty time limitation (FDTL) for them despite the aircraft’s less reclining cockpit seats that make controlled rest less effective for them.The Airlines Pilots’ Association of India has urged the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to rollback the extension given to the “already stretched” flight duty time limit (FDTL) for Boeing 787 two-man flight crew operations from 10 hours (flying time) to 10.5 hours and 13 hours of flight duty period (FDP) to 14 hours.ALPA-India has told the regulator this is a “matter of grave operational and safety concern.” The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has mandated restriction on the pilots’ seat recline function on this aircraft.The FAA “airworthiness directives (AD)” for the B787s issued late last year says: “…the fight deck door decompression panel can strike the captain’s seat headrest if a fight deck or below the fight deck rapid decompression event occurs when the seat is in a certain position…. (This order is) to address the possibility that the decompression panel could strike the captain's head or face.The unsafe condition, if not addressed, could result in serious or potentially fatal injury to the captain after a fight deck or below the fight deck rapid decompression event. ”In India, Air India operates Boeing 787s using its own planes and crew members. IndiGo also uses this planes but they are wet leased, meaning hired with pilots, from a foreign airline. So the Indian DGCA FDTL rules for Dreamliner pilots affect only Air India as of now.Multiple senior Indian pilots of this type said: “If any airline is serious about B787 safety from pilot fatigue perspective given the less cockpit seat recline on this plane that makes controlled rest for them left effective, it should reduce FDTL for its B787 pilots. However the opposite has happened and the flying time has been been extended.They strongly feel that until the corrective seat modification is implemented and the FAA AD is superseded with full recline the fight time should be limited to 8 hours or have augmented crew. ""ALPA-India president Captain Sam Thomas has written to DGCA on Sunday: “This regulatory decision appears not only unjustified but also dangerously inconsistent with global safety practices. Extending duty hours instead of mandating an augmented crew, particularly so soon after a recent fatal accident, raises serious questions about the prioritisation of flight safety over operational costs and convenience. Operating long routes with restricted rest capability, compounded by adverse weather and night operations, creates a scenario ripe for fatigue induced errors. These are not theoretical risks ,fatigue remains a well-documented factor in numerous aviation incidents worldwide.”The association has urged the regulator to “immediately withdraw the FDTL extension for two-pilot 787 operations. Mandate augmented crew (3-man operations) for all flights exceeding 8 hours or operating through the window of circadian low (2 am to 6 am). Undertake a comprehensive fatigue risk assessment in consultation with flight crew representatives before approving any further deviation from established limits. ”“This issue strikes at the heart of flight safety. The recent regulatory action, if left unaddressed, exposes not only the operating crew but also passengers and the travelling public to unnecessary and preventable risk,” Captain Thomas added.","The airlines pilots’ association of india has urged the directorate general of civil aviation to rollback the extension. The faa has mandated restriction on the pilots’ seat recline function on this aircraft. In india, air india operates boeing 787s using its own planes and crew members.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124830811,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-445450,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"Ties with Pakistan not at India's expense, says Marco Rubio -- even though it is",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ties-with-pakistan-not-at-indias-expense-says-marco-rubio-even-though-it-is-us-trump/articleshow/124829884.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

‘Indians Are Very Mature…’: US State Secy Marco Rubio’s Big Remark On US-Pakistan Ties

Revitalized US ties with Islamabad will not be at the expense of Washington’s “deep, historic, and important” ties with India, US secretary of state Marco Rubio has said amid what he saw as disquiet in New Delhi about the Trump White House’s pivot towards the military regime in Pakistan.In a chat with pool reporters on his way to the Asean meeting in Malaysia via Doha, Rubio said New Delhi had not directly communicated any unease to the US on the matter “but we know they’re concerned for obvious reasons because of the tensions that have existed between Pakistan and India historically” and “Indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature.”“Look, they have some relationships with countries that we don’t have relationships with. So, it’s part of a mature, pragmatic foreign policy. I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India,” Rubio said, adding that New Delhi has to understand the US will have relations with a lot of different countries, and it currently sees an opportunity to expand its strategic relationship with Pakistan.Rubio’s remarks come at a time US-India relations, long considered a cornerstone of Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy, is under pressure given the trade and tariff tensions with New Delhi and the slack US has cut for China and Pakistan -- at India's expense.Pakistan currently has a 19 per cent tariff on its exports to the US compared to India's 50 percent.When pressed on whether India might need to reduce its reliance on Russian oil to secure a broader trade deal with the US, Rubio noted that India has already expressed interest in diversifying its oil portfolio.“The more they buy from us, the less they’ll buy from someone else,” he said, suggesting that increased US oil exports could displace India’s purchases from other suppliers, such as Russia. Yet, he avoided committing to specifics on trade negotiations, stating, “I’m not negotiating trade deals, so I’m not going to speak on that.”While Rubio appeared to be echoing the traditionalist State Department outlook that continues to hew to Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy, the Trump White House seems less enthused about it in recent weeks as the US president seeks to engage China, having realized Beijing holds many cards – from its stranglehold on rare earth elements to buying American agricultural produce.He is also transparently in thrall of Pakistan following reports of its pledge to supply rare earths minerals and its interest in crypto business run by family associates, with unvarnished admiration for the country de-facto military ruler, field marshal Asim Munir.Rubio is expected meet his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in Malaysia to continue the ministerial level dialogue since Prime Minister Modi chose to skip the meet, forgoing a meeting with Trump amid apparent misgivings over his grandstanding, with claims of having “solved” the India-Pakistan war – a four day clash that ended when the Pakistani director general of military ops phoned is Indian counterpart to seek a ceasefire.The state department and the national security council, both now run by Rubio – a former Senator who was once derided as “Little Marco” by Trump when he ran for GOP nomination – has had to finesse its position in line with White House priorities even as a trade agreement with India remains in limbo. According to officials who are clued into the talks, an agreement is almost ready, but it needs to be signed off by the President, and “no one has any idea if it will satisfy him. ”","Rubio says new delhi has not directly communicated any unease to the us on the matter. “indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature,” he said. Rubio is expected meet his indian counterpart s jaishankar in malaysia to continue the ministerial level dialogue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124829862,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-null,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"Collegium preserves judiciary’s autonomy, say CJI B R Gavai, Justice Kant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collegium-preserves-judiciarys-autonomy-say-cji-b-r-gavai-justice-kant/articleshow/124772986.cms,"NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, on Thursday stoutly defended the much-criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges and said it has helped the judiciary preserve its autonomy and independence in administration of justice.CJI Gavai was speaking at Royal Institute of Management in Thimphu, Bhutan, while Justice Kant was addressing Sri Lankan Supreme Court in Colombo. The CJI cited SC’s 2015 judgment striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission and said granting primary control over judicial appointments to the executive would imperil the independence and autonomy of the judiciary.Justice Kant said the judiciary’s dominant role in appointment of judges to HCs and SC is a compelling “illustration of the doctrine of separation of powers”. The judiciary’s independence and autonomy help it to go beyond simple resolution of disputes or defending constitutional boundaries; it has allowed constitutional courts actively “shape the democratic imagination of a society and to function as architects of democratic life”, he held.Justice Kant said that if separation of powers is the framework of India’s constitutional democracy, then judicial review — Article 32 (a person can approach SC directly over violation of fundamental rights) and Article 226 (a person can file a writ petition in an HC) — is the sustaining force of democracy.The ambit of judicial review extends to constitutional functionaries like EC, Lok Sabha speaker and governors, as well as legislative assemblies. “No act of governance is beyond the purview of judicial oversight,” he stressed.“This expansive power of review is a cornerstone of India’s constitutional democracy and a part of our basic structure, affirming that legality and constitutionality are fundamental preconditions to the exercise of public power,” Justice Kant said.In what reflects the judiciary’s transformative potential to give voice to the voiceless, Justice Kant said, judicial interpretation has resulted in expanding the scope of fundamental rights, leading to legislative action.CJI Gavai said that apart from the broad and purposive interpretation of Article 21 (right to life), SC has consistently held the state accountable for safeguarding and promoting the rights of citizens, compelling govts to translate constitutional guarantees into tangible actions.Public interest litigation (PIL) has evolved as an instrument for protecting human rights and the rights of marginalised and vulnerable communities like bonded labour, undertrial prisoners, migrant workers, manual scavengers, sex workers and pavement dwellers. SC has also brought in electoral reforms by acting on PILs, the CJI said.Justice Kant disagreed with criticism that judicial activism often results in encroachment of the turfs of legislature and executive, and said, “When courts act to empower the powerless, grounded in constitutional text and moral clarity, they do not usurp democracy, they deepen it.”Both the CJI and Justice Kant referred to SC’s landmark 13-judge judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973 that established the doctrine of ‘basic structure of the Constitution’. “That judgment transformed the judiciary from a mere interpreter of the Constitution into its guardian,” Justice Kant said.","Cji b r gavai and justice surya kant, the next cji, stoutly defended the much-criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges.

"PM Modi to attend Asean summit virtually, Congress takes a swipe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-attend-asean-summit-virtually-congress-takes-a-swipe/articleshow/124772222.cms,"PM Modi Confirmed to Give ASEAN Summit a Miss, Avoids Trump Again: Here’s The Real Reason Why

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi spoke to his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim and conveyed that he will virtually attend India-Asean summit Sunday, scotching speculation of a meeting with US President Donald Trump on the margins of Asean and East Asia summits in Kuala Lumpur.The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections but it also spares him the discomfiture of running into the mercurial president in the middle of a US-India trade deadlock and growing differences over Pakistan-related issues.According to Ibrahim, Modi told him he would attend virtually “given Deepavali festival was still being celebrated in India at that time”. “I respect the decision and extend my Deepavali greetings to him and all the people of India,” said Ibrahim on X. In his own post on the same platform, Modi congratulated Ibrahim on Malaysia’s Asean chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits.“Look forward to deepening of Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Modi. MEA later said in a statement that foreign minister S Jaishankar will represent Modi at East Asia Summit on Oct 27.In their conversation late on Wednesday, Ibrahim said India remains an important partner of Malaysia in trade and investment, technology, education and regional security sectors.Meanwhile, Congress on Thursday said the PM decided against visiting Malaysia to avoid “being cornered by Trump” and asked if this was the reason Modi did not travel to Egypt for Gaza peace summit helmed by Trump a few days back.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said Modi posting messages in praise of Trump on social media is one thing but to be seen hobnobbing in person with a man who has “claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and has claimed five times that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia” is another matter which “is far too risky for him”.",The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by modi might be preoccupation with bihar assembly elections.

GBMES will provide round-the-clock electronic intelligence of enemy emitters. HMVs, in turn, will significantly improve logistical support in diverse geographical terrains,” the official said.Apart from LPDs, the Navy will also get 30mm surface guns at a cost of Rs 1,200 crore for low-intensity maritime operations and anti-piracy roles; advanced light-weight torpedoes for anti-submarine warfare; electro-optical infra-red search and track systems; and smart ammunition for 76mm super rapid gun mounts on warships.","The biggest project to get the “acceptance of necessity’ (aon) was for the construction of four large amphibious warfare ships or “landing platform docks (lpds) another mega project to be cleared was the acquisition of a large number of surface-to-air missiles for the s-400 triumf air defence systems for over rs 10,000 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124770554,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-717429,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Nick Mangold, the beloved center for the New York Jets, has passed away at 41 from complications related to chronic kidney disease. His death comes just days after he shared publicly that he was on dialysis and searching for a kidney donor. Mangold spent his entire 11-year NFL career with the Jets and was known for his toughness, leadership, and consistency on the field.Nick Mangold spent 11 years as a cornerstone of the New York Jets’ offensive line and earned well for his efforts. In 2010, he signed a seven-year contract extension worth $55 million, making him the highest-paid center in the NFL at the time. The deal included $22 million guaranteed, plus $22.5 million in injury protection, showing just how much the team relied on him. By 2025, his net worth was estimated at about $5.42 million. This includes his NFL salaries, bonuses, and other earnings. While exact numbers can vary, it’s clear that Mangold achieved both football success and financial stability over his career.Mangold was picked in the first round out of Ohio State in 2006 and quickly became the Jets’ starting center. Over his 11-year career, he started 164 of 176 games and barely missed any in his first 10 seasons – an impressive feat for an offensive lineman.He made seven Pro Bowls, was named first-team All-Pro twice, and played a big part in the Jets’ playoff runs in 2009 and 2010. He teamed up with left tackle D’Brickashaw Ferguson to form the famous “Nick & Brick” duo. Together, they anchored the offensive line and helped guide rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez during those playoff seasons.Jets owner Woody Johnson said, “Nick was more than a legendary center. He was the heartbeat of our offensive line for a decade and a beloved teammate whose leadership and toughness defined an era of Jets football. Off the field, Nick's wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family.”After retiring in 2017, Mangold stayed involved in football by coaching at Delbarton High School in New Jersey. “You get to mold boys into men and teach the game of football — but also teach them a little bit about life as you go along,” he said in a 2024 interview. In October 2025, he shared that he had been living with a rare genetic kidney disorder since 2006. He was on dialysis and urgently looking for a kidney donor, since no one in his family had a matching blood type. Sadly, a donor was not found in time. Mangold was inducted into the Jets Ring of Honor in 2022 and was also considered for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His influence went far beyond the field, leaving a lasting mark on the team and fans alike.He is survived by his wife, Jenny, and their four children – Matthew, Eloise, Thomas, and Charlotte.","Nick mangold spent 11 years as a cornerstone of the new york jets’ offensive line.

Entered the US illegally but has work authorization, REAL ID



K restriction



Driving under the influence







Sikh driver Jashanpreet Singh, the 21-year-old driver, accused of the crash that killed three people in California, pleaded not guilty to all the charges brought against him -- as a major controversy broke out over Indian truck drivers endangering lives in America. Singh pleaded not guilty to three counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and one count of driving under the influence of a drug. He was appointed a public defender and remained in jail without bail. His next court appearance has been scheduled for November 4, when he will require a Punjabi interpreter.The requirement of a Punjabi interpreter proved that Singh does not know enough English, yet got a driving license for which English knowledge is mandatory.The Department of Homeland Security said Jashanpreet entered the US illegally from India in 2022 during the Biden administration. He has Employment Authorization Documents valid up to 2030 and a commercial driver's license to operate a semitruck. Singh's license is a federal REAL ID, which he was entitled to receive as the federal government gave him a legal status.While California blamed the Trump administration for extending Singh's work authorization, the Trump administration claimed that California violated federal law by allowing Singh to continue driving when he should have been disqualified.In June this year, California issued Singh -- who is an asylum seeker -- a restricted, non-domiciled CDL with a ""K"" restriction, limiting driving to in-state. K restriction is meant for those below 21 years. In September, the federal government paused all issuances of non-domiciled CDLs. In October, Singh turned 21, and his ""K"" restriction was removed. DOT officials say, if California had followed the new rule, Singh's license would have been denied because of his status as an asylum seeker.While Singh pleaded not guilty, his family in India claimed that he is a baptized Sikh and never does drugs. But the toxicology report claimed that he was driving under the influence and could not press the brak,e causing the mishap.",Court documents reveal jashanpreet singh would require a punjabi translator for his next court apperance.

Justin Trudeau dating Katy Perry: Where is his ex-wife Sophie?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/justin-trudeau-dating-katy-perry-where-is-his-ex-wife-sophie/articleshow/124821950.cms,"Katy Perry Confirms Justin Trudeau Romance? ‘48 Hours Ago’ Comment Stuns Fans

The Life After “Sunny Ways”





The Rise of Roar and Order





The Sophie Question





The Optics of Affection





The Liberal Love Arc









There’s an old rule in politics: you can lose an election, but never lose the plot. Justin Trudeau , the man who once embodied Canada’s moral optimism and salon-ready hair, seems to have followed that advice with evangelical zeal. While Canada debates the price of maple syrup and the future of liberalism, the former prime minister is busy trending for something far more cinematic—his rumoured romance with Katy Perry Yes, that Katy Perry, the pop deity who once sang “I Kissed a Girl” and made an entire generation of millennials question their playlists and sexuality. In a twist that sounds like it was storyboarded by Netflix’s marketing team, she’s apparently been welcomed into the Trudeau household with open arms. His kids, the tabloids coo, are “smitten.” The insiders murmur that Justin is “serious.” The headlines scream “wedding bells. ”But before we cue the fireworks and champagne, there’s an obvious ghost at this glossy banquet: Sophie Grégoire Trudeau.Sophie Grégoire wasn’t just Justin’s partner in photo-ops; she was his emotional translator, the one who made the Trudeau brand human. A former TV presenter with a yoga-teacher calm and a charisma that could sell both self-care and social reform, she stood beside him through the selfie years, the scandals, and the slow-motion implosion of Canada’s liberal fairy tale.When they announced their separation in August 2023, the statement was painfully Canadian in its politeness: “After many meaningful and difficult conversations, we have made the decision to separate.” No vitriol, no tell-all memoir, no courtroom drama—just the quiet unravelling of a modern marriage conducted under fluorescent political light.Since then, Sophie has retreated from the paparazzi and leaned into purpose. She published a wellness-themed book, Closer Together, in 2024, half memoir and half meditation on mindfulness, and became a sought-after speaker on empathy and mental health. In short, while Justin’s life turned into an internet soap opera, Sophie quietly reinvented herself as the kind of grounded, post-marital heroine Oprah would applaud.Her most recent social media post captures that evolution perfectly. “Real love isn’t about carrying it all. It’s about learning when to give, when to receive, and when to simply be,” she wrote, in a caption that reads more like a closing chapter than a cryptic comment. “Reciprocity means allowing space for both people to grow, to rest, to rediscover themselves within the relationship. Because love that breathes is love that lasts. ” It’s the sort of message that could only come from someone who has made peace with both endings and beginnings.Meanwhile, Justin’s post-political evolution has been less meditative and more MTV Unplugged. Enter Katy Perry: global superstar, part-time activist, and full-time headline magnet. The two were reportedly first seen together in Montreal this summer, later photographed on a California yacht, laughing, cuddling, and giving the internet enough serotonin to last three news cycles.“Justin loves how easily Katy fits in with the family,” said one insider, presumably between spin classes. “His kids adore her.” Another claimed he’s “serious about building something lasting.” The narrative practically writes itself: the widowed prince of progressivism finds solace in the queen of empowerment pop.It’s hard to ignore the political irony. Trudeau, once roasted for being too performative, has now become the star of his own romantic reboot. The man who apologised for blackface, bad pipelines, and budget overruns is finally living in technicolour, and the world can’t look away.So, what did happen to Sophie? The answer, it turns out, is refreshingly normal. She’s thriving—privately. Her social media remains measured and warm, filled with reflections on love, self-worth, and balance. Friends describe her as “at peace.” There’s no bitterness, no back-channel sniping, no quiet PR war.In a culture that monetises every breakup, Sophie’s restraint feels almost radical. She isn’t auditioning for relevance or competing with Perry’s glitter. She’s doing what many political spouses dream of but rarely achieve: reclaiming her narrative.Her latest Instagram post, now viral for its understated grace, seems to say it all: love isn’t ownership; it’s space. A philosophy that, in retrospect, might be the most sophisticated response to her ex-husband’s new chapter.Still, the Perry-Trudeau affair raises a few questions. Not moral ones, but cinematic ones. How does a former world leader date a pop star without turning it into a trailer? What happens when diplomacy meets choreography? Does she serenade him with “Unconditionally” before bedtime? Does he counter with an apology drafted in both English and French?It’s hard not to see the symbolism. Trudeau’s political brand was always part rock concert, part sermon. Perry’s music, too, thrives on idealism and spectacle. Together, they’re a duet of self-reinvention, two brands trying to age gracefully in a world that devours sincerity.And yet, there’s something deeply human here. Two middle-aged public figures, both famous for their performance of authenticity, may have finally stumbled onto the real thing. Perry, who has weathered the exhaustion of pop fame and the chaos of past relationships, reportedly finds Trudeau “grounding.” He, in turn, finds her “vital.”Maybe that’s all it is: two people meeting at the intersection of burnout and belief, trying to write a new story away from the noise.As for Sophie Grégoire, she’s no longer part of that story, but she’s certainly no footnote. If anything, she’s proof that grace after heartbreak is the rarest form of charisma.So what happened to Trudeau’s ex-wife?She moved on—quietly, intelligently, and without hashtags.And that, in the age of yacht selfies and engagement rumours, might just be the most Canadian ending of all.","Sophie grégoire trudeau and justin trudeau announced their separation in august 2023.

World’s 9 weakest passports in 2025: Countries with the least travel freedom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/destinations/worlds-9-weakest-passports-in-2025-countries-with-the-least-travel-freedom/articleshow/124721967.cms,"Afghanistan (Rank 104, Score 25)

A passport is an important travel document for those who wish to explore other countries. It allows people international travel freedom. But the ranking of passports also matters. If a country’s passport is strong, the residents can often travel visa free or visa-on-arrival facilities to several nations. But when a country’s passport is weak, it only creates issues in obtaining a visa and also lacks several other powers that come along with strong passports.The rankings are reflection of much deeper and larger issues including political instability, limited diplomatic influence and international relations. These are prime reasons restricting travel freedom for citizens of the affected countries.According to the latest (2025) Henley Passport Index ranking, the passport of Afghanistan is the weakest and grants visa-free access to only 25 countries. On this note, let’s have a look at 9 weakest passports in the world.Afghanistan holds the 104th position on the global passport index, making it the least powerful passport worldwide.Afghan nationals can enter only 25 countries without a visa. This restricted travel freedom stems primarily from ongoing conflict, political instability, and limited diplomatic influence. For the majority of international destinations, Afghan travelers face lengthy and often uncertain visa application procedures, significantly limiting their global mobility.Syria ranks second on the list, largely due to prolonged civil conflict and political instability. Only a handful of countries allow Syrians visa-free or visa-on-arrival entry, while most impose strict entry requirements. Security concerns remain the primary reason behind such limited travel access for Syrian passport holders.Iraq’s passport also offers limited visa-free access. It is because of political instability, security issues, and the country’s changing diplomatic relationships. Iraqi passport holders commonly need to apply for visas in advance.Pakistan’s passport ranks low primarily due to ongoing political instability, security concerns, and strained cross-border relations. Citizens frequently face lengthy and complex visa procedures, with a relatively high rate of application rejections compared to many other countries.Yemen has a bad security situation, the state of the country is greatly affected by political instability. The passport has limited reach, leaving many destinations off-limits. Humanitarian crises are also there. Outside travel requires careful planning and prior approvals.Somalia’s passport is affected by long-standing political instability. There are security challenges too and a limited diplomatic network. Many countries need Somalis to obtain visas before travel. Progress in governance and expanded bilateral relations is needed.Nepal’s low rank reflects a passport that Nepalis still require visas for many popular destinations. They might enjoy easier travel within South Asia and some neighboring countries, but long-haul travel involves advance visa applications.Palestinian territories also face a lot of issues. There are diplomatic and recognition issues. Passport holders require lengthy full visa processing. Geopolitical constraints and limited state recognition continue to restrict the mobility of many Palestinians.Libya’s passport has slightly higher access, yet remains burdened by political instability and security issues. Libyans frequently face prior-visa requirements and unpredictable processing times. Any sustained improvements in political stability and international relations would likely be the principal route to expand Libyan citizens’ travel freedoms.These nine weak passports of the countries only reflect how security concerns, political instability, cross border tensions, and diplomatic relationships directly affect not only international but everyday freedom to travel. It’s a difficult travel situation for the citizens of these nine nations. With lengthy visa processes and no surety of obtaining one, international mobility is often a matter of careful planning and several official approvals. It also limits work options, education, or family visits abroad, and personal opportunities too.Ultimately, a passport is more than a travel document - it’s a reflection of a nation’s global standing and stability. As countries work toward peace, stronger governance, and better diplomatic ties, their citizens may someday gain the freedom to move across borders with greater ease and dignity.","Afghanistan holds the 104th position on the global passport index, making it the least powerful passport worldwide.

Adrian Peterson faces DWI and weapon charges in Sugar Land



A legendary career overshadowed by repeated controversies



Former NFL star Adrian Peterson was arrested Sunday morning in Sugar Land, Texas, after allegedly driving while intoxicated and unlawfully carrying a weapon. The 39-year-old former running back, once hailed as one of the greatest players of his generation, now faces serious legal challenges that could significantly impact his post-football legacy.According to local booking records, officers took Peterson into custody around 10 a.m. on Sunday. He was charged with two counts of DWI and one count of unlawful weapon possession. Authorities have not yet disclosed the circumstances that led to the stop or why Peterson was in Sugar Land, which lies roughly three hours from his hometown of Palestine, Texas.This arrest marks Peterson’s second DWI offense this year. In April, Minnesota police reportedly stopped him for driving 83 mph in a 55 mph zone shortly after 3 a.m. “He blew a .14 percent blood alcohol concentration,” nearly twice the legal limit in Minnesota. That earlier incident occurred following a Vikings draft-day celebration, and Peterson was charged with DWI.Under Texas law, repeat offenders face stricter punishment. A second DWI can lead to a fine of up to $4,000, jail time ranging from one month to a year, and suspension of driving privileges for as long as two years.Texas also has a lifetime lookback period for DWI offenses, meaning Peterson’s Minnesota arrest could count toward harsher sentencing.Additionally, Peterson faces a charge for unlawfully carrying a weapon, which under Texas statutes occurs when someone “intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly carries on or about his or her person a handgun.” Depending on the case specifics, this can range from a Class A misdemeanor to a third-degree felony, with possible penalties reaching up to ten years in prison and a $10,000 fine.Adrian Peterson’s football journey was nothing short of iconic. Over 15 seasons, he played for seven teams, but his prime years with the Minnesota Vikings cemented his legacy. In 2012, he was named NFL MVP after finishing just eight yards short of breaking Eric Dickerson’s single-season rushing record. With over 14,000 rushing yards, he ranks fifth in league history.Yet, Peterson’s off-field issues have long shadowed his achievements. In 2014, he faced a felony child abuse charge in Texas but later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor. In 2022, he was briefly detained at Los Angeles International Airport after a domestic dispute, though charges were later dropped.Now, this latest arrest adds another chapter to a troubling pattern. Once a symbol of perseverance and athletic brilliance, Adrian Peterson finds himself fighting not for yards on the field but for redemption beyond it.Also Read: Why the Cowboys turned to Joe Milton as Dak Prescott sits out — full breakdown of the decision","Former nfl star adrian peterson was arrested sunday morning in sugar land, texas.
