Channi issues clarification

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and former Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi sparked outrage by questioning the credibility of India’s surgical strikes in Pakistan, saying he had “never seen where the strike took place.” The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) came down heavily on Channi, accusing him of disrespecting the armed forces and playing politics over national security .Speaking at a press conference following the Pahalgam terror attack, in which 26 people were killed, Channi said, “Till date, I could not find where the (surgical) strike took place, where men were killed at that time, and where this happened in Pakistan. Will we not find out if a bomb is dropped in our country? They say that they did a surgical strike in Pakistan. Nothing had happened. Nowhere was a surgical strike seen. Nobody came to know… I have always demanded (proof).”Channi also took a veiled dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying, “People are waiting for the 56-inch chest to act”. He went on to say, “We have never seen where in Pakistan the strikes were done and where people were killed.”His remarks drew a sharp rebuke from BJP leaders, who accused the Congress of undermining national security. BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan said Channi had a pattern of insulting India’s forces. “In 2024, he disgustingly commented 'stuntbaazi' when Corporal Vicky Pahade was martyred. Now, he insults the armed forces again, saying they (the Army) said that we did a surgical strike on Pakistan, but nobody saw it,” Kesavan said.Delhi BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa said Channi’s comments reflect the ""dirty mentality of the Gandhi family."" He asked, “What kind of mentality is this of the Congress party, the Gandhi family, Rahul Gandhi, that they keep questioning the army, the Indian Air Force?” Sirsa added, “Pakistan itself is saying that India has caused a lot of damage by conducting surgical strikes.”""Charanjit Singh Channi has again shown the dirty politics and dirty mentality of the Gandhi family, who always question the army and demoralise the forces. I condemn this,"" he further said.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla also attacked the Congress, branding it the “Pakistan Prast Party” for repeatedly seeking evidence of India’s military actions.""Congress has become Pakistan parast party (PPP). Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah says no action should be taken against Pakistan... Robert Vadra and other Congress party leaders have given a clean chit to Pakistan and blamed Hindutva... When the whole country is standing behind the army so that they can give a befitting reply to the terrorists, the Congress party is hurting the morale of the army,"" Poonawalla said.After the backlash, Channi attempted to clarify his stance, claiming he was not demanding proof of the strikes but calling for justice for the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.""I have said earlier also that the Congress party, in this hour of grief, is standing by the government. If the government disrupts their (Pakistan's) water supply, air or whatever action it takes, we are standing like a rock with it,"" he said.“There is nothing about surgical (strike) today. Its proof is not asked for, and I am not asking for it either… Don't try to divert this. The innocent tourists who were killed after being asked about their religion—those families want justice today,” he added.Earlier on Friday, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) while expressing full support to the victims' families, passed a resolution urging the Centre to act decisively against Pakistan. Party leaders, including Jairam Ramesh and Sachin Pilot, insisted that the Congress stood united with the government on national security.","Congress mp charanjit singh channi sparked outrage by questioning the credibility of india’s surgical strikes in pakistan.

Since April 24, just hours after the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistani troops have been resorting to unprovoked firing at various places along the LoC, starting from the Kashmir Valley.Initially beginning with unprovoked small arms firing at several posts along the LoC in Kupwara and Baramulla districts, Pakistan swiftly expanded its violations to the Poonch sector and subsequently to the Akhnoor sector.This was followed by small arms firing at several posts along the LoC in the Sunderbani and Naushera sectors.

US govt wants Indian national Badar Khan Suri’s deportation suit shifted; judge pushes back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-govt-wants-indian-national-badar-khan-suris-deportation-suit-shifted-judge-pushes-back/articleshow/120839211.cms,"The US government on Thursday asked a federal judge to transfer Indian national Badar Khan Suri’s deportation case from Virginia to Texas, where he is currently being held on charges of ""spreading Hamas propaganda.""At the hearing, US District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles expressed doubt about the government's petition, which would require her to dismiss the Virginia case, the Associated Press reported.She emphasised that dismissal would invalidate her March directive to keep Badar Khan Suri within the US during his First Amendment proceedings.Justice Department attorney David Byerley indicated he would consult with US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement regarding the judge's concerns. He expressed confidence that ICE would respect her deportation stay order whilst the case transfers to Texas federal court.""OK,"" the judge responded. ""I'm not going to rely on that. But thank you,"" she added.In a court filing ahead of the hearing, US attorneys argued that Badar Khan Suri’s lawsuit should have been filed in Texas, not Virginia, since he was already moved out of the state. They called the transfer a ""straightforward"" legal matter.The Trump administration said it relocated Khan Suri from a detention center in Farmville, Virginia, to Louisiana and then Texas due to overcrowding.However, the judge Giles appeared doubtful about that explanation. She asked the government to provide specific data on how many beds were available in Farmville at the time of Suri’s arrest and how many detainees have actually been transferred for overcrowding.Khan Suri's attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union told the judge that he initially slept on the floor in an overcrowded Texas facility for several weeks, though he now occupies an individual cell.His legal representatives suggested the transfer to Texas aimed to secure a more conservative judicial hearing. Attorney Vishal Agraharkar accused the government of engaging in ""forum shopping.""The federal courts in Texas and western Louisiana feature predominantly Republican-appointed judges, unlike Alexandria, Virginia's US District Court.Appeals proceed to the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The 5th Circuit, one of 13 federal appellate courts nationwide, comprises 17 full-time judges. Twelve received appointments from Republican presidents, including six during Donald Trump's presidency.Outside the Alexandria courthouse on Thursday, Hassan Ahmad, another lawyer representing Khan Suri, reinforced Agraharkar's courtroom statements. ""There is a reason why the detention facilities exist there,"" Ahmad said, further noting that, ""This kind of rigged game has to stop,"" he said.His legal team said that his arrest and imprisonment were unconstitutional, stemming from his wife's Gaza connections. They assert that Khan Suri and his spouse, Mapheze Saleh, faced targeting because Saleh's father worked with Gaza's Hamas-supported administration before the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen, came to the US in 2022 on a J-1 visa and works at Georgetown University as a visiting scholar and postdoctoral fellow.He and his wife Saleh have three children—a 9-year-old son and 5-year-old twins.

The Pakistani assailant involved in the attack, Hashim Musa, had served in Pakistan Army's special forces before ISI is believed to have loaned him to LeT for strikes against non-locals and security forces in Kashmir. The terror masterminds in Pakistan are now talking to terrorists and overground workers (OGWs) in Kashmir through encrypted app Ultra, with evidence pointing to the app's use in Tral coinciding with the Pahalgam attack.

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary KC Venugopal on Friday responded sharply to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s jibe at the INDIA bloc, which came during the inauguration of the Vizhinjam International Seaport in Thiruvananthapuram.Earlier in the day, PM Modi had referred the presence of Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor at the same public event and said that it would ""disturb the sleep"" of many in the opposition alliance.Countering the statement, Venugopal told reporters, “We will sleep peacefully, but it is going to be difficult for the PM to sleep.”He added that the INDIA bloc will ramp up pressure on the central government to act on the recently approved caste census, particularly in increasing the reservation cap beyond 50 per cent.“We won't allow PM and his cabinet to continue this, as with the Women's Reservation Bill . We will put maximum pressure, especially on increasing the cap of 50 per cent,” he said.“I don't know on what grounds PM is saying like this. The PM will be the one who will be having sleepless nights, not the INDIA alliance, Rahul Gandhi or Congress. We are going to put maximum pressure on him on the issue of the caste census,” Venugopal further added.PM Modi, speaking during the seaport event, had said, “I want to tell chief minister (Pinarayi Vijayan), you are a strong pillar of INDI alliance, Shashi Tharoor is also sitting here. Today's event is going to disturb the sleep of many.”Although the translator struggled to convey the exact sentiment in Malayalam, PM Modi said, “The message has gone wherever it has to go.”Meanwhile, speculation around Shashi Tharoor’s political future is gaining momentum, fuelled by his recent public interactions with BJP leaders and cryptic posts on social media in recent past. These developments have cast a shadow over his over 15-years of association with the Congress party.The Prime Minister’s comment came just days after the Centre decided to include caste enumeration in the upcoming census. The announcement was made by information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on April 30, following a Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs meeting.","Pm modi had referred to the presence of kerala cm pinarayi vijayan and congress mp shashi tharoor at the same public event.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif vowed a “decisive response” to any aggression from across the border.Hours before PTV News reported that several IAF Rafales and Su-30MKIs were “spotted and chased” during reconnaissance along the LoC, information minister Attaullah Tarar put out a statement citing “credible intelligence” that India could strike at Pakistan any time.“India’s refusal to allow neutral probes (into the terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam) reveals its intent,” Tarar said, accusing Delhi of “escalating tensions”.Islamabad denies its involvement in the attack, while India blames Pakistan-backed terrorists of targeting tourists after identifying them as Hindus.

India has also closed its airspace to Pakistani flights, following Islamabad’s reciprocal move. Both sides have expelled diplomats and engaged in cross-border firing nightly - breaking the 2021 ceasefire agreement.The Indian armed forces have been given full operational freedom.

""Whoever has carried out the dastardly attack in Pahalgam, we will not spare anyone. We will hunt down each and every perpetrator,"" Shah said at an event in Delhi. He emphasized the Modi government’s zero-tolerance approach toward terrorism, especially in Kashmir.“If someone thinks they will escape by carrying out such a cowardly attack, they are wrong. This is Narendra Modi's government. We will not spare anyone,” Shah said, reiterating the government's commitment to uprooting terrorism from the country. Referring to the April 22 attack that killed 26 people near the tourist hub of Pahalgam, he added, “Do not think that you have won by killing 26 people. Everyone of you will be made answerable.”As tensions between India and Pakistan surge to their most combustible point in years, Islamabad is acting on a fear it won’t admit publicly: that New Delhi might be preparing to strike deep within Pakistani territory, possibly targeting one of its most infamous assets-Hafiz Saeed.Also read: Pahalgam fallout: Why Xi Jinping may not come to rescue of 'China’s Israel' The 77-year-old founder of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and head of its political front, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, has become the focal point of an extraordinary security operation. Pakistani intelligence services, working closely with the military, have quietly assigned former commandos from the Special Services Group (SSG) to his protection. Additional personnel have been deployed around his homes-including his current residence, which has been declared a ""temporary sub-jail""-in densely populated Mohalla Johar in Lahore.A control room equipped with gesture-detection CCTV surveillance now monitors a one-kilometer radius around the compound, reflecting not just Saeed’s notoriety but Islamabad’s heightened anxiety about a potential covert hit.Amidst this, Pakistan’s media has gone into an overdrive. In a single news cycle, state-run outlets reported that Indian Air Force Rafale and Su-30MKI jets had crossed the Line of Control and were “chased away in panic.” A 2am government warning signaled “imminent military action” within 24 to 36 hours.But no confirmed incursion occurred. Indian officials stayed quiet. That silence only deepened Pakistan’s unease. Pakistani generals were left watching the skies-and possibly chasing ghosts.“There’s a real fear that the silence from Delhi is the calm before a storm,” said a Pakistani security analyst in Islamabad, speaking on condition of anonymity.On the ground in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, the anxiety is more tangible. Over 1,000 madrassas have been shut down “as a precaution,” authorities said, citing border tensions. In Muzaffarabad and towns along the LoC, schoolyards have been turned into makeshift training camps, an AFP report said.Children as young as 11 are learning how to use fire extinguishers, administer first aid, and carry wounded classmates on stretchers.In villages like Chakothi, located just three kilometers from the border, parents are keeping children indoors, and bunkers are being reinforced. “We make sure they come straight home from school. One shell is all it takes,” said shopkeeper Iftikhar Ahmad Mir.“Instructions have been issued to stock food supplies for two months in the 13 constituencies along the Line of Control (LoC),” said Chaudhry Anwar ul Haq, the PoK PM, during a session of the local assembly. The PoK government has also established an emergency fund of one billion rupees ($3.5 million) to ensure delivery of “food, medicines, and all other basic necessities,” he added. Machinery has been mobilized to keep roads clear in the border areas, the AFP report said.The Neelum Valley, known for its lush scenery and peak-season crowds, is emptying fast. Hotels are abandoned. Local businesses are shuttering. “Most tourists have left and returned to their cities because there is a risk of war,” said hotelier Rafaqat Hussain.In contrast to India, where some tourist zones were closed by official order, Pakistan has issued no such directive. Yet the exodus speaks volumes. The valley, less than two miles from the LoC, has become an eerie warning of what might lie ahead if escalation continues.In the background, Washington is working the phones.

She was saved at the last moment.”The newlyweds were just about settling in when the April 22 Pakistan-backed terrorist attack on tourists in Pahalgam tore their lives asunder along with those of many others.Lawyer Sharma cited a clarification from MHA that the order cancelling visas to Pakistanis wasn’t applicable to diplomatic and long-term visas.“Meenal was interviewed and recommended a long-term visa before the deportation exercise triggered by the Pahalgam attack started,” he said.On whether a Islamic marriage solemnised online by a qazi was legally valid, the lawyer said the Union govt recognised the wedding by issuing a visa to Meenal “as the wife of Munir Khan”.While the high court didn’t stay Meenal’s deportation, it said she should be allowed to stay in Jammu until her visa status was clear. The case will be next heard on May 14.The court said the onus was on the Union govt to decide whether a long-term visa should be issued to Munir’s wife, also noting that her short-term visa had lapsed more than a month ago.","Pakistan national meenal ahmed khan was reunited with her husband, crpf trooper munir khan, on j&k high court’s orders this week.

India's 1st transshipment hub inaugurated by PM in Kerala,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-1st-transshipment-hub-inaugurated-by-pm-in-kerala/articleshow/120834462.cms,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that the capacity of the Vizhinjam deepwater port will triple in three years, allowing some of the world's largest cargo ships to dock here smoothly.PM said the port will reduce India's reliance on foreign transshipment hubs where 75% of its transshipments currently happen, in what was an obvious reference to Colombo and Singapore. He added that this shift could boost revenue retention and create new opportunities in Kerala.The Rs 8,800 crore Vizhinjam project is India's first dedicated transshipment hub with its natural depth of nearly 20 metres allowing large ships to berth, something that is not possible at the smaller ports in the country.Modi linked the project to India's broader maritime strategy, referring to Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision and India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor announced at the G20 summit. While the port itself was under development for years, much of the construction and equipment involved private sector collaboration, particularly Adani Ports , which is operating the terminal.In a lighter vein, PM also commented on the role of private investment in the project. ""When the people of Gujarat learn that Adani built such a great port in Kerala, after working on a port in Gujarat for 30 years without building anything like this, they'll be upset with him,"" he said, drawing laughter from the audience.Highlighting govt's focus on maritime development in past 10 years, Modi mentioned about the 30% reduction in turnaround time of ships at India's major ports. He also said the reformed regulations concerning Indian seafarers, was yielding significant results.

Ganga Expressway: IAF Conducts Flypast in UP Amid India-Pakistan Tensions Post Pahalgam Attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-conducts-flypast-on-the-ganga-expressway-in-up-amid-india-pakistan-tensions-after-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/120818751.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Friday conducted a major flypast and landing drill on the Ganga Expressway in Uttar Pradesh. The high-profile exercise, involving fighter jets and transport aircraft, was aimed at testing the expressway’s capability to serve as an alternative runway during emergencies or wartime. This came amid rising tensions with Pakistan following the Pahalgam terror attack.The Ganga Expressway stands out as the first in India to support both day and night landings of fighter jets. Previously, similar exercises on the Lucknow-Agra and Purvanchal expressways occurred only during daylight.Locals and students gathered to witness the flight demonstrations, which included various IAF aircraft such as Rafale, SU-30 MKI, Mirage-2000, and more. The drills test low fly-pasts, landings, and take-offs under all lighting conditions.This move by the IAF comes just days after terrorists killed 26, mostly tourists, in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam region on April 22. In the aftermath, India’s military forces have gone into high alert mode, not just on land but across sea and air domains.The Indian Navy has also significantly ramped up its activity in the Arabian Sea. Multiple warships have conducted successful anti-ship missile firings to demonstrate long-range strike capabilities.Earlier, INS Surat, the newest guided missile destroyer in the Navy's fleet, successfully tested the Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missile (MR-SAM) system. Jointly developed with Israel, the system is capable of neutralising aerial threats up to 70 kilometres away. The destroyer, equipped with cutting-edge radar and AI systems, was commissioned earlier this year and marks a leap in India’s maritime defence strength.The Indian Coast Guard has deployed vessels near the maritime boundary off Gujarat, coordinating closely with the Navy to boost surveillance efforts, as per ANI.""The Indian Coast Guard has also deployed vessels in forward areas near the international maritime boundary off the Gujarat coast. It is working in close coordination with the Navy to enhance surveillance,"" the defence sources told news agency ANI.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed swift and strong action in response to the Pahalgam killings, pledging that the perpetrators “would be punished in a way they never imagined”.

Pakistan had managed to secure a $7 billion bailout programme from the IMF last year and was granted a new $1.3 billion climate resilience loan in March.The IMF executive board is scheduled to meet Pakistani officials on May 9 for first review of the extended funding facility, and request for an arrangement under the resilience and sustainability facility.""IMF must reassess its engagement with Pakistan in light of the April 22 Pahalgam attack, the deadliest one on Indian civilians since the 2008 Mumbai attacks...

Introducing Jordon Hudson's ex-boyfriend Joshua L. Zuckerman: The 64-year-old businessman who dated her before Bill Belichick

Love Beyond Age: Navigating Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson's May-December Relationship

“wise beyond her years,”

Joshua L. Zuckerman’s perspective on Jordon Hudson’s current relationship with Bill Belichick

Jordon Hudson ’s relationship with Bill Belichick is currently under intense scrutiny, as the media has been all over their 48-year age gap. From accusations of gold-digging to endless gossip about their unusual romance, Hudson can't seem to catch a break. But while the public focuses on her relationship with the 72-year-old NFL legend, there's an unexpected voice coming to her defense: her 64-year-old ex-boyfriend, Joshua L. Zuckerman . Zuckerman, who dated Hudson for several years before she began her relationship with Belichick, has a lot to say about her character and motivations. And he might just provide some insight into why Hudson tends to choose older men.Since news of Hudson's romance with Belichick became public, the media has been relentless, scrutinizing their every move and fueling online debates. Critics have rushed to label Hudson as a “gold-digger” due to the age difference, with many assuming her relationship is about the financial benefits of being with someone of Belichick’s stature. Social media users have dissected everything from her motives to her past, while tabloids continue to spin headlines questioning whether love or ambition is truly driving this unexpected romance.While the media continues to pile on, Hudson’s ex-boyfriend, Joshua L. Zuckerman, is speaking out in her defense. Zuckerman, a 64-year-old businessman, dated Hudson before she became involved with Belichick. Despite their breakup, Zuckerman has maintained a positive relationship with Hudson and he has his own perspective on the criticism she’s facing. In an interview, he described Hudson asand he insists that the narrative surrounding her character is entirely unfair. For him, Hudson isn’t the “gold-digger” the media makes her out to be but rather a deep, intellectual young woman who deserves respect.Zuckerman paints a picture of Hudson as someone who doesn’t fit the typical mold of a young woman seeking financial gain from an older man. Instead, he talks about the deep intellectual bond they shared during their relationship. According to him, the two connected over psychology, philosophy, and nature, topics that aren’t usually the center of a traditional relationship with someone much older. For Zuckerman, this was never about money, it was about a shared mental connection. His defense emphasizes that Hudson is much more than what critics make her out to be, suggesting that her choices in men have always been based on shared values rather than material gain.Despite their breakup, Zuckerman remains a supporter of Hudson’s and doesn’t want the public’s perception to define her. He believes that Hudson’s current relationship with Belichick, and her past relationship with him, were built on genuine connections, not financial motives. For Zuckerman, Hudson is a young woman unafraid to live life on her own terms and he hopes that the media will start to understand that her dating habits don’t fit the narrative they’ve been pushing.Also read - Bill Belichick’s girlfriend Jordon Hudson gets slammed by his daughter-in-law after Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman defend her","Jordon hudson’s relationship with bill belichick is currently under intense scrutiny.

Donald Trump Sparks Controversy With Remarks on Muslim Imams and '38 Virgins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/do-you-want-to-die-donald-trumps-bizarre-remarks-on-muslim-imams-and-38-virgins/articleshow/120827436.cms,"At a White House event marking the National Day of Prayer , President Donald Trump stood flanked by religious leaders of every stripe—Christian pastors, Jewish rabbis, Hindu swamis, Buddhist monks, and Muslim imams.But in typical Trump fashion, what began as a carefully choreographed moment of spiritual unity soon veered into campaign trail chaos, as he launched into an unscripted anecdote involving imams, death, and what he mistakenly called “38 virgins.”“I love them. They were great,” Trump said, recalling a meeting with Muslim leaders in Michigan during the 2024 campaign. “They said, ‘We don’t want to die.’ I said, ‘You want to die?’ They said, ‘We don’t want to die.’ I said, ‘What about the 38 virgins?’ They said, ‘That’s nonsense.’”The line triggered predictable mockery online. “It’s 72 virgins , not 38,” one X user deadpanned. “Trump’s math works in mysterious ways.” Another joked that the number downgrade was the latest example of the president’s famed deal-making abilities—“negotiating paradise down by 47%.”The “72 virgins” concept itself is a widely misunderstood and often misrepresented trope. It originates from a disputed hadith in some medieval Islamic texts and is not mentioned in the Quran; most mainstream Islamic scholars regard it as symbolic, apocryphal, or even satire, not doctrinal theology. Nonetheless, the idea has been weaponised by extremists and misused in the West as a crude stereotype to paint Muslim beliefs as inherently violent or absurd.But behind the laugh lines lies a far more consequential reality: Trump’s growing appeal among Muslim voters , especially in Michigan’s Arab-American communities. It’s a political realignment that few pundits predicted—and one that helped tip a critical battleground state in his favour.Earlier, during the 2024 election , many Arab and Muslim American voters, particularly in battleground Michigan, made a surprising shift toward Donald Trump. In Dearborn, a city with one of the largest Muslim populations in the United States, Trump won 42% of the vote, a remarkable jump from the roughly 26% he garnered in 2020.Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, burdened by the Biden administration’s handling of the Gaza conflict and broader Middle East policy, secured just 36%, while Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 18%. Trump’s deliberate outreach to Muslim leaders, his vows to “end the wars,” and his emphasis on religious liberty struck a chord with voters frustrated by Democratic foreign policy and progressive cultural agendas.For many Muslim Americans, particularly in Yemeni and Palestinian communities, Trump’s platform, while flawed, felt more aligned with their priorities than the Democratic status quo. It was a calculated, interest-based vote rather than an endorsement of his persona, but in a tight state like Michigan, it made all the difference.","President donald trump mistakenly called muslim imams ""38 virgins"" the line triggered predictable mockery online.
