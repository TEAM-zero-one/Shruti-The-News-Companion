The incident drew a myriad reactions from netizens, especially at a time when the central government has taken concrete steps to bust the Pakistani propaganda against India, especially on Operation Sindoor.Operation Sindoor was launched by armed forces targeting nine terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 that killed 26 people.","Aimim mp asaduddin owaisi took a jibe at pakistani pm shehbaz sharif and its army chief asim munir over fake image of 'operation bunyan' he advised against taking pakistan's claims seriously, ""not even with a pinch of salt""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121424711,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1041029,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"‘It was Indian military action’: Jaishankar denies US role in ceasefire with Pakistan, says 'draw your conclusions' on China link",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-was-indian-military-action-jaishankar-denies-us-role-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan-says-draw-you-conclusions-on-china-link/articleshow/121423798.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar has firmly rejected claims that the United States played a decisive role in brokering the recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan, asserting instead that it was India’s military response that forced Islamabad to halt hostilities. In an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jaishankar also raised concerns over Pakistan’s close defence ties with China, encouraging observers to ""draw your own conclusions.""“The cessation of firing was agreed between the military commanders of both sides through direct contact,” Jaishankar said. “The morning before, we effectively hit and incapacitated Pakistan's main airbases and air defence system. So who should I thank for the cessation of hostilities? I thank the Indian military because it was the Indian military action that made Pakistan say: We are ready to stop.”Pushing back against suggestions that the standoff during Operation Sindoor brought the nuclear-armed neighbours close to atomic conflict, Jaishankar called such claims baseless and alarmist.“Very, very far away. I’m frankly astonished by your question,” he said when asked how close the world was to nuclear war.“We had terrorist targets. Those were very measured, carefully considered and non-escalating steps. After that, the Pakistani military opened fire on us. We were able to show them that we could disable their air defence systems. Then the firing stopped at their request.”He criticised what he called the West’s persistent tendency to frame South Asian conflicts as potential nuclear flashpoints. “Anything that happens in South Asia is promptly linked to a nuclear crisis by the West,” he said, calling the narrative “disturbing” and warning that it inadvertently “encourages terrible activities like terrorism.”On Pakistan’s continued support for terrorism, Jaishankar said: “Anyone who is not blind can see that the terrorist organisations are openly operating from the cities and towns of Pakistan... In Pakistan, terrorism is a very open business. A business that is supported, financed, organised and used by the state. And by their military.”When asked about China's involvement in the India-Pakistan dynamic, Jaishankar pointed to Islamabad’s defence dependency on Beijing. “Many of the weapons systems that Pakistan has are of Chinese origin and the two countries are very close. You can draw your own conclusions from that,” he said.Jaishankar’s remarks were part of a wide-ranging conversation on India’s evolving foreign policy, its relationship with Germany and the European Union, and its longstanding strategic partnership with Russia. Defending New Delhi’s ties with Moscow, he criticised what he described as European double standards.“You sound as if you can do business with states that are different, but we cannot... My neighbour Pakistan has caused every conceivable problem under the sun... But doesn't Germany also do business with Pakistan?” he asked.On Europe’s changing approach to global affairs, Jaishankar said the continent was beginning to move away from the assumption that its concerns automatically translate into global priorities. “I see big changes in Europe and Europe’s thinking... that it feels it should be more independent and more resilient,” he said.He welcomed Germany’s increasing role in global security, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, and expressed hope for stronger India-Germany defence cooperation. However, he acknowledged that “the conditions are not yet perfect” and India continues to press for deeper technological collaboration.Regarding the long-pending India-EU Free Trade Agreement, Jaishankar struck an optimistic tone. “Prime Minister Modi and EU Commission President von der Leyen have made it clear that the project should be completed by the end of the year... The agreement has strategic importance.”He also expressed confidence in Germany’s growing engagement with the Indo-Pacific and its understanding of India’s concerns over China. “When I look at Germany ten years ago, I see an enormous evolution... I see much stronger prospects for our partnership,” he said.","S jaishankar rejects claims that the united states played a decisive role in brokering the recent ceasefire between india and pakistan.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar Monday termed LoP Rahul Gandhi 's charge that Pakistan was told of Operation Sindoor in advance ""utter misrepresentation of facts and events"" that amounted to questioning the version of the armed forces.Briefing members of Parliament's consultative panel on external affairs, Jaishankar cited press briefings to say that armed forces had clearly stated that Pakistan was informed about Op Sindoor only after nine terror bases had been destroyed; a reference to the press briefing by DGMO Lt General Rajiv Ghai, who had said Pakistan was informed after India had struck the targets.Some reports said Jaishankar had informed Pakistan about the strikes 30 minutes after they commenced but this could not be confirmed.Sources said Jaishankar dismissed talk of US ""interference"", saying the decision to halt military operations was made bilaterally following a request from Pakistan, and on a ""you shoot, we shoot; you stop, we stop"" understanding.Jaishankar also said govt had responded to the US's suggestion that it engage with Pakistan by making it clear that ""terror and talks cannot coexist"".Rahul Gandhi has alleged that Jaishankar said he informed Pakistan ahead of the Indian strikes on terror targets and this made him an informant of Pakistan. ""I never used the word 'before' while talking about information sharing with Pakistan,"" a source quoted the minister as telling members of the parliamentary committee.Jaishankar never personally spoke with Pakistani officials and emphasised that India's DGMO notified Pakistan about the strikes on terror camps only after they were executed. The minister asserted the importance of unity at this juncture and said the govt needed the support of all. He also told members to reach out to him for any clarifications and not go by the media, sources said.Sources confirmed that the DGMO was the only line of communication with Pakistan during the conflict.Jaishankar said India had made it plain that it was prepared to counter any escalation, in what appeared to be a reference to PM Narendra Modi's response to US vice president J D Vance when the latter called on the night of May 9 to convey Pakistan's preparation for a massive retaliation.He told members that developments were in the works as far as the Indus Waters Treaty issue was concerned and the govt would share that with the committee when things materialised.He was asked to take measures to address the concerns of Punjab where young lives are being lost to narcotics terrorism. He heard the concerns and assured members that these would be discussed and addressed.He also addressed the geopolitical alignments that surfaced during the standoff. ""Only Turkiye and Azerbaijan stood openly with Pakistan,"" he told the committee.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri presented details of Operation Sindoor to the MPs, while Jaishankar addressed their queries.","Eam on info-share row: never used word 'before' while talking about information sharing with pakistan.

So please don't think that something is only going on behind the scenes,"" he said.Jaishankar also said all the focus on the nuclear-weapon issue between India and Pakistan was only encouraging terrorism, adding that at no point was a nuclear level reached during the recent India-Pakistan military conflict. ""There is a narrative as if everything that happens in our part of the world leads directly to a nuclear problem. That disturbs me a lot because it encourages terrible activities like terrorism. If anything, much more is happening with the nuclear issue in your part of the world,"" said the minister, adding that India sent a clear signal to the terrorists through Operation Sindoor that there is a price to be paid for carrying out Pahalgam-like attacks.""The firing was then started by the Pakistani military.

Asked about the role played by the US in reaching the ""ceasefire"", Jaishankar said only the Indian military can be thanked for it. ""I thank the Indian military because it was the Indian military action that made Pakistan say: We are ready to stop,"" he said.Asked about the differences between India and Germany over the Russia-Ukraine war and India's ties with Moscow, the minister said relationships do not develop because one partner simply adopts the concerns of the other as their own. ""Relationships are built on finding common ground. For you in Europe, other concerns and worries are important than for me in Asia. When you think of conflict, you think of Ukraine.

China To Attack Taiwan? 'Invasion Anytime' As U.S. Confirms HUGE Preps; Fighters, Warships Deployed

NEW DELHI: India has revived its long-pending case for the indigenous construction of 12 specialized warships to detect, track and destroy underwater mines laid by enemy forces to choke harbours and ports, disrupt shipping and maritime trade.Defence ministry sources say the procurement case for the 12 advanced minesweepers or mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for the Navy, at an estimated cost of around Rs 44,000 crore, will soon be placed before the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council for the grant of “acceptance of necessity (AoN)”.The “open tender” or RFP (request for proposal) will then be issued for Indian shipyards to submit their techno-commercial bids. “It will take at least 7-8 years, if not more, for the first MCMV to roll out after the contract is inked,” a source said.The MCMVs are crucial in the backdrop of Chinese nuclear and conventional submarines, which can quietly lay mines, regularly coming to the Indian Ocean Region. Pakistan, too, is rapidly adding to its underwater combat fleet, with eight new Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines to be delivered by China.The Indian Navy, alarmingly, does not have a single MCMV at present, with its earlier six Karwar-class and two Pondicherry class of minesweepers having progressively retired several years ago.The force is making do with “clip-on mine countermeasure suites” mounted on some ships to plug the critical capability gap when it needs 24 MCMVs to guard the country’s 7,516-km long coastline with 13 major ports and over 200 minor ones.Both state and non-state actors can choke harbours and ports by planting underwater mines, which are cheap and relatively easy to use, to blow up warships, merchant vessels and tankers.The acquisition case for 12 MCMVs had begun way back in July 2005, which eventually led to Goa Shipyard tying up with South Korea firm Kangnam to build the specialized vessels. The negotiations, however, remained deadlocked on the costs, technology transfer and build strategy. The Rs 32,000 crore project was finally scrapped by the MoD in 2017-2018.With a displacement of around 900-1,000 tonne, the MCMVs have non-magnetic hulls and high-definition sonars, acoustic and magnetic sweeps to detect marooned and drifting mines. The vessels then use remote-controlled systems like small underwater vehicles to detonate the mines at safe distances.The over 130-warship Navy, of course, played a silent but crucial role during Operation Sindoor earlier this month in dissuading Pakistan from escalating hostilities by forward deploying its aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, warships and submarines in the northern Arabian Sea.The force currently has 60 warships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards, while it will also commission its second 3,900-tonne multi-role frigate built in Russia as INS Tamal at Kaliningrad next month.It also has the initial approval or AoNs for another 31 warships, including seven new-generation frigates, eight corvettes and six stealth diesel-electric submarines. The MCMVs will add to the numbers.The Navy, however, will reach a force-level of just about 160 warships by 2030, given the slow pace of construction in Indian shipyards as well as the progressive decommissioning of older warships, as earlier reported by TOI.","Defence ministry sources say the procurement case for the 12 advanced minesweepers or mine countermeasure vessels (mcmvs) for the navy will soon be placed before the rajnath singh-led defence acquisitions council. “it will take at least 7-8 years, if not more, for the first mcmv to roll out after the contract is inked,” a source said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121399201,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1096204,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'Delulu Land PM...': Pakistan Frames Its Fakery; Passes Off Chinese Drill Pic As India Strike

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army on Monday released a photo of the operations room from the night Operation Sindoor was under way against terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) on May 7.In the photo, top military brass, including Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi and Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, could be seen monitoring the operation.Under 'Operation Sindoor', the Indian Army targeted nine terror hideouts belonging to banned organisations Jaish-e-Mohammed Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen in Pakistan and PoJK.The strategic operation involved striking four locations within Pakistan's territory, while other five targets were situated in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. The military strikes were carried out two weeks after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives.'Operation Sindoor' was executed through coordinated efforts of the Army, Navy and Air Force, conducted from Indian territory. The defence ministry described the operation as ""focused, measured and non-escalatory"", deliberately avoiding Pakistani military installations.On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated that Operation Sindoor should not be treated as a one-off initiative and civil defence preparedness must be institutionalised by the states.During the Governing Council meeting of Niti Ayog, PM Modi said that the states must modernise their approach to civil preparedness. He also added that the recent mock drills have reignited our attention to civil defence states should institutionalize Civil Defence preparedness.Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday chaired a meeting of the Consultative Committee of Parliament on External Affairs to discuss cross-border terrorism and the military strikes carried out under Operation Sindoor.The meeting addressed concerns raised by the opposition and shed light on diplomatic, military and international aspects of the operation.According to ANI sources, the panel was briefed that the government deliberately chose high-value terror targets early to deliver a strong message and expose the inability of Pakistani forces to protect the epicentres of terrorism. The strikes, officials said, had a major psychological impact on the Pakistani military. The EAM also highlighted India’s diplomatic strategy.Following Operation Sindoor, the Modi government deployed seven multi-party delegations across capitals to convey India’s zero-tolerance approach to terrorism. Most countries welcomed India’s action, with only Turkey, China, and Azerbaijan withholding support.","Photo released by army shows top military brass, including army chief gen upendra dwivedi, navy chief admiral dinesh k tripathi and air force chief air chief marshal ap singh.

'Delulu Land PM...': Pakistan Frames Its Fakery; Passes Off Chinese Drill Pic As India Strike

NEW DELHI: In a fiery address from Bhuj, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday delivered a powerful message to Pakistan and its people, warning that peace is a choice, but retaliation is certain if terrorism continues.Speaking during a rally after launching development projects worth over Rs 53,400 crore, PM Modi said, “I want to tell the people of Pakistan— sukh chain ki zindagi jiyo, roti khao, warna meri goli to hai hi (live a life of peace and eat your roti in calm, or else, my bullet is always ready).”The Prime Minister said the onus now lies with ordinary Pakistanis, urging, “The people of Pakistan need to come forward to get their country rid of terrorism. Their youth will have to come forward.”PM Modi’s sharp remarks came days after the Indian armed forces’ large-scale strike under Operation Sindoor , conducted in response to the deadly Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 people.He said the mission wasn’t just retaliation but “a mission to save humanity and end terrorism.” He added, “We waited for 15 days hoping Pakistan would act against terrorism. But it seems terrorism is their bread and butter.”The Prime Minister hailed the strength of India’s response, saying, “Our retaliation was so strong that their airbases are still in ICU. It was the valour and bravery of our forces that made Pakistan wave the white flag.”Referring to Pakistan’s reaction post-strike, PM Modi said, “They sent drones to border areas including Kutch, but even there, brave women had stood firm before. In 1971, women of Kutch rebuilt the Bhuj runway in just 72 hours. Those same women blessed me recently and gifted me a sindoor plant, which I will plant at the PM House.”Criticising Pakistan’s ideology, he stated, “India believes in tourism, it connects nations. But Pakistan considers terrorism as tourism. This is dangerous for the world.”Modi reiterated India’s stance of zero tolerance against terrorism, asserting, “Whoever will make us bleed will face the same fate. At no cost will they be spared.”The PM’s visit to Bhuj included the inauguration of major power, port, and infrastructure projects. He lauded the region's development and resilience, noting, “Bhuj’s growth story is remarkable. The projects launched today will accelerate progress in renewable energy, ports, and infrastructure.”","Pm modi's sharp remarks came days after the indian armed forces’ large-scale strike under operation sindoor.

Guyana Stands With India: Slams Terror, Backs Peace | Tharoor Team Meets PM, VP | Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force on Monday shared a commemorative video marking the anniversary of 'Operation Safed Sagar', its 1999 air campaign during the Kargil War against Pakistan.Operation Safed Sagar was the IAF’s codename for its air operations conducted in support of the Indian Army’s Operation Vijay, which was launched to evict Pakistani troops and infiltrators who had illegally occupied Indian positions along the Line of Control (LoC) in the Kargil sector.In a post on X, the IAF said: “Operation Safed Sagar — the Indian Air Force’s codename for its air operations during the KargilWar1999 — was launched in support of ground forces under Operation Vijay. It aimed to flush out Pakistani regulars and intruders who had occupied Indian positions along the LoC in the Kargil sector.”The operation was historic, being the first large-scale use of air power in the Kashmir region since the 1971 Indo-Pak war. The IAF executed high-altitude precision operations in some of the world’s most challenging mountainous terrain, redefining the role of air power in limited conflicts.The IAF also shared the list of aircraft used during Operation Safed Sagar to take on Pakistan in the Kargil War. These included Mirage 2000s, MiG-21s, MiG-29s, MiG-23s, MiG-27s, Jaguars, Mi-17 helicopters, and Chetak helicopters.The IAF mentioned: “Never before had an air force been tasked with such high-altitude precision operations in rugged mountainous terrain - making it a watershed moment in military aviation history.”Operation Safed Sagar also broke conventional thinking about air power. It demonstrated that limited, targeted air strikes could have a decisive impact without escalating into a full-scale war.“The operation not only showcased the versatility and resolve of the Indian Air Force but also established the deterrent value of calibrated air strikes—even in a low-intensity conflict,” the IAF said.“It proved that air power could decisively alter the course of battle without crossing international boundaries.”The Kargil War lasted from May to July 1999 in the Kargil district of then Jammu and Kashmir, now part of the Union Territory of Ladakh. The conflict began when Pakistani troops and militants infiltrated across the LoC.India responded with full force, and Operation Vijay led to the successful recapture of key positions.The IAF’s tribute to Operation Safed Sagar comes weeks after its recent offensive under Operation Sindoor , a retaliatory strike launched on May 7 in response to the Pahalgam terror attack.In that action, nine known terrorist hubs sponsored by Pakistan were destroyed, showing India’s continued calibrated use of air power in counterterror operations.","The indian air force on monday shared a commemorative video marking the anniversary of 'operation safed sagar', its 1999 air campaign during the kargil war against pakistan.

NEW DELHI: In what can only be described as a bizarre mashup of fantasy and farce, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif gifted a framed photograph to Army chief and newly-appointed field marshal Gen. Asim Munir to commemorate ""Operation Bunyan-ul-Marsoos"". The only catch? The image is not from any Pakistani battlefield. It’s a 2019 Chinese rocket artillery drill.In a gesture that may go down as a new low in military cosplay, the Pakistani leadership chose a stock image of Chinese rocket systems, publicly available on multiple defence websites, and passed it off as a symbol of their military prowess.While India executed Operation Sindoor , a high-precision, retaliatory military operation in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack, Pakistan appears to have responded with a JPEG!""Pakistan just hit a new low in military cosplay. PM Shehbaz Sharif gifts Gen. Asim Munir a Chinese rocket drill photo from 2019, claiming it’s Operation Bunyad-ul-Marsus.

Triggered by the Pahalgam massacre - where tourists were targeted in a brutal execution-style killing - the Indian military executed coordinated strikes deep inside Pakistan, hitting high-value terrorist infrastructure.The response was swift, multi-domain, and precise. India used stand-off weapons, including air-launched cruise missiles, loitering munitions, and long-range drones, to hit nine locations across Pakistan - including Muridke and Bahawalpur, the symbolic and operational hubs of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Unlike earlier military responses such as the 2016 Uri surgical strikes or the 2019 Balakot airstrike, Operation Sindoor wasn’t about symbolism or deterrent threats. It was about imposing direct, material costs - degrading terrorist capabilities and forcing Pakistan’s military-terrorist nexus to rethink its operational latitude.Operation Sindoor didn’t just demolish infrastructure - it pierced the sense of impunity long enjoyed by Pakistan-based terror groups. By launching precise, visible strikes on their most symbolic sanctuaries, India has forced Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and others into a psychological recalibration.The message was clear: no place is beyond India’s reach. As War on the Rocks notes, these groups will now have to constantly watch their backs, draining energy, focus, and resources that were once singularly aimed at India. Terrorist leaders now operate under constant fear of targeted Indian strikes, forcing them to adopt a survival-first mindset that undermines their ability to plan large-scale attacks.","Pakistan's prime minister shehbaz sharif gifted a framed photograph to army chief and newly-appointed field marshal gen. asim munir to commemorate ""operation bunyan-ul-marsoos"" the only catch?

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said India exercised restraint for 15 days after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , hoping Pakistan would act against terrorists. But when no steps were taken, he gave the armed forces a free hand under Operation Sindoor , a mission he described as a clear assertion of India's zero-tolerance policy on terror.“After the Pahalgam attack, we waited for 15 days to see if Pakistan would take any action. But it seems terrorism is their bread and butter. When they did nothing, I gave our armed forces a free hand,” the PM said, addressing a large gathering in Bhuj after inaugurating development projects worth over Rs 50,000 crore.PM Modi said Operation Sindoor not only dismantled terror infrastructure but sent a strong message globally. “Whoever makes us bleed will see a similar response. At no cost will they be spared,” he said.He further said, “Our retaliation was so strong that their airbases are still in ICU. It was the valour and bravery of our forces that forced Pakistan to wave the white flag. We had already told them, our target was your terror infrastructure; all you had to do was stay quiet.

In response, Islamabad has vowed to ramp up military preparedness while simultaneously pushing forward with costly hydropower projects.Planning and development minister Ahsan Iqbal identified water security as a strategic imperative, accusing India of “water aggression” through upstream dam projects on rivers shared under Indus Waters Treaty. “We will not allow India to exploit our water resources,” Iqbal said, pledging accelerated work on the $14bn Diamer-Bhasha Dam.Expected to produce 4,500MW and store 8.1mn acre-feet of water, Diamer-Bhasha is still years from completion, hindered by funding gaps and logistical setbacks.Analysts questioned whether Islamabad can sustain simultaneous defence and infrastructure pushes. Economist Dr Kaiser Bengali called the approach risky. “Diverting funds to defence and megaprojects like Diamer-Bhasha could undermine social spending and economic reforms, leaving ordinary Pakistanis to bear the brunt,” he said Sunday.Pakistan’s debt-to-GDP ratio stands near 70%. With a trade deficit of $25bn in 2024 and import cover for barely three months, fiscal space remains tight. Facing a severe financial crunch with foreign reserves hovering at $3bn, Islamabad is under pressure from a $7bn IMF bailout programme that demands strict fiscal controls.Govt denied IMF pressure delayed the federal budget, attributing it instead to PM Shehbaz Sharif’s foreign travel and Eid holidays. Analysts remain unconvinced.“IMF’s oversight is inescapable,” Bengali said. “This budget reflects a juggling act between security concerns and economic survival.”",Pakistan's decision to boost defence spending by 18% to over rs 2.5 lakh crore in the 2025-26 budget has ignited fresh debate over the cash-strapped nation’s fiscal priorities.economists warned the latest defence allocation framed as a response to escalating tensions with india risks derailing economic reforms.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121400180,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-894651,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Indus Water Treaty : In abeyance, govt to brief MPs on next steps

NEW DELHI: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Monday chaired a meeting of the Consultative Committee of Parliament on External Affairs to discuss cross-border terrorism and the military strikes carried out under Operation Sindoor Launched on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, the operation targeted key terror hubs across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists affiliated with groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen.The meeting addressed concerns raised by the opposition and shed light on diplomatic, military and international aspects of the operation. Here are the key takeaways:Congress MPs raised concerns about whether the government had informed Pakistan in advance of the strikes.The government, however, clarified that there was ""absolutely no conversation"" between India and Pakistan prior to the operation, except at the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) level, and only after the strikes were complete. “The misrepresentation of this sequence is dishonest,” sources quoted EAM Jaishankar as saying.The official timeline shared in the meeting was: strikes on terror hubs, followed by a PIB press release, and then communication from the Indian DGMO to his Pakistani counterpart.The minister told the parliamentary panel that Pakistan was informed by the DGMO about Indian strikes on terror camps in their territory only after they were executed, sources said. He also said he never spoke to Pakistan and cleared the air about alleged US ""interference"", saying the decision to halt the military operation was taken bilaterally after a request from the Pakistan side.The Congress and Rahul Gandhi have been targeting Jaishankar, alleging that he had informed Pakistan beforehand about the Indian strikes at terror camps.According to ANI sources, the panel was briefed that the government deliberately chose high-value terror targets early to deliver a strong message and expose the inability of Pakistani forces to protect the epicentres of terrorism. The strikes, officials said, had a major psychological impact on the Pakistani military.The EAM also highlighted India’s diplomatic strategy. Following Operation Sindoor, the Modi government deployed seven multi-party delegations across capitals to convey India’s zero-tolerance approach to terrorism. Most countries welcomed India’s action, with only Turkey, China, and Azerbaijan withholding support.A recent statement by German foreign minister Johann Wadephul was cited as an example of global backing. Speaking alongside Jaishankar in Berlin, Wadephul said, “India has every right to defend itself against terrorism… We were appalled by the brutal terrorist attack on April 22 and appreciate the current truce. What matters now is ensuring its stability.”Congress sources, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the government’s explanations. They questioned India’s abstention from IMF-related decisions on Pakistan and flagged concerns over Pakistan’s growing military and strategic proximity to China. They also referred to US senator Marco Rubio's comment on brokering peace between India and Pakistan.The committee also sought clarification on remarks made by US President Donald Trump about India-Pakistan tensions. According to the government, Jaishankar had repeatedly communicated to international counterparts that “terror and talks cannot go together.”The minister told the parliamentary panel that the decision to halt the military operation was taken bilaterally after a request from the Pakistan side.The cessation of Operation Sindoor was done only after Pakistan DGMO asked for the halting of hostilities and there was no question of US mediation between the two, the sources said.Jaishankar said the US was urging India to speak with Pakistan and it was told that terror and talks would not go together. The minister further said that the DGMO had informed his Pakistani counterpart that if they would fire, India would fire back.The EAM concluded by calling for national unity, urging MPs to reflect the same bipartisan spirit seen in foreign delegations back home.MPs also inquired whether India would continue to honour the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan. The government clarified that the treaty is currently in abeyance and that parliamentarians would be updated on subsequent developments.Jaishankar summarised the session in a post on X, writing, “Chaired the Consultative Committee Meeting of MEA this morning in Delhi. Discussed Op Sindoor and India's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Underlined the importance of sending a strong and united message in that regard.”","'no prior tip-off to pakistan': govt counters congress claim. India’s strategy and diplomatic outreach highlighted.
