'Animal Will Pay': Trump Erupts After 2 National Guardsmen Shot Near White House; DC In Lockdown

Two National Guard members shot near White House





Authorities have identified the suspect in the Washington DC shooting that critically injured two National Guard members near the White House.Law enforcement sources told CBS News that the accused is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who entered the United States in 2021. Officials are still verifying all his details, and the motive remains unclear.Images shared online appeared to show the suspect being taken away in handcuffs after being shot and placed on a stretcher.“This is the man who opened fire on the National Guard just one day before Thanksgiving. He was taken away in handcuffs after being shot, stripped, and loaded onto a stretcher before being placed in an ambulance,"" an X user wrote, sharing the picture.The shooting happened on Wednesday afternoon when National Guard members were on “high-visibility patrols” near 17th Street and I Street NW.Police said the gunman came around a corner, raised a handgun, and fired directly at the two soldiers. Other Guard members nearby immediately responded.The White House and nearby federal buildings were briefly placed under lockdown. Mayor Muriel Bowser and FBI director Kash Patel said both soldiers are in critical condition. President Donald Trump confirmed that the suspect was also seriously injured.The FBI is treating the incident as a possible act of terrorism, and the case is being handled as an assault on federal officers. The Trump administration later ordered 500 additional National Guard troops to the city.","Rahmanullah lakanwal, a 29-year-old afghan national, is accused of shooting two national guard members near the white house.

NEW DELHI: The power tussle for the top post in Karnataka Congress turned ugly on Thursday with chief minister Siddaramaiah taking open potshots at his deputy DK Shivakumar. Hours after Shivakumar posted a cryptic message reminding Siddaramaiah and the Congress high command to ""keep one's word and walk the talk"", the chief minister has hit back using ""word play"" to target his deputy.Earlier today, Shivakumar in a post on X wrote, ""WORD POWER IS WORLD POWER. The biggest force in the world is to keep one’s word. Be it a judge, president or anyone else including myself, everyone has to walk the talk.

The chief minister used the same words to take potshots at his deputy.""A Word is not power unless it betters the World for the people.

The Congress party , including me, is walking the talk for our people with compassion, consistency, and courage.Our Word to Karnataka is not a slogan, it means the World to us,"" Siddaramaiah wrote on X.Siddaramaiah then went on to list the promises that he had fulfilled as the chief minister in his two tenures.This open social media ""word"" war between the two top state leaders marks a definite shift in their approach.

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Thursday accused the Congress of relying on social-media accounts operating from outside India to influence domestic political narratives, citing new location-tracking features on platform X. BJP MP and spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that several handles linked to Congress leaders and supporters appeared to be based in countries such as the United States, Ireland, Thailand, Pakistan and Bangladesh.Patra claimed that the location indicator on X shows Congress leader Pawan Khera’s account “is based in the United States”, while the Maharashtra Congress handle “is based in Ireland… although now they have changed it to India.” He added that the Himachal Congress account “is connected via Thailand Android app.”According to him, influencers such as Prateek Sinha (“Malaysia”), Alt News (“United States”) and Caravan India (“United States”) also appeared to have foreign-based accounts.He alleged that “several such accounts of Left and Congress influencers… are based in Pakistan, Bangladesh.”Patra accused the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi of attempting to incite civil war in the country, and appealing to foreign nations to intervene in the country's sovereign affairs.He called him “unfit” for politics urging for a total rejection of him.""...Rahul Gandhi goes abroad and speaks nonsense against the country. He tried his best to incite civil war in India. He went abroad and appealed to other countries that democracy had ended in India, and they must come and save us. He compares the RSS and BJP to the Muslim Brotherhood. His party says it will take to the streets and create a situation similar to that of Bangladesh and Nepal in India. He goes abroad and speaks against every constitutional organisation of India. .. The time has come to completely reject and sideline him. INDIA Alliance has now understood that it is not the Midas touch, but the sad touch... Whoever he touches is defeated by the sad touch... What happened in Uttar Pradesh?... What is happening in Bihar? In Karnataka, the game 'Kaun banega Mukhyamantri' is going on. Rahul Gandhi is unfit to be a politician. He is fit to inspire against India from foreign soil. There is a need to be cautious of Rahul Gandhi and Congress...""The Puri MP further said, “Rahul Gandhi not only speaks against India abroad or tries to create anarchy in the country with the help of Gen Z, but he has also delegated this task, with planning and design, to people sitting abroad. There is a division of work in the Congress, their people sitting all over the world, who are not Indian voters, are setting narratives in India.”He went on to describe the reason behind it is as three key narratives allegedly pushed through these handles, the first was “Vote Chori”, followed by attempts to suggest that “PM Modi and the security forces surrendered during Operation Sindoor,” which he claimed was amplified by “handles from Pakistan, West Asia, Bangladesh.” The third, he said, centered on “targeting the Sangh and PM Modi personally.”""... There are three major narratives set in India by these influencers on the instructions of Rahul Gandhi, Congress and the Left ecosystem. First is 'Vote Chori'. The second narrative is trying to show that PM Modi and the security forces surrendered during Operation Sindoor. Handles from Pakistan, West Asia, Bangladesh... were behind it... The third narrative is targeting the Sangh and PM Modi personally..."" he said.The BJP leader also claimed these accounts were behind the campaigns like ‘vote chor gaddi chhod’, and trying to demean Indian constitutional authorites on the global stage.""There are multiple examples of misleading tweets regarding 'Vote Chori'... When Indian institutions are being given chairmanships, Congress and its ecosystem are planning such conspiracies... Everything is in the public domain... These are fake accounts made by the Left-Congress ecosystem to demean India, to come to power and make Rahul Gandhi the Prime Minister one way or another... These people don't really exist. These are fake names and accounts. The narrative of 'Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhod' was being set in foreign countries... It is worrisome how far the Congress and its ecosystem can go..."" he said.Responding to Sambit Patra, Congress spokesperson and social media head Supriya Shrinate dismissed the allegations saying X has itself accepted some glitches in the product launch, and that she too has names of BJP handles operating from outside the country.Hitting back at the saffron party she called it an attempt to divert attention from the pressing issues, which she said were - ""vote-chori, astounding results in Bihar, deaths of BLO's invoved in SIR across the country, Arunachal and more.""“If I were to follow their logic, I could also produce a long list of BJP accounts that appear to operate from abroad. Pawan Khera has already clarified that he uses a VPN, so why make such a fuss? The fact is, X (Twitter) itself has stated that this was a technical glitch during a product launch, and the issue will be resolved gradually…”","Bjp accuses congress of relying on social-media accounts operating from outside india.

Explosive incidents deepen concerns across Pakistan



Security forces in Pakistan have killed at least 22 militants linked to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) during a major intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military said on Thursday.The raid was launched in Dera Ismail Khan after reports emerged about the presence of members of the group referred to by authorities as “Fitna Al-Khawarij”. According to the military, troops “effectively engaged at the hideout of the terrorists, and after an intense exchange of fire, 22 were eliminated”.Officials said a combing operation was continuing to ensure no other militants remained in the area.The operation came as the province witnessed another series of violent incidents targeting law enforcement. Overnight, militants armed with assault rifles opened fire on a police checkpoint in Hangu district, killing three officers before escaping. Officers returned fire, but it remained unclear whether the attackers suffered casualties, District Police Chief Khan Zeb said.A search effort to track down the assailants is ongoing, with investigators suspecting the Pakistani Taliban, who have been linked to similar assaults in recent years.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to the officers killed in Hangu, praising their “bravery and sacrifice” and noting that police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were playing a crucial role in countering militancy.The attack followed a deadly assault days earlier in Peshawar, where two suicide bombers and a gunman stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three officers and injuring 11.In addition to targeted attacks on security forces, civilians have also suffered from a rise in explosions across the country. In Balochistan’s Bolan district, three children were killed when an explosive device detonated outside their home on Wednesday. Police official Jan Mohammad Khosa said investigations were ongoing.Separately, two young men died in Bajaur district after an abandoned landmine exploded in the Jannat Shah area. The victims, identified as Shamshad, 18, and Usman, 22, were passing through when the device went off. Security teams cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to trace those responsible.Pakistan has experienced a marked surge in militant violence in recent years, with officials frequently blaming the TTP. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Afghanistan of allowing the group to operate from its territory, a claim Kabul denies, though tensions have remained high since 2021.","Police face deadly attacks amid rising militant activity in pakistan.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi said on Thursday that his govt is moving towards opening up the nuclear sector in the country for private sector investments on the lines of the space sector.“The scope of reforms is continuously expanding. Just as space innovation was opened to the private sector, India is now moving towards opening the nuclear sector as well,” Modi said while inaugurating Skyroot’s Infinity Campus in Hyderabad via video conferencing. “A strong role for the private sector is being laid in this field, which will create opportunities in small modular reactors, advanced reactors and nuclear innovation. This reform will give new strength to India’s energy security and technological leadership,” he said.The PM’s remarks came ahead of Parliament’s winter session in which a key nuclear energy bill proposing to open up the civil nuclear sector to private players is listed. The Atomic Energy Bill, 2025, is listed in the Lok Sabha bulletin for the session, which will start from Dec 1. Amendments to another key nuclear law, Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA), 2010, are also on the cards.These amendments, if successfully passed, will usher in big reforms in the nuclear sector at a time when India has set a target of generating at least 100 GW nuclear energy by 2047.At present, the Atomic Energy Act prohibits the participation of the private sector or even state govts. Under this law, the power to operate nuclear power plants is vested in the central govt and companies or corporations established by it. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), a PSU under the Department of Atomic Energy, is the only entity operating nuclear power plants, and currently operates all 24 commercial nuclear reactors in the country.Modi also said the future will depend greatly on the research being carried out today, and underscored that the govt is focused on providing maximum opportunities for youth in research. He underlined that the Rs 1 lakh crore Research, Development, and Innovation Fund will provide significant support to the youth. Modi said more than 10,000 Atal Tinkering Labs have already been set up to instil a spirit of research and innovation among students, and added that work is under way to establish 50,000 new labs in the coming days, he said.",Pm narendra modi said on thursday that his govt is moving towards opening up the nuclear sector in the country for private sector investments.

DKS vs Sidda: Shivakumar says ‘word power’ post misread; clarifies his remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dks-vs-sidda-shivakumar-says-word-power-post-misread-clarifies-his-remarks/articleshow/125621174.cms,"'All 140 MLAs Are Mine': DK Shivakumar Amid Karnataka CM Speculation; Siddaramaiah Responds

NEW DELHI: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Thursday clarified that his recent social media post on ""word power"" was meant to mark Constitution Day and was addressed to the legal fraternity after chief minister Siddaramaiah countered him thorough a social media post amid ongoing debate over leadership and political messaging.Speaking to reporters, Shivakumar explained the intent behind his post and said, ""Yesterday I was speaking on the our Constitution day. Whatever judges speak, whatever politicians speak, whatever is speak is very much important. I said that all you, all the advocates for all the advocate. I said when you speak you should be. When you convey the message, it should be very important.""His clarification followed a sharp exchange between the two senior leaders that played out publicly. On Wednesday, Shivakumar wrote on X that ""WORD POWER IS WORLD POWER. The biggest force in the world is to keep one’s word. Be it a judge, president or anyone else including myself, everyone has to walk the talk. Word power is world power."" Siddaramaiah responded later using similar phrasing to assert that the mandate belongs to the government for a full term, stressing he intends to complete five years in office.Shivakumar said his post was being read in a political context, but insisted the message was broader.He added, ""That is what I am telling. Whatever we speak in our world that is called Pratikna. That is the word our tongue. That is. I said word power is world power. Wherever in the world. Whatever you speak is very much important. Whatever you also tell in your media also tell. Your anchor also speak. Whether your reporter speak, that is important. That is the power.""The clarification came amid intensifying discussions over leadership transition in Karnataka after the Congress government completed two and a half years in office, a point at which Shivakumar’s supporters believe a rotational understanding from 2023 should take effect. While Siddaramaiah has consistently maintained his intent to serve a full five-year term, Shivakumar's recent remarks and online posts have been interpreted as renewed signalling of his claim to the post.The exchange marked a departure from previous months, where comments had largely come from supporters of both leaders rather than from the two principals themselves. The matter now rests with the Congress high command, as both sides await direction on whether the leadership question will be settled or deferred.","'all 140 mlas are mine': dk shivakumar amid karnataka cm speculation; siddaramaiah responds.

How Dylan Cease’s Contract Shifted the Pitching Market

Impact of the Cease Deal on Remaining Starters

Why a Padres Reunion Looks Less Likely

Why Michael King Makes Sense for the New York Mets

Key Reasons the Mets Could Target King

The New York Mets may be preparing to make their next major pitching move, with multiple predictions linking them to San Diego Padres right-hander Michael King. Following Dylan Cease’s massive seven-year, $210 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, the pitching market has shifted quickly - and King now sits near the top of the remaining options.While a reunion with San Diego isn’t impossible, current indications hint that King could be heading elsewhere. One notable projection from Will Laws of Sports Illustrated places the Mets as the expected landing spot, making this a storyline worth watching as free agency continues.The New York Mets have publicly signaled their intent to spend aggressively on starting pitching this offseason. With Cease off the board, they are evaluating the next tier of talent - and King, despite concerns about his recent injury, offers significant upside.King excelled in his first full year as a starter with the Padres and, when fully healthy, has pitched at a level comparable to top right-handers across the league. Even if signing him requires an overpay, the Mets appear willing to explore that avenue.Before suffering a midseason shoulder injury in 2025, King was producing at a borderline elite level.Will Laws described the challenge teams now face evaluating his health, writing: “King has shown he can be great, but he’s a high-upside player with a good amount of risk.” (H/t: Sporting News)That assessment captures the balance clubs must weigh: King’s ceiling is undeniable, but his timeline for returning to peak form remains the main question.Dylan Cease signing with the Blue Jays at $210 million over seven years reset expectations. Cease’s deal established a new benchmark at the top of the free-agent class, and teams looking for high-end arms now have diminishing choices.• Raised expectations for multi-year commitments• Increased urgency for teams still seeking frontline pitching• Elevated the market for players like King due to scarcity• Made a Padres reunion less certain given King’s value relative to riskFor King, Cease’s signing both clarified his tier and underscored why teams like the Mets must act quickly before other rotation targets fall off the board.Although King found success with the Padres and a return can never be entirely ruled out, current reporting suggests it isn’t the likeliest outcome. His injury came at a difficult moment - right as his free-agent value was peaking - and San Diego may prioritize other rotation avenues after allocating resources elsewhere.For the Mets, the question is simple: do they want to gamble on upside?• They have publicly stated they intend to spend on starting pitching• They need another top-end arm after recent departures• King’s peak performance fits the profile of a high-strikeout, durable starter (when healthy)• The market scarcity may push them toward players with risk but significant rewardIf King returns to his pre-injury form, the Mets would be landing a pitcher capable of performing at the top of their rotation without paying the absolute premium required for Cease.As the market continues to develop, Michael King stands out as one of the most intriguing high-upside pitchers left. With Dylan Cease’s deal shifting attention to the next group of starters, the Mets are well-positioned to make a strong push. Whether they ultimately secure him will come down to their comfort with his medical evaluations - and their willingness to outbid a Padres reunion attempt.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers considering major defensive shuffle if they land $186 Million ex-Toronto Blue Rays superstar Jon Conahan’s reporting underscores the precarious but promising nature of King’s free agency, making this one of the most compelling pitching decisions left this offseason.","The new york mets may be preparing to make their next major pitching move, with multiple predictions linking them to san diego padres right-hander michael king.

Candace Owens’ claims and the Macrons’ lawsuit





Candace Owens says her show will not come on air this week. She says she had to stop the show because she believes French President Emmanuel Macron tried to plan her murder. Candace Owens says she sent a report about this to the White House and to US counterterrorism teams. She also says these offices told her they got her report. These are her words, not confirmed by officials. She shared this update on X. She wrote that her show will be off the air and then said she wants people to know what is happening. Owens says someone close to the French first couple told her that Emmanuel Macron tried to organize the plan to kill her.Owens also says she thinks the Macrons were part of the plan to kill Charlie Kirk . Charlie Kirk was the founder of Turning Point USA. He was killed on September 10, 2025, while giving a speech at Utah Valley University. Owens says the Macrons did not act alone. She said that anyone who did not believe her can now wait for the President of the United States and US intelligence groups to make a statement. She says only then will people know if she is telling the truth.Candace Owens has also said before that Emmanuel Macron paid $1.5 million to hire someone to kill her. Again, these are her claims, and she has not shown public proof.Right now, Candace Owens is dealing with a lawsuit from Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron . They filed this lawsuit because Owens kept saying Brigitte Macron is secretly a man. The lawsuit says Owens posted an eight-part series where she claimed Brigitte Macron was born male, took another woman’s identity, and later had surgery to become female.The lawsuit says these claims are “demonstrably false” and that Candace Owens knew they were false. It says she still posted them to get more fame and attention. The Macrons say her words were meant to hurt them and their family. Their lawyers also say they asked her many times to stop, but she did not.The Macrons say they hope the lawsuit will end what they call a “campaign of defamation” and help set the record straight.Also Read: Candace Owens Recalls College Moment She Felt Feminism Was A Lie And Reveals The Class Blamed Men For All Problems",Candace owens says her show will not come on air this week.

Hasan Piker has pushed back strongly against Asmongold’s recent reaction video, where the OTK co-founder framed a few criticism comments from Hasan’s community as evidence that the streamer wasThe controversy began after Hasan’s China trip content resurfaced, including segments where he visited a traditional Chinese medicine clinic and attended horse races. These clips sparked limited backlash within his fanbase, mostly centered on concerns about animal cruelty linked to horse racing. However, Asmongold used those reactions to build a broader narrative that Hasan’s own audience washim, prompting the political commentator to respond publicly.In a stream addressing the situation, Hasan called the framing wildly overstated, saying Asmon’s conclusion was based on minimal evidence. He argued that the idea of his subreddit melting down or his community turning against him was inaccurate and exaggerated for content. According to Hasan, there wasof significance, and treating it as a widespread revolt proved how easily narratives can spiral when built around selective screenshots or out-of-context reactions.The exchange has reignited ongoing conversations about how creator drama is shaped by reaction clips, algorithmic incentives, and parasocial expectations from online audiences.At the core of the disagreement is how both streamers interpret the extent of fan criticism. Hasan’s China trip included segments filmed with local crews, such as his visit to a traditional Chinese medicine setting and a day at the horse races where he mentioned winning roughly $30,000. While some moderators and fans expressed discomfort, particularly regarding horse racing and ethical consistency, Hasan insists these reactions weren’t significant enough to justify anarrative. Asmongold, however, reacted to a clip suggesting otherwise, leaning into the notion that Hasan’s mods were inand his audience was turning on him.In his rebuttal, Hasan emphasized that such portrayals distort reality and perpetuate unnecessary drama, arguing that Asmon’s video inflated the situation far beyond what happened. For Hasan, the issue isn’t disagreement from fans but the way isolated criticism can be weaponized to push a storyline about his reputation.The situation highlights the tension between content creation and creator accountability, especially when reaction videos amplify small incidents into large-scale controversies. Hasan maintains the backlash was minimal, while Asmongold treated it as symptomatic of deeper issues. As the back-and-forth continues to draw attention, it underscores how easily narratives can escalate when fueled by selective clips and the pressure to deliver compelling commentary.Also Read: Who is the Burnt Peanut?

Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, opens up about how being sexually assaulted changed her thoughts



Dwyane Wade, the NBA legend, and his wife, Gabrielle Union , have always maintained a pretty private life, away from all the drama.A few months ago, Gabrielle Union had opened up about how she and Dwyane Wade divide their expenses equally at home. This had raised eyebrows and the popular actress finally opens up about the reasons behind it.A couple of months ago, Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, appeared on the popular podcast, “Balanced Black Girl”, where she opened up about the reason behind splitting expenses equally.The popular actress said, “I famously said, 50/50 or bust, right? And I meant that financially, spiritually and emotionally…”Gabrielle Union added, “It’s a trauma response… and 50/50 is, ‘I’m not going to be vulnerable enough to trust you with 100% of anything. Not my heart, not my cash.’”The Being Mary Jane actress continued, “It’s being vulnerable enough to be open enough to know that I’m OK. I’m OK as his wife…”She added, “He’s OK as my husband. I’m OK in this family. I’m OK in this home. I deserve it… and so, I’m trying to expand my heart, expand all of the notions of what vulnerability can look like.”Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, has always been public about her trauma of being sexually assaulted at a young age and going through many traumatic experiences in her early adulthood.It seems these horrific incidents has led Gabrielle Union to become very independent.In the same episode of the podcast, the actress admitted that, being “sexually assaulted at 19” and subsequently being “diagnosed with PTSD” led her to be “hyperfocused on efficiency and time” and “fiercely independent”.While Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union’s admission of splitting expenses equally had raised many eyebrows, the two have stayed away from the drama and have continued to focus on their lives and their young daughter, Kaavia Wade.The two had a pretty tough year with the NBA legend’s cancer diagnosis, but fortunately, everything worked out in their favor.Also Read: Stephen Curry's wife Ayesha Curry breaks silence with heartfelt note to him days after making controversial remarks about their marriage","Gabrielle union opens up about not being able to be vulnerable with dwyane wade.

Jenna Laine’s reminder about privilege reframes Andrews’ message for a much larger audience

In the NFL media ecosystem, conversations about demanding schedules, missed holidays, and constant travel are nothing new. But when longtime sideline reporter Erin Andrews recently opened up about the emotional toll of the job, her message, intended as advice for young professionals, ignited a wider debate about who truly bears the heaviest sacrifices. ESPN’s Jenna Laine became the most prominent voice in that discussion, not by dismissing Andrews’ experience, but by expanding the lens.Laine’s public response struck a chord because it redirected attention toward Americans working multiple low-wage jobs, military families stationed overseas, and those navigating far harsher realities than those inside professional sports. Her comments highlighted a rarely acknowledged truth: even in a high-pressure field like sports journalism, perspective matters just as much as perseverance.Jenna Laine’s post on X laid the groundwork for a larger cultural conversation. She wrote, “I appreciate what she’s trying to say, but let’s consider the folks working 2-3 jobs in retail, in warehouses, and in the service industry right now, just trying to make ends meet,” Her point wasn’t to diminish Andrews’ challenges, but to give voice to those who rarely appear in discussions about work-life balance.She even emphasized that “I totally wasn’t trying to single Erin out,” and instead wanted reporters to acknowledge their relative advantages.Still, Andrews’ message about needing genuine passion to survive the emotional grind remains meaningful. After nearly two decades covering everything from the World Series to the NFL Playoffs, she has lived the nonstop pace she warns young journalists about.Yet Andrews consistently uses her platform for more than career reflections. Her involvement in the NFL’s My Cause My Cleats campaign, where she honored an eight-year-old Sickle Cell patient named Bailey with custom lavender-and-pearl Nike Air Force 1s, shows her desire to elevate families facing unimaginable challenges.In many ways, the exchange between Andrews and Laine reflects the duality of modern sports media: a high-profile profession with real pressures, set against a world where countless people sacrifice far more without recognition. Their perspectives aren’t contradictory, but they’re complementary reminders of empathy, awareness, and using one’s platform for purpose.Also read: Erin Andrews explains why she chose to suffer in silence during her cervical cancer diagnosis while covering the NFL","Jenna laine’s reminder about privilege reframes erin andrews’ message for a much larger audience.
