Fakhar Zaman interview: Power hitting, playing role of mentor in ILT20, hitting sixes & more

NEW DELHI: Smriti Mandhana and Palash Muchhal ’s last public moment together now feels like a bittersweet memory — a joyful sangeet dance that has since taken on a different meaning. In November 2025, the couple performed to “Tenu Leke Main Jawanga” from Salaam-E-Ishq, smiling, laughing and celebrating with friends and family ahead of what was meant to be their wedding week. The video, which went viral, captured Smriti placing a garland around Palash as he twirled her into a romantic dance before serenading her with “Gulabi Aankhen”.Her India teammates, including Jemimah Rodrigues and Radha Yadav, added to the emotional evening with a performance on “Tera Yaar Hoon Main.”Their wedding, scheduled for November 23, was postponed after Mandhana’s father was hospitalised due to a heart ailment. While the celebrations paused, their online interactions appeared warm, leading many to believe the wedding would eventually take place.However, on Sunday, Mandhana announced on Instagram that the wedding had been officially called off.""I need to clarify that the wedding is called off. I would like to close this matter here and implore all of you to do the same,"" she wrote.""Over the past few weeks there has been plenty of speculation around my life and I feel it is important for me to speak out at this time,"" she said in an Instagram post.Calling herself a ""very private person"", Mandhana said the need to set the record straight compelled her to speak.She requested fans and the public to ""respect the privacy of both families"" and allow them the ""space to process and move on"".Mandhana, who is preparing for India's upcoming international season, said her focus remains firmly on cricket.""I believe there is a higher purpose driving us all and for me that has always been representing my country at the highest level. I hope to continue to play and win trophies for India for as long as possible,"" she said.Soon after Mandhana's post, Palash Muchhal issued his own statement, confirming that he had ""decided to move on"" and expressing anguish over what he described as baseless online chatter.""I have decided to move on in my life and step back from my personal relationship. It's been very difficult for me to see people react so easily on baseless rumours about something which has been most sacred to me.""It's the most difficult phase of my life and I will deal with it gracefully holding on to my beliefs,"" he wrote.He urged the public to reflect before amplifying unverified claims.""I truly hope we, as a society, learn to pause before judging someone based on unverified gossip, whose sources are never identified. Our words can wound in ways we may never understand,"" he added.Muchhal also said his team would take legal action against those spreading defamatory content.""My team will be taking strict legal action against those spreading false and defamatory content,"" he said, thanking those who had supported him with ""kindness"" during this period.Watch the video here The development comes days after singer Palak Muchhal, sister of Palash, spoke on the issue.Watch the video here Watch the video here ""I think the families have been through a very tough time... we would like to spread positivity as much as we can. We are also trying to stay strong,"" she had said.Mandhana, 28, has been a central figure in Indian women's cricket for nearly a decade, and her presence in the batting line-up has been crucial across formats. With India set for a busy 2026 calendar, the left-hander reiterated that her professional commitments remain her priority.""Thank you for all your support. It's time to move forward,"" her note concluded.","Smriti mandhana and palash muchhal's wedding has been officially called off. The couple performed a joyful sangeet dance in november 2025.

World's nuclear arsenal

In an era where global powers are flexing their nuclear muscles and dormant arsenals hum with renewed urgency, India stands at a perilous crossroads: should it reignite the fire of nuclear testing to assert its strategic sovereignty, or maintain the delicate restraint that has balanced diplomacy and deterrence for decades?The shadow of India's 1998 Pokhran-II tests still lingers, marked by geopolitical reverberations and economic sanctions. Yet today, with US President Donald Trump publicly accusing rival states like Pakistan and China of clandestine nuclear tests, India faces a high-stakes dilemma.India's nuclear journey began with its first nuclear test, code-named 'Smiling Buddha', in 1974, which stunned the world with a bold demonstration of atomic capability.However, there was then a long gap of 24 years before India conducted its next round of tests, the definitive Pokhran-II in 1998.Now, 27 years after that landmark moment, the clock ticks again — prompting a crucial question: Is it time for India to conduct another series of nuclear tests to secure its place amid a shifting geopolitical order? The answer may shape not just India's nuclear strategy, but the future stability of South Asia and its global standing.Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington, said that a resumption of US atomic tests would ""open the door for states with less nuclear testing experience to conduct full-scale tests that could help them perfect smaller, lighter warhead designs"".Joseph Rodgers, fellow at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said that states such as China or India stand to profit from a resumption of nuclear tests.“It makes more sense for them to test” than it does for the US or Russia, the two states that have conducted most atomic tests to date, Rodgers said.Ahead of his meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping in South Korea on October 29–30, 2025, Trump posted on social media that, because other countries were conducting nuclear tests, he had instructed the US military to begin testing nuclear weapons again on ""an equal basis"" with those nations, and that this process would ""commence immediately"".Trump's comments were interpreted by many as a sign the US was preparing to restart full-scale nuclear blasts for the first time since 1992.In an interview with 60 Minutes on CBS, Trump reiterated his position. ""I am saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes,"" Trump said when asked by if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years.""Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,"" he added. ""I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test,"" he said, adding North Korea and Pakistan to the list of nations allegedly testing their arsenals.Just days after Trump's remark, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified that America is not planning to conduct nuclear explosions.""These are not nuclear explosions,"" Wright told Fox News on Sunday. ""These are what we call sub-critical explosions."" But Wright, whose agency oversees testing, said people living in the Nevada desert should have ""no worries"" about seeing a mushroom cloud.""Americans near historic test sites such as the Nevada National Security Site have no cause for concern,"" Wright said. ""So we're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry, and they set up the nuclear explosion.""Sub-critical nuclear testing refers to experiments that involve nuclear materials like plutonium but use less than the amount necessary to start a chain reaction that would cause a nuclear explosion.No nuclear explosion occurs because the test does not achieve ""criticality,"" the point at which a self-sustaining nuclear reaction happens.These tests involve compressing or shocking small amounts of fissile material with high explosives to study how the material behaves under extreme conditions.Subcritical tests help scientists validate computer models and ensure the safety, security, and reliability of nuclear weapons without performing full nuclear detonations.They are usually done underground to contain any radioactive byproducts and prevent a nuclear blast.Countries like the US, Russia, and China use subcritical tests to maintain their nuclear stockpiles under international test bans like the CTBT.Thus, subcritical tests are a way to ""test"" the components of nuclear weapons at a small, safe scale without violating nuclear test bans or triggering nuclear explosions.Sub-critical nuclear tests are generally very low-yield and do not produce a nuclear explosion, so they release minimal energy and radiation. Because of this, subcritical tests are often difficult or impossible to detect by international monitoring systems like the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) International Monitoring System (IMS).The IMS uses seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound, and radionuclide stations to detect nuclear explosions worldwide. While it can detect all full-scale nuclear tests, the very low yield of subcritical tests—often below a threshold of about 1 kiloton equivalent—means they usually do not produce detectable seismic or atmospheric signatures. Radionuclide detectors also rely on gases released during an explosion, which do not occur in subcritical tests.Sub-critical tests are mostly not picked up by the IMS or satellite monitoring, making them effectively clandestine from the perspective of existing international nuclear test detection systems unless detected through other intelligence sources or on-site inspections after the CTBT enters into force.If India were to conduct a nuclear test today, it would reflect significantly evolved scientific, strategic, and geopolitical conditions compared to the 1998 Pokhran-II tests.The characteristics of a modern Indian nuclear test would likely include:The 123 Agreement, formally called the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement, is a bilateral pact signed in 2008 that allows civil nuclear trade and cooperation between India and the United States.It was a landmark deal that ended decades of nuclear isolation for India, enabling it to engage in global nuclear commerce despite not being a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The agreement requires India to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities, with civilian reactors subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards while retaining control of its nuclear weapons program.The 123 Agreement facilitates technology transfer, fuel supply, and nuclear commerce, strengthening India’s civilian nuclear energy capabilities and strategic partnership with the US.Per Article 14 of the 123 Agreement, should India conduct a nuclear test explosion, the United States holds the right to immediately terminate all nuclear cooperation. This has significant ramifications for India’s civilian nuclear energy expansion plans and international standing. Past statements by US policymakers, including former US president Barack Obama, emphasized pushing for India’s eventual ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) as part of broader nonproliferation goals.The 123 Agreement between India and the United States does not explicitly mention subcritical nuclear testing.The agreement is primarily focused on prohibiting ""nuclear explosive devices"" testing and maintaining a moratorium on nuclear testing as a condition for continued civil nuclear cooperation.Subcritical tests, which do not involve a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction or an actual nuclear explosion, typically fall outside the scope of what is conventionally defined as nuclear explosive testing.This nuance means subcritical tests are not explicitly banned under the 123 Agreement’s terms related to nuclear testing moratoriums.However, any full nuclear explosive test would constitute a breach, prompting the US to have the right to terminate cooperation and possibly impose sanctions.At present there are 9 countries (Russia, US, China, France, UK, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea) that possess nuclear weapons.These countries have roughly 12,331 nuclear warheads, with over 9,600 in active military stockpiles, according to the Federation of Atomic Scientists' 2025 Status of the Worlds Nuclear Forces.While this is a significant decline from the approximately 70,000 warheads owned by the nuclear-armed states during the Cold War, nuclear arsenals are expected to grow over the coming decade.Russia has the most confirmed nuclear weapons, with nearly 5,500 nuclear warheads. The US follows behind with 5,177 nuclear weapons. Total nuclear warheads owned by these 2 countries alone counts for nearly 90% of nuclear weapons in the world.Over 2,000 nuclear weapons tests have been carried out since 1945.The first nuclear device was detonated as a test by the United States at the Trinity site in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, with a yield approximately equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT.The largest nuclear weapon ever tested was the Tsar Bomba of the Soviet Union at Novaya Zemlya on October 30, 1961, with the largest yield ever seen, an estimated 50–58 megatons.","India's nuclear journey began with its first nuclear test, code-named 'smiling buddha', in 1974.

Indigo crisis enters seventh day





NEW DELHI: The aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu vowed in Rajya Sabha on Monday that the government will take “very, very strict action” against Indigo over the recent fiasco to ""set an example"" across the industry.Speaking during question hour, Naidu said the disruption was a result of IndiGo’s internal lapses. Blaming the carrier for failing to manage its crew and duty roster, the minister said, “We are not taking this situation easily. We are doing an inquiry. We will take very, very strict action not only for this situation but also as an example.""Responding to a query from Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, who sought to know whether the cancellations stemmed from a malfunction in the automatic message switching system (AMSS) - the glitch that hit flight operations in early November 2025 - Naidu clarified that the two incidents were unrelated. The IndiGo crisis, he said, arose from “anomalies and mismanagement” in the airline’s crew roster system.The minister also outlined the timeline of the revised flight duty time limitations (FDTL), introduced after a high court order in April 2025. Of the 22 guidelines, 15 were implemented on July 1 and the remaining seven on November 1. He stressed that multiple consultations were held with all stakeholders, including IndiGo, and that the rules had to be followed “without any compromise on safety.”Naidu said the directorate general of civil aviation has been in continuous discussions with airlines since FDTL came fully into force, and had granted limited exemptions based on operational variations and safety assessments.Noting that the crisis erupted “almost one whole month” after the final phase of FDTL implementation, he pointed out that IndiGo did not flag any imminent issues during a meeting with the ministry on December 1.“This is a day-to-day operation - something that Indigo should have maintained. Indigo was supposed to manage the crew, roaster through its day-to-day operations,” he said.Reiterating that accountability is non-negotiable, Naidu added: “If there is any mis-compliance, non-compliance, non-adherence for any single person, entity and organisation, or any operator functioning in this civil aviation, we will take very, very strict action so that we set an example in the industry.”Indigo’s operational crisis entered into its seventh consecutive day of chaos on Monday. With more 500-large scale flight cancellations continuing across major airports.According to the civil aviation ministry, IndiGo is scheduled to operate 1,802 flights across 137 of its 138 destinations on Monday. The ministry also said the airline has already returned around 4,500 misplaced bags to passengers and aims to deliver the remaining 4,500 within the next 36 hours.Separately, the Supreme Court refused to entertain a petition seeking judicial intervention over the large-scale flight cancellations, noting that the matter did not warrant its involvement at this stage.(With inputs from agencies)",'will set an example': indigo faces heat as aviation minister promises tough action in rajya sabha.indigo crisis enters seventh day of chaos with more 500-large scale flight cancellations.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Monday issued a strong-worded message asked China to issue assurance to India after the recent harassment of an Arunachal Pradesh woman at Shanghai airport.The statement follows growing concerns over arbitrary checks and mistreatment of Indian passengers in transit, after reports emerged of an Arunachal Pradesh woman being harassed at Shanghai airport.Responding to the matter, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We expect the Chinese authorities to provide assurances that Indian citizens transiting through Chinese airports will not be selectively targeted, arbitrarily detained or harassed and that regulations governing international air travel would be respected by the Chinese side.""""We have stated many times that Arunachal Pradesh is and will remain an integral part of India, and we do not want any interference in it,"" Jaiswal added.On the China-India relationship, Jaiswal said, ""...This relationship is gradually moving in a positive direction, and we want to keep it moving in that direction.""The MEA also issued an advisory urging Indian nationals to be cautious. ""MEA would advise Indian nationals to exercise due discretion while travelling to China or transiting through the country,"" Jaiswal stated.Ministry of external affairs last month after the incident strongly protested China’s “arbitrary detention” of an Indian passport holder from Arunachal Pradesh at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, stating that no amount of political denial will alter the fact that the northeastern state is an “integral and inalienable” part of India.The ministry of external affairs said it issued a strong demarche to Beijing and its embassy in New Delhi after the woman, identified as Prema Wangjom Thongdok, was detained during transit despite being eligible for visa-free passage under Chinese regulations.“We want to say that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and this is a fact that is self-evident. No amount of denial by the Chinese side is going to change this indisputable reality,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.According to the MEA, the Indian national, holding a valid passport, was travelling onward to Japan when she was stopped at Shanghai airport. India said the detention lacked legal basis and breached norms of international travel.“This issue has been taken up strongly with the Chinese side. Chinese authorities have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel,” Jaiswal said. He added that China’s actions contradicted its own policy for visa-free transit.The MEA warned that such incidents undermine diplomatic engagement between the two countries. “Arbitrary actions by China involving an Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh are most unhelpful towards efforts being made by both sides to build mutual trust and understanding and gradually move towards normalisation of bilateral relations,” Jaiswal noted.However, China has rejected India’s accusations. Responding to Beijing-based media, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that “the lawful rights and interests of the person concerned were fully protected and no compulsory measures were taken on her,” dismissing claims of detention or harassment.This response came despite the Indian citizen narrating her “long ordeal”, alleging that Chinese immigration officials “mocked and raised questions” about her Indian identity, with the situation resolved only after intervention by Indian missions in Shanghai and Beijing.",The statement follows growing concerns over arbitrary checks and mistreatment of indian passengers in transit.

He added that “democracy and Pakistan don’t go together,” as concerns deepen over the country’s weakening democratic institutions.""We keep a close eye on every development in Pakistan. But regarding democracy, you're saying that democracy in Pakistan is becoming weak and its strengths are being weakened. Democracy and Pakistan don't go together,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.Jaiswal added that India is aware of reports of border clashes with Pakistan that killed several Afghan civilians and “strongly condemns attacks on innocent people,” reaffirming India’s support for Afghanistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence.In connection to anti-terror discussions, Jaiswal also highlighted the 21st meeting of the India-US Counter-Terrorism Working Group, held on December 3. “Both sides attach high importance to counter-terrorism cooperation. It is an important element of our comprehensive global strategic partnership with the United States,” he said.He noted that the two countries strongly condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Pahalgam and Delhi, and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation against terrorism through platforms such as the UN, the Quad, the Financial Action Task Force, and other forums.""The two sides renewed their commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation in the fields of terrorism, including at the UN, within the format of Quad, as well as in the format of Financial Action Task Force and several other multilateral forums where we discuss and continue to discuss these aspects,"" Jaiswal added.At the meeting, India and the United States pressed for tougher UN actions against Pakistan-based terror groups, seeking additional punitive measures such as asset freezes and arms embargoes on Lashkar-e-Taiba , Jaish-e-Mohammad, their proxy outfits, and their backers.They also called for further designations of ISIS and al-Qaida affiliates under the UN sanctions regime. Although these groups are already listed and subject to existing restrictions, both sides stressed the need to broaden and intensify global pressure on them.During the talks, India thanked the US State Department for designating The Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy, as both a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). The designation followed the group’s claim of responsibility for the Pahalgam terror attack ""The two sides called for additional designations of ISIS and al-Qa'ida affiliates, and LeT and JeM and their proxy groups, supporters, sponsors, financiers and backers, under the UN 1267 sanctions regime, ensuring their members face a global asset freeze, travel ban and arms embargo,"" the statement by MEA read.","""we keep a close eye on every development in pakistan.

IndiGo outlines ‘preliminary factors’ behind disruption



NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Monday replied to the DGCA’s show-cause notice, saying it is “realistically not possible to pinpoint the exact cause(s)” immediately due to the complexity and scale of its operations. The response addressed the recent large-scale operational disruptions and flight cancellations across the airline’s network.The reply by the airline’s chief executive officer and chief operating officer, was submitted, with the airline requesting additional time to complete a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA).""The airline notes that the DGCA’s manual allows a fifteen-day response timeline for show-cause notices, suggesting more time is needed to conduct a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA). The complete RCA will be shared once finished,"" the statement read.In its submission, IndiGo expressed that it is “profusely apologetic” and deeply regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers. The airline attributed the disruptions to the “compounding effect of multiple factors,” which coincided in an “unfortunate and unforeseeable confluence.”The DGCA had earlier granted a one-time 24-hour extension to IndiGo respond to its showcause notice, setting the new deadline at 6 pm on Monday.The regulator warned that failure to meet the deadline would lead to the matter being decided ex-parte.The notice cited “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management” as the primary reasons behind the airline’s large-scale operational failure.Preliminary factors cited by IndiGo included minor technical glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system, and challenges arising from the implementation of updated crew-rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitation Phase II). The airline added that it had been engaging with the DGCA regarding difficulties in implementing FDTL Phase II and had sought variations, exemptions, or extensions.IndiGo said the disruptions began in early December when these factors collectively affected crew availability and on-time network performance. To manage the situation, the airline carried out a network ""reboot” on 5 December, involving a large number of cancellations to recover stranded passengers, ease airport congestion, and reposition crew and aircraft. Services began normalizing from 6 December onwards.The airline also stated that it provided timely notifications and assistance to passengers, including meals, refreshments, hotels, and local transport, in line with DGCA requirements. Substantial refunds have reportedly been processed for most affected customers.The DGCA is currently examining IndiGo’s response and said that enforcement action, if deemed necessary, will be taken in due course.The current disruption is linked to the implementation of revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules for pilots, which impose longer weekly rest periods, stricter night duty limits, and reduced night landings.Initially opposed by domestic carriers including IndiGo and Air India, the rules were phased in during July and November following Delhi High Court directions. IndiGo has obtained temporary relaxations for the second phase of the norms until February 10.IndiGo’s operational crisis entered its seventh day on Monday, with over 500 flights cancelled across major airports, leaving thousands of passengers stranded across the country.",Indigo on monday replied to the dgca’s show-cause notice.

The Battle Pakistan Lost To India Days Before 1971 War | I Witness

NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on December 5, the third day of the 1971 war, underscoring how air power proved decisive in shaping the conflict’s outcome and paving the way for India’s victory and the creation of Bangladesh.In a post on X, the IAF recalled its strike on the Sakesar radar station, which crippled Pakistan’s key western air defences for two days.“On the third day of the 1971 war, the IAF was everywhere the enemy looked — and many places where they didn’t expect. Hunters tore through Drigh Road and Karachi, smashing storage hangars. Canberras kept up relentless pressure, delivering 1,44,000 lbs of ordnance across four major airfields,” the post said.The IAF added that 132 missions were flown on the western front, with An-12s and Canberras “raining devastation on enemy concentrations.” On the eastern front, with the Pakistan Air Force effectively grounded, 104 offensive sorties by the IAF cleared the way for the Indian Army’s rapid march into East Pakistan, ultimately leading to the birth of Bangladesh.It also recalled the legendary Battle of Longewala, fought from December 4 to 7, 1971, in Rajasthan’s Longewala sector, where heavily outnumbered Indian troops held their ground against a major Pakistani assault — a defence in which the IAF also played a crucial role.“Four Hunters rewrote history — shattering an enemy armoured thrust and leaving 27 tanks destroyed and 10 more damaged. Jaisalmer stood safe because air power arrived when it mattered,” the post highlighted.The 1971 India–Pakistan war began on December 3 with Pakistan launching pre-emptive strikes on Indian air bases amid the Bangladesh Liberation War in East Pakistan. The conflict ended on December 16 with Pakistan’s defeat, the surrender of 93,000 troops — the largest military capitulation since World War II — and the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation.","The indian air force (iaf) on thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on december 5, the third day of the 1971 war.

DGCA may scale down IndiGo ops to make room for others

NEW DELHI: IndiGo may have its schedule cut by 5% and the same - roughly about 110 daily flights - could be given to other airlines that have the resources to add capacity. A livid government is mulling incremental cuts to the schedule starting with 5%, followed by another 5% in coming days if need be, say sources, adding that other actions are also being considered in the wake of the severe disruptions caused by flight cancellations.Meanwhile, a ""profusely apologetic"" IndiGo has in its reply to the DGCA's show-cause notice blamed a combination of five factors, including new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules and winter schedule-related changes, for its massive flight disruptions.The airline said given the scale of its operations, it is ""realistically not possible to pinpoint the exact cause(s)"" in the time given. It sought more time for a ""comprehensive root-cause analysis"", citing DGCA's manual that allows a 15-day response time.DGCA is in the process of examining the response and enforcement action as deemed appropriate will be taken in due course,"" the aviation ministry said regarding the responses submitted at 6.01pm Monday by CEO Pieter Elbers and COO Isidre Porqueras, who is also the accountable manager.Given the public anger at aviation authorities, it remains to be seen whether IndiGo will be granted more time. The DGCA could now scale down IndiGo's flights in proportion to its crew strength and make the slots available to other airlines depending on their resource availability.Apart from a hefty financial penalty, the top executives, who are approved by the DGCA, including the airline's accountable manager (the COO), may face action. The airline, too, may either seek resignations or sack key people seen as responsible for the huge mess.The airline has attributed the disruption to the ""compounding effect of multiple factors which coincided in lesser or greater measure"" in an ""unfortunate and unforeseeable confluence"". It listed these as minor technical glitches; schedule changes linked to the start of the winter season; adverse weather conditions; increased congestion in the aviation system; and implementation of and operation under the updated crew rostering rules (FDTL phase II) that came into force on Nov 1, 2025.""IndiGo notes they had been engaging with the DGCA regarding challenges in implementing FDTL phase II and were seeking variations, exemptions or extensions. The disruptions began in early Dec when the compounding factors resulted in a lower on-time network performance, which affected crew availability,"" the aviation ministry said.IndiGo termed the Dec 5 large-scale cancellations, when over 1,000 IndiGo flights - almost half its daily schedule - were affected, as a ""drastic measure"" of ""rebooting"" the network ""to recover stranded customers, ease airport congestion, and reposition crew/aircraft"".Meanwhile, the four-member DGCA panel probing IndiGo disruption, headed by joint DG Sanjay Brahamane, could summon CEO Pieter Elbers and COO Isidre Porqueras. This panel has been mandated to pinpoint the root cause of this disruption and will examine manpower planning, rostering and IndiGo's preparedness to implement the new FDTL rules.","Indigo may have its schedule cut by 5% and the same - roughly about 110 daily flights - could be given to other airlines.

Texas shake-up: Jasmine Crockett enters Senate battle — is Trump critic the right pick for Democrats?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-shake-up-jasmine-crockett-enters-senate-battle-is-trump-critic-the-right-pick-for-democrats/articleshow/125853616.cms,"Is she a right choice?







Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett on Monday formally launched her bid for a Texas Senate seat at an event in Dallas, ending months of speculation.She will face state lawmaker James Talarico in the Democratic primary, whose fundraising and faith-first message have turned heads in the party.Crockett announced her Senate campaign at the Dallas event, drawing parallels between her effort and Barack Obama’s upstart 2008 presidential campaign.Her campaign played a video at the event featuring President Trump repeatedly referring to Crockett as a ""low-IQ person.""Her announcement came just hours after Texas Democrat Colin Allred said he was dropping out of the Senate race and would instead run for a US House seat.Democrats are aiming to oust long-serving Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) in next year’s midterms, Axios reported.Her bid came at the time when Court has accepted Texas’ redrawn congressional maps, which leave three Dallas-area House Democrats with just two Democratic-leaning districts to run in.The US Supreme Court last week ruled that Texas may use its new map, which adds five Republican-leaning seats, for the 2026 midterms.Allred said Monday that he would run for the redrawn 33rd congressional district.As soon as her name got locked for the Texas Senate seat, several critics felt that she’s made what was already a difficult task even harder.Crockett heads into the primary as a strong favorite, bolstered by national name recognition and firm progressive bona fides — assets that could give her an edge over Talarico in the Democratic race. But those same strengths may prove trickier in a general election, where Democrats will have to win over a much wider swath of Texas voters, NBC reported.Republican Senator John Cornyn’s campaign released a video on the social media platform X over the weekend attacking Representative Jasmine Crockett’s record and urging her to run for the US Senate.Republicans have already been goading her to run, viewing her as a manageable opponent in a general election.Cornyn had posted “Run Jasmine, run!” on X back in July. His campaign’s weekend video opened with a narrator saying, “From open borders to socialist economics to unhinged attacks on anyone who disagrees, Jasmine Crockett isn’t representing Texas. She’s representing the far-left fringe.”The video highlighted some of Crockett’s controversial comments, including saying that “it is not a criminal violation to enter the country illegally”; labelling GOP Governor Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, as “Gov. Hot Wheels”; and criticising Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., as a “bleach blonde bad built butch body.”On Monday, responding to news that Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett was entering the GOP nomination race for the U.S. Senate, Cornyn called her “radical, theatrical and ineffective.”“As the GOP nominee for US Senate, our campaign will make sure every Texas voter knows how absurd her candidacy is, and in the process provide up-ballot support to down-ballot Republicans, including the five new congressional seats that President Trump has made a priority,” Cornyn said, referring to the redrawn House seats.Cornyn told reporters that he did not have a preference for a Democratic opponent, saying of Crockett and her rival, Marc Talarico, “I think both of them are flawed candidates, and so I’d be happy to run against either one of them.”Attorney General Ken Paxton also released a statement dubbing the congresswoman “Crazy Jasmine Crockett” and predicting she would lose a general election.“The announcement is likely extremely upsetting for John Cornyn, who counts Jasmine Crockett as one of his best friends,” Paxton said. “Cornyn even went so far as to call Jasmine Crockett his ‘dance partner,’” Paxton added, referring to Cornyn’s comments last year to the Texas Tribune about working with Crockett on legislation.Crockett has said her campaign has conducted polling showing her in a strong position. “The data says that I can win,” Crockett said in an MS NOW interview after the Thanksgiving holiday, saying she can build a coalition of “Black and brown” voters.","Representative jasmine crockett formally launched her bid for a texas senate seat at an event in dallas.

Donald Trump backs Roger Clemens before vote, but Hall of Fame voters stand firm

Roger Clemens was left out of the Baseball Hall of Fame once again, even after public support from Donald Trump. On Saturday night, December 6, 2025, Donald Trump posted a long message on Truth Social asking voters to induct Roger Clemens. The very next day, Sunday, December 7, the Hall of Fame committee released its results. Roger Clemens did not get enough votes.Barry Bonds also failed to make the cut. Jeff Kent ended up as the only player elected in this voting round. The result quickly upset many baseball fans, who shared their anger across social media.Donald Trump posted his message just one day before the Baseball Hall of Fame committee announced its decision.Writing on Truth Social, Trump called Roger Clemens “one of the greatest pitchers of all time.” He highlighted Clemens’ 354 career wins, seven Cy Young Awards, and six World Series appearances.Trump also pointed out that Roger Clemens never failed a drug test and was cleared in a federal case after testifying before Congress in 2008. “Rumors and innuendo kept him out,” Trump wrote, urging voters to “do the right thing.”Despite the appeal, the committee did not change its view. To enter the Hall of Fame, players needed at least 12 votes. Roger Clemens received fewer than five.Barry Bonds also failed to reach the minimum. Jeff Kent was named on 14 of the 16 ballots, making him the only inductee this time.Roger Clemens played 24 seasons in Major League Baseball, starring for the Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, and New York Yankees. He won two World Series titles with the Yankees and threw two famous 20-strikeout games, one in 1986 and another ten years later.Still, his career remains tied to baseball’s steroid era. Roger Clemens was named in the 2007 Mitchell Report, which investigated steroid use in Major League Baseball.Former trainer Brian McNamee claimed he injected Clemens between 1998 and 2001. Former teammates also made similar claims. Clemens has always denied all accusations.After the vote, fans reacted strongly online. One post said the Hall of Fame “lost its meaning” by keeping out Clemens and Bonds. Another fan wrote that honoring only one player was “embarrassing” for the sport.The decision and the reactions were widely discussed on platforms like X and Instagram, showing that Roger Clemens’ Hall of Fame debate is far from over.Also Read: “White House Is On”: Conor McGregor Calls Out Islam Makhachev As He Aims For The UFC 170-Pound Welterweight Belt Next","Roger clemens was left out of the baseball hall of fame once again, even after public support from donald trump.

Washington’s tight end Zach Ertz took a “dirty hit” from Minnesota Vikings safety Jay Ward on his right knee

Early signs say a serious injury

With just over two minutes left in the third quarter, Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz soared for a high pass from backup quarterback Marcus Mariota on second-and-11. Launching himself skyward, the H-back missed the ball and took a brutal hit on his right knee from Minnesota Vikings safety Jay Ward.The impact sent Ertz tumbling over Ward in a chaotic, uninvited somersault. He remained on the turf for several minutes as trainers rushed to his side. When he tried to sit up, his right leg refused to support him, and he could not put any weight on it.The viral video captures Ertz’s knee snapping back with sickening elasticity after Ward’s helmet hits him. He clutched his right knee and was soon carted off the gridiron, a towel hiding his face as raw emotion took over: pain, frustration, and perhaps the dread of a season cut short. On the sideline, Mariota offered comfort while Ertz’s right leg, now braced, signaled the end of his night as he was ruled out in the fourth quarter.Chad Ryan, reporting on the Commanders from half a world away, posted the gut-wrenching footage of Ertz's injury on X. He described the moment as a “dirty hit” by Jay Ward that left Zach Ertz crumpled on the field, needing help from trainers to leave: “This is a dirty hit by Jay Ward (#24 Vikings) that has left Zach Ertz down on the field and needing assistance from the trainers to leave the field.No place for this on the football field. Disgusting play.”Ryan later shared another video showing the veteran tight end being carted off, his emotions raw and visible. If this marks the end of Ertz's career, he leaves as a true legend, ranked fifth all-time in receptions among NFL tight ends: “Heartbreaking. Zach Ertz, after taking a dirty hit to his knees by Jay Ward, visibly emotional on the cart. If that's the end of his career, he goes out a true legend, with the 5th most receptions by a Tight End in NFL history. ”NFL Insider Adam Schefter revealed that Commanders head coach Dan Quinn fears tight end Zach Ertz may have suffered a torn ACL, with tests set to confirm the extent of the injury. “Early signs say a serious injury,” Quinn told reporters. “This guy is one hell of a competitor in every way. To see frustration and emotion with that, all of us are feeling that.”Ertz, a cornerstone of the team, has inspired teammates and coaches alike with his relentless drive and professionalism. Fellow Commanders tight end John Bates said, “It breaks my heart when you see a great one like him, an all-time great [get hurt]. He does everything the right way, the way things should be done. He’s just a pro’s pro.”In the 2025 season, he tallied 50 catches for 504 yards, averaging 10.1 yards per reception, scoring four touchdowns, and losing the ball just once over 13 games.","Washington commanders tight end zach ertz was carted off the field in the third quarter.

Claims of a disturbing message prompt scrutiny over loyalty and silence

Who Stood To Benefit From Charlie Kirk's Assassination? | Candace Ep 276





Allegations surrounding the reported final hours of political commentator Charlie Kirk have sparked a storm of speculation, and Candace Owens is at the center of it. On her show, she claimed that multiple people connected to Turning Point USA (TPUSA) were aware that Kirk believed he was in danger before he died.The statement has unsettled supporters and critics alike, not only because of the seriousness of the claim, but because of the silence Owens says has followed it. As the public awaits answers, her comments have ignited a wider discussion about loyalty, money, and secrecy in powerful political circles.Owens stated that the information was passed to her by someone inside TPUSA and involved a late-night warning Kirk allegedly sent the night before his death. “What I can tell you is we also received a tip from somebody within Turning Point USA that the night before he died, I know for a fact, he messaged a donor and he messaged somebody at Turning Point USA.”She then revealed the most shocking part of the tip: “But I did not know, and this is what was told to me, that he also messaged Dan Flood, the security that's to his right, and allegedly, explicitly said that they are going to kill me tomorrow.”Owens emphasized that several people, including a donor and TPUSA members, allegedly knew Kirk feared he would be murdered. Yet, according to her, none of them have stepped forward with public statements. She challenged this silence, calling it a “massive question mark” and questioning whether fear, loyalty, or money is keeping people quiet.Her closing words suggested that the root of the silence may run deeper than personal loyalty. “And what we can say for certain is, of course, people will betray one another if money is on the line. It could be for 30 pieces of silver, or it could be for billions. But things get complicated when there's a lot of money on the line.”As the mystery deepens, Owens’ claims have placed TPUSA under intense scrutiny and the public is demanding answers that no one has yet been willing to give.Also Read: Candace Owens reignites explosive France controversy after reposting viral “terrorist state” claim","Candace owens claims charlie kirk warned of his impending death to a donor and tpusa staff the night before he died.
