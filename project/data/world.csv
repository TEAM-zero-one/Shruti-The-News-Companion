NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday linked the recent surge in terrorist activities in the Jammu region to the redeployment of army personnel to Ladakh amid Chinese incursions .He suggested that this strategic shift had created an opening for terrorist groups to exploit the security gap.Abdullah made these remarks while visiting the families of four police personnel—Balvinder Singh, Tariq Ahmad, Jaswant Singh and Jagbir Singh—who were killed in an encounter with infiltrating terrorists in Kathua’s Safiyan forest on Thursday.Two Pakistani terrorists, suspected to be from the banned Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), were also killed in the operation.Speaking to reporters, Abdullah said that encounters and terrorist attacks in the Jammu region were not new but had increased in the past three to four years. He attributed this to the military’s focus on countering Chinese incursions in Ladakh, which led to a redeployment of forces from Jammu.""When the Chinese army made an incursion into Ladakh, we needed an army to counter them. We could not remove troops from the valley, so those stationed in Jammu were sent to Ladakh, resulting in a security gap. That shortage is now being addressed,"" Abdullah stated.Abdullah stressed the need for better counter-terror strategies to prevent further loss of life. ""We must control militancy in such a way that the martyrdom of our people is stopped forever,"" he said.He also expressed gratitude for the bravery of the police officers who intercepted the terrorists before they could cause further harm. ""Had they not been stopped, I don’t know what destruction they would have caused. Our four brave officers sacrificed their lives, but many innocent lives have been saved due to their timely action,"" he said.Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir deputy CM Surinder Choudhary blamed Pakistan for orchestrating violence in the region, urging it to abandon its ""terrorism policy.""""Conspiracies hatched from across the border are killing our children. They (Pakistan) have been doing this for over 30 years but have achieved nothing. J&K and India will not weaken due to terrorism,"" Choudhary said during the wreath-laying ceremony of fallen head constable Jagbir Singh in Jammu, as per PTI.Choudhary further said that terrorism could not break the unity of J&K’s diverse communities. ""Our brotherhood is strong, and nobody can break it, whatever their efforts,"" he asserted.Security forces continue their search operation in the Kathua region to track and neutralise any remaining terrorists. Authorities have assured that the compensation cases for the slain officers will be addressed after Eid.",Jammu and kashmir chief minister omar abdullah linked the recent surge in terrorist activities in the jammu region to the redeployment of army personnel to ladakh.

NEW DELHI: The Congress party staged a protest march in Jammu on Saturday, criticising the Central government's handling of rising terrorism in the Jammu region. The march, which started from Panjtirthi and concluded at Parade Chowk, was prompted by the recent loss of four police personnel in a two-day encounter with terrorists in Kathua district. The attack, which began on Thursday, led to the deaths of two Pakistani terrorists and left four Jammu and Kashmir Police officers dead.Congress leaders, including Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee working presidents Tara Chand and Raman Bhalla, led the march. Protesters voiced their frustration not only with the surge in terrorism but also with the delayed restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir, a longstanding demand.Tara Chand expressed deep sorrow over the loss of security personnel and condemned the government’s inability to maintain peace. He called for immediate action to prevent further loss of life and stressed that the restoration of statehood was essential for the region’s progress. He emphasised that the people of Jammu and Kashmir deserve a peaceful environment, job opportunities, and the full protection of their rights.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari on Friday wrote to external affairs minister S Jaishankar urging him to prevent future foreign visits by chief minister Mamata Banerjee in her official capacity. Adhikari accused Banerjee of undermining India on the international stage and bringing shame to the country during her recent visit to the United Kingdom.In his letter, Adhikari claimed that Banerjee’s remarks in London displayed ""devotion and admiration for the colonial masters,"" which he described as ""unthinkable"" for a Bengali. He cited her speech at a business event in the UK, where she said, ""I love UK because we have an emotional relation, historical relation... From the heritage point of view, ours and from yours also. 190 years, you ruled in India. You ruled Bengal... So we forget that? Always India remembers you, and Bengal also remembers you.""Adhikari condemned her remarks, saying that Bengal had been at the forefront of the independence movement, resisting British rule. He said that praising the colonial past amounted to ""public renunciation of the sacrifices made by our freedom movement revolutionaries.""The letter also criticised Banerjee for her statements at Oxford University's Kellogg College, where she appeared to ""downplay"" India’s economic growth. When a speaker highlighted that India had overtaken the UK as the world's fifth-largest economy and was projected to become the largest by 2060, Banerjee disagreed, saying, ""I will differ that.""Adhikari called her response ""simply treasonous"" and an ""embarrassment for every Bengali and Indian."" He alleged that Banerjee had ""deliberately tarnished India’s reputation on foreign soil"" and accused her of opposing the country's economic rise.The BJP leader further urged the external affairs ministry to conduct a ""thorough probe"" into her remarks and ensure she is not granted permission for official foreign visits in the future. He referenced existing guidelines that require the ministry of external affairs to approve such visits and suggested that her remarks should be considered grounds for disqualification.Banerjee's visit to the UK was marred by controversy, as she faced protests from a group of demonstrators at Kellogg College. Protesters held placards questioning her stance on election violence in West Bengal and the RG Kar College case. BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a video of the incident, criticising Banerjee for her comments on India's economic future. ""West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has a problem with India becoming the world's largest economy... This is truly shameful,"" he posted on X.Union minister Giriraj Singh also slammed Banerjee, saying, ""Hiding the truth and insulting India, both are done by Mamata Banerjee. Today, the whole world is seeing and respecting our growing economy, but unfortunately, when Mamata Banerjee and the 'tukde-tukde gang' go abroad, they insult India. This is unfortunate.""Banerjee, however, responded to hecklers during her speech, saying, ""Please don’t do politics here on this stage. That you can do with me in my state, not here."" She also defended her government regarding the RG Kar College case, stating, ""The case is sub-judice, also, it is with the Central government, not with us.""","West bengal leader of the opposition suvendu adhikari wrote to external affairs minister s jaishankar urging him to prevent future foreign visits by chief minister mamata banerjee in her official capacity.

Elon Musk's message for protesters: 'We are going to go after them'



Tesla protesters have called for a global day of action against the company and its CEO Elon Musk today as hundreds of demonstrations are going to take place across the country and also outside. More than 200 protests are planned at Tesla locations in the country today in a statement against Elon Musk and his interference in the government. ""No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts,"" the website of Tesla Takedown said.Many democratic leaders are supporting the Tesla Takedown, which they call a non-violent protest against Elon Musk's company but hundred of vehicles, showrooms and other properties have been attacked, set on fire in the past few days leading up to the major Tesla Takedown day on March 29.The Donald Trump administration has stood strongly beside Elon Musk and the government said that people arrested for arson and vandalizing Tesla properties will be charged with domestic terrorism.Elon Musk has spoken about the ongoing protests several times. ""Stop being psycho,"" Elon Musk said, addressing the protesters at an all-hands meeting of Tesla. In a more recent interview with Fox News, Elon Musk said he thinks that a great wrong is being done to the people of Tesla and its customers. He said Tesla is a peaceful company but these protesters are shooting guns, fire bombing, issuing death threats to him and other company staff.But he said that the real problem is not the vandalizing of Tesla properties but the people who are pushing the propaganda. He said the protesters are being fed some propaganda and they are believing it.

Indian-origin FBI chief Kash Patel shares article on how Hindu upbringing shaped his worldview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-fbi-chief-kash-patel-shares-article-on-how-hindu-upbringing-shaped-his-worldview/articleshow/119425093.cms,"Kashyap “Kash” Patel, the Indian-origin lawyer and recently appointed FBI Director under Donald Trump , has publicly embraced his cultural roots, sharing an article on social media that highlights how his Hindu upbringing has shaped his worldview, values, and leadership style. The post, which has since gone viral among Indian-American and pro-MAGA circles, provides a rare glimpse into the personal convictions of a man more often known for his takedowns of the so-called deep state.The article traces Patel’s journey from his immigrant family’s modest beginnings to the upper echelons of US government, with a consistent thread running through it: the influence of Hinduism on his life. Raised in a traditional joint family household in New York, Patel’s childhood was steeped in the practices, festivals, and moral teachings of Hinduism. His father, Pramod Patel, fled Uganda during the brutal regime of Idi Amin in 1972, eventually settling in the US after a brief stint in India. His mother, Anjana Patel, grew up in Tanzania. Together, they built a home where hard work, education, and respect for elders were not just encouraged—they were sacred.Sharing the article on X (formerly Twitter), Patel underscored how the values of dharma, karma, and seva—righteous duty, action with accountability, and selfless service—have guided his personal and professional journey. “Kash’s upbringing was rooted in the values of Hinduism—hard work, respect, and education—values that have influenced his worldview,” the article states. It goes on to note that his parents raised him to “respect all religions, embodying the message of universal tolerance famously delivered by Swami Vivekananda in his 1893 speech at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago.”Patel’s deep respect for his cultural heritage was on full display during his Senate confirmation hearing for the FBI role. Before delivering his opening remarks, he turned to his parents in the audience and touched their feet—an age-old Hindu gesture of reverence and gratitude. The act drew attention on both sides of the political aisle, symbolising a rare and visible assertion of Indian cultural values in the heart of American power.Patel, a prominent figure in conservative US politics, often exhibits religious markers associated with Hindu traditions. He is frequently seen wearing a sacred thread (kalava or mauli) on his wrist—a common sign of Hindu faith. He has publicly said ""Jai Shri Krishna,"" invoking the Hindu deity Lord Krishna, which is both a greeting and a devotional exclamation. Such expressions align with broader Hindu customs, like touching parents’ feet as a mark of respect, lighting diyas during Diwali, or visiting temples during significant festivals. These practices highlight his cultural and spiritual identity, especially as Hindu values gain more visibility in diaspora communities.Capping off his statement, Patel invoked a phrase rarely heard in such settings: “Jai Shri Krishna.” The salutation, meaning “Victory to Lord Krishna,” reverberated through the hearing room, becoming an instant talking point on social media and WhatsApp groups across the Indian diaspora.While the gesture drew praise from many in the Indian-American community, it also stirred the usual backlash from liberal commentators who saw it as a blending of religion and governance. However, Patel has never made apologies for his background or beliefs. In fact, he has consistently argued that the strength of American democracy lies in its ability to accommodate and embrace diverse cultural expressions.Patel’s visibility as a Hindu public figure is significant, especially in a political ecosystem where Indian-American representation has often been confined to sanitized cultural references. Unlike others who distance themselves from India’s civilisational heritage for fear of political incorrectness, Patel has leaned into his identity—whether it’s supporting the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, quoting Swami Vivekananda, or criticising Western media for what he calls “biased narratives” about India.The FBI chief’s public embrace of his Indic roots marks a shift not just in how Indian-Americans are represented, but in how they represent themselves. For Patel, being American and being Hindu are not contradictory identities—they are complementary. And in an era where identity politics dominates public discourse, his unapologetic integration of both worlds sends a powerful message.Patel’s rise also adds a layer of complexity to Trump’s 2024 campaign and the broader MAGA coalition . Far from being a monolith of evangelical Christians, Trump’s inner circle now includes a growing number of Indian-origin figures—Patel, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Usha Vance, among others—who bring a distinct cultural and philosophical worldview into conservative politics.With his latest post, Patel has made it clear his Hindu upbringing is not just a footnote in his biography—it is a living, breathing force that continues to guide his decisions, inform his ethics, and define his mission. In doing so, he has opened the door for a broader conversation about what it means to lead while remaining anchored in one's cultural heritage.As the article he shared notes, “While Patel leads a secular institution, his background and values inform his approach to governance.” It adds that his “promise to restore justice and fairness” is guided by both personal conviction and spiritual grounding.","Kashyap ""kash"" patel, the indian-origin lawyer and recently appointed fbi director under donald trump, has publicly embraced his cultural roots.

What do experts say?

Is there a timeline for lifting the freeze?

What is the broader impact of this policy?

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications, intensifying concerns among Indian immigrants, one of the largest migrant communities in the United States. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown focused on increased scrutiny and national security checks.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that the pause is in line with two executive orders signed by Donald Trump. These orders aim to enhance immigrant screening for potential fraud, public safety threats, and national security risks.The suspension impacts immigrants applying for permanent residency, including Indian nationals. With over 2.9 million Indian immigrants in the US as of 2023, many now face prolonged delays and legal uncertainties.Laura Collins, director at the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative, told NBC News, “All these people who are approved to remain in the United States have already passed government scrutiny.” She argued that further delays are unnecessary.Azadeh Erfani from the National Immigrant Justice Center told Newsweek, “This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk.”The Trump administration has not provided any timeline for when green card processing will resume, leaving thousands of applicants uncertain about their future.This move aligns with Trump’s larger push to tighten immigration policies, including plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue the pause unfairly targets legal immigrants and creates further bureaucratic hurdles.Recently, the Trump administration has detained individuals with ties to American universities, many of whom have supported pro-Palestinian causes, as part of a crackdown on immigrants. Among the detained is Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, arrested under accusations of supporting Hamas. Other individuals detained include Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Yunseo Chung, a US resident arrested at a protest, and Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar accused of spreading Hamas propaganda.The US government has also taken action against several other activists, including Leqaa Kordia, Ranjani Srinivasan, and Alireza Doroudi, with many facing deportation or detention. Some of these individuals are accused of advocating for violence or engaging in political protests.","The trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications.

Hulk Hogan allegedly cheated on Linda Hogan with Brooke Hogan’s close friend, Christiane Plante — and that blew it all up

“My relationship with Terry began at a time when Terry and Linda privately knew their marriage was ending. She had left him already, although no official papers had been filed.”

“Having felt the guilt and pain build up, I gave a note to Brooke apologizing for my actions. I will never be able to fully forgive myself for this. I have lost an amazing friend.”

E! News

“When Linda discovered Hulk had [an affair] with Brooke's best friend, Christiane Plante, she made the decision to call it quits on the marriage.”

“When your best friend and one of your closest family members that you have loved unconditionally since your first day on this earth, betray you together… you will NEVER forget the hurt they caused you.”

Linda Hogan says Hulk Hogan was violent, manipulative, and made her fear for her life during their marriage

""[Hulk] tore my shirt. He threw lamps. He held me down on the bed with his hands around my throat during arguments, slamming doors, [and] pounding walls. I was always afraid he would kill me in one of his rages.""

“My kids to this day are still reeling, and they can't get their feet back on planet Earth. I can't get my life back on track either... I don't know where I fit in in this world anymore.”

“The ‘Hogan Knows Best’ show probably exasperated an already existing problem... it certainly exacerbated it, probably fueled it, probably expedited the end of their relationship.”

Divorce didn’t fix anything. It just started a new kind of hell for the Hogan family

“Holy smokes. Wow, you just knocked the bottom out of me.”

“For my own journey to healing and happiness, I have chosen to create some distance between myself and my family.”

“Brooke doesn’t talk to us. She had twins, she got married [and] she didn’t tell us.”

“It’s been 15 however long years since I left Hulk Hogan and my family is the worst mess…”

It wasn’t just a celebrity divorce. It was a full-blown public implosion — with affairs, physical abuse claims, secret lawsuits, millions at stake, and kids stuck in the middle. Hulk Hogan (real name: Terry Bollea ) and Linda Hogan were married for 24 years. But the moment it ended, it dragged the entire Hogan brand down with it.

Plante herself admitted it in a 2008 interview with theAnd she knew what it cost her.Linda Hogan’s publicist backed it all up in, saying:Hulk Hogan denied the affair in his memoir. Denied all infidelity, in fact. Said Linda Hogan just got suspicious whenever he spoke to a woman. But by the time this went public, the damage was already done — to their family, to Brooke Hogan, to their entire reputation.And yes, Brooke Hogan was shattered. She posted this on MySpace — and then deleted it:Linda Hogan didn't stop at cheating accusations. She later said Hulk Hogan was emotionally abusive — and physically terrifying behind closed doors.In her memoir, she claimed:She went on, saying she couldn’t rebuild her life even after the divorce:She blamed Hulk Hogan for destroying the future they planned — the holidays, the weddings, even their relationships with their kids. Linda said she lost her trust, her love, her home. And that the trauma didn’t just fade after the cameras were gone.On the surface, “Hogan Knows Best” made the Hogan family look tight. It aired on VH1 from 2005 to 2007. It was early reality TV — the kind that walked socould run.But the truth was messier. Hulk Hogan’s marriage was falling apart in real time, and the show tried to paint over it with forced smiles and edited footage. It worked for a while — the ratings were strong — but inside that house, things were breaking.Eric Bischoff confirmed this years later on hispodcast, pointing to Hulk Hogan’s own memoir.The show didn’t cause the split.

Linda walked away with 70% of their liquid assets, 40% ownership of Hulk Hogan’s companies, and a $3 million property settlement.But the fighting didn’t end. Linda Hogan dated a 19-year-old named Charlie Hill (a kid who went to school with Brooke Hogan). He sued her for $1.5 million claiming she made him do unpaid yard work.

India is one of the highest-tariffing nations in the world. They're very smart,"" Trump said. ""He is a very smart man and a great friend of mine. We had very good talks. I think it's going to work out very well between India and our country.

Trump has consistently critiqued India's trade policies, calling it 'tariff king' and describing its import duties as 'very unfair and strong'.Trump had said in an earlier statement, ""I have a very good relationship with India, but the only problem I have with India is they're one of the highest-tariffing nations in the world. I believe they're probably going to lower those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us.""Addressing the issue, MoS ministry of external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said that during PM Modi's visit to the US on February 12-13, both India and the US resolved to deepen the bilateral trade relationship to promote growth that ensures fairness, national security and job creation. ""PM Modi and US President Donald Trump set a new bilateral trade target – 'Mission 500' – aiming to more than double the total two-way goods and services trade to $500 billion by 2030... Both sides announced plans to negotiate the first tranche of a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by the fall of 2025.""""The two governments are in the process of taking these negotiations forward and are actively working to build a framework for the BTA, which aims to expand trade across the goods and services sector, whilst working towards increasing market access, reducing tariff and non-tariff barries, and deepening supply-chain integration,"" he said further. Previously, Trump had criticised India's trade practices, stating 'they have the highest tariffs' and 'it is a hard place to do business"". Trump had said, ""We will soon impose reciprocal tariffs- they charge us, we charge them. Whatever a company or a country, such as India or China, charges, we want to be fair; hence, reciprocal.""He continued, ""We have never done that. We were getting ready to do it until Covid hit."" Specifically addressing India's automotive import duties, Trump noted, ""India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%.""During his address to a joint session of the US Congress, Trump confirmed the reciprocal tax implementation on April 2, expressing that the US had faced exploitation from nearly every nation globally and promised to prevent such practices.Additionally, he addressed tariffs imposed by the European Union, China, Brazil, and Mexico, indicating that the US would implement corresponding tariffs based on other nations' treatment of the US.In a declaration from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles entering the United States, describing it as 'very exciting' for domestic manufacturing.The new tariffs, commencing April 2, will affect approximately half of all vehicles sold in the United States, including American brands produced overseas.

What Elon Musk said on Donald Trump’s 25% import tariff announcement on auto parts

US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts. “What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said, as he signed the order in the Oval Office on March 26. The tariffs take effect on April 3 and apply to foreign-made cars, light trucks, and key auto parts. Responding to the development, Tesla CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk said that “this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries”. Musk quoted a post by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley @teslaownersSV which said that “Trump imposes 25% tariff on all cars not made in the United States. Tesla could benefit the most on this.”Clarifying the post, Musk wrote: “To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial.”President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on additional goods, including pharmaceuticals, noting that most drugs available in the U.S. are manufactured abroad, primarily in China and Ireland.Regarding reciprocal tariffs, Trump stated that the U.S. wouldn’t match exact levels set by trading partners but stressed that no country would be exempt.“We're going to make it to all countries, and we're going to make it very lenient,” he said. “I think people are going to be very surprised. It'll be, in many cases, less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades.”He added that the U.S. would be “very fair” and “very nice” in its approach, despite what he described as unfair treatment by other nations.","Us president donald trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts.

Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa announces new transitional Syrian government in Damascus

Syria’s new government was sworn in on Saturday, marking a major step in the country’s transition following the removal of Bashar al-Assad in December.The 23-member cabinet includes a mix of religious and ethnic backgrounds and is expected to lead Syria through its five-year transitional period.Unlike previous governments, this one does not have a prime minister. Instead, a secretary general will oversee its functions, as outlined in the temporary constitution signed by interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa earlier this month.While most ministers are new faces, the foreign and defence ministers retained their positions. One notable absence in the government is representation from the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) or the autonomous administration in northeast Syria. However, al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi recently signed a ceasefire agreement and a deal to merge the US-backed force into the Syrian army.Stability remains the new government’s biggest challenge. Earlier this month, revenge killings in the coastal Alawite region left over 1,000 people dead. The Assad family, which ruled for decades, belongs to the Alawite minority, while most of the new leaders are from the Sunni majority.Economic troubles are also a priority. Sanctions imposed on Assad’s government over a decade ago remain in place, and the UN reports that 90% of Syrians live below the poverty line. The new government hopes that its diverse composition will help persuade Western nations to ease sanctions.Security remains a concern as well. Just hours before the government was announced, the US State Department warned of potential terrorist attacks targeting embassies and public buildings during the Eid al-Fitr holiday. The warning cited the possibility of individual attackers, armed gunmen, or explosives.","The 23-member cabinet includes a mix of religious and ethnic backgrounds.

It seems that US President Donald Trump 's national security advisor Mike Waltz's job is in danger after the Yemen war plan leak on a Signal group chat scandal.""Should I fire him?"" he inquired of his staff and associates, as controversy mounted over Waltz's accidental inclusion of a journalist in communications about an impending Yemen military operation , New York Times reported.Publicly, Trump maintained support for Waltz while criticising the media. Following Jeffrey Goldberg 's article in The Atlantic about his inclusion in the chat, Trump described Waltz as a ""good man"" who needed no apology.Privately, Trump sought counsel from various individuals within and outside his administration regarding appropriate action.He expressed dissatisfaction with media coverage to his allies but was reluctant to appear influenced by press pressure. He also indicated hesitation about dismissing senior officials early in his second term.For Trump, the primary concern appeared not to be Waltz's careless discussion of military plans on a commercial application, but rather his possible connection to Goldberg, a Washington journalist Trump strongly dislikes.
