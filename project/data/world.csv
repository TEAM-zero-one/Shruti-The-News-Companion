Why BSE Sensex, Nifty50 crashed today

1) Consumer Confidence Declines in US

2) Economic Growth and Inflation Concerns

3) Markets Await Inflation Report

4) Ongoing Foreign Investment Outflow

Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Monday. While BSE Sensex crashed 900 points, Nifty50 went below 22,550 intraday. BSE Sensex ended the day at 74,454.41, down 857 points or 1.14%. Nifty50 ended at 22,552.50, down 243 points or 1.07%.American consumer confidence hit its lowest point in 15 months during February, with inflation expectations rising amidst worries regarding President Donald Trump's proposed tariff policies, as indicated by recent data.Asian markets largely declined, following the negative performance on Wall Street from Friday, driven by growth-related concerns.Shares of Zomato, HCL Tech, TCS, Tech Mahindra, HDFC Bank, and IndusInd Bank started lower, whilst Sun Pharma, Maruti, M&M, Bajaj Finserv, and Nestle India registered initial gains.In sectoral performance, the Nifty IT index fell by 1.8%, with LTTS, Persistent Systems, and Coforge leading the decline. Additionally, Nifty Financial Services, Media, Metal, PSU Bank, Realty, and Consumer Durables indices all opened more than 1% lower.Global markets retreated following an unexpected reduction in US services activity, influenced by tariff concerns and rising costs. Reports indicated the White House was urging Mexico to implement tariffs on Chinese goods.American consumer confidence decreased significantly in February, reaching its lowest point in 15 months as inflation outlook increased. The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index reduced to 64.7 from 71.7 in January, below analysts' forecasts. Citizens voiced worries about how President Donald Trump's tariff policies might affect their spending capacity.The US faces worries about concurrent economic slowdown and rising inflation, creating market uncertainty. This situation affects export-focused industries, including Indian IT, whilst making emerging markets less desirable for international investors, who might prefer secure investments like US dollar and treasury bonds.The Nifty IT index fell 1.8% today, with LTTS, Persistent Systems, and Coforge showing losses.Investors remain cautious before Friday's release of the Federal Reserve's main core inflation indicator. Analysts expect the figure to decrease to 2.6% from 2.8%, though tariff-related concerns might overshadow these results.Further complexity arises as nine Fed officials are due to speak this week, likely maintaining a prudent approach regarding interest rate reductions.Foreign portfolio investors have withdrawn Rs 1,01,737 crore net from Indian equities in 2025 to date (Friday closing), as per NSDL figures.""The market is facing headwinds from relentless FII selling and global uncertainties relating to Trump tariffs,"" said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.","Bse sensex and nifty50, the indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on monday.

Europe-backed resolution seeks withdrawal of Russian troops

Amid high drama at the UN over the 2 resolutions that were brought in the UN General Assembly on the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war – one by the US and other by Ukraine and Europe – India abstained from voting on both. Both resolutions were adopted with 93 votes in favour, as EU members seemed to prevail over the Americans in mustering support from the 193-member body for comprehensive peace and for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.The voting for the US effort, which sought a swift end to the conflict, was more dramatic as the US itself abstained from voting on a resolution it had sponsored.This was because the European countries managed to successfully introduce amendments in the text. India, which maintains that it is not neutral but on the side of peace, was expected to vote in favour but the amendments meant that Indian too had to abstain.India was also among the 65 countries that abstained from voting on the Europe-backed resolution that called for just and lasting peace, and also immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. This was in line with its earlier abstentions in the Assembly on resolutions condemning Russia.India officially continues to maintain that it wants both parties involved to restart the dialogue and diplomacy process to resolve the conflict. The Trump administration has been engaging directly with Russia to end the war, keeping both EU and Ukraine out.While the defeat in the General Assembly is a setback for the US, it will look to make up for it in the Security Council, hoping that France and UK will not veto it. Both countries have not used their veto power for decades. The voting was expected to take place later in the day. With effectively just one paragraph, the US resolution seeks lasting, and not just and lasting, peace and calls for a swift end to the conflict between the 2 countries. If approved, it will be the first real resolution to be adopted by the Council on the issue since the beginning of the war. The only 1 adopted so far was days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine for a special emergency session in the Assembly on Ukraine.EU member states had sought 3 amendments in the US draft resolution, including replacing “Russia-Ukraine conflict” with “the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation”.It also called for reaffirming the UN’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, including its territorial waters. The third was a mention of “just, lasting and comprehensive” peace and not just lasting peace. Russia’s amendment for addressing the “root causes” of the conflict was rejected.","India abstained from voting on 2 resolutions brought in the un general assembly.

'Get the house in order': Sanjay Jha's open letter to Rahul Gandhi amid Shashi Tharoor's growing rift with leadership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/get-the-house-in-order-sanjay-jhas-open-letter-to-rahul-gandhi-amid-shashi-tharoors-growing-rift-with-leadership/articleshow/118536030.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha on Monday wrote an open post for Rahul Gandhi on X, asking him to ""get the house in order"" amid reports of Shashi Tharoor's rift with the party.""Dear Rahul Gandhi, I am writing to you publicly here because no one within the Congress is probably going to tell you this. So as usual, let me bell the cat,"" he wrote.""Leadership ( corporate or political or any other) is about having difficult conversations. It is about trouble-shooting. It is not about living in denial; problems have to be addressed, they cannot be wished away.""You and I both know that Shashi (Tharoor) is an outstanding parliamentarian. He is probably among the only few in the country to whom the cliché, “He needs no introduction” truly applies. It is therefore disappointing that once again a great asset of the party is being forced to talk to the media to get his message through to you or the Congress leadership. Almost five years to the date, I was compelled to write an article in a national newspaper when facing a similar predicament. No problem is intractable; the key question is do we have the will to solve them in everyone’s interest? And that too quickly,"" he said in the post.""The Congress must be focused on taking on the BJP, but a prerequisite for that is to first get the house in order. This cannot become an ongoing unresolved challenge for years as it paralyses the energy and drive of the Congress workers and supporters. A challenger party has to be swift, desperate, risk-taking, hungry and on a constant prowl. It cannot be business as usual, for sure. We need to the hit the nail on the head going forward, but right now, we seem to be hitting our head on the nail,"" Jha wrote.Four-time Congress MP Tharoor appears to be growing increasingly disillusioned with the party, following what he perceives as a continued sidelining by the high command.His recent public criticism of a leadership vacuum in Kerala Congress and a meeting with Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi to discuss his role in the party have fuelled speculation about his future within the organisation.","Former congress spokesperson sanjay jha wrote an open post for rahul gandhi on x.

Row over praise for rivals: Should Congress be wary of Shashi Tharoor?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/row-over-praise-for-rivals-should-congress-be-wary-of-shashi-tharoor/articleshow/118537166.cms,"Shashi Tharoor

NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor is no pushover in politics. And the Congress knows that. In October 2022, the former UN dilpomat-turned politician surprised many in the Congress when he announced to contest elections for the post of Congress president against Mallikarjun Kharge - who was the ""nominee"" of the Gandhis. Tharoor fought the elections against all odds with little support from any one in the party and managed to get 1,072 votes against Kharge's 7,897.Tharoor, who then already had the rebel tag around him as a member of G-23 (group of Congress leaders who had written a letter to Sonia Gandhi seeking reforms in the party), braved the risk of being labeled an open dissident to put forth his views on reviving the Congress - which had been on a constant decline since its shocking defeat in 2014. He batted for decentralising authority and empowering the grassroots office-bearers of the party.The former UN diplomat-turned-politician, who has won four consecutive Lok Sabha elections from Thiruvananthapuram, has once again challenged the Congress leadership with his praise for party's political rivals - both at the national and the state level.The Congress MP, who has never been afraid to speak his mind, was once again under fire for his comments praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States and his thumbs up to entrepreneurial growth in Kerala under the LDF government.As expected, the Congress pushback was strong and immediate. But Tharoor, in keeping with his combative style, instead of taking a step back took digs at the party leadership with a cryptic social media which said ""it is a folly to be wise."" The message was loud and clear - the Thiruvananthapuram MP was once again ready to fight the battle within the party.Tharoor, who was reportedly unhappy over being sidelined in the party - both at the national and the state level, had a one-to-one closed-door meeting with Rahul Gandhi and later claimed that the conversation was ""very good"" though he did not divulge any details.The Kerala Congress leader however remained defiant about his article praising the Left Front government and said he was happy that it had ‘done some good' as it had opened a scope for discussion on the issue.According to reports, Tharoor in a yet to be telecast podcast has said that he is ready to explore other options if the Congress did not need his services.What may worry the Congress that this time around there are some voices of support for the embattled leader. Echoing the sentiments of Tharoor, another senior party leader Rashid Alvi, said there was a need to bring senior and ground-connected politicians into Congress mainstream.""Congress party has many senior, seasoned, and ground-connected politicians. We should bring them into the mainstream of the party. This will make Congress stronger. If we do not bring these experienced individuals into the mainstream, it will harm the party,"" Alvi said.This is not the first time that Alvi has given a message to the party leadership. Recently when Congress contested the Delhi elections with full vengeance against Arvind Kejriwal and played a key role in AAP's defeat, Alvi had then spoken against the leadership decision to divide votes and help the BJP in process.And while Alvi was diplomatic in his attack, Sanjay Jha, former Congress spokesperson, who was pushed out of the party following airing his differences, was more direct in his attack. Sanjay Jha wrote an open post on X addressed to Rahul Gandhi explaining why he needed to bell the cat.""I am writing to you publicly here because no one within the Congress is probably going to tell you this. So as usual, let me bell the cat. Leadership ( corporate or political or any other) is about having difficult conversations. It is about trouble-shooting. It is not about living in denial; problems have to be addressed, they cannot be wished away,"" he wrote.Advising Rahul Gandhi to set the house in order, Sanjay Jha said ""We need to the hit the nail on the head going forward, but right now, we seem to be hitting our head on the nail.""Clearly, the Congress leadership in general and Rahul Gandhi in particular need to ensure that the party does not lose another popular leader because of the differences within.",Shashi tharoor has challenged the congress leadership with his praise for party's political rivals.

Most people consider GDP overall to rank the wealthiest countries in the world, this particular method can be quite unfairly defined. Countries like China and India will rank very different from a small, wealthier country. A straight measure of wealth would be GDP per capita, using the total economic output of a country divided by the actual population. This would give a much fairer estimate of the amount of wealth existing per person to give insight into living standards and the share of the economy owned by the average person which provides the list of top 10 richest countries as per Forbes report.However, GDP per capita does not actually control all differences in cost of living and sometimes purchasing power that people actually have. Economists typically make adjustments for this with Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). The adjustment takes in relative prices of goods and services within countries, thus better enabling comparisons of economic well-being across countries.GDP per capita is calculated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and if adjusted for PPP, the richest ten nations for 2025 are as follows:Luxembourg boasts the world's highest GDP-PPP per capita at $154,910, a result of its extremely high standard of living. The nation's wealth stems from having a highly advanced financial services sector in the areas of banking and investment as well as having a business-friendly environment. While small, the Luxembourg economy is well-developed, and the growth rate of 2.7% is indicative of the country continuing to expand, though at a declining rate, due to the already very high level of prosperity.Singapore is also rich, with a GDP-PPP per capita of $153,610. The economy of Singapore is supported by global trade, finance, and high technology. With one of the world's top financial hubs, Singapore has been favored by its geographical location in Asia and its secure and well-run economy. Economic expansion over the long term of 2.5% captures a healthy business environment and ongoing world trade as per the recent data.Macao SAR, China's Special Administrative Region, boasts an incredible GDP-PPP of $140,250 that indicates its economic wealth largely from the gaming and tourist sectors. It boasts a well-developed casino industry that has contributed a lot to its wealth. It boasts a growth rate of 7.3%, recording a whopping economic growth, mostly due to rising tourism and gaming revenue, and is among the fastest-growing economies in this list.The per capita GDP-PPP in Ireland stands at $131,550 and represents its level of living that is largely triggered by its financial and technology sector. Ireland currently exists as the destination of multinationals, particularly technology and pharmaceutical companies. The economy in Ireland continues to move forward in a steady pace of 2.2% spurred by overseas investment and foreign export as the remainder of the globe experiences boom and bust.Qatar is also endowed with natural resources in the form of oil and natural gas, as is evident from their GDP-PPP per capita of $118,760. Fossil fuel wealth has put Qatar on the list of wealthiest nations. Their growth rate is slower at 1.9%, but that is likely due to the reason that the economy is oil-dependent and diversification has been challenging. But Qatar has a high quality of life for its citizens.Norway has a GDP-PPP per capita of $106,540 due to its massive natural resources, specifically oil and gas. Norway also has a very good social welfare system and lifestyle. Its economy is quite developed although it is fairly low on the list with the 1.8% growth rate in comparison to some of the others on the list since the country's stable but not necessarily rapidly growing economy has already achieved a high degree of prosperity.Switzerland's per capita GDP-PPP of $98,140 is due to its robust economy, which is backed by industries like finance, pharma, and manufacturing industries. Switzerland boasts a high standard of living and a stable financial system. Its economy is expanding at a slower pace at a paltry growth rate of only 1.3%, maybe because it is already economically well-developed and because its market is stable.Brunei Darussalam has a GDP-PPP of $95,040 courtesy of the oil and gas industries. Brunei is very wealthy, if only modest, due to its fossil fuel exports. Its 2.5% growth rate speaks to moderate development, if perhaps less than more diversified nations. Its reliance on petroleum also leaves its economic future at the whim of global energy prices.Guyana, located in South America, has a GDP-PPP per capita of $91,380, which is quite high among countries in the continent. Guyana is economically growing very fast at a rate of 14.4% due to its new oil production industry. This very fast growth of oil production is changing the country's economy and turning it into a wealthier nation, ranking it among the world's fastest-growing economies.The United States' GDP-PPP per capita of $89,680 reflects its high standard of living and huge diversified economy. America is a global leader in industry, technology, and finance. The 2.2% growth rate indicates that the United States' economy is increasing steadily but growing at a lower rate than a few of the new rising economies such as Guyana. Still, it is one of the richest nations with a diversified and healthy economy.At first glance, it may seem surprising that Luxembourg, Singapore, and Macao top the list, while major economies like the United States and China rank lower. The reason is that smaller countries often have advantages that boost their GDP per capita.Per capita GDP is an approximation of wealth, but it certainly does not take into account differences in price indices across countries concerning household consumption expenditures. Thus, Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) eliminates these differences in relative prices of goods and services, so that a more realistic measure of purchasing power is applied. Richer countries looking richer are actually richer with costlier goods and services, then they simply look honest with PPP adjustment per head-there is still incompleteness in that aberrations such as tax havens inflate GDP figures with money that comes from other countries.","Luxembourg boasts the world's highest gdp-ppp per capita at $154,910. Singapore's economy thrives on trade, finance, and technology. Macao’s wealth is largely driven by tourism, particularly its casinos. Growth rate of 2.7% is indicative of the country continuing to expand, though at a declining rate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118532722,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-51884,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country. This is nuts,"" Trump acolyte and MAGA major Vivel Ramaswamy had raged.Trump himself, lately exercised over a $ 21 million USAID allocation for a voter turnout program in India, had highlighted the purported scam saying the Biden administration had paid $ 59 million to an unspecified hotel in New York City to house illegal immigrants. Standing beside him, Musk had added that the city was paying double the normal rate for the room.Following the Trump victory, his new administration cited concerns about criminal activity at the hotel for freezing $80 million in FEMA funds to the city, by which time Pakistan had already raked in tens of millions of dollars.""FEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua base of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer. There will not be a single penny spent that goes against the interest and safety of the American people,"" the homeland security department said, referring to the Venezuelan criminal gang, now declared a foreign terrorist organisation, said to be involved in the murder of an American nursing student.","The site opened in may 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run pakistan international airlines.

Potential season-ending surgery on the horizon

Alejandro Rosario’s promising career put on hold

Tough news on one of the Texas Rangers ' best pitching prospects, Alejandro Rosario, who is now facing a big setback. The 23-year-old right-hander is all but certain to miss the entire 2025 MLB season due to an elbow injury. According to initial reports, Alejandro Rosario may need Tommy John surgery , though the Rangers are still working through medical evaluations.Chris Young, the Rangers' president of baseball operations, confirmed the concerning news in a statement to MLB.com on Sunday.“He’s going to require surgery,” Young said. “As with all these things, we want to check the boxes and make sure we get multiple opinions. We don’t want to sit on this and not announce it when we know he’s going to be out, but we’re still figuring out the next steps.”If Tommy John surgery is indeed required, Alejandro Rosario will likely be sidelined for at least a year, impacting both his development and the Rangers’ pitching depth. The team is expected to consult with medical experts before making a final decision on his treatment plan.Rated as the #50 overall prospect on MLB’s official website, Alejandro Rosario was considered a top prospect in the Texas Rangers team. A terrific pitcher at the University of Miami, he was taken in the fifth round of the 2023 MLB Draft, and he showed flashes in his time down the road earlier this season with his electric arm and a potential future piece in the rotation.For the Texas Rangers, who had high hopes for his development, his injury is a big blow. As the team waits for a clear path forward, Rosario’s road to recovery should be long and difficult. Should he require surgery, he will turn his attention to rehabilitation with hopes of returning strong in the future.As Texas Rangers navigate this difficult situation, their player development staff will look to adjust their plans and continue monitoring Alejandro Rosario’s recovery closely.Also Read : 'We Need Him': Texas Rangers bank on Tyler Mahle’s healthy return to strengthen rotation","The 23-year-old right-hander is all but certain to miss the entire 2025 mlb season due to an elbow injury.

Eagles White House Visit: Reports of Eagles Declining White House Invite Are NOT TRUE — No Invitation Issued Yet!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/reports-of-eagles-declining-white-house-invite-are-not-true-no-invitation-issued-yet/articleshow/118539836.cms,"X

Did the Eagles Really Decline a White House Invite? Not So Fast

""disagrees with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem.""

The Philadelphia Eagles are back in the spotlight, but this time, it's not just about their Super Bowl victory. Recent buzz suggested the team had turned down an invitation to visit the White House, but it turns out — that's simply not true. The White House has officially stated that President Donald Trump has not extended an invitation to the Eagles yet, shutting down the viral rumors.Speculation spread like wildfire across social media, with claims that the Eagles had collectively refused a White House visit — a gesture traditionally extended to championship teams. However, the truth is much simpler: there was never an invite to decline in the first place.According to a White House official, President Trump has not invited the Eagles to celebrate their Super Bowl win. If and when the invitation comes, the team plans to vote on whether or not they will attend. This directly contradicts the viral reports suggesting the team had already made up their minds and refused the honor.This isn’t the first time the Eagles have found themselves in the middle of a White House-related controversy. Back in 2018, after winning Super Bowl LII , the team was invited to visit the White House — but the situation quickly turned chaotic. Several players had already indicated they wouldn’t attend due to their political beliefs, and just a day before the event, President Trump abruptly canceled the visit altogether.At the time, Trump cited the players' stance on the national anthem protests as the reason for the cancellation, stating the teamThe event was replaced with a ""Celebration of America"" ceremony, but the fallout left a lasting mark on the team's relationship with the White House.While the drama surrounding the Eagles' potential White House visit has grabbed headlines, it’s crucial to remember the facts: there has been no invitation yet, and the team will decide collectively if and when one arrives.For now, the Super Bowl champs are enjoying their victory lap — and the rest of us can sit tight and wait to see how this story unfolds.Also read - Jalen Hurts’ WR asks Ja’Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson to make way after Eagles OC decision","The philadelphia eagles were invited to visit the white house after winning super bowl lii.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has warned that California is at risk of going bankrupt if significant changes aren’t made.

ASAP, please. @elonmusk”.While Musk did not elaborate on specific causes, his warning aligns with ongoing concerns about the state’s financial struggles.

Critics point to high government spending, business regulations, and an exodus of companies and wealthy residents as factors straining the state’s economy.Musk himself moved Tesla’s headquarters from California to Texas in 2021, citing regulatory challenges and what he described as an unfriendly business environment.
