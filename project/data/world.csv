Viswashkumar's account of the crash

Rescued from the debris

Survivor’s phone went dead after 3 calls: Last conversations before silence

All 15 passengers from Diu identified; just 1 survivor: Diu additional district magistrate Vivek Kumar

In the tragedy that claimed 241 lives, Viswashkumar Ramesh — a British citizen of Indian origin — emerged as the sole survivor of Air India flight AI-171, a rare miracle amid immense grief.The London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed moments after taking off from Ahmedabad on Thursday afternoon, killing nearly everyone on board and on the ground. Among the passengers were Viswashkumar and his brother, Ajaykumar Ramesh. Within 30 seconds, fate tore the siblings apart forever.Viswashkumar, seated in Seat 11A, somehow staggered out of the wreckage — bloodied, dazed, and alive. His brother, who sat across the aisle in Seat 11J, is feared dead.A British citizen of Indian descent, Viswashkumar has lived in the UK for over 15 years.He and his brother Ajaykumar hailed from Diu, a coastal town in India. They were among 15 residents from Bucharwada and Vanakbara villages on the flight.In London, the brothers ran a garment business, while also managing a fishing enterprise back in Diu.From his hospital bed in Ward B7, Bed 11 of Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, Viswashkumar told his cousin Dhirendra Somabhai that the aircraft made a strange noise and seemed to hang mid-air before the pilot’s chilling distress call: “Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!”He remembers little else — just jumping through a door, then waking amid chaos.Bystanders and rescue teams pulled him out of the burning debris. Video clips show him stumbling, bloodied, and shouting in Gujarati: “Plane fatyo che! Plane fatyo che!” (The plane exploded).At the hospital, overwhelmed with shock and loss, he cried: “Where is my brother? Leave me alone. I don’t want to talk. Can anyone tell me where he is?”According to Ayub Mansuri, a close family friend who had driven the brothers to the airport that morning, Viswashkumar’s father in London informed them about the crash.“I spoke to Viswash three times after the crash. Then his phone went dead,” Mansuri said. “I rushed to the hospital and found him with head injuries and bruises.”The night before the crash, Viswash and his cousin Dhirendra were together in Patelwadi.“He told me, ‘I don’t know when we’ll meet next,’” Dhirendra recalled, now haunted by the memory.Around 2:30pm, officials sealed off the hospital ward after identifying him as the lone survivor. The Gujarat ATS and Ahmedabad Crime Branch have since restricted access to ensure safety and assist in the ongoing investigation.Diu additional district magistrate Vivek Kumar confirmed: “All 15 passengers from our region have been identified. Only one has survived. A team from our administration has already left for Ahmedabad.”In the midst of a nation mourning its worst aviation disaster in recent memory, Viswashkumar Ramesh’s survival is both a mystery and a miracle — a lone light in a sky darkened by loss.","Viswashkumar ramesh, a british citizen of indian origin, is the sole survivor of air india flight ai-171.

Poll Should the investigation report into the AI-171 crash be made public? Yes, for transparency No, it should remain private

DGCA statement hints at dual engine failure |

.

MUMBAI: Two short videos surfaced after AI 171 crashed outside Ahmedabad airport - many questions followed, from those who have flown commercial airliners. On social media, pilots were asking:1. Why was the aircraft landing gear not retracted?2. Did the aircraft suffer a dual engine failure?3. Did the engines die because of possible fuel contamination or blockage?4. Were the flaps on the wings lowered for take-off?5. Could a bird hit have contributed to the crash?The final investigation report into the AI-171 accident, set to be released before June 12 next year, will have a detailed analysis of probable causes and contributory factors. But for aviation professionals, the two videos offered many clues.Also read: Air India Ahmedabad-London flight crashes near airport shortly after takeoff; 241 dead ""Within 5 secs of lift off, pilots normally put the landing gear up,"" said Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert. Capt Manoj Hathi, ex-Air India official who has held posts of director (ops) and director (air-safety) said: ""As soon as a positive rate of climb is reached, the landing gear is retracted.""A lowered landing gear increases drag and fuel consumption, while reducing aircraft speed. Retracting the landing gear allows for a smooth aerodynamic flow helping the aircraft climb up. But the clips showed the landing gear extended even as the plane climbed to over 400 feet above ground.Also read: Ahmedabad air crash: Why accidents are common during take-offs, landings What could be the reason why AI-171 had not retracted its landing gear although it had climbed to a height of around 400 feet?""In case there is a distraction the pilots could forget to put the gear up.The distraction could be dual engine failure, bird hit or combination of both. The plume of dust as the aircraft crosses the runway end shows it was low on power and possibly a dual engine problem,"" said air safety expert Capt Amit Singh.Capt Manoj Hathi, a former AI official, said, ""It's possible that a dual engine flame-out was the reason the landing gear could not be retracted. Dual engine failure could occur due to bird ingestion or fuel contamination. Looking at the trajectory and body angle of the aircraft, it appears as if the aircraft has stalled because of loss of speed.""Other pilots, who requested anonymity, too, spoke about dual engine failure and possible fuel contamination. The possibility of a dual engine failure is a rare event with about seven documented accidents in the past seven decades.DGCA in its statement said the pilots gave a MAYDAY call seconds after take-off, further supporting the theory that a dual engine failure occurred probably after the aircraft crossed the speed beyond which a take-off cannot be safely aborted.Video clips show the aircraft gliding and descending over a congested area chock-a-block with buildings. Seconds later, the aircraft nose is raised - AI-171's pilots were probably trying to keep the aircraft from crashing in a congested locality. But raising the nose results in loss of airspeed.The clip shows the aircraft disappear from view and crash. But even if the pilots had not pulled up the nose it would have continued to glide, descend and eventually crash, said Capt Singh. The other point was the flaps - aerodynamic devices that are lowered to increase lift on the wing. While some pilots said the flaps were not lowered as is the norm during take-off, others said the pictures show they were lowered.Investigation into aircraft accidents carried out by civil aviation authorities such as the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) follow norms laid down in the International Civil Aviation Organisation's Annex 13. It states that the primary objective of an investigation should not be to assign blame, but to identify and prevent future similar incidents.Under Annex 13, a preliminary report should be ready within 30 days of the event. But ICAO leaves it to the state (India, in this case) to decide whether to make it public or keep it private. The final report, though, which should be published within a year of the accident, is made public.","Two short videos surfaced after ai 171 crashed outside ahmedabad airport.

The aircraft, heavily fueled for the long-haul journey, caught fire upon impact, complicating rescue operations.According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the aircraft was carrying 242 people — 230 passengers, 2 pilots, and 10 cabin crew members. It was being flown by Capt Sumeet Sabharwal and First Officer Clive Kundar.Fire engines, ambulances, police, and NDRF teams rushed to the site. Three teams (90 personnel) from the NDRF’s Gandhinagar unit were deployed immediately, with three more on their way from Vadodara.There is no official confirmation yet on the number of casualties or survivors.Officials said the fire was intensified by the jet’s full fuel load for the international route. “The heavy fuel load worsened the post-crash fire, making rescue efforts even more difficult,” a DGCA official said.Union home minister Amit Shah spoke with Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel, state home minister Harsh Sanghavi, and Ahmedabad Police Commissioner regarding the tragedy. CM Patel expressed deep grief over the incident and directed authorities to expedite rescue and relief operations.Taking to X, Patel said, “I have instructed officials to carry out rescue and relief work on a war footing and ensure immediate medical treatment for injured passengers. A green corridor has also been set up for quick transportation of the injured to hospitals.”He added that Shah had assured him of full central support in handling the aftermath.Air India, in its initial statement, said: “Flight AI171, operating Ahmedabad–London Gatwick, was involved in an incident today, 12 June 2025.

NEW DELHI: Flights between the West and India, mainly Delhi and Mumbai, will get even longer following the Iranian airspace closure on Friday after Israel attacked the country's nuclear sites. Sixteen Air India (AI) flights were impacted Friday, with the majority diverting and the others returning to origin.AI had resumed overflying Iran shortly after Pakistan had closed its airspace to Indian carriers on April 24 to partially mitigate the longer route its flights had to take since then. While AI will have to take longer routes to and from the West, IndiGo between Delhi and Tbilisi and Delhi and Baku will become one-stop flights now. With both Pakistan and Iran no-go areas, Indian carriers will have to take really longer routes to reach Central Asia. ""We are studying the situation and some AI flights may become one-stop after closure of Iran airspace,"" said sources.Also, if and when Iran retaliates, the airspace of countries near Israel, like Jordan and Lebanon, also be impacted. This has in the past forced airlines to take longer detours in that area whenever conflict escalates.""Due to the emerging situation in Iran, subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of safety of our passengers, (some) Air India flights are either being diverted or returning to their origin.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said he received a phone call from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who briefed him on the evolving security situation following Israel’s airstrikes on Iranian targets.In a post on X, PM Modi said, “Received a phone call from PM @netanyahu of Israel. He briefed me on the evolving situation. I shared India's concerns and emphasized the need for early restoration of peace and stability in the region.”The conversation comes amid growing international alarm after Israel launched a wide-ranging assault on Iranian military and nuclear facilities, reportedly killing senior officials and scientists.Netanyahu’s office confirmed that he has spoken with several global leaders, including those of India, Germany, and France, and is expected to speak with US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and UK PM Keir Starmer. According to Israel, the leaders “showed understanding for Israel's defense needs in the face of the Iranian threat of annihilation.”Israel said the strikes were necessary in light of direct threats from Iran.“The leaders showed understanding for Israel’s defense needs in the face of the Iranian threat of annihilation,” Netanyahu’s office said.India on Friday said it is ""deeply concerned"" over the recent developments between Iran and Israel and ""closely monitoring"" the evolving situation.New Delhi urged both countries to avoid any escalatory steps.According to international media reports, Israel has carried out strikes at various places in Iran, targeting nuclear and missile sites, and top military officers.Israel Defense Forces spokesperson BG Effie Defrin described the airstrikes as “precise, preemptive” targeting of Iran’s nuclear enrichment and weaponisation facilities, warning that Iran was now closer than ever to producing a nuclear bomb.Netanyahu, in a televised address, said the military action was necessary: “Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom bombs. Last year alone, they fired 300 ballistic missiles at Israel. Soon, those could carry nuclear warheads. This is an intolerable threat. It must be stopped.”He added that Israel's operation also targeted leading Iranian nuclear scientists and Iran’s missile development sites.

Trump-Musk feud continues? White House orders review of SpaceX contracts after fallout: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-musk-feud-continues-white-house-orders-review-of-spacex-contracts-after-fallout-report/articleshow/121841289.cms,"Elon Musk with Donald Trump in Oval office (File photo)

The White House instructed the Defense Department and Nasa earlier this month to examine details of SpaceX contracts worth billions following President Donald Trump's public disagreement with Elon Musk , according to four sources familiar with the directive who spoke to Reuters.The administration instructed these agencies to examine Musk's contracts to prepare potential actions against the entrepreneur and his enterprises, these sources indicated. Pentagon officials are also evaluating whether to limit SpaceX's involvement in a new American missile defence initiative, as Reuters reported on Thursday.While the ultimate intention regarding SpaceX's current federal contracts worth approximately $22 billion remains unclear, the assessment will mark the administration's follow-through on Trump's June 6 statement to journalists aboard Air Force One, where he mentioned possible termination of business and subsidies for Musk's ventures, stating ""We'll take a look at everything.""A White House spokesperson, responding via email to Reuters, avoided specific questions about Musk's operations, stating the ""Trump administration is committed to a rigorous review process for all bids and contracts."" Nasa's spokesperson separately indicated the agency would maintain collaboration with industry partners to achieve presidential space objectives.Sources familiar with the directive indicated the contract review aims to enable swift administrative action should Trump decide to move against Musk, who previously served as a senior presidential adviser and led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).One source characterised the review as ""for political ammunition.""The feasibility of legally cancelling existing contracts remains uncertain. However, the situation highlights governance experts' worries about political and personal influences potentially affecting government spending, national security and public interest matters.Another Reuters report on Friday cited three people familiar with the project, claiming that the feud called into question the role of Musk's SpaceX in the new US missile defense system. Until recently, the White House considered a plan for SpaceX, Musk's rocket and satellite venture, to partner with software maker Palantir and drone builder Anduril to construct crucial elements of the project, dubbed ""Golden Dome. "" These people said the administration instructed the Pentagon to prioritize a network of satellites for the purpose.A new framework aimed at tracking and preventing potential missile attacks against the United States is currently under consideration, which could reduce SpaceX's involvement. Three individuals stated that one option might initially forego SpaceX's satellite capabilities to focus on expanding existing ground-based missile defence systems instead.Scott Amey, a contracting specialist at Washington's Project on Government Oversight, noted the situation's paradox, where Musk's contracts face similar subjective political scrutiny that his DOGE team applied to numerous other contracts, emphasising that decisions should prioritise public and national security interests over personal disputes.SpaceX has become essential to American government aerospace and defence operations, managing satellite launches and potentially overseeing a crucial component of Trump's ""Golden Dome"" missile defence system.Despite Musk's recent attempts to moderate his presidential criticisms, including his (now-deleted posts) impeachment call and allegations linking Trump to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his outbursts highlighted government dependence on SpaceX.Before his reversal, Musk suggested decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, currently America's sole means of transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station under a £5 billion Nasa contract.Additionally, SpaceX is developing a classified satellite network for the National Reconnaissance Office, strengthening its relationship with American defence and intelligence communities.The feud between Musk and Trump intensified after the Tesla owner criticised Trump’s key domestic bill, describing it as a “disgusting abomination” and alleging that Trump’s name appeared in unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files—a post Musk subsequently deleted. In response, Trump called Musk “a big-time drug addict” and mocked his appearance during a recent Oval Office visit.However, the tensions seemed to ease when Musk expressed ""regret"" saying he went too far. “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,” Musk wrote Wednesday on the platform he owns. In response, the White House signalled a possible softening of tone. “The President acknowledged the statement that Elon put out this morning, and he is appreciative of it,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.",The white house instructed the defense department and nasa earlier this month to examine details of spacex contracts worth billions. The move follows president donald trump's public disagreement with elon musk.

The ‘gaps’ Boeing couldn’t ignore



In contact with Air India, ready to support them: Boeing Airplanes



NEW DELHI: The tragic crash of Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, has put spotlight on a whistleblower's warnings made in 2024 over the aircraft.The ill-fated aircraft, carrying 242 people including 10 crew members, plunged into a residential complex minutes after takeoff from Ahmedabad on Thursday. It was meant to fly to London’s Gatwick Airport — but lasted just around 30 seconds in the air.As rescue teams continue recovery efforts, aviation experts are turning their focus to the aircraft itself, the 787 Dreamliner, hailed as a technological marvel, yet shadowed by safety concerns.In 2024, New York Times reported about Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour's formal whistleblower complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which alleged serious structural flaws in the manufacturing of the 787 Dreamliner and its cousin, the 777. His claims suggested shortcuts were taken on the factory floor that could dramatically shorten the aircraft’s lifespan and potentially lead to ""catastrophic"" failure over time.“I’m not doing this to bring Boeing down,” Salehpour had said in a press briefing adding: “I’m doing this because I want to prevent a crash.”According to Salehpour, improperly filled gaps in the aircraft fuselage — where different parts of the plane are joined — could increase stress and wear during flights, potentially compromising the structural integrity of the aircraft over years.Also read: Police finds one survivor in seat 11A; 242 were onboard His allegations were not isolated. Back in 2021, the FAA and Boeing paused delivery of Dreamliners for nearly two years to investigate precisely the same issue: improperly filled microscopic gaps. Boeing claimed it corrected the process, resumed deliveries, and maintained that all active aircraft were safe.But Salehpour had alleged that the problem persisted. He described shocking assembly practices — including workers “jumping on aircraft parts” to force them into alignment. “That’s not how you build an airplane,” he said.Boeing had, however, pushed back hard against the allegations. “These claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure long-term safety,” the company had said in a statement.Also read: Ahmedabad plane crash: What caused the crash?

Iran strikes back after Israel's Operation Rising Lion; Netanyahu warns 'more is on the way',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-strikes-back-after-israels-operation-rising-lion-netanyahu-warns-more-is-on-the-way-what-happened-overnight/articleshow/121840211.cms,"'Everyone will feel it': Iran

'I think it's been excellent': Donald Trump







A tense escalation unfolded across the Middle East overnight, as Iran launched back to back, and overnight missile strikes toward Israel late Friday and early Saturday. The move came in response to what Iran described as Israel’s earlier attacks on its territory.The confrontation began with Israel’s ""greatest military operations in history,"" against Iran.In a sweeping and highly coordinated attack on Thursday night, Israeli warplanes and drones, some of them reportedly smuggled into Iranian territory in advance, struck deep inside the Islamic Republic.Key targets included parts of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, ballistic missile production sites, and command centers. The strike also killed top Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists.Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at central Tel Aviv, following a warning from its military that ""everyone will feel it.""Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had cautioned that Israel ""should expect severe punishment"" in response to its sweeping attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities and top military officials.""In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime's most significant enrichment facility, and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,"" declared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a defiant video address. ""The regime does not know what hit them, or what will hit them. It has never been weaker.""Netanyahu also addressed the people of Iran directly: ""To the proud people of Iran, we are in the midst of one of the greatest military operations in history, Operation Rising Lion. The Islamic regime, which has oppressed you for almost 50 years, threatens to destroy our country, the State of Israel. More is on the way.""That promise of escalation was swiftly realised — by both sides.Late Friday night, Iran responded with a salvo of ballistic missiles and drones targeting Israeli territory. Explosions thundered over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as sirens blared and the Israeli military urged residents to take cover.Buildings shook under the pressure of near-simultaneous detonations, with several of them likely the result of Israel’s air defence systems intercepting incoming threats.In a pointed statement, Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the retaliatory attacks.""Using a combination of precision-guided and smart systems,"" the IRGC said, ""Iran targeted military centers and airbases that served as the source of the criminal aggression against our country.""The IRGC added that its missiles struck Israeli military-industrial centers that produce missiles and other war equipment, stating that ""field reports, satellite imagery, and intercepted intelligence indicate that dozens of ballistic missiles effectively hit strategic targets.""""Despite claims of interception, the enemy failed to counter the waves of missile strikes launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" the statement continued.But Israel maintained it had successfully intercepted a significant portion of the threat.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) released footage of a Navy missile ship intercepting five Iranian drones over Israeli waters early Saturday. ""Attached is documentation of the interception of two drones launched earlier today from Iran,"" the IDF posted on social media platform X.The IDF also published a map highlighting areas across Israel currently under threat from Iranian attacks, warning, ""Israeli civilians are currently being targeted by the Iranian regime. The world cannot stay silent.""Inside a fortified command center, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant conducted ongoing situation assessments. According to an Israeli official who spoke with CNN, the leadership is ""fully engaged in real-time military coordination and strategic planning.""The attacks did not cease after Netanyahu's fiery speech. Minutes after his video was posted, more Iranian missiles were launched, with renewed explosions reported in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The tension inside Israel remained palpable as citizens were urged to stay inside shelters.Also read: Iran-Israel war: Iran airspace shut, international flights from India to take longer Israel also confirmed Iran's continued strikes and second barrage of missiles from Khamenei-led country.A senior Iranian official, speaking to CNN, warned that Iran is prepared to escalate even further: “Iran will intensify its attacks on Israel and target the regional bases of any country that tries to defend it.”Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Tehran while reaffirming support for Israel. ""Of course we support Israel in its actions,"" Trump told CNN. ""Iran better agree to a nuclear deal before there is nothing left.""“I think it’s been excellent,” Trump told ABC News about the Israeli strikes. “We gave Iran a chance, and they didn’t take it. They got hit—hard. As hard as you can get hit. And there’s more coming. A lot more.”Trump wrote on his Truth Social: ""Two months ago I gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to “make a deal.” They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn’t get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!

Is Cardi B looking much happier with Stefon Diggs?







Stefon Diggs and Cardi B have been constantly spotted in the last few weeks after the two made their relationship public on the rapper’s social media. While a lot is being said about Stefon Diggs and Cardi B’s relationship, the two have stayed away from all the speculations and were spotted sharing a kiss in public recently. But now, a recent statement by Cardi B has gone viral and fans are dragging Stefon Diggs into it.A few days ago, Cardi B took to her Instagram to complain about fashion houses as she spoke about how there are no special shoes this season.The Grammy winner said, “To all you fashion houses out here, I’m going to give y’all a little warning. I’m going to tell you a little something. I feel like last year or like this summer there is not a shoe that is gagging. There’s not a shoe that is that trend that everybody wants.”Cardi B added, “Except for them Christian Louboutin big ballerina shoes, the big heel ones. Those were something.”However, this video has raised eyebrows among fans and has sparked a divide.A fan took to X and wrote, “And we want the f*cking album”, while another fan commented, “This all she worry bout , need to worry bout that bisexual man she dating & them kids.”A third fan wrote, “The shoes is not gagging and neither is the music”, while another user posted, “You just irrelevant now love they not sending you the early drops anymore ? Maybe have Stefon call in favors like offset had to do.”However, other fans of Cardi B have shown support to her statement. A fan wrote, “She isn’t lying I’m not impressed with any of it”, while another fan wrote, “So true!!!

Wider war feared





In a statement laced with menace and finality, US President Donald Trump warned Iran to “just do it” and strike a nuclear deal, hours after Israeli airstrikes killed several of Iran’s top military leaders and nuclear scientists in a dramatic escalation in the Middle East.Trump also warned Tehran saying that “the next already planned attacks” would be even more brutal if it didn’t agree to a nuclear deal.“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal,” Trump said on Truth Social. “I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told... There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end.”Trump claimed Iran’s hardliners who had resisted previous peace overtures “are all DEAD now,” and urged Tehran to “Just do it, before it is too late.”He added, “There has already been great death and destruction… Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.”His remarks came shortly after Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a “bitter and painful” response to the Israeli strikes, which Tehran called a “declaration of war.”Among the dead were Iran’s armed forces chief Mohammad Bagheri and Revolutionary Guards head Hossein Salami. Six nuclear scientists were also reportedly killed, including at the Natanz enrichment facility.Israel said it deployed 200 fighter jets and confirmed it had targeted Iran’s core nuclear infrastructure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the strikes would “continue as many days as it takes,” accusing Tehran of nearing a nuclear weapons threshold.Iran’s Foreign Minister, in a letter to the UN, demanded an emergency response. Meanwhile, US officials maintained that they had no role in the Israeli operation, though Trump admitted to Fox News he had prior knowledge.“I told them it would be much worse than anything they know,” Trump said, boasting of US and Israeli military supremacy. “Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come, and they know how to use it.”Airports shut down, Gulf carriers suspended flights, and oil prices spiked. As the region braced for further fallout, Trump insisted diplomacy was still possible: “No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”Iran’s armed forces chief Mohammad Bagheri and Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami were among those killed in the strikes, which also claimed the lives of at least six nuclear scientists, according to Iranian media. Israel said it had struck over 100 targets across Iran, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirming that “the heart of Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme” had been hit.Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a “bitter and painful” retaliation. In a letter to the United Nations, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called on the Security Council to address what he described as an act of war.Iran’s military warned there would be “no limits” to its response. State media reported civilian deaths, including women and children, and showed images of damaged buildings, including one in Tehran hit by what appeared to be a precision strike.Trump told Fox News he had prior knowledge of the Israeli strikes, which Israel said involved 200 fighter jets. Trump also stressed that Tehran ""cannot have a nuclear bomb"".Trump said he believed a nuclear deal with Iran was “fairly close” prior to the attack but admitted the Israeli action might have changed the calculus: “I don’t want them going in… Might help it actually, but it also could blow it.”Israel declared a state of emergency and closed its airspace. Jordan intercepted drones and missiles that crossed into its airspace, while Iraq, Jordan, and Iran halted all commercial flights. Gulf airlines canceled operations in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport was shut, and long queues formed at petrol stations across the capital.The Israeli military said intelligence had shown Iran was nearing the “point of no return” in its nuclear ambitions. The IAEA confirmed Natanz was among the targets and said it was “closely monitoring” the situation.The attack comes amid ongoing regional hostilities, including Israel’s war in Gaza and skirmishes with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi movement in Yemen. Netanyahu has pledged less restraint since the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, which Iran supported.The United States has drawn down staff from regional bases, wary of Iranian threats. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Tehran against dragging Washington into the conflict, saying the US was not involved and should not be targeted.Despite the soaring tensions, Trump insisted a diplomatic path still exists, if Iran acts fast: “There is still time to make this slaughter… come to an end.”","Us president donald trump warns iran to 'just do it' and strike a nuclear deal.

Whistleblowers had been raising safety concerns over the Boeing 787 Dreamliner for years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whistleblowers-had-been-raising-safety-concerns-over-the-boeing-787-dreamliner-for-years/articleshow/121811068.cms,"Representative image





LONDON: Concerns had been raised by whistleblowers for years over the safety of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft which crashed in Ahmedabad on Thursday.John Barnett, who had worked for Boeing for more than 30 years and had been employed as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant, which builds the 787 Dreamliner, had alleged to the BBC in 2019 that under-pressure workers had been “deliberately” fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line to prevent delays on the production line.Barnett, who retired in 2017, alleged he had alerted managers to his concerns, but no action had been taken. After retiring in 2017, he commenced legal action against the company and in the week before his sudden death in March 2024, from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, he had been giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company.He had also claimed he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency.He had said that soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something Boeing has denied. He had said that in some cases, sub-standard parts had even “been removed from scrap bins” and fitted to planes that were being built.Another whistleblower, current Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour, had in April 2024 told NBC News that Boeing should “ground every 787 Dreamliner jet worldwide” after warning they are at risk of premature failure.He alleged that crews assembling the plane failed to properly fill tiny gaps when joining separately manufactured parts of the fuselage. His attorneys said this put more wear on the plane, shortening its lifespan and risking catastrophic failure.Salehpour, who has worked at Boeing for more than a decade, also claimed he faced retaliation, including exclusion from meetings, after raising concerns over these issues.Boeing has always denied these assertions and insists the 787 is safe.However the Federal Aviation Administration is currently investigating Salehpour’s allegations. It also opened an investigation in May 2024 after Boeing disclosed in April 2024 that it may not have completed required inspections to confirm adequate bonding and grounding where the wings join the fuselage on certain 787 Dreamliners. That probe is also investigating whether company employees falsified aircraft records.The aircraft involved in Thursday’s crash is an 11-year-old Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. This is the first major accident involving the 787.Boeing issued the following statement: “We are in contact with Air India regarding Flight 171 and stand ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.”","Concerns had been raised by whistleblowers for years over the safety of the boeing 787 dreamliner aircraft which crashed in ahmedabad on thursday.

The Israeli army told news agency AFP that the army is working to intercept the drones launched by Iran.The Israeli offensive on Iran this Friday resulted in injuries to at least 50 individuals, with women and children amongst the casualties, according to state television broadcasts in the Islamic republic.""Following the Israeli attack, about 50 injured people were transferred to Chamran Hospital (in Tehran), at least 35 of whom are women and children,"" the broadcaster announced in its report, with no fatalities mentioned.President Trump disclosed to Bret Baier, Fox News Channel's chief political anchor, that he had prior knowledge of Israel's planned strikes against Iran.""Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and we are hoping to get back to the negotiating table. We will see. There are several people in leadership that will not be coming back,"" Trump stated.Trump has held multiple conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the past few days.The Trump administration informed at least one significant Middle Eastern ally about the impending strike, whilst clarifying that the United States had no involvement in the military action.According to the AFP, Iran Revolutionary Guards chief Hossein Salami killed in Israeli attack. Tasnim news agency, a local media outlet, stated: ""Major General Hossein Salami, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was martyred in the Israeli regime's attack on the IRGC headquarters.""The Revolutionary Guard maintains significant influence within Iran's theocratic structure and holds authority over the nation's ballistic missile capabilities, Times of Israel reported.Israeli forces report that the initial strikes also resulted in the deaths of Mohammad Bagheri, Iran's military chief, along with several high-ranking military officials and prominent nuclear scientists.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated via YouTube that Israel conducted ""a targeted military operation roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival,"" indicating operations would persist until the threat subsides. He added that the attacks will continue “for as many days at it takes to remove this threat.”Iran warned Israel after it launched ""Operation Rising Lion"" on Thursday, said they will face a “severe punishment.”Israel “opened its wicked and blood-stained hand to a crime in our beloved country, revealing its malicious nature more than ever by striking residential centers,” Khamenei says.“With this crime, the Zionist regime has set itself for a bitter and painful fate and it will definitely receive it,” Khamenei says.Defence minister Israel Katz issued warnings about potential missile and drone attacks, declaring an emergency situation requiring adherence to protective measures. “In the wake of the state of Israel’s preventive attack against Iran, missile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately,” he said in a statement.The statement added that Katz “signed a special order declaring an emergency situation in the home front.”“It is essential to listen to instructions from the home front command and authorities to stay in protected areas,” it saidSecretary Rubio confirmed Israel's independent action, stating the US received prior notification of strikes deemed necessary for Israeli self-defence. He cautioned Iran against targeting US interests.In a statement, he said: “Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday said Israel launched a 'targeted military operation' against Iran, striking 'at the heart' of Tehran's ballistic missile programme. The Israeli PM said the attack was to roll back the threat to Israel's ""very survival"".Netanyahu said Israel's attack on Iran would ""continue for as many days as it takes"" after Israel announced it had carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites.""This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat,"" Netanyahu said in a video statement, naming the operation ""Rising Lion"", reported news agency AFP.""We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment programme. We targeted Iran's main enrichment facility at Natanz... We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile programme,"" he said, adding that Israel had also hit Iranian nuclear scientists ""working on the Iranian bomb,"" he said.""This military operation aims to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as necessary to eliminate that threat. For decades, the tyrants in Tehran have openly and brazenly called for the destruction of Israel,"" he said.Israeli PM claimed that Iran has produced ""enough highly enriched uranium for nine atomic bombs"" and that it could produce ""a nuclear weapon in a very short time"".""They have backed up their genocidal rhetoric with a program to develop nuclear weapons. In recent years, Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atomic bombs - nine. In recent months, Iran has taken steps it had never taken before - steps toward weaponising that enriched uranium. If not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be within a year. It could even be within a few months - less than a year. This poses a clear and present danger to Israel’s very existence. Eighty years ago, the Jewish people were the victims of a Holocaust perpetrated by the Nazi regime,” Netanyahu said in an address shortly after the ""Operation Rising Lion"".The attack comes hours after Iran announced that it has built and plans to activate a third nuclear enrichment facility, escalating tensions with the United Nations just after the UN’s atomic watchdog censured the country for failing to meet its nonproliferation commitments aimed at preventing the development of nuclear weapons.""The Islamic Republic of Iran has no choice but to respond to this political resolution,"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry and Atomic Energy Organisation said in a joint statement.The timing also coincides with the efforts of the United States to actively lead negotiations with Tehran aimed at reaching a deal to restrict Iran’s capacity to develop nuclear weapons.The Israeli strike followed months of friction between US President Donald Trump and Netanyahu over how best to confront Iran. Netanyahu has consistently pushed for military action as a way to thwart Iran’s nuclear ambitions.On Thursday, Trump reiterated his opposition to an Israeli attack, warning that such a move could derail diplomatic efforts. ""I think it would blow it,"" he said. Still, he acknowledged the complexity of the situation, adding, ""It might help it actually, but it could also blow it.""Earlier, Trump had dismissed an Israeli plan to launch a strike against Iran, making it clear that he wanted time to pursue a negotiated settlement with Tehran. Just two weeks ago, he said he had cautioned Netanyahu against attacking while talks were under way.However, those negotiations have stalled in recent weeks, and it remains uncertain how much effort Trump made to prevent this latest escalation.Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday said that the strikes by Israel were ""unilateral"" and that US' priority is now to protect the American forces in the region.Rubio said that Israel said that the strikes were done in the spirit of self-defence.He said that Iran must not harm US interests or personnel.In a statement, Rubio said, ""Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel.""","Israeli pm benjamin netanyahu said israel launched a 'targeted military operation' against iran, striking 'at the heart' of tehran's ballistic missile programme.

Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia defends his 'insensitive' comments about Air India crash; says it's 'outpouring of fake emotions',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-businessman-sabeer-bhatia-defends-his-insensitive-comments-about-air-india-crash-says-its-outpouring-of-fake-emotions/articleshow/121834644.cms,"Sabeer Bhatia even held a poll on X asking people whether he should take an Air India flight.

Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia made comments on Air India crash that X users found insensitive.





Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia who recently mocked the Indian economy mocked people mourning over the Air India crash in Ahmedabad and said it was an ""outpouring of fake emotions"". In a series of X posts all of which have gone viral, Bhatia asked for accountability of the crash and defended his words which social media users calls insensitive at the time of grieving.""Do you really think the 4th largest economy in the world should still be having plane crashes due to systemic failures? Time to question what truly makes a nation great,"" Bhatia posted.Social media users reminded him that there have been 55 deadly plane crashes in the US in 2025 alone to which Bhatia retorted that US has a greater number of flights as well.""Sabeer wants the attention he has lost. He wants to remind the world that he still exists,"" one wrote. ""Vulture spotted,"" another wrote. Interestingly, Bhatia engaged with all comments and even ran a poll on whether he should take an Air India flight or not.""Of course I’m deeply saddened and devastated by the loss of life. But that distracts from the real question: Why did it happen and what can we do as a society to prevent it from ever happening again?"" he wrote.""In all the angry replies I’m getting, people are responding as if their own families were on the plane. Telling me to put my phone down. So much hate, so much emotion. Where’s the logic? Do you really go through life like it’s a Bollywood movie?"" Bhatia wrote.""The right words aren’t “devastated” or “pained by the tragic loss” — those center the speaker. Say instead: “The families of the victims are in our thoughts and prayers.” It’s about them, not you,"" he added.""In the past few days of vitriolic backlash, I keep hearing the term “colonial mindset” — as if the West looks down on India. That’s simply untrue. What shocks people in the West isn’t India — it’s the poor decisions of its leaders. If anything, that is the real colonial hangover,"" he said.","Sabeer bhatia held a poll on x asking people whether he should take an air india flight.
