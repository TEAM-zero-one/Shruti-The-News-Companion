NEW DELHI: Operation Sindoor against Pakistan in May was just an ""88-hour trailer"" without the film actually beginning, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said Monday, warning that the Indian armed forces were fully ready to ""teach"" the western adversary ""how to behave responsibly"" if the need arose in future.General Dwivedi also said relations between India and China have improved a lot since Oct last year after dialogue among the leaders of the two nations to usher in ""normalcy"", with military commanders on the ground also regularly meeting to resolve local issues.Addressing a curtain raiser event of the Chanakya Defence Dialogue, the Army chief delivered a stern message to Pakistan by stressing that as per the ""new normal"" India will continue to consider terrorists and their supporters alike.""Blood and water cannot flow together. Talks and terror cannot go together. India focuses on progress and prosperity. If someone creates obstacles in our path, then we will have to take some action against them,"" he added.Alluding to Pakistan's nuclear sabre-rattling, General Dwivedi said ""India is in a position today where it is not scared of any blackmailing"". India has the political will and military capabilities, which are increasing by the day, for the requisite deterrence, he said.""Deterrence works only when the adversary believes you will act the way you warn them...the other side takes your resolve seriously. Today, our deterrence is working,"" he said. On lessons learnt from Op Sindoor, General Dwivedi stressed the importance of integration among the Army, IAF, Navy and other forces, the need for timely decision-making at every level of the command chain, and ensuring proper ammunition and other supplies for even long-drawn out battles.He said the situation in J&K has improved significantly after the scrapping of Article 370 in Aug 2019. ""After this, political clarity has come. There has been a huge decline in terrorism...,"" he said, adding that of the 31 militants eliminated this year, over 60% were of Pakistani-origin.","General dwivedi said relations between india and china have improved a lot since oct last year.

Bangladesh witnessed a series of crude bomb explosions in Dhaka on Sunday, police confirmed to Reuters, heightening tensions across the capital ahead of Monday's verdict in a case against former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina over alleged violence during last year's street protests.No casualties were reported, but the incidents added to the anxiety already gripping the city after days of unrest. Security was tightened overnight across Dhaka and other regions amid sporadic arson attacks and crude bomb blasts.Hasina, 78, is being tried in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering a deadly action against student demonstrators in mid-2024. She denies all allegations and has been in India since fleeing there following her ouster in August last year.Security agencies - including military, paramilitary and police units - were placed on heightened alert after reports that Hasina's now-defunct Awami League had announced a two-day shutdown ahead of the International Crimes Tribunal–Bangladesh (ICT-BD) verdict.On Sunday night, unidentified assailants set fire to a vehicle dumping corner inside a police station complex and detonated two crude bombs outside the residence of an advisory council member of interim government chief Professor Muhammad Yunus.Several intersections across Dhaka also witnessed explosions.The Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) issued strict orders to crack down on violent mobs, authorising personnel to shoot if necessary. ICT-BD prosecutors have demanded the death penalty for the former leader.“I stated over the wireless that anyone who sets a bus on fire or throws crude bombs with intent to kill should be shot. This authority is clearly provided in our law,” Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner SM Sazzat Ali said late Sunday.Since November 10, the capital has seen a wave of mostly predawn attacks, including crude bombs detonated at the entrance of the Grameen Bank headquarters in Mirpur, founded by Yunus. Several branches of the bank were also targeted with coordinated petrol bomb and arson attacks, officials said.Multiple buses were torched during the week, resulting in the death of a sleeping driver.Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal are facing trial in absentia, while the third accused — former police chief Abdullah Al Mamun — appeared in person and has turned “approver”, apparently seeking leniency.“We have sought the highest possible sentence for Hasina. We also requested seizure of the convicts’ property for distribution among families of martyrs and injured victims of last year’s violent street protests,” ICT-BD prosecutor Gazi MH Tamim said.He added that under ICT-BD law, Hasina cannot appeal to the Supreme Court’s Appellate Division unless she surrenders or is arrested within 30 days of the judgment.The verdict is expected to be broadcast live on state-run BTV, with screens installed at multiple locations in Dhaka. Select parts will be aired after tribunal clearance, and live streaming will also be available on ICT-BD’s official Facebook page.In an audio message posted on the Awami League’s Facebook page, Hasina dismissed the charges and urged supporters to remain calm. “We have seen enough of these attacks and cases, this is just a matter of time,” she said.Interim government home affairs adviser, retired lieutenant general Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said the verdict, “whatever it is, will be executed”.Authorities remain on high alert nationwide to avert unrest.Hasina and several senior Awami League leaders face accusations ranging from murder to corruption and abuse of power. Monday’s verdict relates to five counts of alleged crimes against humanity during the July Uprising of 2024, including killings, attempted killings, torture, use of lethal force against unarmed student protesters, deployment of heavy weapons and drones, and specific killings in Rangpur and Dhaka.Hasina insists she is being targeted, accusing interim government chief Yunus of plotting her ouster. She labelled him a “usurper”, saying, “Let them try me, I don’t care… The verdict will not be able to gouge my mouth.”Calling the charges “entirely false”, she added, “If someone makes a false complaint in court, he is tried under law, and one day it will happen.” She also cited Article 7(B) of the Constitution, saying, “If someone by force removes the elected representatives from power, they will be punished. Yunus just did it.”","Bangladesh braces for sheikh hasina judgment amid crude bomb attacks and emergency security measures.

Rudra may change how Army operates: Upgrade likely from ‘Cold Start’ to ‘Cold Strike’ doctrine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rudra-may-change-how-army-operates/articleshow/125374266.cms,"CDS General Anil Chauhan Highlights Inter-Service Jointness And Integration In Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: With the successful testing of a newly-raised integrated 'Rudra' all-arms brigade in the major tri-Service Trishul exercise on the western front with Pakistan, the Army may now well upgrade its ‘Cold Start’ doctrine to 'Cold Strike' for swifter and greater offensive thrusts into enemy territory.This doctrinal evolution has gained ground after Southern Army Command chief Lt-General Dhiraj Seth said performance of the Rudra brigade under the 12 `Konark’ Corps, with integration of all fighting arms backed by combat support and logistics, was “fully validated operationally” during the `Akhand Prahar’ drills in the desert sector under the just-concluded Trishul exercise.“Now, with the Rudra brigade, the time has come to change the Cold Start doctrine into the Cold Strike one. I am fully satisfied that the Rudra brigades in the coming times will be successful in multi-domain operations and executing their task effectively against the enemy,” Lt-Gen Seth said.The Army had formulated its “pro-active conventional war strategy”, colloquially called the Cold Start doctrine, after its “strike formations” under Operation Parakram took almost a month to mobilise at the border launch pads against Pakistan in wake of the terror attack on Parliament in Dec 2001.By that time, Pakistan had shored up its defences, and the US also had jumped in to pressurize India against launching any cross-border attack. Having learnt a harsh operational lesson, the Army since then has been refining its strategy for faster mobilisation for multiple but limited offensives into enemy territory under the nuclear overhang.Pakistan, which does not have a “no first-use” nuclear policy like India, in turn, took to brandishing its short-range Nasr (Hatf-IX) and other nuclear-capable missiles as an effective counter to the Cold Start conventional military strategy.Now, the 11.5-lakh strong Army is converting a few of its over 250 single-arm brigades (each has over 3,000 troops) into Rudra all-arms brigades, with integration of infantry, mechanized infantry, armoured (tanks), artillery, air defence, engineers, signals and drone units, along with logistics and combat-support elements.In effect, a Rudra brigade brings together all fighting arms and support units into a self-contained group even during peacetime to ensure much better cohesion and faster mobilization for combined arms operations.Two Rudra brigades have already come up on the northern borders with China, one in eastern Ladakh and the other in Sikkim. “Each Rudra brigade will be tailor-made as per its earmarked area of operation, the type of terrain there and the operational task to be executed. The brigades will have units that can be attached or detached as per the requirements,” an officer said.As for the `Akhand Prahar’ drills, the “full-spectrum combat readiness” of the Konark Corps was validated through integrated employment of all arms and services from mechanised and infantry manoeuvres to the execution of land operations by the Rudra Brigade called ‘Black Mace’, special heliborne operations, and coordinated attack helicopter missions. “It also witnessed seamless synergy between the Army and IAF, with fighter ground attack missions in close support of the land forces,” another officer said.","The army may now well upgrade its 'cold start' doctrine to 'cold strike' for swifter and greater offensive thrusts into enemy territory.

India Sends Strong Warning To Pakistan As Army Chief Says The Real Movie Begins After Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Monday delivered a strong message to Pakistan and terror outfits operating from its soil, declaring that India’s recent counterterror offensive, Operation Sindoor , was “just a trailer” and that the country is fully prepared for future challenges.His clear warning to Pakistan comes days after a car blast in the vicinity of historical Red Fort in New Delhi.Addressing the Chanakya Defence Dialogue, the Army chief said India would deal equally with terrorists and those backing them. ""When a country encourages state-sponsored terrorism, it becomes a matter of concern for India. India talks about progress. If someone creates obstacles in our course, then we will have to take some action against them.""""When we talk about the new normal, we have said that talks and terror can't go together. All we are asking is to adopt a peaceful process, which we will cooperate with. Until then, we will treat terrorists and their sponsors alike. We will respond to those who encourage terrorists. Today, India is so accomplished that it is not scared of any blackmail attempts,"" he said.Speaking about Operation Sindoor, he added, ""Operation Sindoor was just a trailer which ended in 88 hours.We are prepared for any circumstances in future. If Pakistan gives a chance, we will teach it how to behave responsibly with a neighbouring nation...""The Army chief further noted that modern conflict requires coordination across several platforms, saying, ""In today's time, battles are multi-domain. We cannot say how long it will last. We have to ensure we have supplies to last long.""Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after the Pakistan-backed Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which claimed 26 lives in Anantnag district, Jammu and Kashmir. India later launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, destroying multiple terror hubs and air bases across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The standoff eased only after Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations initiated talks for a peace agreement. However, India has maintained that the operation is in a paused state, not fully terminated, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi having warned that any future ""act of terror"" would be treated as an ""act of war.""",Army chief general upendra dwivedi delivered a strong message to pakistan and terror outfits operating from its soil.

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

High votes, low wins: The big contradiction



Contest more seats



NDA's math clicked, MGB's math cracked



JD(U)'s comeback flipped the story



BJP grows bigger than ever



MGB slipped because allies didn't deliver



Jan Suraaj and AIMIM changed the margins



So, what really happened?



NEW DELHI: Bihar's 2025 election results threw up a story full of surprises. Tejashwi Yadav 's RJD turned out to be the party with highest vote share in the state, yet it ended up with one of its lowest seat tallies ever. On the other hand, the NDA kept the power with landslide victory, clinching over 200 seats in 243-member assembly, keeping the Mahagathbandhan far from the seat of government.RJD recorded a vote share of around 23 percent, just few decimals down from 2020, when it got 23.11 and emerged as the largest party with 75 seats. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats. So the striking question is: how can a party get the most votes, yet finish with so few seats?The answer lies in how votes were spread. RJD seems to have polled a large number of second-position votes. It remained popular, but not with enough concentrated support in winning zones.In simple terms, RJD got votes but not victories. This is no surprise in India's electoral mechanism of 'First Past the Post System.'RJD contested 143 seats this time, the highest among all parties across both the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan. In the 2020 assembly elections, the Lalu-led party had fielded one more candidate, contesting 144 seats.Contesting widely helped the party accumulate more total votes, contributing to the highest vote share. But losing candidates also add to vote share totals.Meanwhile, BJP and JD(U) fought on 101 seats each. They contested fewer seats but converted their votes efficiently into victories. That is why their seat count shot up, even with a lower vote share than RJD.A major turning point this election was the return of Chirag Paswan's LJP (Ram Vilas) to the NDA camp. In 2020, the LJP had hurt the NDA's chances by cutting into its votes, but this time its support helped strengthen the alliance instead of splitting it.In the previous election, LJP (RV) was unhappy with the NDA's seat-sharing formula in Bihar. Even though it was part of the alliance at the Centre, Chirag Paswan chose to go solo in the state and contested 134 seats, which ended up damaging NDA numbers—especially Nitish Kumar 's JD(U).Similarly, Upendra Kushwaha's party contested 104 seats independently in 2020, further cutting into votes that could have benefitted the NDA.This time, with both LJP (RV) and Kushwaha’s RLM back in the NDA fold, the alliance appeared far more united, organised, and prepared. The result: NDA outperformed the Mahagathbandhan by a wide margin.One of the biggest turnarounds happened in seats where RJD and JD(U) were in direct fight.In 2020, RJD dominated these contests. But in 2025, JD(U) turned the tables and won 50 out of 59, almost wiping out RJD in head-to-head battles. JD(U)'s vote share also jumped from 15.39 percent in 2020 to 19.25 percent this time, helping it win 85 seats from the tally of 43 last time.RJD simply failed to see this drastic reversal coming.The BJP crossed 89 seats, its highest tally ever in Bihar, marking a historic leap for a party that once had almost no grassroots base or ideological legacy in the state. By staying aligned for years with ""sushasan babu"" and steadily expanding its footprint, the saffron party has now grown into Bihar's biggest political force.With this mandate, the BJP has effectively redrawn the political map of Bihar. It now sits at the centre of power, holding the strongest bargaining position in the alliance. For years, Nitish Kumar played the ""big brother"" to the BJP, but for the second election in a row, the BJP has outperformed the JD(U), this time doing so with its best-ever numbers.The shift isn't just about arithmetic -- it's psychological. For decades, Bihar's political story revolved around the Lalu–Nitish axis. Today, it revolves around the BJP’s weight, influence and negotiating power.Unlike NDA, the Mahagathbandhan struggled with coordination and clarity.Congress contested on 61 seats as compared to last time's 70, but won only six. The Left parties, which surprised everyone in 2020, could not repeat their performance either. Seat-sharing disagreements and confusing ""friendly fights"" meant votes did not transfer smoothly within the alliance.The opposition was visible but not united -- and unity decides tight contests.Prashant Kishor's much-talked about startup -- Jan Suraaj did not open its account, but it made a strategic dent, in at least 35 seats, its vote share was higher than the winning margin, influencing outcomes for both alliances.Meanwhile, AIMIM repeated its strong Seemanchal performance, winning five seats with 1.85 percent of votes and signalling a shift in political thinking among Muslim voters.The traditional Muslim–Yadav (MY) vote base of the RJD showed signs of fragmentation, with Muslim voters exploring alternative platforms in multiple constituencies, leading to a near wipeout of the Mahagathbandhan in Seemanchal, barring one Congress candidate who scraped through.Mayawati's BSP also registered a presence, securing 1.62% of the total vote share with one seat in the west.RJD did not lose popularity, but lost positional advantage. It remained a strong choice for many voters but could not cross the finishing line often enough. High vote share created the impression of strength, but seats reflect actual power -- and that is where NDA towered above everyone.","Rjd recorded a vote share of around 23 percent, just few decimals down from 2020, when it got 23.11 and emerged as the largest party with 75 seats. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats.

What It Means For Indian Workers

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: India remained the largest source of international students in the US in 2024-25, with 3,63,019 students registered on American campuses - a 10% rise over last year. The increase is slower than 2023-24's dizzying 23% jump.Tougher visa scrutiny, longer appointment queues and jitters over work-visa routes have done little to dent India's presence on American campuses. China, once the unchallenged frontrunner, continued to slide for the fifth straight year, this time by 4% to touch 2,65,919 students. Overall, international student enrolment in the US from across the globe dropped 7% and early signals hint at gathering headwinds. The Fall 2025 Snapshot reports a 1% dip in overall international numbers and a 17% plunge in new arrivals.Indian students spent a total of $14 billion for their education, stay and other expenses in the US, almost matching China's spend of $14.6 billion, the highest by any nation. In 2023-24, Indians had spent $11.8 billion.In 2024-25, undergraduate enrolments (see box) from India rose 11%, but graduate numbers, traditionally India's strongest stream, fell 9.5%.Optional Practical Training, that allows graduates to gain practical work experience after academic study, surged 47%. Globally, the number of new international students entering US institutions in the Fall of 2024 fell 7%, with new undergraduates up 5% but new graduate entrants down 15%. Data on Indian students showed that 63% enrolled in public institutions and 37% opted for private institutes. They mostly went to campuses in Texas, New York, Massachusetts, California and Illinois.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan told TOI, ""Wherever Indian students go, they excel - not by chance, but by capability and character."" He added, ""Our youth are driving global classrooms, research labs, and innovation economies with the same confidence with which they are shaping India's own growth story.""""International students come to the US to advance their education and contribute to US colleges and communities,"" said Jason Czyz, Institute of International Education (IIE) president and CEO.""This data highlights the impact international students have in driving innovation, advancing scholarship, and strengthening cross-cultural understanding.""International students account for 6% of the total US higher education population.

The US remains the top destination for international students globally.Twelve of the top 25 countries sending international students reached their largest totals to date - Bangladesh, Canada, Colombia, Ghana, India, Italy, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Spain, and Vietnam.For the upcoming admission season, US institutions are prioritising undergraduate outreach in Vietnam (55% of institutions which participated in the Snapshot survey), India (49%), Brazil (39%), and South Korea (39%).Colleges and universities focusing on graduate recruitment are as follows: India (57%), Vietnam (32%), China (28%), and Bangladesh (28%).The Snapshot Survey of Open Doors 2025 reveals an increase in undergraduates (+2%) and a decline in graduate (-12%) students.

Isro is set to launch seven more satellites, including the liftoff of a PSLV rocket made entirely by the industry in the current financial year.The Isro chief said the Chandrayaan-4 mission will be India's most complex lunar endeavour yet. “We are targeting 2028 for Chandrayaan-4,” he said. Chandrayaan-4 is also called LUPEX (Lunar Polar Exploration Mission) and is a joint programme between Isro and Japan's space agency Jaxa. The LUPEX project is aimed at exploring the Moon for water and other resources and gaining expertise in exploring the surface of the Moon. “Acquiring technologies needed for rovers and landers to operate in the harsh lunar environment is very important for pursuing space exploration,” said Jaxa.Narayanan said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has directed Isro to work towards sending Indian astronauts to the lunar surface and bringing them back safely by 2040. India’s planning for a manned lunar mission comes against the backdrop of the US gearing up to send crewed missions to the Moon under the Artemis programme, most probably next year, and China setting a 2030 target for its first crewed landing on the Moon.On the Gaganyaan mission, Narayanan said only the timeframe for uncrewed missions has been shifted, and there is no change in the manned mission schedule. “The uncrewed mission was targeted for 2025. The crewed mission was always planned for 2027, and we are holding on to that date,” he said.Narayanan said Isro has also begun work on Bharatiya Antariksha Station, targeted for completion by 2035. “The first of the five modules will be placed in orbit by 2028,” he said. The mission, if successful, will make India the third country to operate a space station -- the US-led multi-country station ISS is nearing the end of life and will be deorbited in year 2030 and China's Tiangong station is moving into full gear.","The chandrayaan-4 mission will be india's most complex lunar endeavour yet.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday issued a travel advisory after Iran suspended its visa-waiver facility for ordinary Indian passport holders. The suspension takes effect on November 22, 2025, from when Indian nationals will be required to obtain a visa to enter or transit through Iran.The move follows multiple incidents in which Indian nationals were allegedly lured to Iran on false job promises or assurances of onward travel to other countries.According to the MEA, several Indian nationals were deceived with fake job offers or promises of onward travel to third countries and were encouraged to use Iran’s visa-free entry to make the journey. Once they arrived, many were reportedly kidnapped for ransom.""The attention of Government has been drawn to several incidents of Indian nationals being lured to Iran on false promises of employment or with assurances of onward transit to third countries. These individuals were tricked into journeying to Iran by taking advantage of the visa waiver facility available for ordinary Indian passport holders. On arrival in Iran, many of them were kidnapped for ransom,"" the MEA said through a statement.In response, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has halted the visa-free entry provision to prevent further misuse.The MEA has strongly advised Indians planning to travel to Iran to ""remain vigilant"" and to avoid any agents offering visa-free entry or transit arrangements via Iran.Earlier this year, a 26-year-old man from Karala in northwest Delhi was reportedly kidnapped and held in Iran. The victim, Himanshu Mathur, was detained for a week and released after his family paid a ransom of Rs 20 lakh.Mathur was reportedly kidnapped and held in Iran after being lured with promises of a job and Australian work visa. He initially contacted Aman Rathi, who convinced him to complete a 15-day course in Noida and later arranged for him to travel to Jakarta and then Tehran. Instead of proceeding to Australia, Mathur and Rathi were abducted in Chabahar and held by a gang.In a separate case, a young man from Amritsar, who had hoped to move to the United Kingdom, reportedly fell victim to an international visa scam and was held hostage in Iran. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of Rs 50 lakh for his release. Gurpreet Singh, a resident of Granthgarh village in Ajnala Tehsil, had travelled to Iran on September 14, believing a UK visa would be arranged for him from there.","The suspension takes effect on november 22, 2025, from when indian nationals will be required to obtain a visa to enter or transit through iran.

Rebel Tanea Brooks’ sudden absence from AEW television had puzzled fans for months, especially after Britt Baker’s rise changed the dynamics on screen. What many did not know was that Rebel, a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and well known AEW personality, had been quietly fighting a private battle. On November 16, that silence ended when she revealed a heartbreaking health update that showed how much she had been carrying behind the scenes.In an Instagram post, the 47 year old announced that she has been diagnosed with lung cancer. She shared the news with honesty, emotion, and a clear request to her supporters. “Health update,” wrote Rebel Tanea in the caption of the post. “Asking for your prayers and support 🙏🏼. I hope to keep you updated in my rehab journey. #lymphoma #cancer #nonhodgkinslymphoma #lungs #fnd #css #mycobacteriumabscessus #rebel. ” Her message set the tone for a video where she explained the long chain of struggles she has been facing.In the video, Rebel revealed that she would begin rehab on November 17 while also managing another serious condition. She explained that she has Functional Neurological Disorder, which has affected her mobility in ways she never expected.“Along this tumultuous journey, I picked up a little disorder called functional neurological disorder, and it has taken my ability to walk,” said Rebel Tanea. “I now walk with a walker. And my ability to speak clearly. I think you can tell, but it sounds like I bit my tongue. And I have also lost the ability… or function, I guess I should say, of my right hand, and I have kind of like a claw hand.”Even with these challenges, she has continued to push forward. She recently suffered an arm injury and is currently dealing with an infection, which requires IV antibiotics before any cancer treatment can begin. She described rehab as “a full-time job,” yet her voice carried determination.The most emotional moment came when she confirmed that she is battling Primary Pulmonary Lymphoma, a rare form of lung cancer. Earlier in May 2024, doctors had misdiagnosed her with Cryptococcal pneumonia. After months of infections, ruptures, and failed treatments, she turned to the Mayo Clinic. “And after a year of not getting better, I decided to go to the Mayo Clinic and see if I could get treated by them,” said Rebel Tanea. “And they found that it was not Cryptococcal pneumonia this whole time, and that is primary pulmonary lymphoma, which is cancer in the lungs, and if there’s a best-case scenario, then I have it, so that’s good.”She now awaits a third bronchoscopy in December to determine whether she will begin radiation or immunotherapy. Despite the uncertainty, Rebel thanked her fans and promised to keep them close on her journey forward.","Ex-cowboys cheerleader rebel tanea brooks urgently asks for prayers amid unexpected lung cancer diagnosis.

Visa Breach Ends India Visit for Blacklisted UK Scholar and Hindi Literature Expert Francesca Orsini





: PoK-origin UK home secretary Shabana Mahmood announced Monday that Trump-style visa bans will be imposed on countries unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants, as she revealed further sweeping reforms to tackle illegal immigration.The first countries to face such a ban are Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo whose nationals will no longer be granted UK visas unless their govts rapidly improve cooperation on removals. “These countries face penalties for their unacceptably low co-operation and obstructive returns processes. Thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from these nations are currently in the UK,” the home office said.Non-cooperation includes embassies failing to process removals paperwork in time and requiring individuals to sign their own documentation — allowing them to block their own deportation.India is thought to be one of several other countries most resistant to taking back illegal migrants and could join the list over the coming year, the Times (UK) reported.Human rights laws will also be overhauled to scale up deportations and prevent migrants from “gaming the system”.UK’s govt will legislate to reform how Article 8 (the right to family and private life) is interpreted by the courts to make clear a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child — blocking people from using dubious connections to stay in the UK. It will also work with partners at the Council of Europe to address the “over-expansive application” of Article 3 (protection against inhuman and degrading treatments) which migrants are also using to block their removal and introduce new legislation to crack down on “migrants making last-minute bogus modern slavery claims”. Migrants will be restricted to arguing all legal grounds within a single appeal and, if they lose, they will be forced to leave.New capped work and study routes for genuine refugees will be created who will be referred through partners such as the UNHCR. British people will be encouraged to house them, as they have done for Ukrainians, to end the reliance on asylum hotels, which cost £2.1 billion in 2024-2025.In the year ending June 2025 a total of 5,475 Indian nationals claimed asylum in the UK making them the sixth-largest nationality. Of these, 346 Indians arrived by small boat illegally. The other Indians were mostly on visas, with student visas being the most common. The top nationality to claim asylum was Pakistani; followed by nationals from Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea and Bangladesh.Only 20 Indians were granted asylum in the year ending June 2025, and 2,691 had their claims refused.","Angola, namibia and the democratic republic of congo will face visa bans unless their govts rapidly improve cooperation on removals.

Ousted Bangladesh PM Hasina Calls ICT’s Death Sentence ‘Rigged’, Says It Denied Fair Trial Rights





Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday slammed the International Crimes Tribunal’s decision to sentence her to death on charges of “crimes against humanity”.In a statement, Hasina claimed that the ruling, linked to the student-led protests of August 2024, was “biased and politically motivated.”""The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,"" Hasina said. ""They are biased and politically motivated. Its guilty verdict against me was a foregone conclusion.""She acknowledged the government had lost control of the situation at the time but maintained that the unrest did not amount to a ""premeditated"" assault on civilians.""We lost control of the situation but cannot characterise what happened as premeditated assault on citizens,"" Hasina said.Criticising the verdicts, Hasina described the process as “rigged” and alleged that the drive for a death sentence was a calculated effort by hardline officials to sideline her and undermine her party, Awami League.Also read: Bangladesh's ousted PM Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death; key takeaways from verdict ""In their distasteful call for the death penalty, they reveal the brazen and murderous intent of extremist figures within the interim government to remove Bangladesh’s last elected prime minister, and to nullify the Awami League as a political force,"" Hasina added.She defended her record in office, citing Bangladesh’s accession to the International Criminal Court, the sheltering of Rohingya refugees, major gains in electricity access and education, and significant economic growth that lifted millions out of poverty.""We led Bangladesh to join the International Criminal Court in 2010, gave refuge to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar, expanded access to electricity and education, and presided over a 450% GDP growth over 15 years, lifting millions out of poverty. These achievements are a matter of historical record,"" Hasina said.She said these achievements demonstrate her government’s commitment to human rights , adding that her critics, including Yunus (chief adviser) can claim ""no achievements that are remotely comparable.""Hasina was sentenced to death on Monday by the International Crimes Tribunal in Dhaka, which found her guilty of “crimes against humanity” in connection with last year’s student-led protests that precipitated the fall of her Awami League government.Also read: No real evidence against me, says Sheikh Hasina ahead of crucial verdict Meanwhile, Bangladesh's interim government has described the death sentence handed down to Sheikh Hasina as a “historic verdict.” It also urged the public to remain calm, exercise restraint, and act responsibly in the wake of the decision.According to the charge document, the tribunal stated, ""Sheikh Hasina has committed crimes against humanity. Six protesters at Chankharpul were killed using lethal weapons on August 5. By issuing orders and through the inaction of Sheikh Hasina, the then home minister, and the IG of police, the students were killed. These killings happened under the orders and full knowledge of PM Sheikh Hasina. By such acts, they committed crimes against humanity.

Protests erupted in Bangladesh following ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina' death sentence over 'crimes against humanity'. Demonstrators clashed with security forces while trying to pull down the remaining parts of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s house. The Rapid Action Battalion moved in to block the attempt, using batons, sound grenades and tear gas to drive the protesters back. Police told the Daily Star that at least six sound grenades went off on Mirpur Road.“Several sound grenades were used to disperse the protesters,” said Masud Alam. Both protesters and police were injured as bricks were thrown and officers carried out baton-charges.Even after being pushed away once, some protesters gathered again near Square Hospital on Panthapath, where police fired more tear gas. Traffic on Mirpur Road and nearby areas stopped completely, and most shops shut their shutters.Police had controlled both sides of Mirpur Road earlier in the day, but around 2:45pm they stepped back as protesters pushed forward. By about 3:05pm, the army, police and Rab moved in together with batons and sound grenades and took back control of the area, the agency reported.The protesters had brought two excavators before the protests broke out, showing they planned to dismantle the house.Parts of the building had already been damaged in a protest in February. Police set up barricades at the front gate and have not allowed anyone inside since.Witnesses said crowds began gathering from around 11:30am, marching towards Dhanmondi 32 and shouting slogans against the deposed prime minister.They chanted “Delhi na Dhaka? Dhaka, Dhaka!”; “Bottrish na Chhottrish? Chhottrish, Chhottrish!”; “Dalali na Mukti? Mukti, Mukti!”; and “Khuni Hasinar Fashi Chai,” the Daily Star reported.Earlier in the day, Bangladesh’s interim government called the death sentence given to Sheikh Hasina a “historic verdict”. It has also urged people to stay calm, show restraint and act responsibly after the ruling.The court said she was responsible both for giving orders and for failing to stop the killings during the unrest.However, the former PM responded, ""the verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate.”She also called the ruling ""biased and politically motivated.”",Protests erupted in bangladesh following ousted prime minister sheikh hasina' death sentence over 'crimes against humanity' demonstrators clashed with security forces while trying to pull down the remaining parts of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman’s house.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125385767,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-193244,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers

'I wish there were more people doing this'







Indian-origin venture capitalist Asha Jadeja Motwani claimed she is behind President Donald Trump's changed stance on H-1B, the visa program that allows US tech companies to hire skilled workers from foreign countries, including India. Motwani, who is also a donor to the Republican Party, said that she spoke with both President Trump and Vice President JD Vance on the value of bringing in the top talent from India into the US.""I have spoken to both JD Vance and President Trump about the fact that people like #RajeevMotwani and i would not have come easily into the US if the current H1B drama had been playing out in the 1980s.,"" Motwani posted on X. Her husband Rajeev Motwani was an Indian-American professor of computer science at Stanford University.Asha Motwani said the Trump-Vance administration is open to good ideas but not enough HNI (high net worth individuals) Indian-Americans are pursuing the Indian-American issue. ""I spent the weekend in Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach and got unusual access to the president with very little effort. I wish there were more people doing this alongside me. Engaging with the current administration in Washington DC is easy and very, very doable.In fact, it is welcomed by everybody,"" she wrote.""Almost one year into batting for India in Washington DC, I am truly shocked that there is not a single other HNI Indian American helping India in DC,"" Motwani said adding that Indian-American billionaires are only close to the Democrats and they are not doing any lobbying in the DC.""When I asked the usual Indian American billionaires why they are not helping our home country, most give the excuse that they know only the Democrats. This does not fly with me anymore. I have lost respect for some friends who on the pretext of “not liking Trump & Vance” are doing a diddley squat for India or US. It is in American geopolitical and economic interest that India is in the American pocket and not with anybody else. We in the diaspora can make this happen and we must put in our effort,"" Motwani wrote.In his latest FOX interview, Trump said America needs certain types of talent as he was speaking on the H-1B issue. This sent shockwaves through the MAGA base as they claimed that Trump meant that American does not have enough good talent. The Donald Trump administration, however, clarified that they welcome foreigners to study, train and then to eventually go back to their own countries.",Indian-origin venture capitalist asha jadeja motwani said she is behind trump's change of heart on h-1b as she constantly lobbied for india in the dc.
