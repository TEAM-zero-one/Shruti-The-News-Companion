Ask for IDs of those you are deporting, says SC bench

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday sought a clarification from the Centre whether speaking Bengali was being used as one of the grounds for deportation of individuals but agreed with the Union govt that border forces had the right to repulse entry of illegal migrants as they pose a danger to the nation's demography, security and strain its resources.For the West Bengal govt's migrant workers' welfare board, advocate Prashant Bhushan told a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that people are being deported just for speaking Bengali, without any verification of their citizenship by authorities or through a tribunal. ""India can't push out anyone out of the country without following due procedure to determine their citizenship. Those pushed out face bullets from both sides, border forces of India and Bangladesh,"" he said.They are caught in a crossfire. This is per se illegal and violative of the right to life,"" he said. The bench said, ""Security forces have a right to repulse illegal migrants. Only if the person is on Indian soil that the procedure is to be followed...We will request the Centre to clarify its stand whether speaking Bengali is a ground for deportation.Is there a bias among officials to treat persons speaking a certain language as foreigners?"" Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, ""Obviously speaking Bengali is not a ground for deportation. """"However, India cannot be the world's capital for illegal migrants. Why is no individual petitioning SC? Why organisations are coming forward. There are states which are promoting illegal migrants to come in and settle in India. It is very disturbing that a systematic racket is going on to facilitate illegal migrants to enter a border state,"" he said and drew the court's attention to massive problems faced by European countries because of the influx of illegal migrants.The bench agreed that illegal migrants are a problem and said, ""They pose threat to the nation's security, integrity and demography as well as a strain on its resources. It is a serious international issue and very complicated too. However, In West Bengal and Punjab, the people on either side of the border speak the same language and share culture. So, language alone could not be the tool to identify foreigners.""The bench said, ""Pushing back illegal migrants is not an issue. But those whom you are deporting, you must ask for their identity proof."" Mehta said those affected by deportation should complain to the court and they could be provided with legal aid to present their case. ""Illegal migrants are facing serious problems in the US. Bhushan should go there to assist them,"" he snidely remarked.Referring to reports of a wall built at the US-Mexico border, the bench asked, ""Are you going to build a wall at the border like America?"" Mehta said India is fencing the border with Bangladesh and the matter was supervised by SC to stop illegal immigration.","Justices surya kant, joymalya bagchi and vipul m pancholi agreed with the union govt that border forces had the right to repulse entry of illegal migrants.

India, China Can Stabilize Global Economic Order, Call For Peace: PM Modi's BIG MESSAGE From Japan

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi set the stage for his meeting with President Xi on Sunday as he said in Tokyo that given the current volatility in world economy, it is important for India and China, as 2 major economies, to work together to bring stability to the world economic order. He said India is ready to carry forward the relationship based on respect for each other's interests and sensitivities.However, Modi later also joined his Japanese counterpart Shigeru Ishiba in expressing serious concern - in the India-Japan annual summit joint statement - over the situation in East China Sea , where Japan is locked in a territorial dispute with Beijing over the uninhabited Senkaku/ Diaoyu islands, and South China Sea.Coupled with the first India-Philippines joint patrolling in the South China Sea earlier this month, the joint statement suggests India will continue to push back against any aggressive manoeuvring by Beijing in the region, despite the ongoing efforts to narrow differences and normalise the relationship with China. “India and Japan are fully committed towards a free, open, peaceful, prosperous, and rules-based Indo-Pacific,’’ said Modi, addressing the media jointly with Ishiba.India and Japan also adopted a new declaration on security cooperation that is seen as more in sync with current realities and efforts to ensure a coercion-free Indo-Pacific that upholds rules-based international order. Both leaders also backed the Quad summit that India has to host this year.Earlier in the day, in a newspaper interview, Modi underlined the “steady and positive” progress in ties since his last meeting with Xi in October last year. He said India is ready to advance bilateral relations with China from a strategic and long-term perspective on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity, and to enhance strategic communication to address our developmental challenges.“Stable, predictable, and amicable bilateral relations between India and China, as two neighbours and the two largest nations on earth, can have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity,” said Modi, adding that this is also crucial for a multi-polar Asia and a multi-polar world.Modi arrives in Tianjin in China on Saturday evening to participate in the SCO summit. His first engagement in China will be in the form of a bilateral meeting with Xi on Sunday morning.Both India and China have sought to stabilise the relationship, saying that they should not allow differences to turn into disputes. It will be interesting to see if China reacts to the concern expressed by Modi and Ishiba over the situation in East China Sea.Modi and his Japanese counterpart in the joint statement also reiterated their strong opposition to any unilateral actions that endanger the safety as well as freedom of navigation and overflight, and attempt to change the status quo by force or coercion. In remarks aimed at China, they shared their serious concern over the militarization of disputed features. “They reaffirmed that maritime disputes must be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law, in particular the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),” said the India-Japan joint statement.",Pm narendra modi says it is important for india and china to work together to bring stability to the world economic order.

Amid the global instability wrought by the US tariff policy, PM Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shigeru Ishiba announced a slew of measures, including a Joint Vision for the Next Decade, to boost ties in areas like trade and investment, AI, energy, critical minerals, human resources and defence and security.Among the highlights was a private-investment target of $ 67 billion from Japan to India over the next 10 years, an economic security initiative that identified semiconductors, critical minerals, pharmaceuticals and clean energy as key areas of collaboration and a renewal of the 2008 security declaration aimed at keeping the Indo-Pacific free of coercion in the face of Chinese assertiveness.Both leaders reaffirmed commitment to deepening the Quad partnership and backed the summit that India has to host in November, even though President Donald Trump’s proposed visit to India remains uncertain because of the strained India-US relationship. India and Japan also announced an action plan for talent mobility that will see an exchange of more than 500,000 personnel in 5 years including, as Modi said, 50,000 skilled personnel and potential talent from India to Japan.“Today, we have laid a strong foundation for a new and golden chapter in our Special Strategic and Global Partnership. We have set a roadmap for the next decade. We will also give special attention to connecting Small and Medium Enterprises and Start-ups from both countries,” said Modi, addressing the media along with Ishiba after the meeting.Speaking about the technology partnership, Modi said semiconductors and rare earth minerals were at the top of the agenda. “Cooperation in high technology is a priority for both of us. In this context, Digital Partnership 2.0 and AI cooperation initiatives are being undertaken,” announced Modi. As per the new economic security initiative, India and Japan resolved to advance cooperation in building resilient supply chains and secure critical infrastructure, promoting and protecting key technologies and addressing bilateral impediments to strategic trade and technology collaboration.Modi also said both sides shared concerns about terrorism and cyber security. “We also have shared interests in the areas of defence and maritime security. We have jointly decided to further strengthen our cooperation in the fields of defence industry and innovation, adding India and Japan partnership is rooted in mutual trust, reflects national priorities, and is shaped by shared values and beliefs.Both countries also announced the launch of a Sustainable Fuel Initiative and Battery Supply Chain Partnership, with Modi saying that the green partnership between India and Japan is as strong as the economic partnership.On the delayed Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail, the leaders noted its importance as a flagship project between India and Japan and agreed to work towards commencement of its operations at the earliest. India also welcomed Japan’s offer, as announced by the railway ministry last month, to introduce in the early 2030s the latest E10 series of the Shinkansen, and both sides agreed to install the Japanese signalling system on which the train runs.While welcoming an agreement for cooperation on the Chandrayaan-5 mission, Modi said that active participation will symbolise the progress of humanity “beyond the boundaries of the Earth, and into space”. Ishiba too said that the 2 countries should “draw on each other's strengths, help solve each other's challenges, and tackle together the issues that future generations will face”.On regional and global issues, Modi and Ishiba expressed support for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter. “They also welcomed the ongoing diplomatic efforts by various countries to achieve a just and lasting peace,” said the joint statement.The leaders also expressed grave concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza, while calling on all parties to show restraint, protect civilians, comply with international law, and refrain from taking actions that could further escalate the situation and compromise regional stability.",Pm narendra modi and his japanese counterpart shigeru ishiba announced a joint vision for the next decade.

Japan PM Ishiba Roots For Make-in-India, Outlines Three Initiatives To Strengthen Delhi-Tokyo Ties

NEW DELHI: India and Japan on Friday signed an implementing arrangement for a joint lunar exploration mission to the south pole of the Moon called Chandrayaan-5, during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Tokyo.The arrangement between Isro and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) concerning the joint lunar polar exploration mission (LUPEX) was inked on the sidelines of Modi's visit and the pact was exchanged by Jaxa vice-president Matsuura Mayumi and India’s ambassador to Japan Sibi George.Addressing a joint press briefing with his Japanese counterpart Shigeru Ishiba, PM Modi said, “We welcome the collaboration between Isro and Jaxa for the Chandrayaan-5 mission. Our active participation has gone beyond the limits of the Earth and will become a symbol of mankind’s progress in space.”Referring to the global praise received by Chandrayaan-3's successful landing near the lunar South Pole in 2023 — when India became the first country to go to the uncharted territory of the Moon — Modi said the next challenge lies in deeper exploration of the lunar surface, particularly areas that may hold critical resources such as water ice.“This will contribute to deepening our understanding of the permanently shadowed regions at the lunar south pole,” Modi said in an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun.“Our G2G collaboration in the space sector, between Isro and Jaxa, is fostering a culture of cooperation between our industries and startups. This is creating an ecosystem where innovation flows both ways — from labs to launchpads, and from research to real-world applications,” Modi said.The Chandrayaan-5 mission will be launched by Jaxa onboard its H3-24L launch vehicle, carrying the Isro-made lunar lander, which will carry a Japan-made rover.Apart from the lander, Isro is also responsible for developing a few scientific instruments for the mission. The spacecraft will carry seven scientific instruments, including a mass spectrometer by ESA and neutron spectrometers by Nasa.Chandrayaan-5’s mission objectives will be mapping lunar water presence; drilling lunar regolith to analyse water content, quality and composition; and performing in-situ scientific observations using spectrometers and sensors. It is a proposed 100-day mission with possible extension to a year and an attempt to explore the Moon’s far side.The approval for the Chandrayaan-5 was given by the Modi govt on March 10, in the form of financial sanction.During May 13-14, Isro and Jaxa had jointly conducted a third face-to-face technical interface meeting for the mission, at the Bengaluru-based Isro headquarters. The meeting was attended by senior officials, project executives and technical team members from Isro, Jaxa and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan.The two-day meeting deliberated on the various technical interfaces, joint mission implementation plan, as well as the potential landing sites for the mission. During the meeting, M Ganesh Pillai, scientific secretary, Isro, congratulated both the teams for technical achievements so far, and emphasized on the importance of the collaborative endeavour for the scientific and technical aspects of the mission.","The arrangement between isro and japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa) concerning the joint lunar polar exploration mission (lupex) was inked on the sidelines of modi's visit.

Poll What should India prioritize in response to US tariffs? Adjust trade strategy Maintain independent policy

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India, accusing New Delhi of using American trade dollars to finance Russia’s war in Ukraine.Justifying Washington’s newly imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian imports, Navarro said that Indian refiners, working with “silent Russian partners,” were making huge profits by refining Russian oil and selling it in international markets while “Russia pockets hard currency to fund its war on Ukraine.”In a post on X, Navarro said, “India uses our dollars to buy discounted Russian crude. This isn’t just about India’s unfair trade—it’s about cutting off the financial lifeline India has extended to Putin’s war machine.”According to Navarro, “Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil made up less than 1% of India’s imports. Today? Over 30% -- more than 1.5 million barrels a day. This surge isn’t driven by domestic demand—it’s driven by Indian profiteers and carries an added price of blood and devastation in Ukraine.”Also read - 'Trump won't budge' : US says Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'Modi's war' “India’s Big Oil lobby has turned the largest democracy in the world into a massive refining hub and oil money laundromat for the Kremlin,” he claimed, adding that India now exports more than 1 million barrels a day in refined petroleum, over half of the Russian crude it imports.Navarro said the Biden administration “largely looked the other way at this madness,” while President Trump was confronting it directly. “A 50% tariff -- 25% for unfair trade and 25% for national security -- is a direct response. If India, the world’s largest democracy, wants to be treated like a strategic partner of the US, it needs to act like one. The road to peace in Ukraine runs through New Delhi.”Also read - Western voices back India against Trump's tariff war Expanding on the criticism, he remarked, “While the United States pays to arm Ukraine, India bankrolls Russia even as it slaps some of the world’s highest tariffs on US goods, which in turn punishes American exporters. We run a $50-billion trade deficit with India—and they’re using our dollars to buy Russian oil. They make a killing and Ukrainians die.”“It doesn’t stop there. India continues to buy Russian weapons—while demanding that US firms transfer sensitive military tech and build plants in India. That’s strategic freeloading,” he added.The remarks follow Donald Trump’s decision earlier this week to double tariffs on Indian imports, citing both trade imbalances and national security concerns.Navarro told Bloomberg TV that it was “real easy” for India to get the penalty removed by halting Russian oil purchases, but accused New Delhi of being “arrogant” in insisting it was their sovereign right.“India, you’re the biggest democracy in the world, okay? Act like one... side with the democracies...(instead) you’re getting in bed with the authoritarians,” he said, reminding India of its long-standing border dispute with China. “These are not your friends folks, okay? And the Russians. I mean, come on!”Navarro also controversially referred to the Russia-Ukraine conflict as “Modi’s war,” insisting India’s purchases were funding Moscow’s aggression. When an anchor corrected him, saying “you mean Putin’s war,” Navarro doubled down, repeating it was “Modi’s war.”While Navarro praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as “a great leader” and India as “a mature democracy with intelligent people running it,” he maintained that New Delhi’s oil deals with Moscow undermined its claim to be a trusted US partner.His comments have drawn criticism within US policy circles, with some analysts pointing out that Washington has not penalised China or the European Union for continuing to buy Russian energy. Others noted that the US itself imports Russian nuclear fuel and precious metals.","Trump's trade advisor blames pm modi for ukraine war, peter navarro targets india over russia oil.

'Show Red Eyes to US’ Owaisi Targets Modi Govt on Tariffs, Calls It Diplomatic Failure

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears “scared of the US,” while slamming the government over the imposition of a 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports by the United States.Speaking to reporters, Owaisi questioned: ""US' Peter Navarro is making statements. Had the same statements been made on the PM by an Opposition leader in the country, the BJP would have attacked him. Why are they silent?...Why are you so scared of the US?""He called the move a “major loss” to the country’s trade, warning that sectors like motor parts, jewellery, gems, and readymade garments could face estimated losses of around Rs 60,000 crore.The AIMIM chief also pointed out that the tariff issue surfaced after Modi’s bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump in February, and accused the government of remaining silent while failing to defend India’s exporters. Owaisi added that opposition leaders would have faced strong criticism from the BJP for making similar remarks.“The 50% tariff will cause a major loss to India's exporters...I think the Narendra Modi Government will have to answer to the people of the country...ModiGovt will have to answer what they are going to do for those who are going to suffer losses,” Owaisi said.Owaisi also referred to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who sparked controversy by calling the Russia-Ukraine conflict “Modi’s war.”In a Bloomberg interview, Navarro claimed that India’s purchases of discounted Russian oil were “fuelling Russia’s war machine” and effectively making American taxpayers bear the cost. Owaisi criticised the government for not responding publicly to Navarro’s remarks.The senior leader also highlighted that India made a major mistake when Trump, during his first term, asked the country to stop buying oil from Iran. Owaisi said that if PM Modi had shown defiance or stood up to him then, the current situation with US tariffs might have been avoided.""Iran was selling us good quality oil at a reasonable price. We blinked there so they could see that they can scare us. That was the first mistake we made,"" Owaisi said.He added that BJP spokespersons should tell the country what is happening instead of taunting the Opposition.","Aimim chief asaduddin owaisi slammed the government over the imposition of a 50 per cent tariff on indian exports by the united states.

Bhairav commandos to add muscle to Army by October 31,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhairav-commandos-to-add-muscle-to-army-by-october-31/articleshow/123592968.cms,".

Indian Army, J&K Police Neutralize 2 Terrorists In Bandipora, Ops Ongoing

NEW DELHI: The Army is now raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China.The plan is to progressively raise 23 ""agile and lethal"" 'Bhairav' battalions from existing troops to bridge the gap between regular infantry soldiers and the elite Para-Special Forces. ""The aim is to have the first five such units in place by Oct 31, though it can take a little more time,"" a source told TOI.Three of the first five 'Bhairav' units are coming up under the Army's crucial Udhampur-based Northern Command, one each for the 14 Corps at Leh, 15 Corps at Srinagar, and 16 Corps at Nagrota. The fourth unit is in the desert terrain of the western sector and the fifth in the hilly terrain of the eastern sector.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is drawing 'Bhairav' commandos from its regular infantry battalions, which number 415 (each has 800 soldiers), under the ""save and raise"" concept without fresh troop accretions. ""Much smaller and nimble than infantry battalions, the 'Bhairav' units will be equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones.They will be geared for speed, flexibility and high-impact tactical operations,"" source said.These units will be in addition to the Army's 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training, and are equipped with a wide array of specialised weapons and equipment.Though meant for special clandestine missions in high-risk environments, usually behind enemy lines, these crack units are often used for mere tactical operations. ""The 'Bhairav' battalions, each with seven-eight officers, are also meant to relieve Special Forces, who can then concentrate on their more critical tasks,"" another source said.The 'Bhairav' commandos will undergo specialised training for two-three months in their respective regimental centres and then be attached to the Special Forces units in their respective theatres for another month for advanced training.On July 26, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had announced the move to set up new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades, 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and the 'Bhairav' battalions. He also said all infantry battalions will now have dedicated drone platoons, as was then reported by TOI.A new tri-service joint doctrine for Special Forces operations was, incidentally, released on Wednesday. Apart from the Army's Special Forces, there are 27 'flights' of around 1,600 'Garud' commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.""Special Forces, owing to their agility, strategic reach and mission-specific capabilities, are uniquely suited to generate disproportionate operational effect through precision engagement, deep insertion and unconventional operations,"" said CDS General Anil Chauhan, in the doctrine's foreword.","The army is raising the first lot of five 'bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers.

""PM Ishiba noted this with concern,"" it said. They called for the perpetrators, organisers, and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice without any delay.The leaders also called for concerted actions against all UN-listed terrorist groups and entities including al-Qaida, Islamic State, LeT, JeM and their proxies, and to take resolute action to root out terrorists' safe havens, eliminate terrorist financing channels and its nexus with transnational crime, and halt cross-border movement of terrorists.","Japanese pm shigeru ishiba joined pm modi in unequivocally condemning terrorism, including the pahalgam terrorist attack.

India in the crossfire

Tariffs hit hard

China steps in





Former US national security advisor Jake Sullivan has launched a sharp attack on Donald Trump’s latest trade move against India, warning that the “massive trade offensive” risks undoing years of work to bring New Delhi closer to Washington - and instead pushing it into Beijing’s orbit.Speaking on The Bulwark Podcast with Tim Miller, Sullivan accused Trump of turning America into a “big disruptor” in the eyes of its allies. He said that while Washington was once seen as a steady hand, it is now viewed as unreliable, even as China gains credibility.“When I go to these places now and I talk to leaders, they are talking about derisking from the United States,” Sullivan said. “They now see the US as the big disruptor, the country that can’t be counted on. China has moved ahead of the United States in popularity in a whole lot of countries… the American brand globally is in the toilet.”Sullivan singled out India as the clearest example of Trump’s missteps.Washington, he said, had worked on a bipartisan basis to build a strategic partnership with New Delhi, particularly to counter China’s growing influence. But Trump’s sudden tariff hikes have strained those efforts.“Take a look at India,” Sullivan said. “Here’s a country we were trying to build a deeper and more sustainable relationship with. Now you have got President Trump executing a massive trade offensive against them and the Indians are saying, ‘Well, I guess maybe we have to go show up in Beijing and sit with the Chinese because we’ve got to hedge against America.’”The critique comes days after the US imposed a steep 50% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 27. The duties - the highest levied against any country - are set to hit Indian sectors like textiles, jewellery, and mechanical appliances, raising fears of lost jobs and slower growth.Trump defended the decision as retaliation for India’s continued purchase of Russian oil. However, analysts say the trigger may be more personal.A report by investment banking firm Jefferies suggested the escalation stems partly from Trump’s anger over not being allowed to mediate in the India-Pakistan conflict earlier this year. Agricultural disputes between the two nations have also deepened the rift.For Sullivan, the damage goes beyond economics. He argued that Trump’s actions hand China a diplomatic victory, with Beijing now able to present itself as a more responsible player on the global stage.“One year ago, China was on the defensive,” Sullivan noted. “Now, countries are basically saying the US can’t be counted on, and China is looking like the adult in the room.”",Former us national security advisor jake sullivan has attacked donald trump's latest trade move against india.

Bhagwat, on the third day, took questions on a wide range of topics concerning society.

BJP-RSS equation

On the 75-year retirement limit age

On reservation

On demography & population

On learning English

Panchkoshiya

Should Sanskrit be made compulsory?

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat addressed the media on Thursday at the event that marked the centenary of the organisation.On the first day of the lecture series, Bhagwat had shared his vision for the future of India and the role of 'swayamsevaks' (RSS volunteers) in shaping it. The speech was translated live in English, French and Spanish for the foreign delegates.On the second day, he pitched for Swadeshi, saying its true spirit lay in the nation engaging internationally by choice, not under pressure. The RSS chief said the fanaticism has increased in the current world order as people tend to cancel those who speak against their views.Speaking on the RSS's coordination with the ruling BJP, the RSS chief said there may be a struggle, but there's no quarrel.""No quarrel anywhere, but being on the same page on all issues is not possible; we always trust each other. I am an expert in running 'shakhas', the BJP is an expert in running the government; we can only give suggestions to each other,"" he said.He said even if a man in the chair ""is 100 per cent for us, he knows what the hurdles are"" and that ""we have to give him that independence"".""We are having good coordination with every government, both state governments and the central government. But there are systems which have some internal contradictions. The system in general is the same, which was invented by the British so that they can rule. So, we have to have some innovations,"" Bhagwat said.He further added, ""Then, we want something to happen. Even if the man in the chair is 100% for us, he has to do it, and knows what the hurdles are. He may or may not be able to do it. We have to give him that independence. There is no quarrel anywhere.""Mohan Bhagwat said that he never advocated for retirement at the age of 75, nor did he ever say someone should retire, putting an end to the buzz that his reference was meant for PM Modi, as the BJP has a practice of encouraging leaders to step down after the age of 75.""I never said I will retire or someone should retire. In Sangh, we are given a job, whether we want it or not. If I am 80 years old, and Sangh says go and run a 'shakha', I will have to do it. We do whatever the Sangh tells us to do...This is not for anyone's retirement. We are ready to retire or work - as long as the Sangh wants us to,"" he said on the question of 'should Indian leaders retire at the age of 75 years'.Mohan Bhagwat said the RSS supports reservation ""as provided in the Constitution"".""Caste-based reservation must be approached with sensitivity. Deendayal Ji had a vision -- those at the bottom should strive to rise, and those at the top should extend a hand to pull them up. The Sangh supports reservation as provided in the Constitution,"" he said.He also referred to the All Hindu Dharmacharyas, who declared in the Udupi Sammelan in 1969 that untouchability does not have acceptability in Hindu Dharma.Mohan Bhagwat said it is generally suggested for a family in India to have three children. However, he said that resources should be managed accordingly.""To keep a civilisation alive, 2.1 is mentioned; it basically means three children. But, resources also have to be managed, so we must restrict to 3,"" Bhagwat said, adding that having three silbings ""helps a child in an ego management"".The RSS chief said infiltration should be stopped as every country has their own rules and regulations with limited resources.He said conversion and illegal migration are key reasons for demographic imbalance.""Religion is an individual's own choice. No one should be forcefully converted. We have to stop it. The second issue is infiltration. Every country has their own rules and regulations, limited resources. So, infiltration should be stopped, and the government is making efforts to stop this... It is important to give employment to the citizens of our country,"" he said.He further said: “Every nation has its rules and regulations. The world is ‘Kutumb’, but every place has its own standards. Freedom is discipline also…Not allowing illegal immigrants in the country doesn't contradict the concept of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'.”Asked how the Sangh views the challenge of preserving values and traditions in an era of technology and modernisation, Bhagwat said: ""Technology and modernity are not opposed to education. Education is not just about information; it is about shaping a cultured individual. The new education policy provides foreducation (five-fold holistic learning).""Bhagwat said education is not just about cramming information.""It is to make a person cultured with values. Education should impart our values based on our tradition and culture,"" he said.Responding to a question on whether Sanskrit should be made compulsory, Bhagwat said: ""To understand self & our knowledge, tradition, basic knowledge of Sanskrit is necessary. It needn't be made compulsory. But, to understand Bharat in the true sense, it is essential to study Sanskrit. That urge is to be created.""""No point in having any dispute over languages, all should together decide on a common transactional language. Everyone should be fluent in a mother tongue, language of state and common transactional language; no bar in learning more,"" the RSS chief said.In a massive public outreach, the RSS has planned to organise several events, including more than one lakh 'Hindu sammelans', across the country to mark its centenary year, starting with Bhagwat's address at the organisation's headquarters in Nagpur on Vijaya Dashami, which falls on October 2 this year.","Rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) chief mohan bhagwat addressed the media on thursday at the event that marked the centenary of the organisation.

Ethel Caterham: The world’s oldest living person witnessing a century of change



Ethel Caterham: Family, lifestyle, and what her longevity inspiring the world



Also Read |

Ethel Caterham, a British centenarian residing in Lightwater, Surrey, has officially become the world’s oldest living person at 116 years old. Born on 21 August 1909, Caterham has lived through some of the most transformative events in modern history, including the Titanic disaster, the Russian Revolution, and both World Wars. She is also the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, representing a living connection to early 20th-century British monarchy. Recognised by King Charles III with a birthday card in 2024, Caterham’s milestone has captured global attention. Her story highlights the remarkable combination of longevity, resilience, and historical perspective, inspiring people worldwide to reflect on the extraordinary possibilities of human life, the evolution of society, and the enduring spirit of individuals who witness over a century of change.Ethel Caterham was born in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, as the second youngest of eight siblings. Growing up in a large family in early 20th-century England meant learning responsibility, cooperation, and resilience from an early age. Raised in Tidworth, Wiltshire, she witnessed a rural way of life during a time of social change and industrial expansion. Her childhood coincided with technological advances like the spread of electricity and the automobile, shaping the early experiences of a girl who would live through over a century of innovation.These formative years likely influenced her adaptability and endurance—traits that contribute significantly to longevity and reflect an era where perseverance, community values, and resourcefulness were essential for survival in challenging circumstances.As a teenager, Caterham worked as an au pair in India, an experience that not only broadened her cultural understanding but also introduced her to independence and responsibility at a young age. As reported by BBC, later in life, she moved to Hong Kong and Gibraltar, accompanying her husband Norman, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the British Army. These postings exposed her to diverse climates, cuisines, languages, and social customs, fostering mental agility and adaptability—qualities that studies suggest are linked to longer life expectancy. Living abroad during politically and socially dynamic periods also provided her with firsthand knowledge of global events, enriching her personal and historical perspective.Ethel Caterham’s life spans some of the most significant events of the last century. Born three years before the Titanic sank in 1912, she experienced the societal upheaval of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and lived through both World Wars. As reported, she has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the advent of commercial aviation, the digital revolution, and major advances in medicine. Caterham’s personal story reflects the resilience and adaptability of individuals living through periods of profound uncertainty and change. Being a living archive of these events, she offers a unique perspective on how human society evolves over time.Caterham’s extraordinary longevity has been officially recognized by the British royal family. King Charles III sent her a birthday card to celebrate her 115th birthday in 2024, a gesture highlighting both her personal achievements and her historical significance. Such recognition is rare and symbolic, connecting Caterham to a lineage that stretches back to King Edward VII. The acknowledgment of her life by the monarchy underscores the cultural and historical importance of longevity and demonstrates society’s admiration for those who live exceptionally long lives.Now living in a care home in Lightwater, Surrey, Caterham enjoys her days surrounded by family and close friends. According to her care home, she prefers to celebrate birthdays quietly, at her own pace, reflecting a peaceful and stress-free lifestyle that research shows can support longevity. Her family has expressed gratitude for the outpouring of public interest and kind messages, emphasizing the role of emotional support, social connection, and family bonding in maintaining mental and physical health in extreme old age.While Caterham is the oldest living person today, the record for the verified oldest human remains with Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days.
