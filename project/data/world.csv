NEW DELHI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju on Saturday said Rahul Gandhi 's remarks make his own MPs uncomfortable, as they fear the party will pay the price for his ""nonsense"".The minister said even the Supreme Court scolded Rahul Gandhi when he called the PM ""chor"" and spoke nonsense on Rafale and claimed China occupied our land.""Rahul Gandhi is the LoP and I don't want to criticise him. The SC scolded him when he called the PM 'chor', spoke nonsense regarding Rafael, and claimed that China occupied our land. He should speak like an Indian. I am no one to improve Rahul Gandhi. He will not listen... Whenever Rahul Gandhi says something, all his MPs become very uncomfortable. They are afraid that they will speak nonsense, and the party would have to pay the price for it,"" Rijiju said.Stepping up his attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the minister accused him of ""destabilising the country"".Rijiju said Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party are ""working in coordination"" with George Soros and anti-India Khalistani forces to ""weaken the country"".""Rahul Gandhi is going on a very dangerous track. George Soros says that one trillion dollars are kept to destabilise the Indian government. The anti-India Khalistan force sitting in Canada, the US, the UK, and many Left organisations are conspiring to work against the country.Rahul Gandhi and Congress are working in coordination with them and weakening the country. This is very worrisome. But no one can destabilise the country under PM Modi's leadership,"" the Union parliamentary affairs minister told news agency ANI.George Soros is a Hungarian-American billionaire investor and founder of the Open Society Foundations (OSF). He made his fortune as a hedge fund manager and is infamous for “breaking the Bank of England” in 1992 by betting against the British pound.In 2023, Soros had suggested that business tycoon Gautam Adani’s troubles (after the Hindenburg report) could “weaken Prime Minister Modi’s stranglehold on India’s government” and even “lead to a democratic revival.” The statement was criticised by the ministers, who said Soros was trying to ""destabilise a democratically elected government.”Rijiju reamed Rahul Gandhi out in a veiled dig over his ""vote chori"" charge, claiming the ""credibility of the spoiled brat is hitting a new low!""Sharing a clip of CSDS psephologist Sanjay Kumar apologising for his Maharashtra data mishap, the Union parliamentary affairs minister said: At least, CSDS head has apologised! How can someone lie so publicly and do not tender apology? Credibility of the spoiled brat non-serious political leaders are hitting new low!""Sanjay Kumar, who is co-director at Lokniti-CSDS, apologised on Tuesday for his post on the Maharashtra elections, which claimed a significant dip in the number of voters in two assembly constituencies compared to the Lok Sabha election held just months earlier.However, CSDS's data set off a political storm, with the opposition, particularly the Congress-led INDIA bloc, alleging that vote theft had occurred in the elections.Escalating his ""vote chori"" campaign against the BJP , Rahul Gandhi on Friday mounted a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA government, accusing them of attempting 'vote theft' in Bihar and betraying the country’s youth with policies that 'destroy employment opportunities.'""The entire country now knows that Narendra Modi steals votes,"" Gandhi alleged. Addressing a massive public rally in Bhagalpur during the ongoing ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’, Gandhi alleged that the Modi government and the Election Commission were working together to snatch away citizens’ constitutional right to vote.“The SIR is an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP and the EC to steal your votes. They are trying their best to snatch your voting rights. The ‘vote chor’ came to Gayaji, but he did not say even a word on his government's attempt to steal votes with the help of the EC,” Gandhi said.","Kiren rijiju said rahul gandhi's remarks make his own mps uncomfortable.

NEW DELHI: A giant effigy of US President Donald Trump was paraded through the streets of Nagpur on Saturday as part of the Marbat festival, with locals using the celebration to protest against the 50% tariffs recently imposed on Indian imports.Visuals from the procession showed residents chanting slogans, holding placards and wheeling the towering Trump figure through the city. “Tariff lagakar humein jo daraye, Bharat ki takat usse rulaye (Those who try to intimidate us with tariffs, India’s strength will make them weep),” read one placard. Another protester said, “The tariffs imposed on our goods will only ruin their business.”Some participants carried placards accusing Washington of hypocrisy, one of which read, “American uncle imposes restrictions on India, yet ends up taking Russian products itself.”The effigy, built with clay and hay, wore a dark red suit, white shirt and yellow tie, and was decorated with marigold garlands and posters. At one point, it was spun in circles and brought face to face with another effigy, drawing cheers from the crowd.The Marbat festival, which dates back to the late 1800s, is an annual Nagpur tradition where locals parade effigies to symbolically drive out evil and highlight contemporary political, social and economic issues.Over time, it has evolved into a blend of protest, satire and entertainment.Trump announced a 25% reciprocal tariff against India in early August after trade talks failed, followed by another 25% levy to be enforced later this month over India’s continued purchase of Russian oil during the Ukraine war. India has strongly opposed the measures, calling them “unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable,” while signalling it will maintain energy ties with Moscow.“If you have a problem with India buying oil or refined products from Russia, don’t buy from us. Nobody forces you. Europe buys, America buys, so if you don’t like it, don’t buy it,” India responded.(With inputs from agencies)","A giant effigy of us president donald trump was paraded through the streets of nagpur on saturday.

Poll What should be the priority for international agencies in combating terror financing? Stricter monitoring of fund flows Stronger global cooperation

NEW DELHI: After suffering severe setbacks during Operation Sindoor , Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror outfit has launched a massive fundraising drive in that country under the garb of building over 300 mosques to replicate Lashkar-e-Taiba’s decentralization policy, security officials said.The JeM has come out with a new mechanism with the support of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to collect funds.It is using digital wallets like ‘EasyPaisa’ and ‘Sadapay’ controlled by its founder and most wanted terrorist Masood Azhar ’s family members to bypass scrutiny by global agencies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the officials said citing inputs from across the border.The Rs 3.91 billion fundraising drive would secure JeM’s operational and weapons financing for at least a decade, they said.Indian armed forces carried out missile strikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in the early hours of May 7 in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack Pakistan retaliated and the intense border skirmishes continued till May 10 before the two countries reached an understanding to end the hostilities.The officials said the JeM’s headquarters ‘Markaz Subhanallah’, along with four other training camps -- Markaz Bilal, Markaz Abbas, Mahmona Joya, and the Sargal training camp – were destroyed during the Operation Sindoor.While Pakistan’s government has announced funding to rebuild these destroyed facilities, the JeM has launched an online fundraising campaign through digital wallets to collect Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new markaz buildings under the garb of constructing mosques across Pakistan, the officials said.On social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, JeM-linked proxy accounts and those used by JeM commanders have posted posters, videos, and a letter from Masood Azhar, urging supporters to donate wholeheartedly as each mosque requires Rs 12.5 million (Rs 1.25 crore) for construction and smooth running, they said.According to the officials, several of the digital wallet accounts were found linked to the mobile number of Azhar’s brother Talha Al Saif (Talha Gulzar) and JeM Haripur district commander Aftab Ahmad based in Khala Batt Township.They said another fundraising channel was linked to a mobile number run by Azhar’s son Abdullah Azhar (Abdullah Khan) while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, JeM commander Syed Safdar Shah is collecting donations for the organization’s markaz via a number registered near Melwarah post office, Oghi, Mansehra district. In addition to these three accounts, over 250 EasyPaisa wallets are reportedly being used to raise funds for the JeM’s fundraising campaign.Alongside social media appeals, the terror outfit circulated an audio recording of Azhar’s brother, Al Saif, via its official propaganda channel, MSTD Official, urging supporters to contribute Rs 21,000 per person, the officials said. The speech was delivered at a gathering at Markaz Usman-o-Ali during a Friday congregation on August 15.In the audio clip, Al Saif also instructed the establishment of 20 new markaz this year, as part of JeM’s overall target of 313 centres, the officials said citing JeM’s organizational posters and videos. To build these mosques, the officials said the JeM may have two key motives -- first, to replicate LeT’s vast markaz network, decentralising its training camps so that future Indian strikes would have minimal impact on its terror infrastructure in Pakistan.Second, to establish secure, lavish safe houses for Azhar and his family to allow Pakistan to maintain plausible deniability about their whereabouts, the officials said. Under this plan, three-four large markaz centres would function as safe houses, medium-sized facilities would serve as training camps, and the remainder would handle logistics, allowing JeM to operate nationwide while Pakistan’s government continues to deny Azhar’s presence, they said.While JeM claims each markaz will cost Rs 12.5 million, estimates suggest a Markaz Bilal-sized facility costs only Rs 4-5 million.Larger markaz like Subhanallah or Usman-o-Ali may cost around Rs 100 million, but it is unlikely all 313 will be this large. If built, with three large markaz and 310 smaller ones, the total construction cost would be about Rs 1.23 billion (Rs 123 crore) leaving a large surplus for weapons purchases, the officials said.Given JeM-Hamas-TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban) connections and leadership meetings, the officials said the surplus could be used to acquire advanced weaponry and maybe attack drones or quadcopters used by TTP.It is widely known that Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI helps JeM procure arms cheaply from the black market, the officials said. “Today, JeM’s arsenal already includes machine guns, rocket launchers, and mortars.Thus this Rs 3.91 billion campaign could heavily bolster its arms stockpile,” an official said. In 2019, Pakistan was placed in grey list by the international watchdog working on blocking terror financing and accordingly, the Pakistani Government implemented the National Action Plan and presented to FATF that it had curbed JeM by taking its markaz under government control and placing JeM chief and his brother’s bank accounts under official watch, the officials said.It also banned cash transactions, animal hide donations, and other forms of fundraising which resulted in Pakistan getting formally removed from FATF’s grey list in 2022. Now, instead of donations going into bank accounts, the money is being transferred to the digital wallets used by Azhar’s family members and this way, Pakistan could falsely claim to FATF by showing only bank account details that JeM’s funding had been cut off, the officials said.",The jem has come out with a new mechanism with the support of pakistan's inter-services intelligence (isi) to collect funds. It is using digital wallets like ‘easypaisa’ and ‘sadapay’ controlled by its founder and most wanted terrorist masood azhar ’s family members.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123444403,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1736748,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

And while it’s different from what we had before, it's still better than that of any other country,"" Carney said.""Canada and the United States have reestablished free trade for the vast majority of our goods. Canada will retain our tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos as we work intensively to resolve the issues there,"" he added.With the USMCA scheduled for review in 2026, Carney described the pact as a ""unique advantage"" for Canada, noting that the US is increasingly charging other countries for market access.The Canadian PM noted that America's commitment to the agreement ensures Canadian exporters still benefit from one of the lowest average US tariff rates, with more than 85% of bilateral trade remaining tariff-free.Canadian and Mexican firms also continue to receive preferential access under the USMCA, AP reported.The retaliatory tariffs were introduced under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after Washington imposed duties on Canadian goods. However, the Trump administration later exempted USMCA-covered products, prompting Ottawa’s latest move.While most Canadian and Mexican imports remain protected by the trade pact, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has signaled fresh uncertainty, saying, ""I think the president is absolutely going to renegotiate the USMCA.""Earlier, Trump also signed an executive order raising tariffs on Canadian imports to the United States from 25% to 35%.The tariff applies to all items not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. A 40% transshipment levy would apply to goods rerouted through another country to avoid these tariffs.At the same time, Canada still faces sector-specific US levies outside the deal that continue to weigh on the industry.Since March, Trump implemented various Canadian tariffs: 25% on all goods excluding potash and energy products, 10% on energy resources including potash, 50% on steel and aluminium imports, and 25% on automotive products.Trade experts note that preserving the free trade pact will be crucial for both Canada and Mexico, with more than 75% of Canadian exports and 80% of Mexican exports heading to the US.","Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs on us goods, aligning with washington's recent decision to exempt products covered under the usmca.

Poll Is it important for India to resist external pressures? Yes, for national interests No, cooperation is key

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Saturday took a sharp swipe at US and Pakistan, saying both countries had a habit of “overlooking history.”Speaking at Economic Times World Leaders Forum, the foreign minister cited the 2011 US raid in Abbottabad that killed Osama bin Laden. He reminded that it was the same Pakistan that had sheltered the 9/11 attacker.""They have a history with each other, and they have a history of overlooking their history. It is the same military that went into Abbottabad (in Pakistan) and found who there?"" Dr Jaishankar asked.He further underlined that India’s foreign policy was guided by long-term confidence rather than short-term “politics of convenience.” “When countries focus on the politics of convenience, they keep trying to do this or that. But I always keep in mind the larger structural strengths of the relationship, and the confidence that comes from it. At the end of the day, I know my strengths and I know the importance of my relationships,” he said.The EAM also reiterated that US didn't mediate between India and Pakistan for the ceasefire after the conflict following India's Operation Sindoor ""Since 1970s, for more than 50 years now, there's a national consensus in this country that we do not accept mediation in our relations with Pakistan,"" he said.He further explained that calls from the US and other countries were made during Operation Sindoor, but clarified that these were routine diplomatic exchanges, not negotiations.“Every American phone call I had is there on my ‘X’ account,” he said, emphasising that the settlement was the result of direct talks between India and Pakistan, and pushing back against the narrative by opposition and US president Donald Trump that US negotiated the ceasefire.The external affairs minister also used the occasion to attack the opposition, saying that India was also resisting external pressures to protect its national economic interests.“When it comes to trade and the interests of farmers, when it comes to our strategic autonomy, when it comes to opposing mediation, this government is very clear. Our positions are firm,” he said, warning that, “If anybody disagrees with us, please tell the people of India that you are not prepared to defend the interests of farmers. Please tell the people of India that you don’t value strategic autonomy. We do. We will do whatever we have to do to maintain it. ”","Dr s jaishankar took a sharp swipe at us and pakistan, saying both countries had a habit of “overlooking history.” the foreign minister cited the 2011 us raid in abbottabad that killed osama bin laden.

NEW DELHI: A giant effigy of US President Donald Trump was carried out at the centuries-old Marbat Utsav in Nagpur, as locals symbolically protested the US government’s recent 50% tariff on Indian goods.Alongside the giant effigy, several placards carried protest messages such as: “By imposing tariffs to intimidate us, they end up regretting India’s strength,"" “The tariffs imposed on our goods will only ruin their business” and “American uncle imposes restrictions on India, yet ends up taking Russian products itself.”The Marbat festival, celebrated annually in Nagpur on the second day of Pola, blends tradition, culture and social commentary.Originating in the 19th century, the festival was initially intended to ward off evil spirits, with clay and hay effigies known as “Marbats” that represented negative forces or societal evils. Over time, the event has evolved into a platform for expressing public sentiment on contemporary social and political issues.This year, the Trump effigy was carried, reflecting public displeasure over the tariff imposed by the US.On August 6, President Trump signed an executive order adding a 25% tariff on Indian goods to the existing 25% rate, citing India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, a significant funding source for Moscow’s war in Ukraine.The festival processions, vibrant music and ritualistic burning or immersion of effigies offered residents a means to voice their discontent while maintaining the cultural essence of Marbat Utsav. Traditionally, the effigies symbolize corruption, injustice or social evils, according to the website of Maharashtra tourism.","A giant effigy of us president donald trump was carried out at the centuries-old marbat utsav in nagpur.

The minister ruled out any compromise on the red lines drawn by India in trade negotiations and on mediation while underscoring India's position on oil that such decisions are about upholding national interest and strategic autonomy.The discussions for a bilateral trade deal could not take place as the US delegation called off its visit, but the minister said ""negotiations are still going on in the sense that nobody has said the negotiations are off"". ""People do talk to each other. It's not like there's a complete cut,"" he said, speaking at the ET World Leaders Forum. Asked about US charge that India is profiteering from Russian oil, Jaishankar said it's funny to have people who work for a pro-business American administration accusing other people of doing business. tnnThat's (US allegations that India is profiteering from Russian oil) really curious. But here's the point: if you have a problem buying oil from India - oil or refined products - don't buy it.Nobody forces you to buy it. What Europe buys, America buys. If you don't like it, don't buy it, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said.""So, when it comes to trade and the interests of farmers, when it comes to our strategic autonomy, when it comes to opposition to mediation, this govt is very clear. If anybody disagrees with us, please tell the people of India that you're not prepared to defend the interests of farmers. Please tell the people of India you don't value autonomy. We will do whatever we have to do to maintain it,"" he said, adding that the red lines are primarily the interests of India's farmers, and to some extent small producers.On improvement in ties with China, he said India always maintained that if the border is stable, predictable, and free of incidents, there is a natural improvement in rest of the relationship. ""The border has been stable for some time now, & as disengagement was completed, it was logical that there would be improvement in other areas... it's not a great U-turn where everything is fine now,"" he said.""For our farmers, a predictable flow of fertilisers is important. For those in infrastructure, getting machinery from China is important. For our auto industry, an uninterrupted flow of magnets is important. These are legitimate issues of our industry.

Reforms are not a compulsion, nor are they crisis-driven; it is our commitment, our conviction. We take a holistic approach for each sector and undertake reforms one by one,"" he said while addressing the ET World Leaders Forum 2025.He listed several measures taken by the govt in recent days - from a new income tax law to Jan Vishwas Bill to decriminalise more than 300 provisions of various laws and reforms in mining and shipping sectors as well as an overhaul of the GST architecture.""A major reform is underway in GST, set to be completed by this Diwali, making it simpler and bringing down prices,"" the Prime Minister said while reasserting his promise to reduce levies.Referring to the new sports bill, the new sports policy and steps taken to host mega events, the PM said, ""It is not in my nature to be satisfied with what has already been achieved. The same approach guides our reforms... we prepare for the future.We have to move forward. We are coming with an arsenal of reforms and we are working on multiple fronts.""In a speech delivered against the backdrop of headwinds of an increasingly bellicose Trump administration and geopolitical churn and uncertainties, PM Narendra Modi conveyed calm reassurance.He said India, which had failed to grasp many opportunities before 2014, now not only grabs them when they emerge but also creates new ones. “From missing the bus to being in the driver’s seat, we’ve come a long way,” he said.The govt has unleashed a series of steps in a bid to boost domestic demand and step up economic activity at a time when US President Donald Trump’s proposed additional tariffs of 50% on India’s exports to the US could have an adverse impact on labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery and leather goods. Pointing to S&P’s first sovereign rating upgrade of India in 18 years, Modi said, “This means that India, due to its resilience and strength, offers hope for the rest of the world. ” He said India was contributing to around a fifth of global growth. The PM said semiconductor-related factories have started coming up in India. “By the end of this year, the first Made-in-India chip will come in the market. We are also working on Made-in-India 6G.”“Guided by the mantra of reform, perform, transform, India today is in a position to help lift the world out of slow growth.” Although he did not make any reference to US tariffs in his address, it was seen as a rebuttal of Trump’s comments on India being a “dead economy”. “The timing of the forum is perfect, and I would like to appreciate that. Just last week, from the Red Fort I spoke about next generation reforms. Now this forum is working as the force multiplier of this spirit,” he said about the ET event.Welcoming the PM to the second edition of the ET World Leaders Forum, Satyan Gajwani, chairman of Times Internet, said Modi had refused to bow in the face of opportunistic tactics and arm-twisting when others have “agreed to play ball”. He said Operation Sindoor not only gave a fitting reply but also effected a reset in how India will respond to any such provocations in future.“We are also witnessing highly disruptive policy moves from those once deemed the global guarantors of stability. These moves threaten to upend the rules-based order that has held up the world for more than seven decades. The take-home is that the global supply chain — which ensured shared prosperity to the developed and the developing worlds — cannot be taken as a given anymore,” Gajwani said.","""we are working towards quantum jump, not incremental change,"" pm narendra modi said. He listed several measures taken by the govt in recent days - from a new income tax law to jan vishwas bill to decriminalise more than 300 provisions of various laws.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123477688,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-26920,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
US ambassador announcement welcome development but concerns about dual role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-ambassador-announcement-welcome-development-but-concerns-about-dual-role/articleshow/123475987.cms,"Sergio Gor

The announcement by President Donald Trump – 7 months after he assumed office – that he’s promoting close aide Sergio Gor to be the next US ambassador is a welcome development for India, suggesting a willingness to intensify bilateral engagement at a time the relationship seems to be in a free fall.The appointment, subject to Senate confirmation, was long overdue and the fact that Gor is a part of Trump’s inner circle should facilitate a candid engagement between the 2 sides on thorny issues like trade, Trump’s handling of Pakistan, immigration and India’s ties with Russia. The announcement about Gor also raises hopes of a Trump visit to India for the Quad summit in November, even as the relationship seems headed south because of the threat of additional tariffs on India.However, the unprecedented decision to have Gor double up as a special envoy for South and Central Asia has also caused concerns about a possible overreach by Washington on India-Pakistan affairs.The announcement by Trump was greeted with muted response in India. Jaishankar didn’t comment on the US announcement about its new ambassador to India at an Economic Times event, merely saying he had read about it. Indian officials were also cagey about offering any observation, choosing to wait for more clarity to emerge about his role.This is mainly because of the US efforts to project India and Pakistan in terms of equivalence, which India saw as blurring the lines between the aggressor and the victim, following the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack, and the subsequent Op Sindoor in May.These efforts have seen Trump declaring umpteen times he brokered a “ceasefire” between the 2 countries, even after PM Narendra Modi “clearly conveyed” to Trump on June 17 that neither the India-US trade deal nor any mediation proposal was discussed between the 2 sides in the build-up to the cessation of hostilities. Jaishankar reiterated Saturday it was negotiated directly between India and Pakistan after “very bad things” happened to the Pakistani airfields.India has strongly resisted past attempts by the US to assign itself any role in addressing the Kashmir issue. In 2009, the Indian government pushed back against the Obama administration, forcing it to keep India outside of the purview of Richard Holbrooke, who was appointed envoy for the Af-Pak region.Trump has offered to mediate more forcefully between the 2 countries this time and India will be alert to any attempt to use the appointment of Gor as a stepping stone by the US to impose itself on issues that India maintains can only be addressed bilaterally. As Jaishankar reiterated Saturday, there has been a national consensus for more than 50 years that India won’t accept any mediation in its relations with Pakistan.","Sergio gor will be the next us ambassador to india. The appointment, subject to senate confirmation, was long overdue. Gor is a part of trump’s inner circle and should facilitate candid engagement between the 2 sides on thorny issues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123476161,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1083089,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

PM Modi refused to give an exception to the prime minister.""""The PM is also a citizen, and he should not have special protection. Most of the CMs are from our party. If they do something wrong, they have to leave their position"" he said.""Any position, whether CM, PM or Union Ministers, cannot be above the law. What objection does the Opposition have? The nation is welcoming this revolutionary bill,"" he added.The remarks came after Union home minister Amit Shah tabled three bills in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, including the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks automatic removal of the prime minister, chief ministers, or ministers if they face corruption charges or serious offences and remain in custody for 30 consecutive days.Earlier, while addressing a rally in Gaya on Friday, PM Modi had also questioned how CMs and ministers continue in office despite being jailed, while even junior government employees face automatic suspension if imprisoned for more than 50 hours.""But a CM, a minister, or even a PM can enjoy staying in the government even from jail... Some time ago, we saw how files were being signed from jail and how government orders were given from jail,"" PM Modi said.""If leaders have such an attitude, how can we fight corruption. NDA government has brought a law against corruption, and the Prime Minister also comes under its purview,"" he added.Rijiju further said that while the monsoon session was successful for the ruling government in passing important bills, it was a ""failure from the Opposition's point of view.""Rijiju also launched a sharp attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of working in coordination with ""anti-India"" billionaire George Soros.""Rahul Gandhi is going on a very dangerous track. George Soros says that one trillion dollars are kept to destabilise the Indian government. The anti-India Khalistan force sitting in Canada, the US, the UK, and many Left organisations are conspiring to work against the country. Rahul Gandhi and Congress are working in coordination with them and weakening the country. This is very worrisome. But no one can destabilise the country under PM Modi's leadership,"" Rijiju said.""When Congress cannot win elections, then they and the forces against India together start attacking the government and the institutions so that the public loses faith in this country's institutions... They have repeatedly said that the judiciary and the Election Commission are sold to weaken them"" he added.Taking another swipe at the leader of opposition, Rijiju said even Congress MPs feel uncomfortable when Rahul Gandhi speaks in Parliament.""Rahul Gandhi kuch bolte hain, unke saare MPs bahot uncomfortable ho jaate hain. Wo darte hain ye anapshanap baatein karenge, uska khamiyaza party ko bhugatna padta hai (When Rahul Gandhi speaks, his MPs get uncomfortable what nonsense he will speak, the party will have to bear its consequences,"" he added.","Kiren rijiju says prime minister narendra modi made it clear there would be ""no exception for him"" in the bill that allows sacking of ministers facing corruption or serious charges.

"'Dumper state': Rajnath Singh's reply to Asim Munir's Mercedes statement; 'consider it confession, not troll'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dumper-state-rajnath-singhs-reply-to-asim-munirs-mercedes-statement-consider-it-confession-not-troll/articleshow/123453803.cms,"NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday took a jab at Pakistan army chief Asim Munir 's Mercedes statement, calling it a ""confession"" rather than a ""troll material"". Drawing attention to Munir's odd analogy where he compared India to a “shining Mercedes” and Pakistan to a “dump truck”, Singh said that it was acknowledged by everyone that India had a ""Ferrari-like economy"" and Pakistan was still in a ""dumper state"".""I am not saying. Pakistan's economy is like a dump truck full of debris. Now you people know the answer to this. Now, Asim Munir was trolled a lot for this statement both inside Pakistan and all over the world. Everyone said that if two countries got independence at the same time and one country built a Ferrari-like economy through hard work, right policies and foresight and the other is still in a dumper state, then it is their own failure,"" Rajnath Singh said at Economic Times World Leaders Forum 2025.""I consider this statement of Asim Munir as a confession. I do not consider his statement as mere troll material... If we do not pay attention to the historical indication behind this serious warning, then it can become a matter of concern for us. And yes, if we pay attention to this and prepare for it, then India is capable of giving a befitting reply to such warnings,"" he added.Munir's Mercedes statement has been the latest one on India where he compared the two nations and went on to claim that one could ""imagine"" what would happen if the two collided.“India is like a shining Mercedes, but we are like a dumper truck, loaded with stones; imagine what happens when the two collide,” he had said.Earlier this month, Munir sparked outrage with a provocative warning to India, claiming that Islamabad would be willing to “take down half the world” if faced with an existential threat from New Delhi. India swiftly rejected the remarks as another instance of Pakistan’s “nuclear sabre-rattling,” stressing that it would not succumb to nuclear blackmail.At the heart of Munir’s statement was a controversial “crude analogy,” in which he likened India to a “shining Mercedes” and Pakistan to a “dump truck full of gravel,” suggesting that even in collision, India would suffer significant losses.Munir’s analogy was widely mocked across social media, where users ridiculed what they saw as an inadvertent admission of Pakistan’s economic and military weakness in comparison to India.","Defence minister rajnath singh takes a jab at pakistan army chief asim munir's mercedes statement.

Jay Rosehill calls the trade a “pipe dream” but says Leafs should take it

Fans divided over the bold trade proposal

Former NHL enforcer Jay Rosehill stirred the pot this week with a bold trade scenario that has Toronto Maple Leafs fans debating the future of their blue line. On the ""Leafs Morning Take"" podcast, Rosehill weighed in on a hypothetical deal that would send Morgan Rielly and Nick Robertson to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Erik Karlsson , who is on an eight-year, $92 million contract.While acknowledging the unlikeliness of such a move, Jay Rosehill made it clear he’d pull the trigger in a heartbeat. “I take that all day,” Rosehill said. “We're gonna try and get rid of Nick Robertson in general… I just don't think he's gonna be here. And Morgan Rielly is, you know, kind of stalled, makes 7.5 million. Doesn't produce like he used to. Sometimes has some dead stuff going on in the D-zone.”Rosehill praised Karlsson’s resume, pointing to his Norris Trophy-winning pedigree, elite puck movement, and power play ability. Still, he admitted the blockbuster was more of a dream scenario than a realistic front-office move. “I just don't see anyone going for that… so I would take it for sure. But I just don't see it happening.”The mock deal quickly lit up fan discussions online. Some fans argued that Karlsson isn’t worth the package, while others said it would be a “Christmas present” for Toronto. One fan countered bluntly: “Pretty sure Rielly says no.”Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Edmonton Oilers weighing major trade with Bruins as Connor McDavid contract factor looms With Toronto’s offseason decisions still under scrutiny, Rosehill’s take reflects a broader debate: should the Leafs gamble on another star defenseman or continue betting on their current core?",Toronto maple leafs linked to shocking erik karlsson trade.
