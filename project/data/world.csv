Trump announces 25% tariff on countries buying Venezuelan oil - How it will impact India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-announces-25-tariff-on-countries-buying-venezuelan-oil-how-it-will-impact-india/articleshow/119433171.cms,"Key figures regarding India's oil/gas imports from Venezuela:

December 2023: India imported approximately 191,600 barrels per day (bpd). Reliance Industries received around 127,000 bpd, while Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and HPCL-Mittal Energy received approximately 37,000 bpd and 28,000 bpd, respectively.

January 2024: India's imports rose to over 254,000 bpd, which was nearly half of Venezuela's total oil exports of almost 557,000 bpd for the month.

President Donald Trump said on Monday he would levy a 25 percent tariff across the board on any country buying oil or gas from Venezuela, as he escalated trade wars with a number of US foes and allies.""Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse,"" he wrote on his Truth Social network. ""Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country.""In December 2023 and January 2024, India became the top buyer of Venezuelan crude oil. In 2024, India imported 22 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which made up 1.5% of India's total crude oil purchases.Announcing the new tarrif, Trump said on his Truth Social platform: ""President Donald J. Trump announced today that the United States of America will be putting what is known as a Secondary Tariff on the Country of Venezuela, for numerous reasons, including the fact that Venezuela has purposefully and deceitfully sent to the United States, undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals, many of whom are murderers and people of a very violent nature. Among the gangs they sent to the United States, is Tren de Aragua, which has been given the designation of “Foreign Terrorist Organization.” We are in the process of returning them to Venezuela — It is a big task! In addition, Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse.""""Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country. All documentation will be signed and registered, and the Tariff will take place on April 2nd, 2025, LIBERATION DAY IN AMERICA. Please let this notification serve to represent that the Department of Homeland Security, Border Patrol, and all other Law Enforcement Agencies within our Country have been so notified. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump added.","President donald trump said on monday he would levy a 25 percent tariff across the board on any country buying oil or gas from venezuela.

India to conduct joint naval exercise 'Aikeyme' with 10 African nations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-conduct-joint-naval-exercise-aikeyme-with-10-african-nations/articleshow/119428378.cms,"Photo: Navy

NEW DELHI: India will now for the first time conduct a major naval exercise called `Aikeyme’ with 10 African countries, as part of the continuing military outreach to the continent where China has made major strategic inroads, even as it keeps a close watch on the threats posed by Somali pirates and Houthi rebels in the region.The Navy will next month also launch another maiden initiative called `Indian Ocean ship (IOS) Sagar’, under which a combined crew of Indian sailors and 44 personnel from nine friendly foreign countries will man offshore patrol vessel INS Sunayna during her deployment to the south-west Indian Ocean Region (IOR) from April m5 to May 8.“Over the past 10 years, the Indian Navy has deepened its partnerships with navies and agencies of IOR countries to enhance maritime security in consonance with the govt’s vision of `Sagar’ (security and growth for all in the region),” Navy deputy chief Vice Admiral Tarun Sobti on Monday.“With the announcement of `Mahasagar’ (mutual and holistic advancement for security across the regions) by the PM during his visit to Mauritius in March, Aikeyme and IOS Sagar -- first of their kind initiatives -- are aimed at consolidating India’s stature as the ‘preferred security partner’ and `first responder in the IOR,” he said.While attacks by Somali pirates and Houthi rebels in the region have receded since Dec, an Indian warship is permanently deployed in the Gulf of Aden and adjoining seas, and more will be sent if piracy gains “ascendancy” again, the deputy chief added.The multi-nation Aikeyme exercise, or the `Africa-India key maritime engagement’, will be conducted off Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania from April 13 to 18. “We are looking to make the exercise a biennial endeavour. This time it includes east African countries. In the next edition, we will invite west African countries as well to make it a larger African exercise,” Vice Admiral Sobti said.The countries taking part in Aikeyme, which will be inaugurated by defence minister Rajnath Singh, include Tanzania (which is co-hosting it), the Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles and South Africa.The exercise will focus on VBSS (visit board search and seizure) drills, arms firings, helicopter operations, seamanship evolutions, search and rescue missions, among others. “There will also be table-top and command post exercises on anti-piracy operations and information-sharing,” Vice Admiral Sobti said.India and Africa give immense importance to maritime security and have reiterated their commitment to increase cooperation in tackling threats such as piracy, drugs smuggling, trafficking and other illegal activities through sharing of information and surveillance, he added.The IOS Sagar, in turn, will see 44 personnel -- already undergoing training at Kochi -- from Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Seychelles and South Africa on board INS Sunayna, which will set sail from Karwar on April 5.The warship will undertake port calls at Dar-es-Salaam, Nacala, Port Louis, Port Victoria and Male as well as undertake joint surveillance of EEZs of Tanzania, Mozambique, Mauritius and Seychelles.",India will now for the first time conduct a major naval exercise with 10 african countries.

Elon Musk Tesla Latest News: Tesla investor who called for Elon Musk's exit says Board should not have allowed him to purchase Twitter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tesla-investor-who-called-for-elon-musks-exit-says-board-should-not-have-allowed-him-to-purchase-twitter/articleshow/119351660.cms,"Some Tesla investors want Elon Musk to step down from the CEO post.

Can Elon Musk be removed as CEO?



Long-time Tesla investor Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who called for Elon Musk 's exit from the company has now said that the Tesla Board should have never let him purchase Twitter as that started Elon Musk's distraction from Tesla. ""Why has the board of directors sat quietly while so much brand value has been eroded to the point that cars are being set on fire?"" he said. ""It's been wildly negligent that the board has done nothing to curb Elon's behavior, especially around extremist statements.""Gerber's statement came as shares of Tesla dropped in the wake of massive protests against Elon Musk inside the country and also outside. Hundreds of Tesla vehicles have been set on fire showing anger against Elon's interference in the government decisions. The arson incidents are being treated as 'domestic terrorism' by the Donald Trump administration who sympathized with Elon at this time of crisis.Elon, however, brushed aside the emergency and adviced shareholders to hold on to their shares -- in a surprised all-hands meeting of Tesla.Gerber said the Tesla Board can't do anything against Musk as it solely functions for the benefit of Elon and is highly compensated by him. ""They're not going to do anything he doesn't say,"" Gerber said.Newsweek reported that Tesla shareholders don't have the power to directly vote to remove the CEO. But they could influence the Board if they believe Musk's leadership endangers their investment. ""An ouster would likely occur if enough board members—facing pressure from large investors—determined that Musk's actions or controversies significantly harmed Tesla's performance or reputation,"" David Park, professor of entrepreneurship at Syracuse University, told Newsweek.Gerber believes Tesla is suffering because of Elon Musk's involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) -- the department that he has been leading solely after Vivek Ramaswamy's exit. DOGE has a mandate to cut the government spending within a year and after that DOGE is supposed to stop functioning.As the world's wealthiest individual, Musk has assumed a prominent position in President Donald Trump's second term, heading DOGE. However, his engagement in politics has sparked investor unease, leading to Tesla's poor market performance throughout 2025.In 2025, Tesla's share value has declined by 37 per cent, following Musk's controversial political statements and decisions. Recent weeks have also witnessed increasing incidents of Tesla vehicles being targeted for vandalism including gunshots fired at Tesla dealerships, or targeted in arson attacks.Read more: Tesla arson attacks investigated as 'domestic terrorism,' backed by radical group tied to 2020 riots",Long-time tesla investor ross gerber has called for elon musk's exit from the company.

Indians on green cards are advised not to panic but to carry relevant documents when returning to the US from abroad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indians-on-green-cards-are-advised-not-to-panic-but-to-carry-relevant-documents-when-returning-to-the-us-from-abroad/articleshow/119419156.cms,"Checklist of documents that green card holders should carry with them for re-entry into the US



Valid and unexpired green card (Form I-551) – Ensure it is unexpired.

Passport from home country

Re-entry permit (if applicable) – Needed for those staying abroad for over one year but less than two years

Pay stubs from current employment (last 3 months)

Employment verification letter

Previous year’s W-2 form and federal income tax return copy

US bank account details

US driver’s licence

With a tough immigration policy being followed by the US government and key agencies including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ), putting green card holders under heightened scrutiny; many Indians who are living and working in the US with legal permanent resident status (green cards) are worried.A recent statement by US Vice-President, JD Vance , that a green card “doesn’t give you an indefinite right to stay in the US”, has sparked concerns among thousands of Indians who are in the US on green cards. However, many experts and immigration attorneys feel that there’s no need to panic for most Indians who are on green cards and may need to travel outside the US, including on visits to India.“Though green cards can be revoked for certain reasons, including national security risks or criminal activity, most Indian professionals are law-abiding and tax-paying individuals. They don’t need to panic. As long as they follow US laws, avoid criminal activities, maintain strong ties to the US, and avoid extended stays abroad, they have little to worry about,” feels Neha Mahajan , co-founder of Skilled Immigrants in America (SIIA), an organisation supporting Indians stuck in long green card queues. She adds that green cards aren’t automatically at risk unless someone engages in actions that violate immigration rules or national security policies.The green card is a status of permanent resident in the US; hence strong ties to the US are important. “One can have multiple residences but the US government wants America to be the permanent residence of green card holders,” says Manjunath Gokare , an attorney based in Atlanta, Georgia, who specialises in immigration. Law requires that the green card holder must live in the US (maintain a home or apartment); maintain employment in the US; file income taxes in the US on all income earned globally; and maintain US bank accounts and driver’s licence.An important factor for green card status is the duration of travel outside the US and long absences are not recommended. “A stay of less than six months outside the US typically does not raise questions. A stay of more than six months but less than one year could result in additional scrutiny upon arrival in the US. A stay beyond one year without a valid re-entry permit (Form I-131) may lead to the presumption that you have abandoned your green card,” says Mumbai-based immigration lawyer, Poorvi Chothani.For green card holders, it is important to keep certain documents with them and to make sure that they are valid and updated. “Keep your green card valid and on you and renew it on time and always carry the original when you are travelling. Keep your US bank account, active health insurance, driver’s licence, and tax records up to date,” says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should file taxes as resident (1040) and not as non-resident.Given the increased scrutiny at ports of entry, it is wise to carry certain documents for green card holders returning from overseas. “These include pay stubs from your current employment (last 3 months); employment verification letter and last year’s W-2 form and federal income tax return copy,” says Gokare.It is very important for green card holders not to have been convicted of any criminal offences (classified under US immigration laws as aggravated felonies) that render them deportable or removable, under US immigration laws.“If one is maintaining their permanent residence in the US and does not have any criminal convictions, then there is nothing to worry about. Green card holders that are targeted by CBP, typically have either residency issues or removable criminal convictions,” says Gokare. He adds that green card holders who believe that they have always complied with the law, but are yet facing issues at the port of entry, should ask the CBP officers to set up a ‘deferred inspection’.“With an appointment for deferred inspection, a green card holder is allowed to provide evidence and can be accompanied by a lawyer when they meet with CBP officers to present their case as to how they are maintaining permanent residence in the US,” he says.If faced with tough questions at a US border, green card holders are advised not to sign any forms; including Form I-407; which is the record of abandonment of legal permanent residence status; without consulting their lawyers, even if there is pressure from CBP. “No one is legally required to sign it. If they refuse, CBP cannot unilaterally strip them of their green card without due process,” says Chothani.Despite providing evidence of resident status and ties to the US, if CBP officials ask green card holders to renounce their green cards on arrival, there are still certain potential recourse measures that can be taken up.“Those who have been outside the US for an extended period should be prepared for questioning by CBP officers. If placed in secondary inspection, it is best to remain calm and provide clear responses regarding ties to the US,” says Chothani.Secondary inspections can take up to two hours to clear and Gokare advises anyone facing such inspections to co-operate with the officers and not get alarmed. Even if CBP insists that a green card holder is inadmissible or has abandoned their green card, they can still request a notice to appear before an immigration judge. This allows them to fight the case in immigration court rather than surrendering the green card at the airport.“If an individual’s green card is revoked, they may still have a few options including filing for a motion with the USCIS or immigration court to reopen or reconsider and applying for a returning resident visa to regain LPR status,” Chothani says.Finally, five years after getting their green cards, those who are eligible can consider US citizenship. “It’s the best way to make sure you don’t have to worry about losing your status,” says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should stay engaged; follow rules and not let small mistakes put their status at risk.","A recent statement by us vice-president, jd vance, has sparked concerns among thousands of indians who are in the us on green cards. It is important to keep certain documents with them and to make sure that they are valid and updated.

UK issues new travel advice for citizens going to US

Though Canada has not issued any travel advisory against visiting the United States, Canadian lawmaker Charlie Angus issued a warning against travelling to the US as he claimed that Canadian citizens are being kidnapped by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents. ""We have seen too many stories of citizens being pulled out of airport lines, and being fingerprinted and deported, as if they were criminals. Citizens being kidnapped to illegal detention by ICE…this is not the actions of a Democratic nation,"" New Democratic Party's leader said. While Canada and US have locked horns in a tariff war, the travel warning coincides with the Trump administration's border crackdown.""Canada will never kiss that gangster's ring. We are truth, we are north, we are strong, we are free, we will not bend, and we will not give an inch,"" Angus said in a press conference.Canadian actor Jasmine Mooney who starred in an American Pie video said she was put in chains when she went to renew her visa at the San Ysidro border crossing. She said she was told that she was in the wrong place and that she should have gone to a US consulate. After some to and fro, she was put into ICE custody as she failed to explain to the officers that she was not trying to enter the US illegally. After 12 days of detention, she was finally released and allowed to fly back to Canada.In a massive crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Trump administration has been on an arrest spree. The arrest of two green card holders, Mahmoud Khalil and Badar Khan Suri, created ripples as the administration is planning to deport them. Around 200 members of Venezuela's notorious prison gang Tren de Aragua have been sent to El Salvador, though according to claims some among them are not gang members.The UK government's ""foreign travel advice"" for the US warns travelers to ""comply with all entry, visa and other conditions of entry.

Trump to impose high tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Will it impact India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-to-impose-high-tariffs-on-countries-buying-venezuelan-oil-will-it-impact-india/articleshow/119450907.cms,"25% tariffs on Venezuelan oil



Will it impact India?



Failure to uphold agreement



The 'dirty 15' countries



US President Donald Trump on Monday announced high tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas—a move that could impact India, China, and others while fueling global trade tensions.""Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse. Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.Trump further accused Venezuela of ""purposefully and deceitfully"" sending criminals to the United States, including violent offenders and members of organisations such as Tren de Aragua.Trump has aggressively imposed tariffs on both allies and rivals, using them as a tool to exert economic and diplomatic pressure, since his return to the White House in January.The newly proposed 25% tariffs on Venezuelan oil, affecting both direct and indirect purchasers, could be implemented from April 2, as per Trump's signed directive.The implementation decision rests with the secretary of state, who will consult with other US agencies before determining whether to enforce these levies.These tariffs scheduled for April 2, coincides with Trump's planned announcement of reciprocal tariffs on other nations—a day he calls ""liberation day.""In addition to reciprocal tariffs, he has vowed to impose broad sector-specific duties on imported automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.The tariffs could impact India and China, as both nations import Venezuelan oil, along with the United States and Spain. Trump confirmed the 25% tariff would be additional to existing rates.The order stipulates that the 25% tariff will cease one year after a country's last Venezuelan oil import, or earlier at Washington's discretion.In 2024, India imported 22 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which made up 1.5% of India's total crude oil purchases.In January 2024: The nation's imports increased to above 254,000 barrels per day, representing approximately half of Venezuela's aggregate oil exports, which totalled nearly 557,000 barrels per day during this period.In December 2023: India's crude oil imports stood at roughly 191,600 barrels per day. The distribution amongst companies showed Reliance Industries securing 127,000 barrels per day.Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) obtained 37,000 barrels per day, and the HPCL-Mittal Energy received 28,000 barrels per day.Last year in February, Venezuela exported approximately 500,000 barrels of oil daily to China and 240,000 barrels to the United States, according to AFP.Trump's announcement follows last month's suspension of the deportation pipeline between the US and Venezuela, citing Caracas' failure to uphold an agreement to take back migrants quickly. Following this, Venezuela withdrew from accepting these flights.Earlier on Saturday, Caracas announced reaching a new agreement with Washington to resume deportations, resulting in nearly 200 Venezuelan nationals being deported from the US through Honduras.Separately, the Trump administration extended the operational deadline for US petroleum corporation Chevron in Venezuela until May 27. The firm had been functioning under a sanctions exemption.Earlier, during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Washington would approach trading partners to discuss tariff levels and non-tariff barriers.Bessent explained that countries could potentially avoid these levies by discontinuing their current practices.During the same discussion, Bessent mentioned that the tariffs would target approximately 15 percent of nations having trade imbalances with the US, referring to them as a ""dirty 15.""","25% tariffs on venezuelan oil and gas to be implemented from april 2.

His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkiye in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law.A total of 1,133 people have been detained since March 19, when the mayor was arrested at his home, interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said. As many as 123 police officers were injured in the protests, he said adding dangerous materials like acid, firebombs and knives were seized.The minister said some of the detained were identified as having ties to groups listed as terrorist organisations.

Mahmoud Khalil: In His Own Words

'Lot of things have changed with the election of Donald Trump'



The Trump administration has found a new ground to seek the deportation of a Syrian-born immigrant with a green card Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over his pro-Palestinian protest.The administration alleges Mahmoud Khalil provided inaccurate information on his green card application, rendering him ineligible for US residency.Court documents reveal that the administration claims Khalil omitted details about his extended employment at the British Embassy's Syria Office in Beirut beyond 2022, and his role as a ""political affairs officer"" at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) from June to November 2023, ABC news reported.The filing states, ""Khalil is now charged as inadmissible at the time of his adjustment of status because he sought to procure an immigration benefit by fraud of willful misrepresentation of a material fact.""The administration further contended that Khalil failed to disclose his membership in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest organisation.Khalil was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at his Columbia-owned apartment and later moved to a detention facility in Louisiana, where he now faces deportation.The filing asserts, ""Khalil's First Amendment allegations are a red herring, and there is an independent basis to justify removal sufficient to foreclose Khalil's constitutional claim.""In response, Khalil's attorney Marc Van Der Hout told ABC News, ""The additional charges the government filed last week are completely meritless. They show that the government has no case whatsoever on this bogus charge that his presence in the U.S. would have adverse foreign policy consequences. This case is purely about First Amendment protected activity and speech, and U.S. citizens and permanent residents alike are free to say what they wish about what is going on in the world.""Since 2023, Trump has repeatedly vowed to revoke visas of international students who participate in pro-Palestinian protests and criticize Israel's war efforts.During Monday's State Department briefing, spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided directly addressing whether UNRWA employment history would disqualify visa applicants, instead stating, ""If you lie in your efforts to come to the United States to get a visa for any reason, or for a green card, maybe there haven't been repercussions, or we haven't done things properly in the past. A lot of things have changed with the election of Donald Trump.""Following his initial arrest, Khalil was moved from his student accommodation to 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, then to Elizabeth, New Jersey's immigration facility, before transfer to a Louisiana Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centre, according to his legal representatives.","The administration alleges mahmoud khalil provided inaccurate information on his green card application, rendering him ineligible for us residency.

Black Cove fire: Started by a downed power line, this fire has burned 2,076 acres and remains 0% contained as of Sunday.

Deep Woods fire: The largest fire in the county, covering 1,802 acres, is also completely uncontained.

Fish Hook fire: The smallest of the three, this fire has burned 199 acres but is 50% contained.

Emergency measures and safety

South Carolina

Table Rock fire (Pickens county): This fire has expanded to over 1,280 acres, forcing authorities to request voluntary evacuations near Table Rock Mountain. Firefighters have used controlled burns to contain the flames.

Persimmon Ridge fire (Greenville county): This blaze, which ignited on Saturday, has spread to 800 acres despite aerial water drops.

Burning ban and safety measures



Why are these wildfires so intense?

Long road ahead

Firefighters are battling multiple wildfires in North and South Carolina, with rough terrain, strong winds, and dry conditions making containment efforts extremely difficult. The fires, which have already burned thousands of acres, are fueled by debris left behind by Hurricane Helene and an ongoing drought across the region.The North Carolina forest service reported three active wildfires in Polk county, with two major blazes spanning between 1.7 square miles (4.4 square kilometers) and 1.9 square miles (4.9 square kilometers). Fires are also burning in Burke, Madison, and Stokes counties, with Stokes County bordering Virginia.The three major wildfires: Black Cove, Deep Woods, and Fish Hook, continue to spread, forcing evacuations and threatening homes.The Black Clove and Deep Woods fire have each destroyed one home and two structures, officials in Polk County said, quoted by NBC news.At 8.20 pm on Saturday, the North Carolina department of public safety had issued mandatory evacuation orders for parts of the county, located 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte. A shelter was also set up in Columbus, North Carolina.Over 165 properties are under mandatory evacuation orders, particularly in areas near the Henderson County line. Local officials have issued voluntary evacuation notices for parts of Laurel Mountain View Road and Boulder View Road as the flames continue to advance.Due to the escalating crisis, North Carolina has issued a statewide burn ban. The North Carolina division of air quality has also declared a “Code Red” air quality alert for Polk County, warning residents to avoid prolonged outdoor exposure. Rutherford county is under a “Code Orange” alert, signalling hazardous air conditions for sensitive groups.Kim Callaway, a Polk county resident near one of the evacuation zones, described the tense situation, “We’ve already actually evacuated everything that we thought that was important.”“And now we’re just staying at the house and trying to do what we can to get our house prepared if the firemen need to show up and hold the line,” Callaway further told WLOS-TV.The fires were burning through timberlands in the Green River Gorge, spreading across steep and difficult terrain on both state-owned and private properties.South Carolina is also struggling with dangerous wildfires, prompting governor Henry McMaster to declare a state of emergency. Two fires in the mountainous region are proving difficult to control:Both the Table Rock and Persimmon Ridge fires were sparked by human activity. While no injuries had been reported and no structures were under immediate threat, voluntary evacuations remained in effect for around 100 homes.The state also obtained a FEMA grant to help cover the costs for additional fire crews, air tankers and other equipment, McMasters said on Monday, USA Today reported.In a statement, the governor said, ""The statewide burning ban remains in effect as wildfire risks remain high across the state.”""Anyone who violates this ban can and will go to jail.""According to the New York Post, the fire that broke out on Sunday morning had spread to approximately 100 acres. The South Carolina National Guard reported that a National Guard air crew had joined efforts to contain the Persimmon Ridge Fire in Greenville, South Carolina.According to Robert Scheller, a forestry professor at North Carolina State University, the devastation left by Hurricane Helene last September has created perfect conditions for these fires.“Helene just dropped tons of fuel on the ground,” he said, “Then these flash droughts allow that fuel to dry out very fast.”This phenomenon was also observed in 2022, when the Bertha Swamp road fire burned 51 square miles of Florida’s timberland, following the path of Hurricane Michael.The North Carolina department of agriculture and consumer services reported that at least 250 firefighters from across the region are battling the flames. The combination of fallen trees, steep terrain, and dry weather is making their job significantly harder.With no significant rainfall in the forecast and high winds continuing to fan the flames, officials warn that the fire season could last for weeks. Residents in affected areas are urged to stay alert, follow evacuation orders, and take precautions against smoke inhalation.","Firefighters are battling multiple wildfires in north and south carolina, with rough terrain, strong winds, and dry conditions making containment efforts extremely difficult.

Vanessa Trump, formerly known as Vanessa Haydon, is the ex-wife of Donald Trump Jr. , the eldest son of Donald J. Trump, the 45th and 47th President of the United States. This makes her Donald Trump’s former daughter-in-law.Vanessa and Donald Trump Jr. married in November 2005 at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, a property owned by Donald Trump. The wedding was a high-profile event attended by many from the political, social, and business elite, consistent with the Trump family’s media-heavy presence even before Donald Trump’s presidency. During their marriage, Vanessa and Donald Jr. had five children together, making Donald Trump their grandfather.Born Vanessa Kay Haydon, she was a former model and aspiring actress. Raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Vanessa had a relatively privileged upbringing and was known in New York social circles even before her marriage to Donald Trump Jr. She signed with Wilhelmina Models and appeared in various campaigns during her modeling career. She also briefly dabbled in acting, appearing in films like Something's Gotta Give.While married to Donald Jr., Vanessa was often seen at Trump family events and campaign appearances, particularly during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential run. However, her role was more subdued compared to other Trump family members like Ivanka or Melania. She maintained a low public profile, especially after reports emerged about tensions in her marriage in the mid-2010s.In March 2018, Vanessa Trump filed for divorce from Donald Trump Jr. after nearly 13 years of marriage. The divorce was finalized later that year. In a joint statement, the couple emphasized their continued commitment to co-parenting their five children.Though no longer married into the Trump family, Vanessa has occasionally been in the news, most recently in March 2025 when it was confirmed that she is in a relationship with golf legend Tiger Woods. The news stirred renewed interest in her background and her ties to the Trump family. Some reports suggest that her daughter Kai, an avid young golfer, may have played a role in connecting Vanessa with Woods.Ironically, Vanessa had once briefly dated Donald Trump himself before she was introduced to his son. According to past interviews and reports, she had a few interactions with Donald Trump Sr. in the early 2000s, but the relationship didn’t last. Shortly afterward, she was introduced to Donald Jr. by the elder Trump at a fashion show. That twist of personal history has become more notable with her recent relationship with Tiger Woods, another man famously associated with Donald Trump.Donald Trump’s deep connection to golf also makes the Vanessa-Woods relationship even more interesting. Trump is an avid golfer and owns or operates nearly 20 golf properties around the world. He has frequently played with professional golfers, including Tiger Woods, and has awarded him honors such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2019. Woods has played on Trump courses and was seen as a friendly associate of the former president. This new romantic link between Woods and Vanessa Trump places her once again at the intersection of politics, celebrity, and the sport that Trump has long considered central to his brand.","Vanessa trump, formerly known as vanessa haydon, is the ex-wife of donald trump jr. the eldest son of donald j. trump, the 45th and 47th president of the united states.

Greenland Prime Minister Mute B. Egede has criticised an upcoming US delegation's visit, including second lady Usha Vance, as ""highly aggressive"", further straining relations following President Donald Trump's stated intentions to annex the Danish territory.The White House announced that Vance, spouse of US Vice President JD Vance, will visit Greenland to attend the national dogsled race and engage with local culture. National security adviser Mike Waltz might also join her in the visit, according to the CNN.In an interview with Sermitsiaq newspaper on Sunday, Greenland PM Egede expressed strong concerns about Waltz's presence, questioning the motives behind sending a national security adviser to Greenland.""What is the national security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,"" Egede said. ""His mere presence in Greenland will no doubt fuel American belief in Trump's mission — and the pressure will increase.""The territory has gained international attention due to Trump's annexation plans, particularly given its strategic reserves of rare earth minerals and growing Arctic competition between the US, Russia and China. Trump has consistently advocated for US control despite firm opposition from Denmark and Greenland.""I think we're going to get it one way or the other,"" Trump said during remarks to a joint session of Congress earlier this month.Egede, who advocates for Greenland's independence from Denmark, noted that diplomatic efforts have proven ineffective against Trump's administration's determination to control Greenland.Despite his party's recent electoral defeat, Egede continues as prime minister until a new coalition forms. Likely successor Jens-Frederik Nielsen criticised the timing of the American visit, citing ongoing negotiations and municipal elections.The White House characterised Vance's visit as cultural, focusing on historical sites and the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race. This unprecedented high-level delegation to the race has raised eyebrows.Greenland's relationship with Denmark evolved from colonial rule to self-governance in 1953, with expanded powers granted in 2009. Denmark retains control over security, defence, foreign and monetary matters, whilst Greenland benefits from Danish EU and NATO membership.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen emphasised the seriousness of the US delegation's visit, advocating for cooperation whilst maintaining sovereignty principles.","Greenland prime minister mute b. egede has criticised an upcoming us delegation's visit as ""highly aggressive"" usha vance, spouse of us vice president jd vance, will visit greenland to attend the national dogsled race and engage with local culture.
