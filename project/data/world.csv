We could hear the sound of firing for a long time. We didn’t look back. Everyone was screaming, trying to get out. The exit gate was just four feet wide, and there were too many people.

NEW DELHI: Terror struck at the heart of Kashmir’s tourist belt once again on Tuesday, as militants opened fire on a crowded site in Pahalgam, killing at least 28 people, including two foreign nationals from the UAE and Nepal, and two locals. The incident, which also left dozens injured, has reignited memories of the valley’s most brutal attacks on civilians over the past three decades.The assault, carried out at one of south Kashmir’s most visited locations, comes just months after the deadly June 2024 attack in Reasi, where pilgrims en route to Vaishno Devi were targeted. Officials described Tuesday’s attack as the deadliest on civilians in recent years.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who landed in Delhi shortly after the attack, held an emergency meeting with NSA Ajit Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar at the airport itself. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah called the attack “much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years.”Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi said he had spoken with home minister Amit Shah, the J&K chief minister, and Congress leader Tariq Karra to understand the situation. ""The families of the victims deserve justice and our fullest support. Hollow claims of normalcy must now give way to concrete action,” Gandhi said.This is not the first time Pahalgam has found itself in the crosshairs. From the abduction of six foreign tourists in 1995, one of whom was later killed, to the 2000 Nunwan base camp massacre that left 32 dead, including Amarnath pilgrims and local vendors, the region has seen more than its share of bloodshed.The valley’s history is pockmarked with chilling incidents:, 36 Sikhs were massacred in Chittisinghpora on the eve of President Clinton’s visit.9 Amarnath pilgrims were killed in an attack at the Nunwan camp., seven Amarnath pilgrims, mostly from Gujarat, were killed in Anantnag., a Vaishno Devi-bound bus came under fire in Reasi, killing 10 and injuring 33.From fidayeen assaults on temples to grenade attacks on buses, the targets have mostly remained the same: pilgrims, tourists, migrant workers, and minority communities.As the nation mourns yet another tragedy, pressure is mounting on the Centre and state administration to move beyond statements and deliver actionable security reforms.","Militants opened fire on a crowded site in pahalgam, killing at least 28 people, including two foreign nationals from the uae and nepal.

NEW DELHI: Panic gripped Pahalgam in South Kashmir on Tuesday after terrorists attacked a popular tourist spot, leaving more than 26 people dead, according to PTI.The attack occurred around 3 PM when terrorists descended from the mountains of Baisaran Valley and opened fire on tourists in the area, which is often called 'mini Switzerland' for its scenic green meadows.Videos circulating online showed security forces and police rushing to the scene, with several people lying injured or motionless on the ground.Cries for help echoed across the Baisaran meadows, as panicked women were seen weeping and frantically searching for their loved ones amid pool of blood.One woman, who did not reveal her identity, pleaded for urgent help to move the injured to the hospital.“Bhaiyya, please save my husband,” she cried, her voice shaking with desperation, reported news agency PTI.Ambulances were rushed in to assist the victims. At Pahalgam hospital, medical staff confirmed 12 tourists were receiving treatment, adding that all were in stable condition.""My husband was shot in the head while seven others were also injured in the attack,"" a woman survivor told PTI over phone call.The incident occurs during a period of increased tourism in Kashmir following years of unrest.

NEW DELHI: The Resistance Front (TRF), proxy outfit of Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed 's Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), on Tuesday claimed responsibility for the ghastly attack on tourists in J&K's Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives.""More than 85,000 domiciles have been issued to non-locals, creating a pathway for demographic change in Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK). These non-locals arrive posing as tourists, obtain domiciles, and then being to act as if they own the land. Consequently, violence will be directed toward those attempting to settle illegally,"" the TRF said.The TRF, which was banned by the government last year, has been involved in recruiting youth through the online medium for the furtherance of terrorist activities, recruitment of terrorists, infiltration of terrorists and smuggling of weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into J&K.The group came into existence in 2019 as a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was involved in numerous terror acts, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.Sheikh Sajjad Gul is a commander of The Resistance Front and has been designated as a terrorist under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act 1967.TRF has been responsible for numerous attacks targeting civilians, security forces, and political figures in Jammu and Kashmir. Its operations are believed to be supported by Pakistani state mechanisms, including the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), aiming to sustain unrest in the region.In January 2023, the Indian government designated TRF as a terrorist organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and Sheikh Sajjad Gul was officially labelled a terrorist. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has since placed a bounty on Gul, reflecting the group's significant threat to regional stability.Union home minister Amit Shah arrived in Srinagar on Tuesday evening to assess the security situation in Kashmir following a deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam that left 26 people dead.After landing, Shah headed straight to Raj Bhavan from the airport and is set to chair a high-level meeting with top security officials. He is also expected to visit Pahalgam on Wednesday.The attack, which took place in the picturesque Baisaran Valley—often referred to as “mini Switzerland”—is the deadliest targeting civilians in Kashmir since the 2019 Pulwama strike. Terrorists opened fire on tourists gathered in the popular meadow near Pahalgam, killing 26, including two foreigners and two local residents, according to a senior official.Located around six kilometers from Pahalgam town, Baisaran is a scenic meadow surrounded by dense pine forests and mountains. Witnesses said gunmen entered the area and began shooting at tourists who were enjoying pony rides, eating at local stalls, or picnicking on the grass.","The resistance front (trf), proxy outfit of pakistani terrorist hafiz saeed's lashkar-e-taiba (let), on tuesday claimed responsibility for the ghastly attack on tourists in j&k's pahalgam.
