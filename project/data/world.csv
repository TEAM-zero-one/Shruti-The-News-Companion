NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Namansh Syal of the Indian Air Force was honoured with a ‘Missing Man’ manoeuvre by the Russian Knights aerobatics team after he was killed in a Tejas fighter jet crash at the Dubai Air Show on Friday.After the crash of the Indian Tejas fighter jet, the Russian Knights released a video of their performance at the Dubai Airshow 2025, paying tribute to the pilot and honouring the lives lost.In the video, shared on Russian social media platform VK, the team described the crash as “impossible to describe” and said their final-day performance was dedicated to the “memory of the brothers who did not return from the last flight”.At the air show, members of the US F-16 team also reacted strongly to the tragedy. Their pilot, Captain Taylor Hiester, said he was shocked that the event continued despite the fatal accident. The US team, along with a few others, chose to cancel their performance out of respect for the Indian pilot, his colleagues and his family.“After two years of doing this job, that was a first for our team and it came just before our final performance of the season.Together and individually, we all quietly watched the aftermath unfold from a distance thinking about the Indian maintenance crew standing on the ramp next to an empty parking spot, aircraft ladder laid on the ground, the pilot's belongings still in his rental car,” Hiester wrote as he headed back to the US.The Tejas aircraft was in the middle of an eight-minute aerobatic display when it suddenly lost altitude during what appeared to be a low-level manoeuvre. Visuals aired across several channels showed the jet diving toward the ground before erupting into flames, sending thick black smoke over Al Maktoum International Airport. Spectators, including families with children, watched in shock as emergency teams rushed to the scene.","Wing commander namansh syal of the indian air force was honoured with a ‘missing man’ manoeuvre by the russian knights aerobatics team after he was killed in a tejas fighter jet crash.

'No Longer Optional': PM Modi Calls For UNSC Reforms At IBSA Meet; Urges United Stand Against Terror

PM Narendra Modi participated in the IBSA Leaders' Meeting on G20 margins, stressing that UNSC reform is imperative, and said that there should be no room for double standards while fighting terrorism.PM Modi joined the trilateral mechanism meet hosted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and attended also by Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.While all three countries have had their share of problems with the US under Trump, diplomatic sources played down suggestions that the meeting was a response to the Americans as they cited the fact that a substantive IBSA summit meeting took place on the margins of 2024 G20 summit too in Rio.The US boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa because of alleged mistreatment of white Afrikaners.PM Modi said global institutions do not reflect the realities of 21st century. ""None of us is a permanent member of UN Security Council. This clearly demonstrates that global institutions no longer represent today's world. Therefore, IBSA must send a unified message to the world: institutional reform is not an option but imperative,"" he said.""Similarly, we must work in close coordination in the fight against terrorism. On an issue of such gravity, there can be no room for double standards. For the sake of global peace and prosperity, united and decisive action is essential,"" he added, calling for institutionalising the NSA-level meeting of the countries to strengthen security cooperation.Describing the meeting as timely, PM Modi noted it coincided with the first G20 summit on African soil and marked the culmination of four consecutive G20 presidencies by Global South countries, of which the last three were by IBSA members. This, he said, had resulted in several important initiatives focused on human-centric development, multilateral reform and sustainable growth. Modi emphasised IBSA is not just a group of three countries but an important platform connecting three continents, three major democratic nations and three major economies.""Highlighting technology's crucial role in ensuring human-centric development, the PM proposed establishing an 'IBSA Digital Innovation Alliance' to facilitate sharing of Digital Public Infrastructure like UPI, health platforms like CoWIN, cybersecurity frameworks and women-led tech initiatives among the countries,"" said an Indian readout, adding the PM also emphasised IBSA's potential to contribute to development of safe, trustworthy and human-centric AI norms. He invited IBSA leaders to the AI summit next year.""Appreciating IBSA Fund's work in supporting projects across 40 countries in sectors like education, health, women empowerment and solar energy, the PM proposed IBSA Fund for Climate Resilient Agriculture to further advance South-South Cooperation,"" said the Indian government.",Pm modi joined the trilateral mechanism meet hosted by south african president cyril ramaphosa and attended also by brazil president luiz inacio lula da silva.

Tragedy struck with brutal finality at the Dubai airshow when an Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet crashed during a negative-G manoeuvre, killing Wing Commander Namansh Syal and plunging the biennial spectacle into grief.Hours later, a heartfelt Instagram post from US F-16 demonstration pilot Taylor ""FEMA"" Hiester cut through the noise, emerging as a stark reminder of the bond that unites aviators across flags and frontiers.Hiester, a captain with US Air Force's Thunderbirds-inspired demo team, was prepping for his own routine when the Tejas went down and erupted in flames. His reflective post - shared with 150,000 followers - captured shock, sorrow and solidarity. He revealed that his team chose to withdraw from their final performance, a rare step in a world driven by tight schedules and multimillion-dollar deals.""Though the show made the shocking decision to continue with the flying schedule, our team along with a few others made the decision to cancel our final performance out of respect to the pilot, his colleagues and family,"" Hiester, 34, wrote.He described walking past the Tejas crew, motionless beside an ""empty parking spot"", ladder still on the ramp, the pilot's belongings untouched in his rental car.""I suppose each of us contemplated their new reality that came in an instant,"" he added - an image that distilled the dread every fighter pilot carries into the cockpit.As the airshow pressed ahead with upbeat announcements, Hiester felt uneasy. Crowds cheered, sponsors were thanked, and a closing line - ""Congratulations to all of our sponsors... we'll see you in 2027"" - clashed sharply with the grief still hanging over the tarmac. ""It was uncomfortable for me for a lot of reasons, some of them selfish,"" he wrote, imagining his own team breaking down their gear amid blaring music and carnival energy.That dissonance became a ""gift"": a reminder that beyond rockstar treatment and sponsor demands, what endures are the teammates who become family, he wrote. ""The people you invest in, the people that you love and the people that love you back... will be the only way you live past your own individual end,"" Hiester concluded.The Texas-born F-16 Viper pilot with over 1,500 flight hours has become an emblem of the global aviator brotherhood - one in which an American ace grieves an Indian pilot with the intimacy of shared skies.Tributes filled forums and pilot circles. ""Humanity and camaraderie is still alive.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that Sindh, which went to Pakistan during Partition, could ""return to India again someday,"" stressing the region's deep civilisational ties with the country.Speaking at an event, he said, “Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again.”The minister referred to the Sindh province along the Indus River, noting that many Sindhi families migrated to India after 1947. Citing former deputy PM and BJP stalwart LK Advani, he said Sindhi Hindus of that generation had never fully reconciled with the separation.“Lal Krishna Advani wrote in one of his books that Sindhi Hindus, especially those of his generation, still haven't accepted the separation of Sindh from India,” Singh said.He cited Advani to underline that the Indus River’s importance goes far beyond geography. “Not just in Sindh, but throughout India, Hindus consider the Indus River sacred. Many Muslims in Sindh also believed that the water of the Indus was no less sacred than the Aab-e-Zamzam of Mecca.This is Advani ji's quote.”Reiterating the emotional link, Singh said, “Our people of Sindh, who hold the Indus River sacred, will always be our own. No matter where they are, they will always be ours.”Also read: French navy slams Pakistan media over misinformation on Operation Sindoor; calls Rafale claims fabricated Singh also recalled his efforts to provide proper citizenship via law to various immigrant Sindhi families after his visit to the community in Delhi back in 2019, describing their living conditions as ""distressing."" He went on to add that because of NDA being in minority in Rajya Sabha back then, the bill collapsed in the upper house, but Amit Shah taking over the home affairs continued the work in the direction, a possible reference to Citizenship Amendment Act.""People from the Sindhi community and various other non-Muslim groups had fled to Delhi, where they were living in slums in extremely distressing conditions. I personally went to see them. After returning, I decided that we would enact whatever laws were necessary to grant them proper citizenship. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi and apprised him that I was moving forward in this direction. The bill was prepared, I introduced it in the Lok Sabha, and it was passed there. But it was the final phase of 2019, only a few months were left, and we did not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. I spoke to several opposition leaders, but they refused to support it. I said that if it didn’t pass that year, it would certainly be passed the next year. Later, when Amit Shah became the Home Minister, I spoke to him, and he took the work forward,"" he added.Earlier in September while interacting with the Indian community in Morocco, Singh had expressed confidence that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) would integrate with India “without aggressive steps”.“PoK will be ours on its own. Demands have started being made in PoK, you must have heard sloganeering,” he had said then.","Defence minister rajnath singh said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that sindh, which went to pakistan during partition, could ""return to india again someday"" citing former deputy pm and bjp stalwart lk advani, he said sindhi hindus of that generation had never fully reconciled with the separation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125521493,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-609930,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'Objective Is To Destroy The Enemy': Op Sindoor Echoes As Indian Army Vows Stronger Response to Pak

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DLEHI: The French Navy on Sunday criticised Pakistani media for publishing what it described as “misinformation and disinformation” about India’s Operation Sindoor , after one outlet claimed a French officer had confirmed Pakistani air superiority and the shooting down of Indian Rafale jets during a border confrontation earlier this year in May.In a statement issued on its official X handle, the ‘Marine Nationale’ said the article had fabricated comments and even misidentified the officer involved.“FAKENEWS: These statements were attributed to Captain Launay who never gave his consent for any form of publication. The article contains extensive misinformation and disinformation,” the post said. Pakistan based broadcaster Geo TV’s November 21 report had quoted a “Jacques Launay” as allegedly praising the Pakistan air force during a supposed May 6–7 aerial engagement involving over 140 fighters, and claiming Indian Rafales were downed with Chinese support. The French Navy said the officer’s real name is Captain Yvan Launay - and none of the comments attributed to him were genuine.Clarifying his actual role, the Navy said: “First name is Yvan, not Jacquis. Contrary to what has been established in the article, his responsibilities are limited to commanding the organic naval air station where the French Rafale Marine aircraft are stationed.”According to the statement, Captain Launay’s presentation at the Indo-Pacific conference was strictly technical.“Captain Yvan Launay presented the assets of his naval air base, the missions of the Rafale fighter jet, and the French carrier strike group concept,” it said.Responding to questions at the event, Launay “neither confirmed nor denied that Indian aircrafts had been shot down” during Operation Sindoor and “refused to comment on possible jamming of the Indian Rafale by Chinese systems.” The Navy added that “he never mentioned the Chinese J10.”These clarifications directly contradicted another claim published by the Pakistani outlet, which had said Launay linked alleged Rafale performance issues to operational shortcomings and compared the jet with the Chinese J-10C. The Navy reiterated that such references were never made.The BJP spokesperson and its IT cell chief Amit Malviya reacting to the post by French navy called out the Geo TV's report as ""same old, fabricated claims."" He also took a dig at the journalist behind it Hamid Mir.In a post on X he said, ""The French Navy has called out Pakistan’s Geo TV and its correspondent Hamid Mir for spreading “misinformation and disinformation.” In his report, Hamid Mir peddled the same old, fabricated claims about Rafales and the so-called May conflict and has now been publicly exposed. When official institutions start debunking their propaganda, you know how desperate Pakistan’s misinformation machinery has become. Incidentally Hamid Mir has several friends in Indian media. Spot them.""France’s rebuttal comes days after a US report by US-China Economic and Review Commission exposed how in aftermath of Operation Sindoor, China initiated a “disinformation campaign” to “hinder the sales of French Rafale aircraft in favour of its own J-35s, using fake social media accounts to propagate AI images of supposed debris from the planes that China’s weapon destroyed.”The Operation Sindoor was launched in response to the dastardly Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu & Kashmir on April 22 earlier this year, in which 26 civilians were killed - the incident later prompted Indian response targeting Pakistan-sponsored terrorist sites.","French navy slams pakistan's misinformation campaign.

What's The Constitution (131st Amendment) Bill, 2025

What's the political row?

NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs, issuing a clarification over the Constitution (131st Amendment) Bill, said on Sunday that the central government has ""no intention"" of introducing the Bill in the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament.The ministry said the intent behind the legislation is to ""simplify the Central Government’s law-making process"" for the Union Territory of Chandigarh and that the Bill is ""still under consideration with the Central Government"".The Bill reportedly aims to bring the Union Territory of Chandigarh under the ambit of Article 240 of the Constitution, a provision that empowers the president to issue regulations and legislate directly for certain Union territories.""The proposal only to simplify the Central Government’s law-making process for the Union Territory of Chandigarh is still under consideration with the Central Government. No final decision has been taken on this proposal. The proposal in no way seeks to alter Chandigarh’s governance or administrative structure, nor does it aim to change the traditional arrangements between Chandigarh and the States of Punjab or Haryana,"" the ministry said.""A suitable decision will be taken only after adequate consultations with all stakeholders, keeping in mind the interests of Chandigarh. There is no need for any concern on this matter. The Central Government has no intention of introducing any Bill to this effect in the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament,"" the MHA said.According to bulletins issued by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the government will introduce The Constitution (131st Amendment) Bill, 2025 in the Winter Session of Parliament beginning December 1.The Bill proposes to place Chandigarh in the same constitutional category as Union territories without legislatures, including the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, and Puducherry when its assembly is suspended or dissolved.If enacted, the move could pave the way for Chandigarh to once again have an independent administrator, similar to the arrangement that existed when the UT had its own chief secretary.​The government has also listed a provisional set of 10 Bills for the coming session, the bulletin noted.Article 240 currently empowers the president to make regulations for specified UTs “for the peace, progress and good governance” of these territories. However, once a legislative body is set up under Article 239A, as in Puducherry, the president’s power to issue such regulations ceases from the date of the legislature’s first sitting. Regulations issued under Article 240 may amend or repeal parliamentary laws applicable to the UT and carry the same authority as an Act of Parliament.AAP MP Vikramjit Singh urged an intervention on the issue, calling the amendment ""politically sensitive"" and asking all MPs from Punjab to meet Union home minister Amit Shah.Citing media reports, he posted on X that the proposal seeks to bring Chandigarh under Article 240 ""like several other UTs"". He also warned that ""Chandigarh is currently administered by the Punjab governor, and with the new law, it is likely to be administered by an independent administrator.""""Punjab claims on Chandigarh have historical significance. Chandigarh was made capital of Punjab after partition as Lahore went to Pakistan,” he said, recalling that after the 1966 reorganisation of Punjab, the city became the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana. He noted that under multiple accords, the Centre “promised to make Chandigarh the capital of Punjab.” Singh added, “I request all MPs from Punjab to immediately call upon the home minister. ”Chandigarh’s administration has shifted over the decades. Initially run by an independent chief secretary after its creation in 1966, the UT came under the administration of the Punjab governor from June 1, 1984, with the chief secretary’s role recast as Adviser to the Administrator.In 2016, the Centre attempted to restore the old model by appointing former IAS officer K J Alphons as administrator, but withdrew the move following protests from then Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and opposition parties including the Congress and AAP.Punjab continues to assert its claim over Chandigarh, with chief minister Bhagwant Mann reiterating the demand for its immediate transfer during the recent Northern Zonal Council meeting in Faridabad.","The bill reportedly aims to bring the union territory of chandigarh under the ambit of article 240 of the constitution. The intent behind the legislation is to ""simplify the central government’s law-making process"" the bill is ""still under consideration with the central government,"" the ministry said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125518333,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-192338,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

DEHRADUN: In a significant show of combat readiness, Indian Army 's Western Command carried out a month-long integrated ground and air drill involving over 20,000 personnel, simulating offensive operations across the Pakistan border in Punjab.The exercise, which was first of its kind held in Uttarakhand by the Army, concluded near Haridwar on Saturday and was held in terrain mimicking the riverside plains of Punjab.The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command. Though the location operationally falls under Central Command, army officials said it was chosen due to geographical similarities with the Punjab sector. The exercise included fighter jets, reconnaissance aircraft, Apache attack helicopters, amphibious armoured vehicles, tanks, drone-based surveillance, and night-time paratrooper deployment.General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command, Lieutenant General Manoj Kumar Katiyar, who inspected and validated the final phase of the drill, said it focused on rehearsing responses to major provocations by Pakistan.""In the recent Operation Sindoor, we delivered a robust response, which resulted in extensive damage to Pakistani forces. But we doubt whether it has learnt any lesson. If there is another mischief by it, we are prepared to respond with far greater force, including entering Pakistan from Punjab,"" he said. He added that the location was selected as it allowed simulation of riverine obstacles similar to those found in Punjab. ""We conduct exercises in operational areas under other commands too to ensure readiness,"" he said.A senior Army officer involved in the exercise told TOI, requesting anonymity, that the drill tested operational agility, multi-domain capabilities and real-time coordination across land, air and cyber domains.Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retired), former deputy director general of military operations during the Kargil war, told TOI the drill was vital to test preparedness for the Punjab sector.""Pakistan has constructed numerous canals in Punjab to act as barriers against our armoured and mechanised units. Exercises simulating such conditions enhance operational efficiency because ultimate victory comes under the boots of infantry on enemy land,"" said Lt Gen Bhandari (retired)who conducted similar drills during his time in Western Command.","The month-long ‘ram prahar’ exercise, involving 20,000 soldiers, simulated offensive operations across the pakistan border in punjab.

NEW DELHI: The fatal crash of an Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet at the Dubai Air Show 2025 has prompted defence experts to raise the possibility of a “G-force blackout”, after visuals showed the aircraft abruptly losing height during a low-altitude manoeuvre before plunging to the ground. Wing Commander Naman Syal, who was piloting the aircraft, died in the incident.Defence expert Captain Anil Gaur (Retd.) said the nature of the crash suggested the pilot may have lost control during the manoeuvre or experienced a blackout linked to high gravitational forces. Speaking to ANI, he said, “It is sad that our Tejas jet was crashed during the Dubai air show and our brave pilot lost his life. From the visuals, it seems that the jet lost control during the acrobatics, or there might have been a pilot blackout. Blackout here means the excessive gravitational force.” He added that pilots wear G-suits to prevent blood from pooling in their legs, and only data retrieved from the cockpit would confirm what happened.The Indian Air Force said the aircraft went down during an aerial display on Friday, adding, “An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at the Dubai Air Show today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident.IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief.”A court of inquiry has been ordered.The Dubai Media Office said emergency teams “responded rapidly to the incident and are currently managing the situation on-site”.Also Read: IAF pilot dies as Tejas fighter crashes at Dubai air show Back in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district, the death of Wing Commander Syal has left his home village of Patiyalkar grief-stricken.

"In a 1st, SC goes all-swadeshi in Presidential reference opinion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-1st-sc-goes-all-swadeshi-in-presidential-reference-opinion/articleshow/125525638.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the first time, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court in a matter relating to interpretation of constitutional provisions abjured citing rulings of Supreme Courts of foreign countries to buttress their logic and referred only to the SC's past judgments while penning its opinion on the Presidential Reference.CJI B R Gavai, who led the five-judge bench also comprising Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar, said the bench wanted to speak in one voice and support its opinion with 'swadeshi' interpretation of constitutional provisions relating to the power and functions of the President and governors with regard to bills passed by assemblies.Another five-judge bench on Wednesday pronounced a judgment on promotions in judicial services without any of the judges taking credit for authorship. This trend of speaking in one voice, without any single judge taking credit for authoring the judgment, started with Ayodhya verdict. A five-judge bench led by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi didn't have the author's name.For the last six months, Justice Narasimha, since he started presiding over benches, has also rendered judgments without taking authorship credit and passing the verdicts as that of the bench. However, his bench colleague has been persuaded to take credit for judgments authored by him.It is likely that Justice Narasimha could have suggested an unanimous yet anonymous opinion by the five-judge bench on the reference.In the presidential reference opinion, the five-judge bench explained why it did not want to be influenced by foreign judgments. The SC said, ""Copious written submissions and extensive arguments have been employed by counsel to underscore the functioning of the Westminster parliamentary model and its workings in the UK. They sought to draw parallels on the discretionary powers of the Crown and the limitations thereon. ""It added, ""This court believes that our constitutional truth does not lay in either of these extremes but is grounded in the way we have successfully, and if we may add, proudly, worked our Constitution over three quarters of a century. While our constitutional text may have been inspired by comparative outlook, its interpretation and working, we believe, is truly swadeshi.""It explained how the working of India's constitutional federal democracy was different from that of the UK and the US. ""Unlike the English experience of an unwritten constitution, we have a written text. English constitutional law did not have to grapple with vital questions of federalism and an inherently diverse country,"" it said.""The American experience is different due to the strict separation of powers between executive and legislature, necessitating the presidential veto. Indian constitutionalism has evolved to a parliamentary model where legislative agenda, business and enactment is overwhelmingly executed at the behest of the executive,"" it said.","For the first time, a five-judge bench of the supreme court abjured citing rulings of supreme courts of foreign countries.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi sought a global compact to ensure AI is used for good and to prevent its misuse, saying this should be based on basic principles including effective human oversight, safety-by-design, transparency, and strict restrictions on the use of AI in deepfakes, crime and terror activities.To build a fair and just future for all, PM Modi said, India stood for development that is sustainable, trade that is trusted, finance that is fair, and progress in which everyone prospers. Citing the Covid-era global supply chain vulnerabilities, the PM underscored that nations cannot be viewed merely as markets, and must adopt a sensitive and long-term approach.""AI systems that impact human life, security, or public trust must be responsible and auditable.

""Around the world, competition over critical technologies is intensifying. This is a matter of concern for humanity, and it also poses an obstacle to innovation.

NEW DELHI: Defending the collegium, the outgoing Chief Justice of India BR Gavai, emphasised the need to exclude the creamy layer from the Scheduled Caste quota, and expressed regret over not appointing any women judges during his tenure.According to PTI, Gavai said he leaves the institution with a deep sense of satisfaction and contentment. Reiterating his decision not to accept any post-retirement assignments, he said, ""I made it clear when I took office that I would not take up any position after retirement. For the next 9-10 days, it’s a cooling-off period.

NEW DELHI: India has welcomed the key outcomes of the 30th session of the UN climate conference (COP30), saying it recognised the need for adaptation in developing countries and would not shift the burden of climate change mitigation (emission reduction) onto the shoulders of those who have the least responsibility in causing the problem. The annual conference concluded in the Brazilian city of Belem late Saturday.""A substantive decision on adaptation is a manifestation of the principle of equity and a recognition of the overwhelming need for adaptation in developing countries,"" said Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav in his post on X on Sunday, while appreciating the Brazilian Presidency’s efforts in foregrounding the issue of climate finance.The decision to triple the adaptation finance means increasing it to around $120 billion annually by 2035 from the current $40 billion annually. Though it would be part of the overall climate finance of $300 billion annually by 2035, the move at least gave a much-needed push to the cause of adaptation in developing countries.Besides deciding to triple the funds needed by developing countries to adapt themselves to face the impacts of climate change, the COP30 also decided to develop a 'just transition mechanism' to support countries in protecting workers and communities as they shift to clean energy; and launch a 'global implementation accelerator' - a two-year process to close the gap between current national climate plans and what is required to keep the global warming within 1.5 degree Celsius.The outcomes are, in fact, aligned with what India had been telling the forum not to expect the developing countries to fill in for the failure of the rich historical emitters, and also not to allow developed nations to carry on with unilateral trade measures such as the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in the garb of climate action.India has long been opposed to the CBAM, which is to be implemented from next year. The mechanism will impose a border tax on carbon-intensive goods such as iron and steel, aluminium and cement entering the 27 European Union nations, placing a tariff burden on products from developing countries, including India and China.The COP30 agreement has, at least, acknowledged the concerns, noting that the response measures on climate change must not constitute ""disguised restrictions on international trade"".Thanking the COP30 Presidency for delivering the space to discuss unilateral trade-restrictive climate measures, India in a statement, said that these measures are increasingly affecting all developing countries and are violative of the principles of equity and CBDR-RC, enshrined in the Convention and its Paris Agreement.The statement, delivered by the country's representative at the closing plenary of the COP30 on Saturday, stressed that these issues cannot continue to be brushed under the carpet. ""The Parties (countries) have made a beginning here to reverse this trend,"" it said.Expressing satisfaction over the decision to establish the 'just transition mechanism', India called it a ""significant milestone"" and hoped that it would help operationalise equity and climate justice at both global and national levels.",India welcomes key outcomes of the 30th session of the un climate conference.

NEW DELHI: A group of 272 eminent citizens, including 16 judges, 123 retired bureaucrats, 14 former ambassadors and 133 retired armed forces officers, issued an open letter accusing leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and the Congress of trying to erode public faith in the Election Commission and other constitutional institutions.The letter, titled ""Assault on National Constitutional Authorities,"" alleged that opposition leaders were attempting to manufacture a sense of institutional breakdown through what it described as “venomous rhetoric” and “provocative but unsubstantiated accusations.”The letter said: “Some political leaders, instead of offering genuine policy alternative, resort to provocative but unsubstantiated accusations in their theatrical political strategy. After their attempts to tarnish the Indian Armed Forces by questioning their valour and accomplishments, and the Judiciary by questioning its fairness, Parliament, and its constitutional functionaries, now it is the turn of Election Commission of India to face systematic and conspiratorial attacks on its integrity and reputation.”The signatories singled out Rahul Gandhi for repeatedly alleging vote theft while, they said, failing to file a formal complaint or sworn affidavit to back his claims. They pointed to his assertions that he had “100 per cent proof” and an “atom bomb” against the Commission, alongside accusations of “treason,” and argued that such remarks came “without the prescribed sworn affidavit” required for accountability.The letter also noted that similar accusations had been amplified by Congress leaders, opposition parties and allied NGOs, including claims that the Election Commission had acted like the “B-team of the BJP.” It argued these assertions collapsed under scrutiny, pointing to the ECI’s public release of its methodology and verification done under court oversight.It said, “Moreover, several senior figures of Congress and other political parties, leftist NGOs, ideologically opinionated scholars, and a few attention seekers in other walks of life, have joined in with similarly blistering rhetoric against SIR, even declaring that the Commission has descended into complete shamelessness by acting like the ‘B-team of the BJP.’ Such fiery rhetoric may be emotionally powerful but it collapses under scrutiny, because the ECI has publicly shared its SIR methodology, overseen verification by court-sanctioned means, removed ineligible names in a compliant manner, and added new eligible voters. ”The signatories described this pattern of criticism as “impotent rage,” stating that leaders who faced electoral setbacks “lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility.”The letter said, “This pattern of behaviour reflects what might be called ‘impotent rage’ deep anger born of repeated electoral failure and frustration, without a concrete plan to reconnect with the people. When political leaders lose touch with the aspirations of ordinary citizens, they lash out at institutions instead of rebuilding their credibility. Theatrics replace analysis. Public spectacle takes the place of public service. ”Invoking the legacy of former chief election commissioners TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, the letter said, “Today, thinking of ECI, the country also remembers the likes of TN Seshan and N Gopalaswami, whose unyielding leadership transformed the Election Commission into a formidable constitutional sentinel. They did not court popularity. They did not chase headlines. They enforced the rules fearlessly, impartially, relentlessly. ”Calling for transparency, legal accountability and respectful political conduct, the letter concluded by saying, “We call upon the Election Commission to continue its path of transparency and rigour. Publish complete data, defend itself through legal channels when necessary, and reject politics dressed up as victimhood. We call upon political leaders to respect the constitutional process, to compete not through baseless accusation but through policy articulation, and to accept democratic verdicts with grace. ”","272 eminent citizens accuse rahul gandhi and congress of trying to erode public faith in constitutional institutions.

Ciara’s Guide To Manifesting Convictions Into Reality | Angie Martinez IRL

Ciara and Russell Wilson have never shied away from expressing admiration for one another, but the singer’s latest reflections are offering fans one of the most intimate looks yet into their marriage. During a candid appearance on the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast, Ciara spoke at length about the dynamic she shares with the New York Giants quarterback, especially their three-year age gap, something she says has only added depth to their connection.For Ciara, Wilson is not just younger on paper; he’s the emotional anchor in their marriage, someone whose “old soul” and grounded demeanor bring stability during the pressure-filled chaos of NFL life and fame.While discussing the early years of their relationship and the evolution of their bond, Ciara shared that Russell Wilson often feels more mature than she does, despite being younger. “I do like to live young,” she said. “And then obviously my husband’s younger than me too, so I gotta keep it here. He’s an old soul, to be honest with you, he might be a little more older than me.”Ciara added, “Sometimes I feel his fullness as a man, and that feels good.”It’s a sentiment that mirrors what fans repeatedly see in their public exchanges; respect, partnership, and a deep emotional alignment.That admiration was on full display back in October when Ciara penned a heartfelt Instagram message thanking Wilson for a surprise birthday celebration. “Baby, thank you for always making me feel on top of the world and for throwing the best surprise birthday party!” she wrote. “You always make every moment for me, big or small, feel special and important! You are the best!! I love you soooooo much.”The couple continues to shrug off online chatter, including the long-running “corny” label directed at Wilson. Ciara addressed that narrative months earlier on “The Breakfast Club,” responding with grace and conviction. “Why would I even respond to that, you know what I’m saying?” she said. “[He’s] the most amazing human being you can know… What you see with him is really who he is. So, it’s beautiful, it’s different. ”As the pair publicly embraces discussions about expanding their family, one thing remains clear: Ciara sees Russell Wilson not just as her partner, but as the grounding force who brings consistency, love, and an unwavering sense of maturity into their life together.Also Read: Russell Wilson and Ciara celebrate a Hollywood milestone as their first major film breaks into the year’s top 100","Singer ciara revealed on the 'angie martinez irl' podcast that her husband, russell wilson, acts as an emotional anchor due to his 'old soul' and maturity.
