What trends in Bihar show

What did the exit polls say?

As trends in the Bihar assembly election results emerge, NDA alliance has taken decisive leads across the state with Mahagathbandhan trailing. However, one name that is notably absent from the numbers is Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj. Despite promises to reshape Bihar’s political landscape, the results so far show no significant traction for the party.According to latest trends, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) sweeping elections with Mahagathbandhan lagging behind.The early picture is dominated by the two major blocs:NDA has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the BJP and JD(U) registering strong performances.Mahagathbandhan (MGB) trails behind, with RJD performing significantly better than alliance partner Congress — but still not matching the NDA’s spread.RJD, despite MGB trailing overall, is showing up as one of the top individual parties in several seats.Jan Suraaj, however, does not appear in the early seat charts, and its vote share — where visible — is marginal, rarely impacting the margins in competitive constituencies.The Jan Suraaj Party contested its maiden elections this month with more than 200 candidates in the fray. The party, formed by poll strategist Prashant Kishore, initially announced plans to contest all 243 seats in the Bihar Assembly.The number dipped slightly after Jan Suraaj faced defections, ‘forced’ withdrawals, and other setbacks during the nomination process.Prashant Kishor, the election strategist turned politician, set an ambitious victory target for his party in the state assembly elections. He had also stated that if his party fails to achieve this, he will consider it a personal defeat.However, all exit polls predicted a dismal performance for Prashant Kishore’s Jan Suraaj Party in the Bihar assembly elections . The maximum number of seats any pollster is willing to give to the party is five. While Kishore himself did not contest the polls, his party’s vote share numbers will determine whether they have been able to make any significant dent in the votes of either the NDA or the Mahagathbandhan.","Nda has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the bjp and jd(u) registering strong performances.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi delivered his first response to the Congress Party’s poor performance in the Bihar assembly election, describing the contest as “unfair from the very outset” and insisting that the party, along with the wider INDIA alliance, will undertake a detailed review of what went wrong.In a post on X, he wrote: “I express my heartfelt gratitude to those millions of voters in Bihar who placed their trust in the Mahagathbandhan. This result in Bihar is truly astonishing. We could not secure victory in an election that was unfair from the very outset. This battle is for the protection of the Constitution and democracy. The Congress Party and the INDIA alliance will thoroughly review this outcome and make their efforts to save democracy even more effective. ”His remarks came as the NDA surged to a historic victory, securing over 200 seats, while the Mahagathbandhan registered just 33. The Congress won only six of the 61 seats it contested, prompting sharp internal and public reactions from party leaders. Rahul Gandhi repeated his accusation that the electoral process was compromised, saying the party “could not achieve victory in an election that was not fair from the very beginning.Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge also expressed deep disappointment but urged party workers not to lose heart. In his post on X, he wrote: “We respect the decision of the people of Bihar and shall continue our fight against those forces that are engaged in weakening democracy by misusing constitutional institutions. We shall study the election results in depth and shall present a detailed account after understanding the reasons for the outcomes. To those voters in Bihar who have supported the Mahagathbandhan, we are deeply grateful from the bottom of our hearts. I wish to tell every Congress worker that there is no need for you to feel disheartened. You are our pride, honour, and glory. Your hard work is our strength.”He added that the party would “continue the struggle to protect the Constitution and democracy by staying among the people,” describing it as a long fight to be waged with “complete dedication, courage, and truth.”The NDA’s emphatic win has strengthened Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Nitish Kumar, with the BJP emerging as the single largest party, followed closely by JD(U). For the Mahagathbandhan, the result marks a significant setback, particularly for the RJD, which won just 24 seats.As the political dust settles, the Congress leadership appears unified on one point: the Bihar result will be contested politically and organisationally, and the party intends to return to the electorate with renewed resolve.","Congress leader rahul gandhi delivered his first response to the congress party’s poor performance in the bihar assembly election.

CJI Gavai on 1979 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-on-79-rape-ruling-moment-of-institutional-embarrassment/articleshow/125285027.cms,"CJI BR Gavai (File photo)

CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.",Cji b r gavai calls 1979 rape verdict a'moment of institutional embarrassment' he says it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable.

NEW DELHI: In a major booster shot for military capabilities in eastern Ladakh, India on Wednesday operationalised its new Nyoma airbase close to the frontier with China, even as a large Army exercise called 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' is now under way in Arunachal Pradesh on the eastern front.The developments at the opposite ends of the 3,488-km LAC underscore the high military readiness being maintained along the China frontier. ""There is ongoing reset in bilateral diplomatic ties. Military CBMs are also being progressively strengthened but the trust deficit on the ground remains high,"" a senior officer told TOI. ""With no de-escalation along LAC, troops will continue to be forward deployed for 6th successive winter since multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020,"" he said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, to formally inaugurate the strategically located airbase. He was accompanied by Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Jeetendra Mishra.Located just about 35 km from the LAC, Nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth Rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway, a new ATC complex, hangars, crash bay and accommodation, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Mudh airfield is now fully capable of handling and sustaining operations by heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. Primarily, it will help quickly rush troops, weapons and supplies to areas such as Pangong Tso, Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026 though high altitude will be a limiting factor. China has assiduously upgraded all its airbases facing India over the last five years to offset the terrain constraints due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.China now has additional fighters, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones deployed at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports all along the LAC.In the far reaches of the Eastern Himalayas, thousands of soldiers from the 3 Spear Corps of the Indian Army, along with elements of IAF, ITBP and others, are now also engaged in the 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' exercise in the high-altitude terrain of Mechuka and other areas of Arunachal Pradesh.From airlift and force projection to mountain warfare manoeuvres and multi-domain integrated operations, the exercise aims at validating rapid mobilisation, operational logistics and precision-strike capabilities. ""The right force must reach the right place at the right time during conflicts,"" an officer said.While Nyoma will be another operational base for the IAF in Ladakh after Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and the Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground), India has also progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, civil ALGs in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal) of the LAC are also now being increasingly used for military purposes.","Indian air force opens nyoma airbase in ladakh, a strategic game-changer along the china frontier.located just about 35 km from the lac, nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125286003,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1011904,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Lions Get Aidan Hutchinson back but secondary issues deepen before Eagles clash



Lions’ Aidan Hutchinson Details Recovery From Season-Ending Injury + Regrets Not Meeting Eminem 😱

More coverage in NFL:

The Detroit Lions enter Week 11 with a mix of optimism and growing anxiety as they prepare for a nationally televised clash with the Philadelphia Eagles. While the return of star pass rusher Aidan Hutchinson boosts Detroit’s confidence, a wave of secondary injuries is threatening to unravel the team’s defensive stability at the worst possible time.This matchup carries major playoff implications, and the Lions know that limiting Jalen Hurts and Philadelphia’s explosive receiving duo is critical. Hutchinson’s availability helps, but the mounting issues in the defensive backfield are the main concern this week and could play a major role in how Sunday night unfolds.Aidan Hutchinson’s full return to practice on Thursday delivered the good news Detroit desperately needed. After sitting out Wednesday with an elbow issue, the star edge rusher was cleared to resume full work, signaling his readiness for Week 11. Hutchinson has been one of the driving forces behind Detroit’s top-tier pressure numbers, and his presence is essential to containing Hurts’ mobility and disrupting Philadelphia’s rhythm.However, the Lions’ secondary is moving in the opposite direction. Cornerback Amik Robertson was added to the injury report with a hamstring problem, creating another major concern.Robertson has frequently served as Detroit’s No. 1 corner due to injuries elsewhere, making his status crucial for a defense preparing to face AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith.Veteran corner DJ Reed, sidelined since Week 4 with a hamstring strain, practiced in a limited capacity for the second straight day, but the team has yet to decide whether to activate him for Sunday. Rookie Terrion Arnold remains in concussion protocol and hasn’t practiced all week, while safety Kerby Joseph is expected to miss his fourth straight game with a knee issue. If Robertson is unavailable and Reed isn’t cleared, Detroit may be forced to rely on Rock Ya-Sin and Nick Whiteside against one of the NFL’s toughest passing attacks.Offensively, tight end Sam LaPorta missed his second consecutive practice with a back injury, creating uncertainty around one of Jared Goff’s most reliable weapons. The Lions also saw defensive tackle Pat O’Connor downgraded to a non-participant, while Taylor Decker, Penei Sewell, Marcus Davenport, Josh Paschal, Sione Vaki, and Brock Wright were limited. Malcolm Rodriguez and Graham Glasgow practiced fully, offering at least some stability heading into Sunday. With so many moving pieces, the Lions’ depth and resilience will be tested as they aim to hold their ground in a crucial Week 11 showdown.",Detroit lions face philadelphia eagles in nationally televised game on sunday.

Percy Harvin’s Florida home fire brings fast response and raises safety concerns



Percy Harvin, the former NFL wide receiver and Florida Gators star, had a scary moment on Thursday evening when his home in Gainesville, Florida, suddenly caught fire. The flames grew fast, and people living on the same street could see the bright glow from their windows. One neighbor even took a quick video as the fire moved across the roof. Fire trucks reached the home within minutes, and the lights from the trucks filled the whole block. Early updates say everyone is okay, and no serious injuries have been reported.The house is only a short drive from the University of Florida campus, where Percy Harvin became a huge name while playing from 2006 to 2008. Because the fire spread quickly, firefighters and deputies asked people nearby to step out of their homes until things were safe again. Crews worked from different sides of the house to calm the flames. Officials still do not know what started the fire, and the investigation is still active.The Alachua County Sheriff’s Office said on Friday morning that deputies and fire rescue teams responded right away after getting the call about the fire on Thursday night.While deputies worked on evacuating nearby residences and obstructing the road, a representative stated Alachua County Fire Rescue managed the flames.Firemen used hoses from various angles to ensure the fire stopped spreading. It is unknown right now whether any family members including Percy Harvin were inside the house when the fire erupted.Because of his college career before becoming the 22nd pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, Percy Harvin, 37, is still really well liked in the Gainesville neighborhood.When they heard the news, several city supporters were anxious but were comforted after discovering no one was severely hurt.Also Read: Is Eminem Performing On NFL Thanksgiving?

What It Means For Indian Workers

What are H1-B visas and who uses them



How are American jobs at risk



Supporters say the programme keeps America competitive



MAGA does not like Trump's U-turn







A heated national row over jobs, immigration and the future of the American workforce has intensified after President Donald Trump suggested that the United States “doesn’t have certain talents” earlier this week, even as the Trump Administation tightens rules around the H1-B visa programme.The GOP leader's latest comments have reignited a long-running political fight over whether foreign workers are helping American innovation or displacing American workers.The H1-B visa allows companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialised fields for up to six years. It is intended for people of “exceptional merit and ability”, typically with at least a bachelor’s degree. The tech sector remains the biggest user of the programme, accounting for up to 70 percent of applications each year. Engineering, consulting, healthcare and university research also rely heavily on the visa.India dominates the applicant pool, making up 73 per cent of all H1-B visa holders, followed by China at 12 per cent, according to Fox News. Universities and non-profit research institutions are exempt from the usual annual cap of 65,000 visas, plus an additional 20,000 for applicants with advanced degrees, which means the total number of approvals is often far higher.Pew Research Center estimates around 400,000 approvals in the last year alone.Opposition to the programme spans both Republicans and Democrats. Critics argue that the system is being abused to import cheaper labour and push aside American workers.In September, Trump issued a presidential proclamation accusing the H1-B system of being “deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labour”. He said this practice “has undermined both our economic and national security”.Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on each new H1-B visa application, effective September 21. His administration is also introducing stricter definitions of “specialty occupation”, expanding compliance inspections, and requiring employers to file applications directly rather than through third-party contractors.Many business leaders warn that harsh restrictions could push talent and investment overseas. The US Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit to block the new $100,000 fee, arguing it violates immigration law and would make the programme “cost-prohibitive” for small and mid-size companies.Elon Musk is among the most vocal defenders of the visa system, noting that many of the engineers who helped build Tesla and SpaceX first arrived in the United States on H1-B visas. He said, “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.”Despite his own sweeping restrictions, Trump stirred a row this week by insisting that the United States still needed foreign workers because “people have to learn”. He added that “the United States doesn’t have certain talents” and warned that some highly technical defence and technology roles cannot simply be filled by “taking people off an unemployment line”.His remarks have frustrated parts of his MAGA base, who view the comment as undercutting his America First message. Others argue it reveals the core tension at the centre of the H1-B debate: the nation wants to protect American jobs, but it also fears falling behind global competitors like China, which recently launched its own talent visa known as the K visa.",'no talent in u.s.': trump burns maga base for india reset?

""Climate change is a lie""— a person who never opened a science book.

Over 99% of climate scientists globally endorse the reality and human causation of climate change, based on the most comprehensive recent literature reviews. This near-unanimity underscores the urgency for action, as affirmed by bodies like the IPCC and national academies.

I mean even if you think climate change is a hoax, don’t you still care about taking care of the environment?

People are still trying to deny that climate change is real?!

Poorly educated people are put in trump's cabinet in an attempt to make trump seem smart.

Karoline Leavitt stirred a fresh row after claiming that climate change is “based on a fallacy."" Environmental activists were not very happy with White House Press Secretary's comments.Leavitt made the remark during an appearance on Fox News while attacking California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. Leavitt accused him of damaging the state with environmental policies she mocked as the “Green New Scam”. She said, “Gavin has done so much damage to his state, with the ‘Green New Scam’ and with this utopian pursuit of climate change that is just so false, it's built on a fallacy, and he's built up energy costs [so much] that people are fleeing the state. ” Her comments run counter to the overwhelming scientific consensus on global warming.Recently, Congress released tens of thousands of Jeffrey Epstein’s emails, which implicated that US President Trump knew about Epstein and the 'underage girls' in the sex trafficker's house. Democratic lawmakers have also advanced a petition to the White House demanding that even more related records be made public.","Leavitt made the remark during an appearance on fox news while attacking california’s democratic governor, gavin newsom.

JD Vance on foreign workers amid H-1B row: 'We don't need low-wage servants',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-on-foreign-workers-amid-h-1b-row-we-dont-need-low-wage-servants/articleshow/125331155.cms,"Vice President JD Vance says America does not need low-wage foreign labors.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





Vice President JD Vance spoke out on the issue of foreign workers in the US amid the ongoing H-1B row triggered by President Donald Trump's recent statement that US needs 'certain' talents from other countries. As Vance spoke to Sean Hannity, he said the Democrat model was to import more low-wage immigrants which he said hurt the jobs, wages and prosperity.Vance said the choice is between low-wage immigrants and American citizens empowered by technology. The VP said Trump's model is the second one which will pave prosperity for America.As Vance said US should avoid relying on low-wage workers and instead focus on using technology to empower the blue-collar workers, he struck a different chord with the President. Because the president said America lacks certain types of talent and cited the example of the battery plant in Georgia that was raided.“They raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out. They had people from South Korea that made batteries all their lives. You know, making batteries are very complicated. It’s not an easy thing and very dangerous,"" Trump said adding that the South Korean company had “like five or six hundred people, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it.Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. ""You're going to need that,"" Trump said when he was asked whether H-1B visa will be a big priority for his administration.H-1B visa program is for high-skilled individuals, mostly employed in tech and education sectors. But while Trump said US needs foreign workers, Vance said US does not need low-wage foreign workers.“Their (the Democrats) idea was the way that we get more prosperity is that you import more and more low-wage servants and that actually I think reduced prosperity, because it meant that a lot of our blue-collar workers were struggling. But if you use technology and you empower the blue-collar workers rather than replace them with foreign labor, I think they are going to do way better, they are going to make higher wages and the whole country is going to be better off,"" Vance said.""In other words, do you depend on low-wage immigrants or do you depend on American citizens bolstered by technology and innovation? That’s the Trump model,"" Vance added.","Vice president jd vance says america does not need low-wage foreign labors.

The Donald Trump administration has been shaken by the new revelations that came to the fore regarding sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Democrats released email correspondence of Epstein to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The emails reveal that Epstein was in touch with many celebrities, both friends and enemies of Donald Trump and he spoke with them on a wide range of issues.The emails do not implicate the named celebrities of any wrongdoing. Some of the prominent names who exchanged mails with Epstein are:David Blaine is an illusionist whose name cropped up as he exchanged emails with Epstein. In one undated letter to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, Blaine wrote in support of a visa for ""an amazing fashion model"" he had met. In a brief October 2016 email, Epstein wrote, “dinner with woody sun?” to which Blaine responded, “Great.”Barak allegedly discussed Middle Eastern politics with Epstein. They coordinated meetings, including notes about his availability in August 2015 and discussions of intellectual material circulating among Epstein’s social circle.Between 2015 and 2017, Epstein and Noam Chomsky apparently exchanged emails discussing about politics, world affairs and linguistics.They also discussed President Donald Trump and his incoming administration in 2016.Messages between Epstein and Peter Thiel —co-founder of PayPal and billionaire Republican donor —suggested intermittent contact, with Epstein writing in one email in May 2014, “That was fun, see you in 3 weeks.”In November 2016, Epstein and Indian-American author Deepak Chopra exchanged emails. Epstein shared a link to a news article on how Katie Johnson, who accused Donald Trump of raping her when she was aged 13 at an alleged Epstein “sex party,” abruptly dropped her civil lawsuit. Chopra asked Epstein whether Katie dropped the civil case against Epstein also.Journalist and author Michael Wolff and Epstein exchanged emails on various issues, including news reports on Epstein. He told Wolff in an email that Clinton was never there on the island, infamously known as Epstein Island.Summers served as Treasury Secretary in the Bill Clinton Administration from 1999 to 2001 and as Director of the White House National Economic Council in the Barack Obama Administration from 2009 to 2010.Summers criticized Trump in his mail exchanges with Epstein. In October 2017, he wrote that Trump was the “world s luckiest guy in terms of opposition, economy etc.”Epstein and Andrew exchanged emails on Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew of raping him when she was a minor and she used to work for Epstein. Epstein forwarded “the Duke” an email in March 2011 about an upcoming Daily Mail story about Giuffre’s allegations against Andrew. “The Duke” wrote back: “What? I don’t know any of this. How are you responding?” “Just got it two minutes ago. I’ve asked g lawyers to send a letter,” Epstein said. “I’m not sure how to respond, the only person she didn’t have sex with was Elvis.”The then New York Times reporter emailed Epstein about the Giuffre case to which Epstein wrote back that her allegations against Andrew were delusional.Former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, who served in the Obama Administration, exchanged emails with Epstein, many of which revolved around personal conversations.Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Epstein exchanged emails on Trump, Andrew, and Virginia Giuffre.Epstein wrote to Siegal in 2011 over Giuffre's story. He asked her to reach out to a media house and inform them that Giuffre was a fraud.","Jeffrey epstein was in touch with several celebrities, journalists, trump's friends and enemies, new files reveal.

Candace Owens explains her list of “verifiable lies” told after Charlie Kirk’s assassination





Image via Candace/Podcast

She said the first lie was the story that Mikey McCoy had “blood all over him.” She said this story was made up and was told by Pastor Rob McCoy.

The second lie, she said, came from Alex Clark and Andrew Kolvet. She said they pushed a story that Charlie Kirk was a “committed evangelical” who only liked Catholic buildings. Owens said this was not true.

The third lie was a strange story that Charlie Kirk’s “strong bones” stopped a 30-06 bullet. She said Andrew Kolvet pushed this and that it made no sense.

The fourth lie, she said, was the claim that Charlie “never blinked” in his support for Israel. Owens said this was not true.

For the fifth lie, she said TPUSA told people that Mikey McCoy first called his dad during the crisis. Owens said this story was also false.

The sixth lie was about Terryl Farnsworth, the AV worker. She said TPUSA claimed police told him to remove cameras. Owens said her video review shows this did not happen.

The seventh lie was the claim that Farnsworth moved SD cards because “people were stealing them.” She said this made no sense because SD cards are cheap and cameras are expensive.

The eighth lie came from Alex Clark, who said there was “no bad blood” between Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk. Owens said that was “propaganda.”

The ninth lie was that TPUSA’s yearly audits proved nothing odd. Candace Owens said this was misleading because Doge worked differently from normal TPUSA work.

The tenth lie was calling Mikey McCoy a “hero.” Candace Owens said this was not fair because he did not call 911 right away.





Candace Owens spoke on her podcast on November 13, 2025. She said she found ten “verifiable lies” that she believes Turning Point USA (TPUSA) told after Charlie Kirk was killed. Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The next day, 22-year-old Tyler James Robinson was arrested for the shooting. Owens said she will keep talking about this case because she feels she is getting “very close” to the real truth, and she believes some people at TPUSA are upset with her for this.In her show, Candace Owens said TPUSA gave wrong or confusing stories about what happened that day. She said some stories made people sound more heroic, more loyal, or more important than they really were. She also said some stories changed facts about Charlie Kirk, his beliefs, his staff, and what happened at the scene.Candace Owens then shared the ten lies she says TPUSA spread.

After a year of self-exile, journalist Olivia Nuzzi is back with her bombshell book 'American Canto' due to be released next month, with threadbare details of her affair with 71-year-old RFK Jr, without naming him.

Understanding the science behind the Northern Lights





How geomagnetic storms are classified





Tips to improve your chances of seeing the Northern Lights





Find a dark viewing spot far from city lights and face north for the best view. Light pollution can wash out faint auroras, so rural or elevated areas are ideal.

Use your smartphone camera as many modern phone cameras are more sensitive to light than the human eye and can detect faint auroras before they become visible.

Let your eyes adjust to the dark for at least 20 to 30 minutes and avoid looking at bright screens. This allows your vision to adapt to low light and makes it easier to spot subtle colour shifts in the sky.

Dress warmly because temperatures can drop significantly at night, especially in northern regions. Layered clothing, gloves, and hats are essential for comfort during long viewing periods.

Be patient. The Northern Lights are unpredictable and can appear suddenly. Staying outdoors for an extended period improves your chances of witnessing the spectacle.

What to do if you miss tonight’s display

The night sky across the United States is expected to dazzle millions as the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, become visible in over twenty states from November 11 to 12, 2025. This rare spectacle is fueled by heightened solar activity, including several powerful solar eruptions that send charged particles hurtling toward Earth at incredible speeds. As these particles interact with the planet’s magnetic field, they create stunning displays of shifting light in shades of green, pink, and violet, dancing across the sky in dynamic, ever-changing patterns. The phenomenon, usually confined to polar regions, may reach as far south as states like Kansas and Virginia, offering a rare opportunity for Americans to witness one of nature’s most captivating and colourful celestial events.The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight, offering a rare opportunity for millions to witness one of nature’s most mesmerising displays. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), enhanced solar activity has created ideal conditions for auroral visibility, pushing the colourful phenomenon much farther south than usual.If weather conditions remain clear, shimmering curtains of green, pink, and violet light could illuminate the skies across multiple regions, from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast. This widespread coverage marks one of the most extensive Northern Lights forecasts in recent years, making tonight a particularly exciting occasion for stargazers and photographers alike.Here’s the list of US states:Timing is crucial for observing the aurora borealis. NOAA’s three-day geomagnetic forecast predicts that activity will peak late in the evening and continue into the early hours of 12 November. The best viewing windows are expected to be between 4 pm and 10 pm EST (2100–0300 GMT) for minor to moderate activity, and between 10 pm and 1 am EST (0300–0600 GMT) for stronger geomagnetic storm levels.During these peak hours, observers may witness luminous arcs or shimmering curtains of light dancing across the northern horizon. In some areas, the lights could stretch overhead in glowing ribbons that shift and ripple as magnetic fields interact.The combination of multiple CMEs and an exceptionally powerful solar flare makes this event stand out from recent auroral displays. The convergence of these solar bursts increases the likelihood of intense geomagnetic disturbances. Such interactions can create stacked auroras, where layers of colour overlap, giving the sky an even richer appearance. The last time auroras of this strength reached similar latitudes was during strong solar events several years ago. Additionally, solar activity tends to rise and fall in roughly 11-year cycles known as solar cycles. We are currently nearing the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which explains the recent increase in both sunspots and flares that are the main drivers of auroral events, producing spectacular skies visible to many observers across high-latitude regions.The Northern Lights occur when streams of charged particles from the Sun, known as the solar wind, reach Earth and interact with gases in the upper atmosphere. These collisions release energy in the form of light, producing the stunning patterns that dance across the sky.Oxygen atoms are responsible for the green and red colours most commonly seen, while nitrogen produces blue and purple hues. The exact colours depend on which gases are hit and at what altitude the interactions take place.This week’s event is particularly special because several coronal mass ejections (CMEs), enormous bursts of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun, are headed toward Earth. These CMEs are part of heightened solar activity linked to an X5.1-class solar flare, the most powerful flare recorded so far in 2025. When these charged particles collide with Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause strong geomagnetic storms, expanding the auroral oval and pushing the Northern Lights much farther south than usual.Geomagnetic storms are measured on a five-level scale from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme). These classifications are determined by the strength of the disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field.A G3 storm is strong enough to make auroras visible at mid-latitudes, while a G4 storm can extend the visibility range even farther south and may affect some radio communications and satellite operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, suggesting that much of the continental United States could witness the aurora. It is rare for auroras to reach such southern latitudes, making this a potentially historic event for skywatchers.While space weather determines when the aurora will occur, your viewing experience depends largely on preparation and local conditions. Experts recommend several strategies to increase your odds of seeing the lights clearly.If cloudy skies or poor visibility spoil your view tonight, there is still hope. The sequence of solar eruptions means geomagnetic activity could remain elevated for several days. Keep an eye on forecast updates through NOAA’s channels or dedicated aurora-tracking apps, as new opportunities may arise later this week.Even if you miss this particular show, solar activity is expected to stay strong for the remainder of the year, providing additional chances for aurora sightings across mid-latitudes.","The northern lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the united states tonight.

‘Deport Him…’: Team Trump Moves To Strip Mamdani Of US Citizenship After NYC Win

New York will survive, but will get worse before it gets better







Billionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai as he pledged to freeze rents because tenants' incomes have stagnated. Sternlicht who has both commercial and residential holdings in NYC said when one neighbor finds out that their neighbor is not paying, they stop paying and thus NYC will turn into Mumbai.“Over $100 million, every project in New York has to go union, and it’s super expensive. It leads to extremely expensive housing. And other developers have tried to cut deals with the unions, but they rule New York, and that’s one of the key reasons the blue states are so expensive and they’re so difficult to add supply of housing to,” Sternlicht said in an interview with CNBC Property Play, reacting to Mamdani's win.“And then the far left gets really nuts and says the tenants don’t have to pay. Well, you can’t kick them out if they don’t pay. So the neighbor finds out the neighbor isn’t paying, and they don’t pay, and the next guy doesn’t pay, and then you’re basically going to turn New York City into Mumbai,"" he said.Sternlicht said his New York team is considering leaving the city as well.“The core issues are not what he’s focusing on. We need to increase housing.That’s not going to happen easily, right? You need serious subsidies from the government if they want us to work with unions. The unions have to be more accommodative on their work laws and the wages and everything else, otherwise you can’t add economically,"" he said. Sternlicht said rent freezing is not the solution but increasing housing is.Sternlicht said he believed New York will survive but will first gets a lot worse before it gets better. “People are working really hard. Just how do we help others to do well and believe in the American dream? That’s probably a better message for a leader in the city than saying, let’s just tax everyone who’s been successful, force them to leave and then have to rely on Washington for handouts to basically keep the city going,” Sternlicht added.",Billionaire real estate investor barry sternlicht said new york will turn into mumbai under new mayor zohran mamdani's administration.
