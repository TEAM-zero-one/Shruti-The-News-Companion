Wadephul will also hold talks with commerce minister Piyush Goyal, as the two countries look to expand their trade and investment ties.The visit is taking place days after a ""brainstorming"" meeting of EU foreign and defence ministers in which the participants discussed the way forward in their support for Ukraine. One of the measures mulled was secondary sanctions against Russia's trading partners, which could complicate India's energy ties with Russia.These issues are likely to be discussed during Wadephul's meetings here, sources said. Jaishankar had told his Finland counterpart Elina Valtonen in a phone conversation last week that India should not be unfairly targeted over Ukraine conflict. He is again likely to stress that India has always backed dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict and wants it to end at the earliest.This was also the message conveyed to President Vladimir Putin by PM Narendra Modi at their meeting in China on Monday. Wadephul has expressed doubts about whether Putin is really interested in peace talks and wants more pressure applied on Russia, including through a fresh EU package of sanctions.Jaishankar and Wadephul will address the media after their talks Wednesday.","Germany's foreign minister johann david wadephul is visiting india.

Dwayne Johnson moved to tears after powerful reception at Venice Film Festival



Poll Which aspect of Dwayne Johnson's transformation for the role do you find most impressive? His physical transformation His emotional depth

Benny Safdie and Emily Blunt share an emotional moment with Dwayne Johnson



Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson experienced one of the most emotional nights of his career when his latest film, The Smashing Machine, premiered at the Venice International Film Festival. The 53-year-old actor, portraying UFC legend Mark Kerr, was overcome with tears as the audience delivered a thunderous 15-minute standing ovation, among the longest of this year’s festival.Footage from inside the theater showed Dwayne Johnson wiping his eyes while applauding back at the cheering crowd. Standing beside him were his co-star Emily Blunt , director Benny Safdie , and Kerr himself, each visibly shaken by the extended applause. Variety’s co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh, who shared the moment on X, remarked, “Dwayne Johnson weeps during the 15-minute #Venezia2025 standing ovation for ‘The Smashing Machine.’ This was the most emotion we’ve since on the Lido since Brendan Fraser launched his Oscar campaign here four years ago for ‘The Whale.’”The comparison to Fraser’s Venice triumph quickly sparked speculation about Johnson’s awards season prospects.Fraser went on to win an Academy Award for The Whale, and Johnson’s raw, vulnerable turn as Kerr is already drawing early buzz.Johnson himself acknowledged how transformative the project has been. At a press conference earlier that day, he admitted, “I looked around a few years ago and I started to think, you know, am I living my dream or am I living other people’s dreams? I've been scared to go deep and intense and raw until now, until I had this opportunity.”Safdie, making his solo directorial debut after acclaimed collaborations like Uncut Gems, also broke down during the ovation, clutching Johnson and Blunt as tears streamed down his face. Blunt, who plays Kerr’s now-ex-wife Dawn Staples, stood hand-in-hand with Johnson as the real Mark Kerr wiped his own eyes from the audience.The moment showed how personal the film is for everyone involved. Johnson underwent a dramatic physical transformation to embody Kerr, stepping away from his signature blockbuster action persona. Fans even noticed his lean frame on the red carpet.Also Read: John Cena turns heads as he carries wife Shay Shariatzadeh over puddle during sweet public moment Distributed by A24, The Smashing Machine releases in theaters on October 3. If the reaction in Venice is any indication, Johnson may have delivered the most defining performance of his career.

Sullivan on Trump’s India-Pakistan remarks



Trump & Pakistan business







NEW DELHI: Former US National Security Advisor (NSA) and attorney Jake Sullivan has accused President Donald Trump of sacrificing Washington’s ties with India to further his family’s business interests in Pakistan In an interview with MeidasTouch YouTube channel, Sullivan described the development as “a huge strategic harm” to the United States itself.He was asked about America’s trade row with India and Trump’s repeated claims about resolving the India-Pakistan conflict, which resurfaced after the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir.“I think this is one of the more under-reported stories in Trump's foreign policy, and I'm really glad that you raised it,” Sullivan said in response to the host’s question, which also mentioned the Trump family’s Bitcoin business with Pakistan and Tim Cook’s Apple factories in India.The former NSA stressed that the US has for decades worked on a bipartisan basis to strengthen ties with India, “the world's largest democracy,” and a country it should be “aligned with on technology, talent, economics, and so many other issues, and aligned with in dealing with the strategic threat from China.”Sullivan noted that Washington had made significant progress in developing these ties. “And now, in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, he has thrown the India relationship over the side.That is a huge strategic harm in its own right because a strong US-India relationship serves our interests,” he added.He warned that such moves would worry US allies worldwide. “But imagine every other country in the world, your Germany, your Japan, your Canada. You look at that and you say that could be us tomorrow. And that only reinforces your view that you got to hedge against the United States,” Sullivan said.According to him, America’s credibility was at stake. “And having all of our friends and countries around the world decide they just can't rely on the US in any way, shape or form. That is not in the interest of the American people long term. Our word should be our bond. We should be good for what we say. Our friends should be able to rely on us. And that has always been our strength. And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.”During the conversation, Sullivan was reminded of Trump’s earlier claims about being “best friends with Modi” and promising that the first deal he would sign would be with India. The host said Trump then began “taking credit for resolving the India Pakistan war which is a very big sensitive topic for India saying you did not do that stop taking he does that every day and that like you know hurts their hurts everything there and it like crushes them that's not they go that's not true. ”The host further alleged, “Donald Trump took like his family took Bitcoin from the Pakistani Bitcoin sovereign fund and they brought in the general from the Pakistan to be there and India's like what the hell are you. And then meanwhile, you still have Apple building new factories because Tim Cook came in with the gold bar and he's building the factories in India. What do you make of what's happening there?”Sullivan reiterated, “I think this is one of the more under reported stories in Trump's foreign policy and I'm really glad that you raised it on a bipartisan basis going back decades. The United States has worked to build its relationship with India, the world's largest democracy, a country that we should be aligned with on technology and talent and economics and so many other issues and aligned with in dealing with this strategic threat from China. And we had come a long way on that. And now in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, Trump has thrown the India relationship over the side. That is a huge strategic harm in its own right because a strong US India relationship serves our interests. But imagine every other country in the world, your Germany, your Japan, your Canada. You look at that and you say that could be us tomorrow. And that only reinforces your view that you got to hedge against the United States. And having all of our friends and countries around the world decide they just can't rely on the US in any way, shape or form. That is not to in the interest of the American people long term.

And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.”Before concluding, Sullivan remarked, “It's a big world, so there's a lot more to say. I'll have to come back at some point in the future and, you know, hit the next 10 topics that we didn't get to today.” The host thanked him, saying, “Jake Sullivan, former national security adviser. Thank you as always.”The controversy comes amid Trump’s increasing business engagements with Pakistan. In April, the World Liberty (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by Trump, signed agreements with the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to promote investment and blockchain innovation. Trump and his affiliates reportedly hold a 60 per cent stake in WLF, launched in 2024.A US delegation at the signing included WLF co-chairman and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff’s son, Zachary Witkoff.In June, the Pakistan army stated that Field Marshal Asim Munir and Trump had discussed trade, economic development, and cryptocurrency during a White House meeting. “President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,” the army said.A month later, Trump announced a trade agreement with Pakistan while threatening 25 per cent tariffs on Indian goods. “We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,” Trump posted on Truth Social.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the agreement, calling it “historic” and expressing hope it would expand cooperation between Islamabad and Washington.",Former nsa jake sullivan accuses president donald trump of sacrificing washington’s ties with india to further his family's business interests in pakistan.

Trump ‘Sold Out India For Pakistan Business Deals,’ Says Ex-U.S. NSA Jake Sullivan

WASHINGTON: A key architect of close US-India engagement accused President Donald Trump of wrecking ties with New Delhi because of family business interests in Pakistan amid a visible rift between the White House and administration mandarins on India and the tariff issue.Former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who has served under President Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton over the past decade and whose remit included India ties, told the podcast Meidastouch on Monday that Trump has ""thrown the India relationship over the side"" because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family.Sullivan was referring to Trump family ties to Zach Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which signed a deal with the Pakistan Crypto Council in April of 2025, to advance crypto development and digital financial transformation in Pakistan. Members of the Trump family, including his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, are reported to hold significant stake in the company.Witkoff is the son of Steve Witkoff, a former real estate lawyer whose friendship with Trump goes back to the 1980s and who is now his troubleshooter in hotspots across the world, including in the Gulf and Russia-Ukraine. The crypto deal is believed to have resulted in Trump inviting Pakistan's military ruler Asim Munir to the White House, weeks after Zach Witkoff met him in Islamabad to promote his crypto venture.Calling it ""one of the more under-reported stories in Trump's foreign policy,"" Sullivan said jettisoning ties with India is a ""huge strategic harm,"" and warned it would cause allies like Germany, Japan, and Canada to hedge their bets because the US could not be trusted and they could be next.""Our word should be our bond. We should be good for what we say. Our friends should be able to rely on us. what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts...it has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world,"" he said.Sullivan's remarks came even as Trump administration mandarins appeared to be dialing down the White House invective against India amid wide coverage in the US media of the SCO summit in China. Many pundits lamented that Trump's hardball approach was driving New Delhi to closer ties with Moscow and Beijing in what some characterized as a new ""axis of upheaval.""But US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made light of the SCO meeting, calling it ""largely performative,"" and maintaining that India's values are much closer to America's that to China's or Russia's. “The Indians have not been great actors in terms of buying Russian oil and then reselling it, financing the Russian war effort in Ukraine. But at the end of the day, two great countries will get this solved,” Bessent said.White House trade counselor Peter Navarro too appeared to dial down his diatribe against India, saying, with reference to the SCO summit in Tianjin, ""It was a shame to see Modi getting in bed with Xi Jinping and Putin... We hope he comes around to seeing that he needs to be with us and not Russia.""But many analysts reckon the damage is done and it will be tough to retrieve the relationship. ""Even if India and U.S. eventually reach a tariff deal, the trust is most likely gone,"" Ed Price, a senior non-resident fellow at New York University told CNBC, amid alarm in the US commentariat at what is seen as monumental missteps by Trump.""If the Chinese, the Russians, and Indians get together in any form of alliance that is economic and around the edges military, there's no way that the Americans can compete in the 21st Century. We might as well go home,"" Price said.","Ex-u.s. nsa jake sullivan says trump has ""thrown the india relationship over the side"" because of pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the trump family.

The epicentre was located in the Kama district of Nangarhar Province, near the Pakistan border.Powerful tremors destroyed villages and left people trapped under collapsed houses made mostly of mud bricks and wood. The difficult terrain slowed rescue efforts, with Taliban authorities air-dropping commandos to evacuate the injured from areas where helicopters cannot land.Another earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale struck eastern Afghanistan on Tuesday, near the epicentre of Sunday's powerful tremor, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.The latest quake was centred 34 kilometres (21 miles) northeast of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, the USGS added.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) has reported that around 12,000 people have been directly affected by the disaster across four provinces.","Earthquake of magnitude 6.0 quake has injured over 3,000 people, with most casualties reported in kunar province.

This marks a sharp drop from just $1 in July and highlights the growing price gap, as US crude is currently being sold to India at a $3 premium. The widening discounts come at a time when Indian refiners are seeking cost advantages in the global oil market.The price shift coincides with rising political tensions, as the Trump administration has imposed a 50% tariff on India over its rising Russian oil imports. Washington accuses New Delhi of indirectly financing Russia’s war in Ukraine through these deals, while India continues to prioritize affordable energy supplies to meet its growing demand.

NEW DELHI: Congress' Udit Raj on Monday publicly endorsed White House trade counselor Peter Navarro's controversial 'Brahmins profiteering' remarks.""I completely agree with @RealPNavarro...,"" he posted on X amid outrage sparked by the remarks of Trump's aide, adding, ""In fact, private Indian oil refiners are from upper castes, and it will take decades, perhaps centuries, for so-called lower castes to become oil refiners. """"It is true that corporate houses owned by upper castes are buying cheap oil from Russia and selling it to other countries after refining. Indians are not benefiting from this at all,"" he said, in remarks which appeared to be in tune with his party's attack on ""elites"", ""privileges"" and ""merit"": all of which were seen as shorthand for the party's current priority to raise a coalition of non-upper castes.Udit Raj's colleague from Tamil Nadu, MP Karti Chidambaram, said ""Boston Brahmins is a term used to describe the elite of society in common parlance"".Ironically, Brahmins in US have, for some time, been at the receiving end of Navarro's staunch ideological opponents in US, the liberal hawks usually aligned with the Democrats. A few years ago, Civil Rights Department of Democrat-controlled California sued Cisco Systems at the instance of a PIO employee who alleged that he was denied a leadership position by his upper caste colleagues; chiefly Sundar Iyer, an alumnus of Bombay IIT.Iyer who denied the charge and won a significant victory against Civil Rights Department, lamented about being accused of casteism. ""Civil Rights Department assigned Brahmin caste to me,"" Iyer had famously remarked while rebutting the charges against him.Equality Labs, widely seen as a group of activists who are unlikely to agree with Navarro and Trump's MAGA movement has taken upon itself to document alleged cases of caste-based discrimination in US: something which the Hindu groups have flayed as an attempt to divide Indians and, particularly, Hindus.The influence of ""liberals"" has appeared to be on the wane since Trump's success last Nov, with many Democrats and centrists blaming the success of MAGA on ""woke activism"".

NEW DELHI: New Delhi: Far away from the raging bilateral tariff tensions, India and the US on Monday kicked off one of their largest-ever Army `Yudh Abhyas' exercise in Alaska, even as planning is underway to conduct the top-notch Malabar naval exercise among the `Quad’ countries off Guam in the Western Pacific in Nov.India-US ties may have plummeted after President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on New Delhi, but defence officials say the bilateral strategic partnership assiduously built over the last two decades, with defence cooperation being its cornerstone, is in no danger of unravelling as yet.“It’s early days yet…though mutual trust has taken a big hit, there is too much at stake,” an official said. Just in terms of defence acquisitions, the delivery of 99 GE-F404 turbofan engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for $716 million in Aug 2021 to power the all-important indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters, has just about begun after a two-year delay. India is also getting set to sign another deal with GE for 113 more such engines for $1 billion.Apart from other deals, India is also slated to receive 31-armed MQ-9B`Predator’ high-altitude, long endurance drones, ordered from the US for $3.8 billion in Oct last year, in the 2029-30 timeframe.The US has bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth over $25 billion since 2007, though there might be a re-think on future arms deals if the downward trajectory in bilateral ties continues amid the ongoing geopolitical churn unleashed by Trump.India, in pursuit of its “strategic autonomy”, of course, has already accelerated its re-engagement with China despite the continuing trust deficit on the border, while steadfastly sticking to its long-standing strategic-defence ties with Russia.Far away in the subarctic climate of Fort Wainwright in Alaska, over 450 Madras Regiment soldiers will undertake a spectrum of high-altitude tactical drills with troops from the 5th Infantry Regiment “Bobcats” of the Arctic Wolves Brigade Combat Team, 11th Airborne Division of the US, till Sept 14.“Over two weeks, the troops will rehearse joint heliborne operations, employment of surveillance resources and unmanned aerial systems, rock-craft, mountain warfare, casualty evacuation, combat medical aid and the integrated use of artillery, aviation and electronic warfare systems,” an Army officer said.Parallelly, India, the US, Australia and Japan are finalising the operational details for the upcoming 29edition of the high-voltage Malabar naval exercise off Guam. The Malabar began as a bilateral endeavour between India and the US in 1992but includes all “Quad” countries now, with an eye firmly on China’s aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific and their resolve to deter any coercion in the crucial region.India and the US have been steadily cranking up the scope, strength, complexity and frequency of their bilateral exercises, while stepping-up participation in multilateral ones, as part of their “strategic partnership and convergence” over the years.","India-us ties may have plummeted after president donald trump imposed 50% tariffs on new delhi.

The SCO Tianjin Declaration strongly condemned the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack saying that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice. Without naming Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi in his address warned member-states against double standards on terrorism and questioned if the open support for terrorism by certain countries can ever be acceptable to the member-states.While the strong condemnation of Pahalgam allowed India to endorse the declaration, the SCO in the same breath, and as a compromise sought by Pakistan, condemned the terrorist attacks on Jaffar Express in March and another attack in Khuzdar in May this year.Pakistan has accused India of having a role in the Jaffar Express attack. Defence minister Rajnath Singh had earlier refused to sign on to a joint statement by SCO that didn’t mention the Pahalgam attack on civilians in J&K.“We have to say clearly, and in one voice, that no double standards on terrorism will be acceptable. We have to oppose terrorism together, in every colour and form. This is our responsibility towards humanity,” said Modi in his remarks at the summit.The PM said that SCO stood for 3 pillars - Security, Connectivity and Opportunity. In his remarks, Modi mentioned the Pahalgam attack, calling it an assault not just on the conscience of India but also an open challenge to every country and every individual who believes in humanity.“For the past 4 decades, India has been bearing the grave scars of ruthless terrorism. Countless mothers have lost their children, and innumerable children have been left orphaned. Recently, we witnessed the most heinous face of terrorism in Pahalgam,” said the PM, thanking all nations that stood by India.Modi also said that Terrorism was not only a threat to the security of individual nations, but a shared challenge to all of humanity. “No country, no society, no citizen can consider themselves completely safe from it. That is why India has consistently stressed the importance of unity in the fight against terrorism,” he said, recalling India’s initiative under the SCO counterterrorism mechanism to counter Al-Qaeda and its affiliated terrorist organizations. He backed joint measures against radicalization, extremism and separatism and thanked SCO for supporting India’s position on terror-financing.The Declaration strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, stressed that double standards in the fight against terrorism are unacceptable, and called on the international community to combat terrorism, including cross-border movement of terrorists.On connectivity, India again was the only SCO State to not back China’s BRI because its flagship project, China Pakistan Economic Corridor, passes through Pakistan occupied Kashmir. The PM said in his remarks “connectivity that bypasses sovereignty ultimately loses both trust and meaning”.Modi underlined that efforts towards connectivity must uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, saying this is also enshrined in the core principles of the SCO Charter. He also urged SCO to increase mutual cooperation for reforms of global institutions and call unanimously for UN reform.“To confine the aspirations of the Global South to outdated frameworks is to deny justice to future generations. The colourful dreams of the new generation cannot be displayed on a black-and-white screen. It is time to change the screen,” he said.The PM also underscored that India has been an active member of SCO, which many see as an important platform for India to stress its strategic autonomy, and has always contributed in a constructive and positive manner.While underlining the significance of sovereignty, Modi backed strong connectivity saying it does not merely facilitate trade but also opens the doors to trust and development. “It is with this vision that we are working on initiatives such as the Chabahar Port and the International North-South Transport Corridor. Through these, we can enhance our linkages with Afghanistan and Central Asia,” said the PM.On opportunity, Modi backed more cooperation and reform recalling that in 2023, under India’s presidency, the SCO witnessed “fresh energy and ideas” along with new areas of cooperation like start-ups and innovation, traditional medicine and digital inclusion. To strengthen people-to-people ties, he proposed creation of a Civilizational Dialogue Forum under the SCO. “Such a platform will allow us to share the richness of our ancient civilizations, art, literature, and traditions on a global stage,” said Modi.",Sco echoes india’s stance on pahalgam terror attack; pak pm watches in silence.

Sadhguru Reveals Its Mystical Power

Poll Do you agree with Sadhguru's view on India's ability to thrive despite challenges? Yes, I believe in India's resilience No, challenges are too overwhelming

Sadhguru on Saturday completed the Kailash Yatra on his motorcycle and returned to a grand reception at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, just 18 months after undergoing two emergency brain surgeries.He was welcomed at the Coimbatore Airport, with locals, villagers and volunteers lining the route to the ashram in a devotional procession.Speaking to journalists at Coimbatore Airport, Sadhguru noted, “As per medical advice, I was not supposed to ride a motorcycle, yet I went to 18,000 feet above mean sea level. This demonstrates the power of yoga.”Describing how yoga helped him in the journey, he said, “Yoga means you become one with the very source of creation, which is within every one of us. So when you are in touch with the source of creation, this is not a challenge. Effortlessly, I have done this at this stage.”Sadhguru began his yatra on a motorcycle, from Gorakhpur on August 9, travelling through Nepal and Tibet amid rain, landslides, rough terrain and altitudes of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. His route took him through Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Thulikhel in Nepal, before crossing into Tibet via Zhangmu, Nyalam and Saga.After reaching Lake Manasarovar, he trekked to Mount Kailash.Ahead of the journey, in an interaction with actor Dino Morea he had said, “I am not going to see Shiva. For me, the dimension we refer to as Shiva—when I close my eyes, that is where I am. I don’t have to go to Kailash for that. Kailash is the most spectacular library, but these days I am not going even for that.”He further added, “I'm taking a few hundred people with me. People when they wake up in the morning, do they say Shiva? No, they'll say stock market or cinema. So for those people with altitude and variety of other challenges, it lowers their concerns about stock market and we can get them to focus on something more profound.”Talking about the tariffs that the US has imposed on India, he said, “When challenges are thrown at us, it's for us to stand up sharper and stronger, which I think India will do for sure. Maintaining India's sovereignty, its freedom to do its business the way it wants to do, is something that we cannot give up as a free nation.”“Even when things are against you, you must thrive. That is the capacity we need to build. And this is a good example, this is a good lesson for us. To make sure that India thrives no matter what kind of conditions,” he furher added.","Sadhguru completed the kailash yatra on his motorcycle on saturday.

NEW DELHI: India joined other SCO member states in strongly condemning in the Tianjin Declaration the military strikes by Israel and the US on Iran, a member of the Eurasian group, in June this year. SCO had in June too condemned Israel's military strikes on Iran in a joint statement, but India had then refused to associate itself from it saying the Indian govt wasn't a part of the discussions that preceded the condemnation.The Tianjin Declaration said such aggressive actions against civilian targets, including nuclear energy infrastructure, which resulted in the death of civilians, are a gross violation of the principles and norms of international law and the UN Charter, and an infringement of Iran's sovereignty.""They undermine regional and international security and have serious implications for global peace and stability,"" it said. The Declaration also noted that the physical nuclear safety and security of nuclear facilities must be ensured on a permanent basis, including during periods of armed conflict, in order to protect the population and the environment from harm.Reiterating their ""deep concern"" over the continuing escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the member states also strongly condemned the actions that have led to numerous casualties among the civilian population and a catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.""They stress the need to ensure an immediate, complete and sustainable ceasefire, access to humanitarian aid, and intensified efforts to achieve peace, stability and security for all residents of the region,"" it said.India had in June also abstained from voting on a UN resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Its decision to distance itself from the SCO condemnation of Israel then was seen as another show of solidarity with Israel. The fact that Pakistan, a traditional foe, is also a member of SCO was also seen as a likely factor in India's decision at the time.""Member states note that the only possible way to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East is through a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian question,"" said the Declaration.",India joins sco nations in condemning israel & u.s. in tianjin declaration.

The New York Islanders have officially added one of their most intriguing prospects to the organization. On Tuesday, the club announced the signing of forward Daniil Prokhorov to a three-year entry-level contract. Selected 42nd overall in the 2025 NHL Draft, Prokhorov had been expected to stay in Russia, but his ELC opened the door for him to move overseas sooner than anticipated.Prokhorov’s signing comes as a notable shift in his development path.

With MHK Dynamo St. Petersburg of Russia’s top junior league (MHL), Prokhorov tallied 20 goals and seven assists for 27 points in 43 games last season. He added another eight goals in eight playoff contests, showcasing his knack for finishing in high-pressure moments.Prokhorov’s frame and style of play make him a unique asset for the Islanders’ pipeline.Weighing over 200 pounds, he thrives on physical play, creating space on the forecheck and establishing a strong net-front presence. Coaches in Russia praised his willingness to attack the dirty areas of the ice, while his playoff goal-scoring highlighted his ability to elevate his game when it matters most.Over two seasons in the MHL, he recorded 27 goals and 16 assists for 43 points. That steady production, combined with his imposing size, earned him strong draft stock and positioned him as a potential long-term power forward for New York. His decision to sign an NHL contract suggests both he and the Islanders are committed to accelerating his transition to North American hockey.By signing Prokhorov, the Islanders secured the rights to a prospect with the physical tools and scoring upside to become a future impact player.
