Pakistan Major who 'nabbed' Abhinandan killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-major-who-nabbed-abhinandan-killed/articleshow/122081687.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a big setback for the ISI and Pakistan army, a Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tuesday. The slain Major, Moiz Abbas, from the 6 CDO battalion (SSG), had claimed he had captured IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman in 2019.Abbas was honorarily promoted to the rank of Major for his act. While Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir attended his funeral prayers on Wednesday, President Asif Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif offered condolences and praised him for fighting against the operatives of ‘Fitna-Al-Khwarij’, a term used by Pakistan for referring to TTP fighters.On Feb 27, 2019, Varthaman, then a Wing Commander, had downed an enemy jet (F-16) during an aerial combat with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrikes a day before. His own jet was subsequently hit, prompting an ejection and landing on enemy soil. He was held captive for three days and released by Pakistan on March 1. He was later conferred with the Vir Chakra, India's thirdhighest war-time gallantry medal, and promoted to the rank of Group Captain.Abbas (37) was an SSG commando from Chakwal. He was seen in an interview to the Pakistani media describing Varthaman’s capture and rescue from angry civilians.Confirming Abbas’s death, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that Abbas led his troops from the front. “He fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of the soil, Lance Naik Jibran Ullah, during the intense fire exchange,” it said.The ISPR also claimed that 11 TTP fighters were killed and called them “Indiasponsored terrorists”, their usual ploy to avoid naming Afghanistan or Taliban.Sources said the TTP fighters targeted Pakistan army personnel in two separate ambushes in Kurram and Sararogha in south Waziristan. While eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 10 injured in Kurram, at least six soldiers were killed in south Waziristan. TTP operatives also destroyed army vehicles and seized weapons before leaving.In a statement issued on its Telegram account, TTP said videos of both attacks would be released soon. ISPR, however, said, “During the operation, our troops effectively engaged the Khwarij location and 11 Indian-sponsored Khwarij were killed and seven got injured by the security forces.”","A major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by tehreek-e-taliban pakistan (ttp) fighters in waziristan.

2 Air India Flights Cancelled, One Mumbai-Bound Plane Grounded In Kolkata Over Engine Snag





MUMBAI: At least 11 persons, including six cabin crew members, felt dizzy and nauseated on an Air India flight from London to Mumbai on Monday, said sources. Air India confirmed the incident but said only five passengers and two crew members took ill.The flight AI-130 was operated with a Boeing 777 aircraft. The aircraft that's under increased scrutiny following the Ahmedabad accident is Boeing 787 Dreamliner.The cause for the illness is under probe. Poor oxygen supply, which can lead to hypoxia, can cause nausea and dizziness on flights, as can food poisoning.""On board flight AI-130 from London Heathrow to Mumbai, five passengers and two crew reported feeling dizzy and nauseous during different phases of the flight,"" said Air India in a statement. ""The flight landed safely in Mumbai where our medical teams were ready to provide immediate medical assistance. After landing, two passengers and two cabin crew, who continued to feel unwell, were taken to the medical room for further examination and were later discharged. We are investigating the incident and have duly notified the regulator.""A source said a cabin depressurisation problem could cause lower levels of oxygen in the passenger cabin, but then oxygen masks drop from the overhead panel, which didn't happen during this flight.""So, drop in cabin pressurisation is not likely to be the cause."" Food poisoning appears to be the more likely cause, said the source.The pilots of the flight were not affected. ""Pilots get their meal after the passengers have been served. They get the same food as the passengers. Earlier, the commander and the first officer would get separate meal trays, which came from two different kitchens. Serving pilots meals from different kitchens is a proactive safety measure grounded in aviation risk management. It ensures that a single point of failure in catering does not compromise both pilots, preserving flight safety through crew redundancy,"" the source said.","At least 11 people felt dizzy and nauseated on an air india flight from london to mumbai.

The United States deployed its B-2 Spirit bombers in Sunday's strikes on three key nuclear facilities in Iran. The aircraft, sometimes also referred to as the “Stealth” bomber, has an Indian connection - a naturalized US citizen from India was involved in the development of the plane's propulsion system.The engineer, Mumbai-born Noshir Gowadia, was later sentenced to over 30 years in prison for sharing classified military information with China, with which Beijing developed a cruise missile exhaust system to make Chinese cruise missiles resistant to detection.According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Gowadia, now 81, was first arrested in October 2005 on a criminal complaint which alleged that he ""wilfully communicated"" national defense-related information to a person ""not entitled to receive it.""As per information produced during the trial, Gowadia worked with Northrop Grumman Corporation - the makers of B2 bombers - for almost 20 years, from approximately 1968 to 1986. During this time, he contributed to the development of the unique propulsion system and low observable capabilities of the B-2; he also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the United States government until 1997, when his security clearance was revoked.Evidence displayed at the trial showed that Gowadia visited China six times between June 2003 and July 2005 to provide defense services in the form of design, test support and test data analysis of technologies for the purpose of helping Beijing build a cruise missile system by developing a stealthy exhaust nozzle.At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the Chinese.Gowadia was found guilty in August 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu.

In the pilot seat of 'Dragon', the Axiom-4 space capsule that would take a four-member crew to the International Space Station on Thursday, was India's Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla ""Namaskar, mere pyaare desh vasiyon,"" Shukla radioed to Earth minutes after entering space. ""What a ride! We are orbiting Earth at a velocity of 7.5km per second (27,000 kmph)."" Later, PM Modi congratulated the mission and posted that Shukla ""is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the ISS"".Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984. Shukla's message from space - ""this isn't the beginning of my journey to ISS, but beginning of India's human space flight programme"" - reflects India's ambition to have its own space station by 2035 and crewed missions to Moon and beyond.After multiple postponements, Ax-4 mission lifted off Wednesday carrying commander Peggy Whitson (US), 65, mission pilot Shukla, 39, and mission specialists Sławosz Uznanski (Poland), 41, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), 34, on a 14-day mission to ISS.Earlier, the symbolic ""crew handover"" took place. The four astronauts waved to their families before heading to the launchpad in a Tesla. Strapped into the Dragon capsule, the crew underwent final checks as the countdown proceeded. Post lift-off, the capsule separated from the second stage nine minutes, 38 seconds later, beginning its journey to ISS. The capsule, now named 'Grace', is expected to dock with ISS at 4.30pm IST on Thursday.Dragon capsule ""Grace"" separated from Falcon 9 nine minutes after launch and is now orbiting Earth at 27,000kmph. Nose cone deployed. Navigation instruments and docking sensors exposed as the spacecraft begins its precision chase of International Space Station.Grace circles Earth once every 90 minutes. The journey isn't a straight line and docking isn't immediate. Over the next 24 to 28 hours, the capsule will execute a series of thruster burns - each timed to the second - to raise & fine-tune its orbit, aligning perfectly with the station's trajectory.A slight delay could shift the narrow rendezvous window. Onboard systems track position in real-time using GPS, radar, and sensors, continuously updating Grace's path against that of the ISS.F inal approach begins Thursday. Dragon will stop at predetermined waypoints, starting 400m out and moving in stages. At each halt, ground controllers and onboard software assess whether conditions are right to proceed.At 20 metres, laser sensors and cameras take over. Grace creeps forward at just a few centimetres a second, lining up precisely with Harmony module's docking port.Soft capture comes first - magnetic guides gently pull the capsule into place. Then hard capture follows, as mechanical latches lock and seal the connection. Hatch opening is not immediate. Engineers on Earth conduct pressure and leak checks before approving crew transfer.Aboard are four Axiom-4 astronauts and a fifth member - Joy, a soft, white baby swan toy serving as the mission's zero-gravity indicator. Joy carries personal meaning: chosen with Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's six-year-old son, Kiash - fondly called Sid - in mind.""Our first ideas all included animals,"" said mission specialist Tibor Kapu.

Viral: Tharoor’s Sharp Swipe At Pakistan In Moscow; After English, Fiery Takedown In French

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , widely recognised for his eloquence in English, drew widespread praise this week for speaking fluent French while strongly criticising Pakistan’s inclusion in an upcoming anti-terrorism conference organised by Russia.During a meeting in Moscow with Russian Liberal Democratic Party chairman Leonid Slutsky, Tharoor responded in French to Slutsky’s remarks regarding a proposed summit on combating terrorism.Slutsky had announced Russia’s plans to host a conference early next year involving the parliamentary heads of six countries: Turkey, Iran, Russia, India, Pakistan, and China. He emphasised the need for concrete action, not just discussion, on the issue of terrorism.In a striking moment, Tharoor replied in French, directly addressing the problem of Pakistan’s involvement. ""There is a country that unfortunately provides a safe haven for these terrorist groups,"" Tharoor said. ""They have their headquarters, they train terrorists in their country, fund them, arm them, and send them to other nations. It’s difficult for us to ignore the fact that they enjoy patronage in Pakistan.The video of Tharoor’s French-language exchange with Slutsky quickly went viral on social media, earning him praise for both his linguistic skill and diplomatic clarity.Following the meeting, Tharoor posted on X: “Good to renew my acquaintance with my Russian counterpart, Mr Slutsky, who had visited Parliament in New Delhi a few months ago with a Russian delegation. We exchanged views on regional peace, Operation Sindoor , and possible avenues of future parliamentary cooperation.”Tharoor has long been vocal about Pakistan's links to terrorism and reiterated India’s concerns abroad while leading the Indian delegation under the government’s Operation Sindoor global outreach initiative.",Congress mp shashi tharoor drew widespread praise this week for speaking fluent french.

The timing raised eyebrows, as the Congress has been sharply critical of the Modi government’s foreign policy, accusing it of isolating India internationally.“People always tend to see all this in the context of today’s news,” Tharoor said, after rumours began to gain ground. “It is an article in which I describe the success of this outreach mission, which, among other things, showcased the unity of all parties behind the matter of vital national interest,"" he said.“So, I said the Prime Minister himself has demonstrated dynamism and energy in engaging with other countries.

"In UP village, forgotten Indian roots of Ayatollah Khomeini",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-up-village-forgotten-indian-roots-of-ayatollah-khomeini/articleshow/122010671.cms,"KINTOOR (BARABANKI): In Kintoor, a tranquil village of 13,000 nestled along the Ghaghara, 70 kilometres from Lucknow, only five Shia families remain. Among them, the Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, the fiery cleric who ignited Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and became its first Supreme Leader.Born in Kintoor in the early 19th century, Ahmad’s journey from this unassuming village wove a legacy that reshaped West Asia’s history. He left India, escaping colonial rule in 1830, migrating to Najaf, and then finally settling in Khomeyn in 1834. Hence the family name.A portrait of Ruhollah Khomeini still hanging in his drawing room, septuagenarian Syed Nihal Kazmi says, “My great-great-great-grandfather Mufti Mohammad Quli Musavi and Syed Ahmad Musavi were cousins. Ahmad’s story began here in Kintoor, but he became Iran’s forever.” The village, once a vibrant hub of Shia scholarship in the kingdom of Oudh, is concerned with the war in West Asia.BBC journalist and author Baqer Moin, in his book Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah, writes that Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi left Kintoor around 1830, drawn to Najaf, Iraq, for pilgrimage. There, he befriended Yusef Khan Kamarchi, a landowner from Farahan, near Khomeyn, Iran.Persuaded by Yusef, Ahmad settled in Iran in 1839, purchasing a sprawling house and garden in Khomeyn that remained in the family for over a century.Ahmad went to become a Twelver Shia cleric. From his third wife, Sakineh Ahmad, who was his friend Yusef’s sister, Ahmad had three daughters and a son, Syed Mostafa, father of Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad died in 1869 and was buried in Karbala.The Musavi family’s roots trace back to Nishapur (or Neyshabur), Iran, over 2,500 kilometres from Kintoor. “In the early 18th century (1700), they migrated to India, settling in Kintoor,” Moin notes. The family, Musavi Syeds, claimed descent from the Prophet through his daughter and the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim, a lineage rooted in Nishapur.Syed Adil Kazmi, Nihal’s youngest son and an LLB graduate, says, “Our ancestors’ journey from Nishapur to Kintoor, and Ahmad’s return to Iran, tied two worlds together.”Today, Iran’s defiance under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei echoes Khomeini’s unyielding spirit. “Long before Khamenei or the 1979 revolution led by Khomeini, it was Ahmad, born in our Kintoor, whose choice to settle in Iran changed West Asia’s discourse,” Adil says.From Ahmad’s departure to Khomeini’s revolution, Kintoor’s quiet lanes hold stories of faith, migration, and a family that bridged continents, leaving an indelible mark on history.Kintoor’s legacy also includes Justice Syed Karamat Husain, a Musavi Syed who rose to the position of a judge at the Allahabad high court and founded the Karamat Husain Muslim Girls’ PG College in Lucknow, championing education for women.","The kazmis claim a distant kinship with syed ahmad musavi hindi, grandfather of ayatollah ruhollah musavi khomeini.

Strong surveillance and intelligence systems Strict laws and harsher punishments

A brilliant Bombay-born engineer helped build America's deadliest ghost in the sky. Then he betrayed it. Sold its secrets to China. Decades later, the same B-2 stealth bombers he helped perfect unleashed bunker busters on Iran's nuclear facilities on June 22.Noshir Sheriarji Gowadia, now 81, sits behind bars in Colorado's Florence, serving a 32-year sentence handed down on Jan 24, 2011. The former Northrop engineer helped design B-2 stealth bomber's propulsion system, held top-level security clearance, and taught classified aeronautics. He was convicted of espionage after passing classified information to Beijing.Born April 11, 1944, to a Parsi family, Gowadia reportedly earned the equivalent of a PhD by 15. At 19, he left for US to study aeronautical engineering and became a naturalised American on July 25, 1969. A year later, he joined Northrop, where he was instrumental in developing the B-2 Spirit's infrared-shielded propulsion system.""The entire geometry came from me,"" Gowadia said. His internal codename: ""Blueberry Milkshake"". Northrop secured the B-2 contract in 1981, the bomber's defining breakthrough being its radar-elusive profile.Gowadia's work reduced visual, infrared, and radar signatures - vital to B-2's stealth edge.He left Northrop to start his own defence consultancy in Albuquerque. He advised on CIA aircraft and nuclear weapons at Los Alamos, and in 1999, launched NS Gowadia Inc. But mounting expenses drove him to look abroad for clients - a search that ended in China. Gowadia made three trips to China, providing details on stealth propulsion. Beijing used the information to build an undetectable exhaust system for cruise missiles. His payment: $110,000. Years later, satellites picked up what looked like a B-2 clone drone at a Chinese air base.On Oct 13, 2005, FBI agents knocked on Gowadia's Hawaii home. Seeing handcuffs, Gowadia muttered: ""No."" The agent tucked them away. On Oct 26, he was arrested and charged with one count of sharing national defence secrets with a foreign nation. On Oct 22, 2005, he wrote his final confession: ""On reflection what I did was wrong to help the PRC make a cruise missile. What I did was espionage and treason because I shared military secrets with the PRC. ""Gowadia was convicted on 14 counts under Espionage Act and Arms Export Control Act. His son Ashton said the jury was barred from seeing exonerating documents and vowed to appeal. Now, the engineer's betrayal resurfaces in the shadow of bombs falling over Iran. He sits in Florence, far from Mumbai - a traitor of stealth, undone by his own signature.","Noshir sheriarji gowadia helped design b-2 stealth bomber's propulsion system.

NEW DELHI: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Defence Ministers' Meeting in China's Qingdao on Thursday, where he delivered a sharp message on terrorism , slamming Pakistan in the wake of April's Pahalgam terror attack ""Some countries use cross-border terrorism as an instrument of policy and provide shelter to terrorists. There should be no place for such double standards. SCO should not hesitate to criticise such nations,"" Singh said in a strong statement.Then directly referring to the April 22 terror attack in Kashmir's Pahalgam and Operation Sindoor launched by India in May, ""The pattern of Pahalgam terror attack matches with LeT's previous terror attacks in India. In exercising its right to defend against terrorism and pre-empt as well as deter further cross border terrorist attacks, India on 7th May 2025 successfully launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle cross border terrorist infrastructure. """"Any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivation, whenever, wherever and by whom-so-ever committed. SCO members must condemn this evil unequivocally,"" he added.""We reiterate the need to hold the perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of reprehensible acts of terrorism, including cross-border terrorism, accountable and bring them to justice,"" he further stated.Referring to the broader geopolitical challenges, Singh called for greater unity among SCO members in facing threats to peace and stability. ""I believe that the biggest challenges that we are facing in our region are related to peace, security and trust-deficit. The root cause of these problems is increasing radicalisation, extremism and terrorism. Peace and prosperity cannot co-exist with terrorism and proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction in the hands of non-state actors and terror groups. Dealing with these challenges require decisive action and we must unite in our fight against these evils for our collective safety and security,"" he said.Expressing gratitude for welcome at the SCO, Rajnath further said, ""The world we live in is undergoing a drastic transformation. Globalisation, which once brought us closer together, has been losing momentum. The weakening of multilateral systems has made it harder to address urgent challenges—from maintaining peace and security to rebuilding economies after the pandemic.""Singh arrived in Qingdao on Thursday and was received by Chinese Defence Minister Admiral Dong Jun. Before the official proceedings, he joined his SCO counterparts, including Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, for a group photograph.The two-day SCO Defence Ministers’ Meeting, taking place from June 25 to 26, provides a platform for regional defence leaders to deliberate on shared security threats, counter-terrorism measures, and military cooperation.The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a regional intergovernmental body established in 2001 to foster mutual trust, political dialogue, and security cooperation among member states.

The music soothes the nerves of the astronauts and helps them relax in order to focus on the lift-off.The ode-to-life song in the Ashutosh Gowarikar film that Shukla chose, coincidentally, centres around a Nasa scientist.The music playlist also had tracks curated by the rest of the crew: Commander Peggy Whitson (US) picked ‘Thunder’ by Imagine Dragons, Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland) went with ‘Supermonce’, a Polish track, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary) listed ‘Bvhely’, a traditional Hungarian song, as per a post by Axiom Space on X.The boy from Lucknow, which is famous for its varieties of mango, is carrying mango nectar with him to ISS. While astronauts are usually advised to travel light, Shukla is also carrying some mouth-watering Indian sweets — gajar (carrot) ka halwa, and moong dal halwa — with him to satiate his cravings for home-made food in space.After the 1999 Kargil War, Lucknow boy Shubhanshu Shukla was inspired to join the IAF. So, he applied for the National Defence Academy (NDA) exam and cleared it.He completed his military training and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from NDA in 2005. He was then selected for the flying branch and underwent training at the IAF Academy.In June 2006, he was commissioned into the fighter stream of IAF as a flying officer. Shukla logged over 2,000 flying hours across a range of aircraft, including the Su-30 MKI, MiG-21, MiG-29, Jaguar, Hawk, Dornier 228, and An-32.Selected in 2019 for Isro's Gaganyaan mission, Shukla, along with three other selected Indian astronauts, went to Russia in 2020 for basic training at Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. After completing basic training in 2021, Shukla and others returned to India and attended training at Astronaut Training Facility in Bengaluru. During that time, he completed his Master of Technology degree in aerospace engineering from IISc Bangalore.Shukla’s name as a member of the Gaganyaan team was officially announced on Feb 27, 2024, when PM Narendra Modi announced the names of the astronaut-designates for India's first human space mission at Isro's Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram.Last year, he was chosen to pilot the Axiom mission 4 to ISS, becoming the first Indian astronaut to do so.","Shubhanshu shukla is carrying mango nectar with him to iss.
