J&K terror attack: India summons Pakistan's top diplomat; hands over expulsion note,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-terror-attack-india-summons-pakistans-top-diplomat-hands-over-expulsion-note/articleshow/120567206.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday summoned Pakistan's top diplomat Saad Ahmad Warraich and handed over the formal Persona non grata note for its military diplomats following the Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 28 innocent lives, including 26 Indians and two foreign tourists, news agency ANI reported citing sources.This comes after India noted evidence of cross-border linkages in the attack and said the attack came “in the wake of the successful holding of elections in the Union Territory and its steady progress towards economic growth and development.”As part of its response, India suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, shut the Integrated Check Post at Attari with immediate effect, and halted Pakistani access to travel under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES). Any such visas issued earlier have been cancelled, and Pakistani nationals under SVES have 48 hours to leave.Additionally, the overall strength of both countries’ diplomatic missions will be capped at 30 personnel by May 1, down from 55. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy outfit of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, has claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack, in which most of the victims were civilians. Asif said Thursday’s National Security Committee meeting reflects the gravity of the moment, noting that such sessions are held “when issues related to national security are to be discussed.”India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.Earlier, Defence minister Rajnath Singh had assured the nation of a ""loud and clear"" response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.Rajnth Singh said that the government would hunt down not only the perpetrators who carried out the ghastly attack, but also those behind the scenes.In what is being described as the deadliest assault since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, at least 28 tourists were killed and many others injured on Tuesday.The attack occurred in Baisaran meadow, a scenic area approximately 7 km from the resort town of Pahalgam, popular among tourists for its natural beauty and serene environment.According to survivors, six foreign terrorists dressed in Army's fatigue uniform targeted their victims based on religion. The assailants reportedly asked individuals to identify themselves by name and recite Islamic verses before opening fire at point-blank range.The attack occurred around 1:30 pm as tourists relaxed in the picturesque meadow, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and pine forests. Despite a strong security presence in the region, including multiple checkpoints and armed patrols, the attackers managed to breach defenses and unleash chaos in what should have been a peaceful tourist haven.Security forces have carried out a major manhunt, combing the area to track down the terrorists responsible. ""The search operation is currently in progress, with all efforts focused on bringing the attackers to justice,"" the Indian army's Chinar Corps said in a statement overnight.Meanwhile, the security forces also foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control in Baramulla.According to the Indian Army, terrorists tried to infiltrate through the general area Sarjeevan at Baramulla's Uri Nala. ""On 23 Apr 2025, approximately 2-3 UI terrorists tried to infiltrate through the general area Sarjeevan at Uri Nala, Baramulla (in north Kashmir),"" Chinar Corps said in a post on X.The alert troops on the LoC challenged and intercepted the infiltrators, resulting in a firefight, the army said. ""The operation is in progress,"" it added.","India summons pakistan's top diplomat saad ahmad warraich and hands over the formal persona non grata note for its military diplomats.

Internal issues External interference

NEW DELHI: A day after a deadly terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam rocked Jammu and Kashmir , Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif distanced Islamabad from the bloodshed, describing the violence as “home-grown” and part of a wider rebellion against India.Asif’s remarks, made during an interview with Pakistan’s Live 92 news channel, came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi cut short a high-profile visit to Saudi Arabia to return home following the killing of 28 people at the Baisaran meadow near Pahalgam. While New Delhi has yet to officially point fingers, Asif launched a counter-offensive.“Pakistan has no connection with this,” he insisted. “There are revolutions in so-called Indian states, from Nagaland to Kashmir, in Chhattisgarh, Manipur, and the south. These are not acts of foreign interference but local uprisings.”The statement sharply diverges from New Delhi’s longstanding position that cross-border terrorism , particularly from groups allegedly backed by Pakistan, fuels unrest in Jammu and Kashmir. However, Asif doubled down, saying, “These are people asking for their rights. Hindutva forces are repressing minorities, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, and people are reacting.”With emotions running high after the attack that targeted unarmed tourists, Asif attempted to shift the narrative by accusing India of meddling in Pakistan’s internal affairs. “India is sponsoring unrest in Balochistan. We’ve presented evidence multiple times, not once, but repeatedly, of India’s hand behind instability in Pakistan,” he said.While Asif claimed Pakistan opposes terrorism “under any circumstances,” he suggested India’s treatment of its own citizens was leading to armed resistance. “If the army or police are committing atrocities against people denied fundamental rights, blaming Pakistan becomes a convenient excuse.”There was no immediate response from the Indian government to Asif’s provocative comments, which come at a sensitive time with security tensions already heightened.",Pakistan's defence minister khawaja asif distanced islamabad from the bloodshed.

Pahalgam terror attack: What is Indus Water Treaty and how will its suspension impact Pakistan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-terror-attack-what-is-indus-water-treaty-and-how-will-its-suspension-impact-pakistan/articleshow/120557713.cms,"What is Indus Waters Treaty?



How does the Indus Waters Treaty works?



Why was the treaty needed?



How will Indus Water Treaty suspension impact Pakistan?



The Indus River network, comprising the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, serves as Pakistan's principal water resource, supporting a population of tens of millions.

The treaty will impact Pakistan as it receives about 80% of the total water flow, which are vital for agriculture in Pakistan, especially in the provincesof Punjab and Sindh.

Pakistan relies substantially on this water supply for irrigation, farming and potable water.

The agricultural sector contributes 23% to Pakistan's national income and supports 68% of its rural inhabitants.

The Indus basin supplies 154.3 million acre-feet of water yearly, which is vital for irrigating extensive agricultural areas and ensuring food security.

Any interruption to water flow would significantly impact Pakistan's agricultural sector, a crucial component of its economy and rural livelihoods.

Reduced water availability will likely lead to lower crop yields, food shortages, and economic instability in rural areas dependent on farming.

Pakistan already faces critical water management issues such as groundwater depletion, salinization of agricultural lands, and limited water storage capacity.

issues such as groundwater depletion, salinization of agricultural lands, and limited water storage capacity. The country’s water storage capacity is low, with major dams like Mangla and Tarbela having a combined live storage of only about 14.4 MAF, which is just 10% of Pakistan’s annual water share under the treaty.

The suspension exacerbates these vulnerabilities by cutting off a guaranteed water supply, leaving Pakistan with fewer options to manage its water needs.

NEW DELHI: India suspended the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan on Wednesday in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack . This move was one of five major decisions made during a Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Indus Water Treaty (IWT), signed on September 19, 1960, between India and Pakistan, is seen as a key example of cross-border water-sharing.It was brokered by the World Bank after nine years of talks and signed by India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan’s President Ayub Khan to manage shared rivers.According to the agreement, India has control over the eastern rivers—Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej—while Pakistan gets the waters from the western rivers—Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab.The treaty benefits Pakistan as it receives about 80% of the total water flow from these rivers, which are vital for agriculture in Pakistan , especially in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh.According to the World Bank, the treaty set up a framework for fair and cooperative management of the Indus River system , which is essential for agriculture, drinking water, and industry in both India and Pakistan.It outlined clear guidelines for the equitable sharing of the river and its tributaries to ensure both nations could meet their water needs.The treaty gave India control over the eastern rivers—Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej—while Pakistan was given the western rivers—Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab.However, both countries are allowed limited use of the rivers assigned to the other for specific purposes like irrigation and power generation.When British India was divided in 1947, the Indus River system—which starts in Tibet and flows through both India and Pakistan, also touching parts of Afghanistan and China—became a source of tension.In 1948, India temporarily stopped the flow of water to Pakistan, leading Pakistan to raise the issue with the United Nations. The UN recommended involving a neutral third party, prompting the World Bank to step in and mediate.After years of negotiations, the Indus Water Treaty was finally signed in 1960 by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistani President Ayub Khan to peacefully manage and share the vital river system.Also read: 5 big CCS decisions taken by India following Pahalgam terror attack The treaty's suspension would considerably affect Pakistan, as this agreement regulates the usage and allocation of water from the Indus River system and its tributaries, which are essential for Pakistan's water requirements and agricultural sector.","The indus river network, comprising the jhelum, chenab, ravi, beas, and sutlej rivers, serves as pakistan's principal water resource.

How closing Attari border will impact trade?

NEW DELHI: In the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack , the central government on Wednesday suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan — one of five key decisions taken at the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""The CCS reviewed the overall security situation and directed all forces to maintain high vigil. It resolved that perpetrators of this attack will be brought to justice and their sponsors held to account. As with the recent extradition of Tahawwur Rana, India will be unrelenting in the pursuit of those who have committed acts of terror or conspired to make them possible,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misry.Attari, located just 28 kilometres from Amritsar, is India’s first Land Port and the only permitted land route for trade with Pakistan. Spread across 120 acres and directly connected to national highway-I, the check post has played a crucial role in cross-border trade, particularly in imports from Afghanistan.The Attari-Wagah corridor has witnessed fluctuating figures in trade and passenger movement over the years. In 2023-24, the land port recorded trade worth Rs 3,886.53 crore with 6,871 cargo movements and 71,563 passenger crossings.The Attari Land Port has long served as a critical trade conduit between India and Pakistan, handling a variety of goods. Key Indian exports through the route include soybean, chicken feed, vegetables, red chilies, plastic dana, and plastic yarn. On the other side, imports from Pakistan and beyond have largely comprised dry fruits, dry dates, gypsum, cement, glass, rock salt, and various herbs.The closure of the port is expected to significantly impact the movement of these goods, particularly affecting small traders and manufacturers who rely on this cross-border exchange. However, volumes have generally declined since 2018-19, reflecting ongoing tensions and disruptions.Earlier, Defence minister Rajnath Singh had assured the nation of a ""loud and clear"" response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.Rajanth Singh said that the government would hunt down not only the perpetrators who carried out the ghastly attack, but also those behind the scenes.",The indus waters treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect until pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.

The role of two Rawalkot-based Lashkar commanders, one of whom is Abu Musa, is also under scrutiny, sources said.On April 18, Musa organised an event in Rawalkot where he said, ""Jihad will continue, guns will rage and beheading will continue in Kashmir.

Many of the victims in Pahalgam were asked to recite the 'kalma' (Islamic phrase of declaration of faith), and those who could not were shot dead.TOI had reported last week that the Indian intelligence establishment viewed the anti-Hindu rhetoric as a calculated move - coinciding with protests against changes to the Waqf Act - to motivate Pakistan-based terrorists to regroup.The preliminary assessment of the intelligence agencies is that around sixterrorists, supported by local auxiliaries, carried out the attack. ""It seems the attackers arrived a few days prior to the attack, conducted reconnaissance, and then struck when they saw an opportunity.

NEW DELHI: The Resistance Front (TRF), proxy outfit of Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed 's Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), on Tuesday claimed responsibility for the ghastly attack on tourists in J&K's Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives.""More than 85,000 domiciles have been issued to non-locals, creating a pathway for demographic change in Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK). These non-locals arrive posing as tourists, obtain domiciles, and then being to act as if they own the land. Consequently, violence will be directed toward those attempting to settle illegally,"" the TRF said.The TRF, which was banned by the government last year, has been involved in recruiting youth through the online medium for the furtherance of terrorist activities, recruitment of terrorists, infiltration of terrorists and smuggling of weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into J&K.The group came into existence in 2019 as a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was involved in numerous terror acts, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.Sheikh Sajjad Gul is a commander of The Resistance Front and has been designated as a terrorist under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act 1967.TRF has been responsible for numerous attacks targeting civilians, security forces, and political figures in Jammu and Kashmir. Its operations are believed to be supported by Pakistani state mechanisms, including the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), aiming to sustain unrest in the region.In January 2023, the Indian government designated TRF as a terrorist organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and Sheikh Sajjad Gul was officially labelled a terrorist. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has since placed a bounty on Gul, reflecting the group's significant threat to regional stability.Union home minister Amit Shah arrived in Srinagar on Tuesday evening to assess the security situation in Kashmir following a deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam that left 26 people dead.After landing, Shah headed straight to Raj Bhavan from the airport and is set to chair a high-level meeting with top security officials. He is also expected to visit Pahalgam on Wednesday.The attack, which took place in the picturesque Baisaran Valley—often referred to as “mini Switzerland”—is the deadliest targeting civilians in Kashmir since the 2019 Pulwama strike. Terrorists opened fire on tourists gathered in the popular meadow near Pahalgam, killing 26, including two foreigners and two local residents, according to a senior official.Located around six kilometers from Pahalgam town, Baisaran is a scenic meadow surrounded by dense pine forests and mountains. Witnesses said gunmen entered the area and began shooting at tourists who were enjoying pony rides, eating at local stalls, or picnicking on the grass.","The resistance front (trf), proxy outfit of pakistani terrorist hafiz saeed's lashkar-e-taiba (let), on tuesday claimed responsibility for the ghastly attack on tourists in j&k's pahalgam.

Stronger security for tourists in Kashmir Swift action to apprehend the attackers

NEW DELHI: Security agencies on Wednesday revealed that the three terrorists suspected to have carried out the deadly Pahalgam attack used specific code names, Moosa, Yunus, and Asif, to mask their identities during the operation that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.The suspects have been identified as Asif Shaikh, Suleman Shah, and Abu Talha, all of whom are believed to be operatives of The Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy.According to officials, the trio was previously active in Poonch and had a history of orchestrating terror strikes in the region.The use of aliases by terrorists is not new, but security experts say the names appear to be part of an effort to create confusion, avoid detection, and establish interchangeable identities within militant networks.Meanwhile, the sketches of the three suspects were drawn based on inputs from survivors of the Pahalgam assault and released publicly. Black-and-white pencil sketches suggest the men are young and bearded.One grainy photograph also surfaced showing a man running with an AK-47, believed to match the survivors’ descriptions, though its authenticity is still being verified.The attack took place at 1:30 pm on Tuesday in the lush Baisaran meadows near Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: Asserting that India will be unrelenting in its pursuit of those who commit terrorist attacks against the country, the govt announced a series of measures to impose costs on Islamabad for its support to cross-border terrorism , including the suspension of World Bank-backed Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) until Pakistan ""credibly and irrevocably"" abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.The govt also shut down the Attari border with Pakistan in Amritsar, expelled the Pakistani air, navy and army advisors declaring them persona non grata and cut down the strength of the high commissions from the already downgraded 55 to 30. The posts of defence advisors were annulled by India and five support staff of the service advisors withdrawn from both high commissions. India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.After a CCS meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi, foreign secretary Vikram Misri also announced that Pakistani nationals will not be permitted to travel to India under the Saarc Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) visas. ""Any SVES visas issued in the past to Pakistani nationals are deemed cancelled. Any Pakistani national currently in India under SVES visa has 48 hours to leave India,'' he said. In the CCS meeting, Misri said, the cross-border linkages of the Pahalgam terrorist attack were brought out and was noted that this attack came in the wake of the successful holding of elections in the Union Territory and its steady progress towards economic growth and development.Speaking about India's response to the attack, which came in the middle of important Indian engagements with the US and Saudi Arabia, govt sources suggested the actions announced were only indicative and not exhaustive, as all options, including ""kinetic action"", remained on the table.In the absence of any substantive bilateral engagement with Pakistan for almost a decade, exchanges between the two countries had been limited to talks under the IWT framework for irrigation and hydropower development and cooperation at the SCO forum.India had not discontinued engagements under the IWT mainly because of the involvement of the World Bank, a co-signatory to the treaty, but it had twice issued notice to Pakistan in the recent past for a review and modification of the treaty. Last year, it cited the effect of persistent cross-border terror attacks as one of the reasons for seeking a review of the treaty.President Donald Trump in a conversation with Modi condemned the attack and offered full support for efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. The support for India from the international community so far has been overwhelming, with all countries, including China, condemning the attack Pakistan denied any link with the worst attack on civilians in India in years, choosing to describe it as ""home-grown"".Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif said the top civilian and military leadership will meet on Thursday to formulate an appropriate response to India's move to suspend the IWT and downgrade diplomatic ties. ""A session of the National Security Committee will be held under the chair of PM Shehbaz Sharif,"" he said. Misri said strong expressions of support and solidarity were received from many govts around the world, which unequivocally condemned the terror attack, and the CCS recorded its appreciation for such sentiments, which reflect zero tolerance for terrorism.""The CCS condemned the attack in the strongest terms and expressed its deepest condolences to the families of the victims and hoped for the early recovery of the injured,'' Misri said, adding that the CCS also reviewed the overall security situation and directed all forces to maintain high vigil. ""It resolved that the perpetrators of the attack will be brought to justice and their sponsors held to account. As with the recent extradition of Tahawwur Rana, India will be unrelenting in the pursuit of those who have committed acts of terror, or conspired to make them possible,"" Misri said.","India suspends world bank-backed indus waters treaty (iwt) until pakistan ""credibly and irrevocably"" abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.

NEW DELHI: In the winter of 2023, four soldiers were killed in action in J&K's Poonch and an unknown outfit named People's Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) claimed responsibility for the attack. Months later, it claimed responsibility for another attack in Gulmarg that had resulted in four deaths, including two soldiers from Rashtriya Rifles.In the summer of 2020, a fierce gunbattle broke out in Keran, leading to multiple casualties on both sides, and the terrorists claimed to be from The Resistance Front (TRF).Both outfits had not been heard of before, but their emergence failed to fool too many. It did not take long for Indian agencies to figure out they were offshoots of notorious outfits Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which had sought to camouflage their jihadi orientation by slipping into new sloughs.The tactical sleight of hand and rebranding of the outfits - LeT became TRF and JeM became PAFF - was prompted by the changed political landscape in J&K following abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.Rebadging has been an old practice with terrorist outfits but the switch this time to non-Islamist nomenclatures was prompted to curry favour with influential human rights groups in the West, which have been enamoured with claims of ""freedom struggle"", ""self-determination"" and ""resistance"" - in short ruses that terrorist groups employ to woo public opinion in foreign capitals.""With these seemingly innocuous monikers, groups like LeT and JeM cloaked their jihadist ideology and intensified terrorist activities in Kashmir, exploiting the rhetoric of resistance and rights to further their agenda and fuel violence, while also helping their chief backer Pakistan peddle their alibi about terrorism in J&K being a homegrown affair,"" said an officer from the security establishment.In this case, the additional motivation came from the blows that Indian security forces had inflicted on LeT and JeM while also squeezing their overground supporters, and as the two needed to rally their cadre.""By adopting monikers, both groups aimed at creating confusion among the people so that their support on the ground remained intact. This tactic, they assumed, would allow their new Mujahideens to maintain a low profile and help Pakistan avoid sanctions, and continue their nefarious activities without arousing suspicion,"" a senior intelligence officer said. Moreover, rebranding enabled them to reinvent their image, potentially appealing to new recruits and sympathisers who were deterred by their previous notoriety.The rebranding was also an attempt to evade global sanctions and dodge the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which had designated LeT as a terrorist organisation. International pressure also prompted Pakistan to pretend to take action against terrorist groups, and it had resorted to putting terrorist leaders under house arrest or imprisoning them.","In the winter of 2023, four soldiers were killed in action in j&k's poonch.

There are a variety of military options, short of a full-blown war, on the table. It's for the political leadership to take the final call. If there is a go-ahead, then the retaliatory strikes will be at a time and place of our choosing,"" a senior military officer told TOI after a flurry of top-level meetings on Wednesday.The hard-nosed intent for cross-border retaliation , in keeping with the Modi govt's self-avowed muscular image on national security issues, was also evident when defence minister Rajnath Singh addressed an IAF event in the afternoon. There would be swift and strong action against not only the terrorists involved in the Pahalgam massacre, but also the orchestrators behind the scenes who conspired to carry out the heinous act on Indian soil, he said.There is realisation among the military brass here that Pakistan will not be caught off-guard like it was during the Balakot air strikes in Feb 2019 or the earlier ground-based ' surgical strikes ' to take out four ' terror launch pads ' across the Line of Control (LoC) in Sept 2016. With the well-equipped Pakistan military being no pushover, the pros and cons of every option, along with the escalation matrix, will have to be factored into the decision-making.Military officers, on their part, contend that ""carefully-calibrated precision air strikes"" against non-state targets by fighters like Rafales, Mirage-2000s and Sukhoi-30MKIs - armed with long-range weapons like the French 'Scalp' air-to-ground cruise missiles, Israeli Crystal Maze missiles and Spice-2000 precision guided penetration bombs - remain ""the best and most effective option"".""One can always achieve the element of surprise on Day-1 with airborne strikes. The day after the Balakot strikes, Pakistan managed to surprise the IAF with its 'Operation Swift Retort' because we let our guard down. Lessons have been learnt,"" another senior officer said.Govt will have to be fully prepared for escalation if it decides to go for air strikes. A less-escalatory tactical option will be to break the ongoing ceasefire with Pakistan along the 778-km LoC, which has largely held since it was renewed in Feb 2021. This will involve targeted firings by artillery guns and heavy mortars as well as concerted sniping and other such operations to disrupt their patrols in forward areas. ""All this can be very effective in raising the costs for the other side,"" an officer said.Then, there are shallow raids that can be conducted to destroy the makeshift terror launch pads that are generally located close to Pak army posts to ensure terrorists can cross the LoC in a single night. As per latest estimates, there are 110-120 terrorists present in 42 launch pads along the LoC, with 32 of them being south of the Pir Panjal range and 10 in the north. ""Terror launch pads close to LoC can be good targets,"" the officer said.If it comes to escalation, then the artillery barrages can be supplemented by longer-range standoff weapons like the 90-km range Smerch and 45-km Pinaka rocket systems and the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, whose strike range has been extended to 450 km.",The hard-nosed intent for cross-border retaliation was also evident when defence minister rajnath singh addressed an iaf event in the afternoon.
