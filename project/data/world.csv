NEW DELHI: The US on Saturday again warned that travellers to the country have to follow all rules or they will be deported. ""US visa screening does not stop after a visa is issued. We continuously check visa holders to ensure they follow all US laws and immigration rules. We will revoke their visas and deport them if they don't,"" the US embassy in India said on X Saturday.The Trump administration has been getting strict with visa issuances. It only recently resumed student visa processing for this fall after pausing May-end over social media screening. ""Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under US law,"" the embassy had said on X on June 23.Three days later, this policy was expanded when the embassy said: ""Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last five years on the DS-160 visa application form. Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit. Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas.This May, students pursuing courses in American colleges were warned they may not only lose their visa but also be ineligible to get one in future if they drop out or skip classes. The US embassy in India had said on X in May-end: ""If you drop out, skip classes, or leave your programme of study without informing your school, your student visa may be revoked, and you may lose eligibility for future US visas. Always adhere to the terms of your visa and maintain your student status to avoid any issues.

'FUEL CUT OFF': Air India Boeing 787 Crash TRUTH Out; PROBE Reveals 'ACTUAL CAUSE' | Details

Poll Considering the information provided, what do you believe should be the priority for aviation safety moving forward? Enforcing all safety recommendations, even if advisory Improving aircraft technology and fault detection systems

The question is, what was the microprocessor status on the AI B787 that crashed?





MUMBAI: Three seconds after Air India flight AI-171 lifted off Ahmedabad runway on June 12, the fuel to both engines of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (VT-ANB) cut off. Within a time gap of one second, fuel to both engines was cut off. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why he cut off the fuel supply. The other pilot responded that he did not do so.""SEE ALSO: The big question in Air India Crash: If pilots didn’t cut fuel, what caused both engines to shut down mid-air? Experts say 'cockpit conversation is alarming' This is the most crucial bit of information in the 15-page preliminary report into the fatal Air India accident that killed 270 people. India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) released the report to the public in the early hours of Saturday.The big questions are: If the pilots didn’t cut off the fuel, then how did the fuel supply to both engines cut off during the most crucial phase of flight? Was it a technical problem with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner? The only other logical possibility is one of the pilots cutting off the fuel supply and saying he didn’t.The investigation report veers towards aircraft issue. It refers to a 2018 bulletin issued by the US aviation regulator on fuel switch malfunction.The AAIB report says that Air India did not carry out the relevant inspection recommended in the bulletin as it was not mandatory.The final report into the accident which will be released by June 12, 2026 will likely give the answers and reveal the probable causes of the accident.The aircraft started rolling at 08:07:37 UTC. As per the EAFR (the digital flight data recorder) data, the aircraft crossed the take-off decision speed V1 and achieved 153 kts IAS at 08:08:33 UTC. This is the speed at which a take-off should be continued and should not be aborted for any reason.This is the sequence of events put down in the AAIB report.The Vr speed (155 kts) was achieved as per the EAFR at 08:08:35 UTC. The Vr speed is the speed at which the pilots pull back the control column to lift the nose and lift off the ground.The aircraft air/ground sensors transitioned to air mode, consistent with lift-off at 08:08:39 UTC. The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC, and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cut-off switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec.The Engine N1 and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off.""The CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed Ram Air Turbine (RAT) getting deployed during the initial climb immediately after lift-off (fig. 15).No significant bird activity is observed in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall,"" the report says.While the commander of the flight had over 15,000 hours of flying experience, including about 8,600 hours on the B787, the co-pilot had 3,400 hours of flying experience. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying (PF), and the PIC was Pilot Monitoring (PM) for the flight.The investigation has noted the relevance of US aviation regulator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) No. NM-18-33, issued in December 2018. It highlighted reports from operators regarding potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature in Boeing aircraft, including the B787-8 fitted with similar part numbers.Although the SAIB did not result in an Airworthiness Directive (AD) and was advisory in nature, it recommended inspection of the fuel control switch installations to ensure proper locking function.""As per the information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory,"" the report said. Records indicate that VT-ANB underwent throttle control module replacements in 2019 and 2023, unrelated to fuel control switch faults, and no subsequent fuel control switch defects were documented after 2023, it added.""At this stage of the investigation, no definitive cause has been determined, and no immediate safety recommendations have been issued to B787-8 or GEnx-1B engine operators,"" it said, adding that the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) of India, supported by NTSB-USA, Boeing, GE, FAA, and other international stakeholders, continues a detailed investigation focused on engineering, human factors, and system interactions.TOI spoke to senior commanders and examiners, and they referred to another service bulletin issued jointly by FAA and GE (engine manufacturer) in 2021.Service Bulletin FAA-2021-0273-0013 Attachment 2 recommends the replacement of the ""MN4 microprocessor on ECU"" with respect to engine fuel and control. It states: ""This recommendation is to address a condition that may affect Flight Safety... Accumulated thermal cycles of the EEC with age causes the solder ball to fail.""What is the MN4 Microprocessor and what is the Engine ECU? ECU stands for Engine Control Unit, and it’s like the ""brain"" of the modern jet engine. It monitors crucial engine parameters such as temperature, pressure, and RPM. But most importantly in this context, it controls fuel flow, variable geometry components, starting, and other functions to ensure optimal performance, efficiency, and safety.The MN4 is an integrated microprocessor used inside the ECU. It handles critical processing tasks such as interpreting sensor data, executing engine control algorithms, sending signals to actuators such as fuel metering valves, and managing fault detection and communication with cockpit systems.Why did the FAA recommend replacement of the MN4 Microprocessor? ""Solder Ball Fatigue"" was the crucial issue. ""The microprocessor is mounted on a Ball Grid Array (BGA), which uses tiny solder balls to attach the chip to the circuit board. As the aircraft flies, the engine experiences high temperature swings, constant vibration, and thermal cycling (repeated heating/cooling during engine start/shutdown).Over time, this thermal cycling causes fatigue cracks in the solder balls, leading to intermittent electrical connections, loss of signal processing, and potential engine control faults,"" explained a senior commander. A failing microprocessor could disrupt fuel flow control, cause engine flame-out, prevent proper engine restart, and trigger dual engine shutdowns (a catastrophic scenario).Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert said: ""The time line given in the report is not tallying, especially after take-off when the RAT is shown deployed in the image, which means both engines have already failed. It does not match with the engine failure timings given in the report.""What was happening in the ten seconds after the fuel cutoff switch was off. The report doesn't give information on the conversation in the cockpit.The two sentences from the CVR mentioned in the report about a pilot enquiring who cutoff the fuel also doesn't carry a timestamp.""Capt Sam Thomas, President of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (APAI), said: ""The conversation between the pilots enquiring who cut off the fuel control switch is alarming.""Another crucial issue is, why did the Emergency Locator Transmitter not work after the accident? It should emit signals if the force of impact is between 3.2 to 3.5 G; the impact of the accident would have been exponentially higher.He also raised a question about the composition of the investigating team. ""Who is the expert in this group? It is assumed that some B787 Dreamliner pilots have been... Why the secrecy? We know pilots in India, and none of them have been consulted. IAF pilots are not competent enough to investigate and understand modern aircraft operated by civilian airlines.""The AAIB said: ""The investigation team comprising Mr. Sanjay Kumar Singh as Investigator-in-Charge, Mr. Jasbir Singh Larhga as chief investigator and Mr. Vipin Venu Varakoth, Mr. Veeraragavan K, and Mr. Vaishnav Vijayakumar as Investigators. Experienced Pilots, Engineers, Aviation Medicine Specialist, Aviation Psychologist and Flight Recorder Specialists have been taken on board as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to assist the Investigation in the area of their domain expertise,"" the report said.","Preliminary report on air india crash reveals fuel supply to both engines cut off shortly after takeoff.

India-US trade deal:

'Closer': Donald Trump's Big Hint On India-US Trade Deal Amid High Tariff Slapped On Other Nations

India, US near trade deal. What happens next if New Delhi joins Trump’s shortlist?



United States is working toward an interim trade agreement with India that could reduce proposed tariffs to below 20%. This would give India a more favourable position compared to other countries in the region.Unlike many nations, India is not expected to receive a formal tariff hike notice this week, and the agreement may be announced through an official statement, Bloomberg reported, quoting sources.The proposed interim trade deal between the two nations would allow both the sides to continue negotiations, giving India time to address unresolved issues before a broader agreement expected later this year, the source added.The planned agreement is likely to set a baseline tariff of under 20%, down from the 26% initially proposed, with provisions to allow further adjustments as part of a final pact. However, the exact timeline for the interim deal remains uncertain.If finalised, India would likely join a select group of nations that have reached trade arrangements with the Trump administration. In contrast, several other countries were hit with surprise tariff hikes of up to 50% this week, ahead of the August 1 deadline.India is pushing for a more favourable deal than the one signed with Vietnam, which included 20% tariffs. Vietnam, caught off guard by the high rate, is now seeking a revision. So far, only the UK has officially signed trade deals with the Trump administration.Earlier on Thursday, Trump told NBC News that he is considering imposing blanket tariffs of 15% to 20% on most trading partners who haven't yet received specific rates.Currently, the baseline tariff for most US trade partners stands at 10%. For Asian countries, announced rates so far include 20% for Vietnam and the Philippines, and as high as 40% for Laos and Myanmar.Despite being among the earliest to initiate trade discussions this year, India-US relations have shown recent tensions.While Trump indicates an imminent agreement, he has also suggested additional tariffs regarding India's BRICS membership.An Indian negotiation team is expected to visit Washington soon to push forward trade talks. India has already made its final offer to the Trump administration and outlined its non-negotiable positions.The key sticking points remain, including the US demand for India to allow genetically modified (GM) crops, something New Delhi has firmly opposed, citing concerns for farmers. Other unresolved issues include non-tariff barriers in agriculture and regulatory challenges in the pharmaceutical sector.","India is not expected to receive a formal tariff hike notice this week, and the agreement may be announced through an official statement.

"As UNSC president, Pakistan looks to up ante on Kashmir issue",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-unsc-president-pakistan-looks-to-up-ante-on-kashmir-issue/articleshow/122411205.cms,"File photo: Pakistani deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar (Picture credit: AP, ANI)

NEW DELHI: As the month-long Pakistan presidency of the UN Security Council (UNSC) nears its business end, Islamabad is gearing up to organize an open debate on unresolved disputes around the world, looking to follow it up with a resolution urging member-states to use mechanisms available to them for pacific settlement of disputes.While the motive behind convening this signature event under the UN’s maintenance of international peace and security agenda is to highlight the Kashmir issue, it’s unlikely Pakistan will name J&K for fear of getting the resolution vetoed. UNSC resolutions need 9 votes to pass, including the concurrence of all 5 permanent members.Pakistan deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar will travel to New York to chair the event on July 22 that will likely be briefed by Secretary General Antonio Guterres too.According to the Security Council Report, Pakistan aims to adopt the resolution urging full use of all Chapter VI mechanisms for peaceful resolution of disputes between nations. Article 33 of the Chapter states that the parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall seek a solution by, among other things, mediation and arbitration.However, the same Article also says the parties can seek a solution through “other peaceful means of their own choice”. This is important for India as it helps underscore its position that this is exactly what it is trying to do through Simla and Lahore Declarations that stress bilateralism.“The generic resolution which will most likely be conceptual in nature will focus on general principles not specific issues to avoid any objections,” says Syed Akbaruddin, former Indian ambassador to the UN. Pakistan also knows that except China, all other permanent members continue to maintain that Kashmir is a bilateral issue.While underlining the Council’s role in maintaining peace and security, many member-states stress that any such attempt can’t undermine a State’s sovereignty or invoke settlement agreements without the consent of both parties. The open debate follows closed consultations called by Pakistan on May 5 to discuss India-Pakistan tensions after the Pahalgam terrorist attack.Pakistan will also convene another signature event under its presidency, hoping to strengthen cooperation between the UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the 57-member body that has repeatedly expressed support for Islamabad’s Kashmir agenda.The meeting will take place under the UN’s ‘Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations’ agenda item. Along with Pakistan, there are 4 other non-permanent member-states that are also in the OIC – Algeria, Somalia, Sierra Leone and Guyana. It will be difficult though to gloss over differences between the Council and OIC on key issues like Israel’s actions in Gaza and the OIC condemnation of the US strikes on Iran. India has repeatedly accused the OIC of allowing its agenda to be hijacked by Pakistan, while ignoring Islamabad’s support to cross-border terrorism, and any mention of the Kashmir issue at the meeting is likely to be met with a similar response from India.",Pakistan is gearing up to organize an open debate on unresolved disputes around the world.

What triggered the dual engine flame-out?

Did the pilots attempt an engine restart?

Was fuel contamination a factor?

Was the aircraft airworthy?

Were flight crew and procedures followed?

Could the engine electronic control unit (ECU) be at fault?

Why wasn’t the landing gear retracted?

Why is there no cockpit video?

Could it have been an electrical glitch?

Was the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) operational?

Who is on the investigative panel?

When is the final report expected?

In its first official account of the June 12 crash that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has released a 15-page preliminary report into Air India Flight 171. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plunged into a medical college hostel moments after takeoff, becoming one of India’s worst aviation tragedies in decades and the first fatal crash of a Dreamliner globally.The report stops short of assigning blame but outlines a chilling sequence of events: both engine fuel control switches were inexplicably moved from ""RUN"" to ""CUTOFF"" within a second of each other, starving the aircraft’s engines of fuel. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why he had shut off the fuel. The other denied doing so.Despite relighting both engines, only one recovered fully before the plane crashed just 32 seconds after becoming airborne. The switches were later found back in the ""RUN"" position. While mechanical failure, bird strike and fuel contamination have been ruled out, the mystery of how the switches were moved persists, prompting calls for further forensic analysis and voice identification.Roughly seven seconds after lift-off, both fuel switches were cut to CUTOFF in less than one second, depriving the engines of fuel and leading to a thrust loss. The Ram Air Turbine (RAT) swung into action to supply emergency power—which was captured on CCTV footage shortly thereafter.Yes. The Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder (EAFR) shows that around 10 seconds after the cutoff, both switches were returned to RUN, and one engine began recovering. However, the altitude was insufficient for a full restoration of thrust before crashing.No. DGCA lab tests on samples from the refuelling bowsers and tanks found the fuel to be satisfactory.The CVR captured a pilot asking, “Why did you cut off?” with the response, “I did not do so,” but identities were not assigned to either speaker.Yes. All mandatory checks had been completed. However, an advisory issued by the FAA in 2018 concerning fuel switch locking mechanisms was not acted upon, as it was classified as non-mandatory. The VT-ANB underwent throttle control module replacements in 2019 and 2023, with no reported fuel switch defects since, TOI reported..Both pilots passed pre-flight breathalyser tests and were visible on CCTV pre-departure. The captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, had over 15,000 flying hours (8,600 on the 787), while First Officer Clive Kunder had 3,400 hours. Sabharwal was monitoring, Kunder was flying.TOI reports that veteran commanders referenced a 2021 joint FAA–GE Service Bulletin recommending replacement of the “MN4 microprocessor” on the engine’s ECU—citing solder-ball fatigue due to thermal cycling that might lead to electrical faults. A failure here could plausibly trigger unintended switch activation.The report notes the gear was still down. One theory is that the crew was preoccupied with engine failure procedures and had no opportunity to retract the gear. Audit transcripts make no mention of the “positive climb” or “gear up” call being made.Experts like Peter Goelz of the NTSB have lamented the lack of visual cockpit recording, which could definitively identify who moved the switches, BBC reported.Former AAIB investigator Capt Kishore Chinta, while speaking with BBC raised the question of whether the ECU or other systems could have electronically tripped the fuel switches—adding to suspicions of a microprocessor fault.Capt Amit Singh, told TOI that the ELT failed to emit a distress signal—despite impacts of 3.2 to 3.5 g ordinarily triggering it. He also questioned discrepancies in the RAT deployment timeline and the lack of cockpit conversation timestamps.TOI had also reported that Capt Sam Thomas of the Airline Pilots’ Association of India raised doubts about the expertise composition of the AAIB team. The AAIB has since confirmed the inclusion of subject-matter experts: pilots, engineers, aviation medicine specialists and flight-recording experts supporting the core investigation team.According to AAIB, the comprehensive report is due by 12 June 2026. Until then, no definitive cause has been declared, nor have safety directives been issued for 787-8 operators or GE’s GEnx-1B engines.","Aircraft accident investigation bureau (aaib) releases 15-page preliminary report into air india flight 171.

'FUEL CUT OFF': Air India Boeing 787 Crash TRUTH Out; PROBE Reveals 'ACTUAL CAUSE' | Details

NEW DELHI: The Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) on Saturday raised concerns over the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau’s (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, saying the investigation seems to assume that the pilots were responsible for the accident.""The tone and direction of the investigation suggest a bias toward pilot error. We categorically reject this presumption and insist on a fair, fact-based inquiry,"" ALPA India president Sam Thomas said in a statement.The association also pointed to a ""lack of transparency"" in the process. ""Investigations continue to be shrouded in secrecy, undermining credibility and public trust. Qualified, experienced personnel—especially line pilots—are still not being included in the investigation team,"" the statement said.A preliminary report has found that the fuel supply to both engines of Air India flight AI171 was cut off within a second of each other, causing confusion in the cockpit and the airplane plummeting back to ground almost immediately after taking off.The 15-page report says that in the cockpit voice recording, one unidentified pilot asked the other why he had cut off the fuel, which the other denied.ALPA referred to a Wall Street Journal article published on July 10 that reported the crash may have involved the movement of the engine fuel control switches.The association questioned how such information was leaked to the media before the official release of the report. ""A July 10 article in The Wall Street Journal references inadvertent movement of the fuel control switches. ALPA-I questions how such sensitive investigative details were leaked to international media,"" the statement read.ALPA also criticised the AAIB for releasing documents without proper official identification. ""ALPA-I is concerned that the preliminary AAIB report has been shared with the media without any responsible official signature or attribution,"" it said.The association again requested to be allowed to participate in the investigation process. ""ALPA-I renews its request to be included, at the very least, as observers in the investigation process to ensure transparency and accountability.""On June 12, a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport, hitting a medical college hostel. The crash killed 241 of the 242 people onboard and 19 people on the ground, making it the deadliest aviation accident in a decade.According to a timeline in the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) report, both engine fuel control switches—which are used to shut down the engines—were moved to the cutoff position almost immediately after takeoff. The report did not mention how this happened or who was responsible.Soon after the fuel control switches moved from RUN to CUTOFF, one second apart, a Ram Air Turbine (RAT) pump was deployed to provide hydraulic power as both engines dropped below idle speed.About 10 seconds later, the fuel control switch for Engine 1 was moved back to RUN, followed by Engine 2 four seconds later. The pilots managed to relight both engines, but only Engine 1 regained power. Engine 2 did not build enough thrust to stop the plane’s descent.One of the pilots made a ""Mayday, Mayday, Mayday"" call, but before air traffic control could respond, the aircraft clipped some trees and crashed just outside the airport boundary into a hostel occupied by students.","The airline pilots’ association of india (alpa) raised concerns over the aircraft accident investigation bureau’s (aaib) preliminary report on the air india plane crash in ahmedabad.

New Delhi: India’s Operation Sindoor was not just a warning to Pakistan, but a signal to the world about India’s military strength, says international security expert John Spencer. According to him, the strikes showed that India has both the capability and the will to respond with precision and restraint.Spencer, who is Chair of Urban Warfare Studies at the Modern War Institute (New York), told ANI in a video interview that the operation became a direct test of Indian-made systems versus Chinese military technology used by Pakistan.“This is absolutely a test of Chinese military technologies, both for the rest of the world and also for China,” he said. “It (China) uses it (Pakistan) as a lab for this technology.”India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK, after a terror attack in Pahalgam killed 26 civilians. In the days that followed, India repelled Pakistani military action and hit back at key airbases. Hostilities ended after Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations reached out to the Indian side.Spencer said India’s response highlighted not just its military upgrades but also how prepared it was: “War puts everything to the test… and everybody was learning from that demonstration.”He also noted that the ineffectiveness of Chinese-made weapons used by Pakistan is under scrutiny.“The evidence was in the video, satellite footage — not in the words about how you said your Chinese systems performed.”Spencer described the situation as part of a broader “proxy warfare” dynamic, where countries like China and Turkey back Pakistan with defence ties. “There are a lot of nuances… using Pakistan and these borders to isolate India economically and militarily,” he said.He added that India’s pattern of response to cross-border terrorism has shaped a doctrine, and while wars cannot be predicted, preparation is key. “One of the ways you prevent future wars is through preparation, change, and being on the ground.”Discussing Pakistan’s reliance on Chinese gear, Spencer said there could be a rethink. “If what you bought doesn’t work, then you go back to the seller and say, ‘This didn’t work like it was supposed to.’ But you also know if there’s user error.”He added that Pakistan may now seek advanced weapons elsewhere, but money is a major problem. “They have a money problem. The IMF has to bail Pakistan out.”Spencer said he studied Operation Sindoor not just for what happened in those four days, but because it reflected years of transformation and innovation in India’s defence sector. “India is more prepared,” he said.","India launched operation sindoor on may 7, targeting terror infrastructure in pakistan and pok.

MUMBAI: What do pilots have to say about the AAIB report?Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert, commented: ""At what stage did the engines actually stop producing thrust? The AI-171 Preliminary Report says: 'After 08:08:42 UTC when Fuel Control Switches were moved to CUT OFF. But in a later paragraph, the report stated the RAT (ram air turbine) was already deployed immediately after take-off. A simple report consisting of the collated data to date would have served the purpose of a preliminary report. This report has raised questions and suspicion about the intent and motive.""Capt Sam Thomas, president of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (APAI), said: ""The conversation between the pilots enquiring who cut off the fuel control switch is alarming. Another crucial issue is, why did the emergency locator transmitter not work after the accident? It should emit signals if the force of impact is between 3.2 to 3.5 G; the impact of the accident would have been exponentially higher. The AAIB report carries no official signature or attribution, investigations continue to be shrouded in secrecy, undermining credibility, and public trust. Thirdly, qualified, experienced personnel - especially line pilots - are still not being included in the investigation team.ALPA-I renews its request to be included, at the very least as observers, in the investigation process to ensure transparency and accountability. A July 10 report in the ""Wall Street Journal"" references inadvertent movement of the fuel control switches, ALPA questions how such sensitive investigative details were leaked to international media.""Capt Mohan Ranganthan, a former Boeing 737 commander and instructor, claimed: ""The pilot cut off the fuel knowingly. The left engine failed several seconds after the right engine, indicating that the fuel control switches were cut off one after the other. The AAIB report has a lot of ambiguity.""A senior Boeing commander, requesting anonymity, said: ""The argument that since Boeing has not issued an advisory, it indicates the pilot moved the fuel to the cut-off position is flawed. Lack of advisory does not confirm system safety. Several aircraft design flaws were acknowledged only after multiple incidents, history has shown.

Accidental flip of fuel switch ruled out due to lock

MUMBAI: Investigation into the Air India flight AI171 crash in Ahmedabad has revealed an unsettling detail.Three seconds after take-off, fuel supply to both engines of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was cut off, either by a faulty fuel supply switch or manually by one of the two pilots. The report is ambiguous on what starved the engines.But it referred to a 2018 safety bulletin that instructed airlines to look out for a possible mechanical fault with the fuel control switches, which could cut off fuel supply to the engines.“In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut off (the fuel supply). The other pilot responded that he did not do so.” This is the most crucial information in the 15-page preliminary report released early Saturday by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). The June 12 AI-171 crash killed 270 people, including 19 on the ground.Aviation safety experts criticised the report for paraphrasing the pilots’ exchange.What stands out in the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's preliminary report into the AI 171 air crash is that it points to a single-point failure or tampering with a critical flight system, the fuel supply cutoff switch.The possibility of inadvertent movement of fuel control switch from “run”’ to “cut off” position was ruled out. “The fuel control switch has a locking mechanism for added safety. You lift it up with three fingers and roll it up and into the slot to run fuel supply to the engine and, similarly, you lift it up, roll it down and then push it back into the slot to cut off fuel supply,” said Captain Manoj Hathi, former director (operations), Air India. The report does refer to a 2018 serviceability bulletin concerning fuel control switch gates which flagged disengagement of the locking mechanism.The final report into the accident, to be released on or before June 12, 2026, will likely give answers and reveal the probable cause of the crash.Most crashes are caused by a combination of several factors & multiple failures, such as the AI Express Calicut or Mangalore crash in 2020 & 2010, respectively. While the commander of AI-171 had 15,000 hours of flying experience, including 8,600 hours on the B787, the co-pilot had 3,400 hours of experience.The senior commanders TOI spoke to also referred to another service bulletin issued jointly by the FAA and GE (engine manufacturer) in 2021. Service Bulletin FAA-2021-0273-0013 recommends the replacement of the “MN4 microprocessor on ECU” with respect to engine fuel and control. “This recommendation is to address a condition that may affect flight safety,” it states.It involves the engine control unit (ECU), the “brain” of modern jet engine. An ECU monitors crucial engine parameters and controls fuel flow. MN4 is an integrated microprocessor used inside ECU. It handles critical processing tasks such as interpreting sensor data, executing engine control algorithms, sending signals to actuators such as fuel metering valves, and managing fault detection and communication with cockpit systems.The report said CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed the ram air turbine (RAT) being deployed during initial climb immediately after lift-off. “No significant bird activity is observed in vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall,” the report said. “At this stage of the probe, no definitive cause has been determined, and no immediate safety recommendations have been issued to B787-8 or GEnx-1B engine operators,” it stated.",Preliminary report into air india flight ai171 crash in ahmedabad reveals unsettling detail.

Poll What should be prioritized to prevent future aviation accidents? Regular technical audits and maintenance Enhanced pilot training and protocols

Here are the key findings from the preliminary investigation report:

Fuel to both engines cut off mid-air: Just three seconds after liftoff at 08:08:39 UTC, the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were triggered, one second apart. ""The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec,"" the report states.

Cockpit voice recorder captures pilot confusion: The cockpit voice recording reveals confusion in the final moments. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so."" Investigators are looking into whether the switches were triggered manually, inadvertently, or by a system malfunction.

Relight attempt on engines: The flight data shows that an automatic relight was attempted. Engine 1 briefly responded, but Engine 2 did not recover despite multiple attempts to reintroduce fuel. This failure ultimately made it impossible for the aircraft to maintain thrust.

Emergency RAT deployment: The Ram Air Turbine (RAT), an emergency power source deployed in response to power failure, activated right after takeoff, a clear indicator of loss of electrical power to critical systems.

Mayday call issued moments before: At 08:09:05 UTC, one of the pilots issued a distress call: ""MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY."" The Air Traffic Controller attempted to confirm the call sign but received no further response. Seconds later, the aircraft crashed.

Aircraft crashed in nose-up attitude: Flight path analysis shows the aircraft hit buildings near BJ Medical College with an 8-degree nose-up pitch and level wings. With no thrust from either engine, the aircraft could not sustain flight.

Thrust levers found in idle post-crash: Although the thrust levers were in takeoff position during flight, they were found in idle after the crash. Flaps and landing gear were confirmed to be in standard takeoff positions, ruling out abnormal configuration as a factor.

Wreckage spread across 1,000 feet: The plane disintegrated across a wide zone, hitting multiple buildings. Debris, including engines and landing gear, was scattered over more than 1,000 feet, indicating the force of the impact and trajectory.

Aircraft airworthy, no fuel control issues logged earlier: The aircraft had valid airworthiness certification. Though there were some minor Category C and D MEL (Minimum Equipment List) issues, none related to fuel control. Notably, no previous issues with fuel cutoff switches had been reported.

Optional Boeing advisory not followed: While Boeing had issued an optional advisory on fuel control switch locking mechanisms, Air India had not carried out the recommended checks. The aircraft’s throttle control modules had been replaced in 2019 and 2023.

The Big Picture







The Trump administration is facing its most volatile internal crisis yet, as FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino edges closer to resignation over Attorney General Pam Bondi’s mishandling of the long-anticipated Epstein files. The fallout, driven by Bondi’s broken promises and growing public outrage, has FBI Director Kash Patel reportedly prepared to follow Bongino out the door—setting the stage for a possible leadership implosion at the heart of American law enforcement.This internal war—once quietly brewing—is now on full display, with recriminations flying, alliances shifting, and MAGA loyalists turning on their own.On July 7, the Department of Justice issued a memo that decisively undercut the narrative Bondi had been peddling for months. The two-page document concluded there was no evidence of a “client list,” no credible signs of blackmail, and reaffirmed the long-standing official position that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in a federal jail cell in 2019.The memo, signed off by both DOJ and FBI leadership, included surveillance footage and investigative summaries that contradicted Bondi’s earlier statements. For months, she had claimed the FBI was in possession of tens of thousands of hours of disturbing video footage, and had repeatedly promised bombshell disclosures.Those promises now appear to have been hollow.Conservative influencers, who had banked on explosive revelations implicating elites, were incensed. Bondi’s office had built expectations with Phase 1 of the “Epstein Files” back in February—a series of binders handed out to right-wing media figures that mostly repackaged previously leaked information. With the July memo’s flat conclusions, fury erupted.The conflict between Bongino and Bondi came to a head on July 9 during a closed-door White House meeting. Bondi accused Bongino of leaking frustrations to the press, an allegation he denied. Witnesses described the exchange as heated and personal, with Bongino storming out of the room.Two days later, Bongino took a personal day and has not returned. Multiple administration sources now say his resignation is imminent. One source described him as “done,” and unwilling to work another day under Bondi’s leadership. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and a fixture in conservative media, had reluctantly endorsed the DOJ memo’s suicide conclusion, only to be caught in the backlash from MAGA influencers who accused him of selling out.FBI Director Kash Patel is also said to be considering resignation. Once a key proponent of theories questioning Epstein’s death, Patel has since aligned with the suicide explanation in his official capacity. However, insiders say he is privately furious at Bondi for damaging the Bureau’s credibility and igniting a crisis within the administration.Patel’s calculus is reportedly tied to Bongino’s fate. If his deputy resigns, Patel may follow, seeing little institutional value in continuing under Bondi’s divisive leadership. One aide close to the director said, “He doesn’t want to be left holding the bag. If Bongino goes, Kash walks too.”Bondi, once lionised by MAGA world as a crusading truth-teller, now finds herself isolated. Online, influencers and activists who once supported her are accusing her of deceit. Hashtags attacking her flooded conservative corners of social media in the days following the memo’s release. Even voices that typically defend the Trump administration have begun to call for her resignation.What makes the backlash particularly potent is that Bondi had personally staked her reputation on the idea that the Epstein files contained smoking guns. Now that official documentation has concluded otherwise, she has lost the confidence of both the public and senior officials inside the administration.Donald Trump has so far refused to intervene. During a cabinet meeting on July 8, he reportedly urged his team to “move on” from the Epstein issue, calling it a distraction from his legislative agenda. While the president continues to publicly back Bondi, insiders say he’s well aware of her declining utility. Trump’s political instincts have always been sharper than his personal loyalties—and Bondi may soon find herself on the wrong side of that calculation.This isn’t just about Epstein. It’s about trust, credibility, and the fault lines within the Trump-era security state. Bondi’s promise of transparency has backfired, alienating the very audience it was meant to appease. Bongino’s looming exit and Patel’s wavering loyalty signal a broader collapse of cohesion at the top. With two of the administration’s most prominent law enforcement figures ready to walk and the base in open revolt, Pam Bondi’s position may no longer be tenable. And while the Epstein case may be officially closed, the political aftershocks are far from over.",The trump administration is facing its most volatile internal crisis yet.

Ovidio Guzman Lopez: Drug lord 'El Chapo's' son pleads guilty; admits to drug trafficking charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ovidio-guzmn-lpe-drug-lord-el-chapos-son-pleads-guilty-admits-to-drug-trafficking-charges/articleshow/122399341.cms,"Ovidio Guzman Lopez (AP image)





Ovidio Guzman Lopez, the son of notorious Mexican drug lord “El Chapo” pleaded guilty on Friday (local time) to drug trafficking charges in the United States. He is the first of El Chapo’s sons to agree to a plea deal with US prosecutors.Prosecutors say Ovidio and his brother, Joaquín Guzmán López, led a faction of the Sinaloa cartel known as the “Chapitos” or “little Chapos.” Authorities described their operation as a major effort to smuggle huge amounts of fentanyl into the US, contributing to tens of thousands of overdose deaths every year.As part of the plea deal, Ovidio admitted to overseeing the production and trafficking of cocaine, heroin , methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the US. He also pleaded guilty to money laundering and firearms charges connected to his leadership role in the cartel.The specific terms of the agreement, including possible sentencing reductions or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed. However, officials said sentencing has been delayed as Ovidio cooperates with US authorities.His lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, said he would wait until sentencing before discussing whether it was a good deal.Lichtman also pointed out that the case against Ovidio’s brother Joaquín is different and might take longer to resolve.“Remember, Joaquin was arrested in America well after Ovidio was, so it takes time,” Lichtman said.Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant US attorney in Los Angeles, said Ovidio’s guilty plea might have helped protect his family members.“In this way, he has some control over who he’s cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.”Levenson described the plea deal as a “big step” for the US government.Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday criticized what she called a “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels. She pointed out the contradiction between the US labeling cartels as foreign terrorist organizations while also making plea deals with their leaders.Ovidio Guzmán López was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States. He had first pleaded not guilty but signaled in recent months that he would change his plea.His father, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, is serving a life sentence in the US after being convicted in 2019 for leading the Sinaloa cartel and having smuggled massive amount of cocaine and other drugs into the United States for over 25 years.","Ovidio guzman lopez pleads guilty to drug trafficking charges in the united states.
