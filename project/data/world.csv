"'India ain't football you kick around': Ex-Pentagon official Rubin on ties with Canada; calls Khalistan, Nijjar issue 'Trudeau's fictions'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-aint-football-you-kick-around-ex-pentagon-official-rubin-on-ties-with-canada-calls-khalistan-nijjar-issue-trudeaus-fictions/articleshow/121766861.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ex-Pentagon official Michael Rubin criticised Justin Trudeau 's approach towards India and said that it was ""not a football which you kick around but an ally you strive to embrace"". Terming the Khalistan and Hardeep Singh Nijjar issues- the core reasons behind souring of India-Canada ties- ""Trudeau's fictions"", Rubin appreciated Mark Carney for making an effort to rebuild ties with India.""India is not a football which you kick around. It is an ally to be embraced"", Rubin said in an exclusive interview with ANI.""The grievances about Hardeep Singh Nijjar and the Khalistan movement were not real. They were exaggerations that Justin Trudeau amplified...Justin Trudeau may have wanted so much to appease radical Sikh extremists in various constituencies that he was willing to take an organised crime hit between various Sikh groups and mafias and blame an outside power for it, rather than acknowledge the problem and the fault was Canada's alone. That is Justin Trudeau's problem. But now that Justin Trudeau is gone and likely will never return to power, Prime Minister Carney is taking a sober approach and recognising that he is not going to be tied to Justin Trudeau's fictions,"" he added.Contrasting Trudeau's approach towards India with that of current Canadian PM Mark Carney's, he said, ""Mark Carney is working on repairing the relationship rather than following Justin Trudeau down the rabbit hole already shows that Prime Minister Carney is a much more serious person than the former Prime Minister of Canada...Canadanow needs to demonstrate its good faith.""""Canada's relationship with India, especially under Justin Trudeau, was not principled. It was all virtue signalling and politics. The fact of the matter is that India is crucial to Canada, and Canada needs to decide whether ultimately it's going to side with the democracies like India and the United States, or whether it's going to posture the way Justin Trudeau did and allow China, which also has significant interests in Canada,"" he added.Talking about Carney's invite to PM Narendra Modi for G7 summit, Rubin said, ""Canadian PM Mark Carney originally was a banker. He understands the importance of India. Justin Trudeau was a politician who peddled in image and imagination, and therefore it makes sense that Carney wants to restore maturity to the relationship.""""It makes sense for Prime Minister Modi to show that the problem was not Canada itself, but the immaturity and unprofessionalism of Justin Trudeau,"" he added.Canada will host the upcoming G7 summit from June 15 to 17, gathering the world's top industrialized nations—France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Japan, the US, and Canada—alongside the EU and international bodies such as the IMF, World Bank, and UN. The summit will focus on key global issues, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising tensions in West Asia.","Michael rubin criticised justin trudeau's approach towards india and said that it was ""not a football which you kick around but an ally you strive to embrace"" terming the khalistan and hardeep singh nijjar issues- the core reasons behind souring of india-canada ties- ""tr trudeau's fictions"", rubin appreciated mark carney for making an effort to rebuild ties.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121767061,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-759895,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

In an interview in Brussels, he said Pakistan had trained thousands of terrorists and was ready to unleash them on India.Asked about China's support to Pakistan, the minister warned against double standards on the issue of terrorism. ""They have had close ties for decades. But on an issue like terrorism, you cannot afford ambiguity or double standards. In the end, it's a problem that concerns all of us,"" said the minister.The message to the terrorists, he said, is that there is going to be retribution, and that retribution will be against the terrorist organisations and the terrorist leadership.""We don't care where they are. If they are deep in Pakistan, we will go deep into Pakistan,"" he said, adding that India's fighter aircraft and missiles had inflicted far more damage on the Pakistani Air Force than vice versa, forcing Pakistan to sue for peace in the conflict that followed India's Operation Sindoor against the terrorists.""As far I'm concerned, how effective the Rafale was or frankly, how effective other systems were - to me the proof of the pudding are the destroyed and disabled airfields on the Pakistani side,"" he said. ""The fighting stopped on the 10th for one reason and one reason only, which was that on the 10th morning, we hit these eight Pakistani, the main eight Pakistani airfields and disabled them,"" he said, adding that images are available in Google showing runways and those hangars which have taken the hit.The minister also said that the issue in Kashmir is about terrorism. ""It has become an India-Pakistan issue because Pakistan harbours and supports terrorists.

"A riveting, action-packed year awaits Modi 3.0 on the diplomatic front",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-riveting-action-packed-year-awaits-modi-3-0-on-the-diplomatic-front/articleshow/121765702.cms,"The first year of Modi 3.0 will be remembered most for Operation Sindoor, thrusting Pakistan back to the centrestage of Indian foreign policy. By striking terrorist infrastructure deep inside Pakistan, India not only imposed unprecedented costs upon Islamabad for its support to cross-border terrorism but also raised the stakes for the international community's indulgence of Pakistan's duplicity in addressing a core Indian concern.The year also saw milestones being delivered like the India-UK FTA and the India-EU end-of-2025 deadline set by both sides for a similar agreement that the EU has described as the largest deal of its kind anywhere in the world. PM Modi's visit to the US within a month of President Trump's return to the White House, along with the launch of negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement, was also one of the high points.There were other foreign policy pluses, none perhaps more significant than the breakthrough with China in the form of the successful settlement of the five-year-old border standoff. The thaw in the relationship after the Modi-Xi meeting in Oct in Russia saw India resuming bilateral visits to Beijing and agreeing on a host of measures to normalise ties.Among the highlights was the upgrade in ties with the Taliban with the first political contact in the form of external affairs minister S Jaishankar's talks with the acting Afghan foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi. Modi also garnered international attention for his back-to-back visits to Russia and Ukraine, during which he stressed the importance of direct talks to end the war - something the two sides are engaged in currently.However, many of these foreign policy hits remain an unfinished business and will test India's resolve in the days ahead. On Pakistan, the challenge will be to ensure the global community, particularly the UN Security Council where Pakistan is a member, shows understanding about the punitive terms India has set out in the 'new normal' against Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism. This will be critical in the event of another terrorist attack from across the LoC. The all-party delegations have made a beginning but there's more to be done, while being mindful of the risks of India-Pakistan re-hyphenation that such an exercise might entail.Managing the relationship with the US will be another pressing challenge in the second year of Modi 3.0. This has arisen unexpectedly from Trump's constant needling of India on bilateral trade and perhaps even more damaging utterances on the India-Pakistan conflict, like his use of the term mediation - a big taboo in Indian foreign policy lexicon - and his drawing an equivalence between India and Pakistan. India is hoping that not just the US but also its other Quad partners will be more liberal in their support for India on cross-border terrorism, like in the form of a joint statement when the foreign ministers and leaders meet this year.The third significant challenge in the next few months will be to decide whether it's time to reinforce the improvement in ties with Beijing by resuming direct air and normal visa services with and, more importantly, with a visit to the country by Modi for SCO summit. Despite China's ties with Pakistan acting as a deterrent, India has kept the door open for continued engagement.Modi has also shown interest in rebuilding ties with Canada by accepting his counterpart Mark Carney's delayed invitation for the G7 but this will be subject to Ottawa's handling of Khalistani separatists and also the probe into Nijjar murder that wrecked the relationship. Signs of improvement in Pakistan-Taliban ties and the proposal to expand CPEC into Afghanistan might pose a few problems too. All in all, a riveting, action-packed year is what awaits Modi 3.0.","The first year of modi 3.0 will be remembered most for operation sindoor, thrusting pakistan back to the centrestage of indian foreign policy. The year also saw milestones being delivered like the india-uk fta and theindia-eu end-of-2025 deadline.

"Modi government at 11: Operation Sindoor a success, but defence budget needs to go up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-government-at-11-operation-sindoor-a-success-but-defence-budget-needs-to-go-up/articleshow/121765634.cms,"With the deep military collusiveness between Pakistan and China being rudely reinforced during Operation Sindoor , India needs to raise its annual defence budget to at least 2.5% of GDP, impart a greater thrust to self-reliance in military R&D and production, and invest heavily in unmanned aerial systems, long-range weapons, space-based systems, electronic warfare and other such tech that will be decisive in future warfare.Modi govt will have to contend with the now well-fused two-front challenge along our long unresolved borders, which will see China continue to use Pakistan as a more than willing proxy to bog India down in South Asia.China is, and will remain, India's main strategic threat in the years ahead. ""India will have to tackle a superpower (China), which will also actively continue to support a near-peer military adversary (Pakistan) against us. We need to continue bolstering both our conventional and nuclear deterrence,"" a top military officer told TOI.The wide array of Chinese weapons and sensor-shooter networks used by Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities, ranging from J-10 fighters firing the PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to HQ-9 air defence missile batteries, make this quite evident. It's only going to get worse, with Pakistan on course to acquire at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation stealth jets and even the formidable HQ-19 long-range air defence missile systems from China.Despite competing demands from other crucial developmental sectors, India simply cannot let its defence budget languish at just about 1.9% of GDP. The bulk of the allocation, as of now, is gobbled up by the huge salary and pension bill as well as operational sustenance, leaving barely 25% for concrete military modernisation. ""Emergency procurements approved by govt are more than welcome to plug immediate operational gaps, but the overall budget needs a sharp hike,"" another officer said.There is also no getting away from the fact that genuine 'Atmanirbharta' in defence production with a much greater role for the private sector, instead of the present half-hearted measures, is critical for systematically building potent capabilities across the spectrum, ensuring adequate war-wastage reserves and surge capacities in crisis situations. ""It's critical for retaining strategic autonomy. India will have to fight its battles alone or largely on its own,"" the top officer said.The indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter called the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), for instance, needs to be majorly fast-tracked after the defence ministry last month finally approved a new ""programme execution model"" for prototype development.The long, meandering developmental history of the fourth-generation Tejas, which began way back in 1983, cannot be repeated. The IAF is still waiting to get the first Tejas Mark-1A 'improved' fighter. Similarly, indigenous development of 110 Kilonewton engines, with or without foreign collaboration, to power AMCA is critical. IAF is currently grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised.Then, there are drones and standoff weapons, which have revolutionised the nature of modern-day combat. From low cross-section loitering munitions and swarm drones to FPV (first person view) drones and UCAVs (unmanned combat aerial vehicles), all need to be produced in India in large numbers.The sheer operational utility of a robust multi-layered air defence also came to the fore during Operation Sindoor, with India using Russian S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile systems (380-km interception range), Barak-8 medium range SAM systems (70-km, jointly developed with Israel), the indigenous Akash systems (25-km) and several short-range systems to thwart multiple drone and missile attacks by Pakistan.Towards this end, DRDO needs to complete its ongoing development of the very short-range air defence system missiles, which have a 6-km range, and the long-range system under Project Kusha, with a 350-km range, on a war footing.Amid all this, long-pending systemic defence reforms like slashing the non-operational flab in the 15-lakh strong armed forces, streamlining long-winded procurement procedures and setting up unified theatre commands for an integrated war-fighting machinery in a cost effective manner, cannot fall by the wayside.","China is, and will remain, india's main strategic threat in the years ahead. The bulk of the allocation, as of now, is gobbled up by the huge salary and pension bill.

Modi at 11: PM increases vitality gap with opposition as new challenges loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-at-11-pm-increases-vitality-gap-with-opposition-as-new-challenges-loom/articleshow/121765620.cms,"One year ago, when Narendra Modi began his record-equalling third term, the mood in BJP and the larger saffron fraternity was far from that of unalloyed celebration. Contrary to the near-total consensus that BJP would surpass its 2019 score of 303, the party's tally had dropped to a modest 240, forcing it to depend on the support of TDP and JD(U) to form the govt. Instantly, commentary was rife that the law of diminishing returns had finally caught up with the man who had defied the capriciousness of public sentiment as well as the headwinds and vicissitudes which had, quite predictably, marked his 10 years, not just to maintain but to improve his standing with the voter.True to himself, Modi struck a sunny note, focusing on the positive takeaways from the less-than-satisfactory outcome. But that was not enough to quell the doubts gnawing at supporters. Rivals, of course, were jubilant, not letting their third consecutive defeat come in the way of celebrations.But it did not take long for the pall of uncertainty to lift. BJP's victories in Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi proved wrong those who had rushed to write the obituaries. It failed to form a govt in Jammu and Kashmir, but its performance in Jammu was yet another indication of its superiority over Congress in straight contests: something that the defeat in Jharkhand could not erase.Several factors contributed to the outcomes. But Modi's continuing popularity was, unarguably, the common thread. Together, they also showed that the opposition, particularly, had drawn disproportionate conclusions from the setback in the Lok Sabha polls. Also, the gambits, for instance, the unsubstantiated charge about a conspiracy to abolish quotas or the consolidation of Muslims in favour of the opposition, may not necessarily be all-weather winners.Modi, keeping any disappointment over the dip in numbers to himself, had started his third innings on a brisk note, in any case. The electoral wins came as an impetus, countering the hope of opponents and the fear of supporters that his dependence on allies, both of whom were tough bargainers, would force him to govern with one hand tied behind his back. The enactment of the Waqf Bill is a prime example. Both TDP and JD(U) supported the legislation, dubbed communal by the opposition, which tried to bait them into breaking ranks with BJP by saying that the stands of N Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar would be a litmus test of their secular credentials. Changes in the waqf law affect powerful interests among Muslims far more directly than the abrogation of J&K's special status. Understandably, the lobbying against the move was more intense, often threatening to match the feverish heights last seen over the Shah Bano case and the Babri demolition.If Naidu and Nitish stayed firm, it was because of the simple calculation that Modi's enduring appeal would more than compensate for any loss of Muslim support they still had.There is no sign yet of the opposition closing the vitality gap that Modi has opened up. It is 11 years since he took over, but he has not stopped taking either initiatives or plotting counter-manoeuvres to disrupt opposition's plans. The decision on caste census is a classic example of Modi coming up with a move which the rival had not anticipated. With this single move, he undercut Rahul Gandhi's effort over the years to cast himself as a social justice warrior. That it came in the wake of Pahalgam only added to the audacity.Operation Sindoor only served to strengthen Brand Modi. India won this round decisively, with satellite images of the losses inflicted by the Indian Air Force deep inside Pakistan and the destruction of the hostile neighbour's strategic bases providing tell-tale evidence. No amount of scorekeeping of losses, both real and imaginary, and the embrace of US President Donald Trump's claim to have brokered the 'ceasefire' can take away from this. Looked at purely through the prism of politics, it has recharged the PM's 'jo kaha so kiya' persona and, given the performance of indigenous weapons systems, should put an end to the mocking of his 'Make-in-India' ambition.The military confrontation and its aftermath have seen justified criticism of the outlandish claims made by ultra-zealous individuals on social media and in a few newsrooms. But what has gone unnoticed is the readiness of society to back him to the hilt, regardless of what turn a conflict between two nuclear-armed adversaries might take. Starting with Uri in 2016 and through Balakot, Modi had single-handedly created a new national resolve, which speaks to the people's trust in him.The 'surrender' charge does not seem to bother the Prime Minister. Otherwise, he would not have accepted the invitation to attend the G-7 meeting in Canada, where Trump will loom large.The coming days will not be easy. In Bihar, he will have to strain hard to offset Nitish's incumbency. Global volatility, Trump's tariff war, the general uncertainty that he has generated, and the possibility that Pakistan's military-jihadi complex may try to avenge their humiliation: all these add up to a challenging task. The BJP organisation has not been in good shape for quite some time. A reorganisation has been delayed, putting him and his trusted associate Amit Shah under strain. But don't be surprised if he negotiates them well. He has a proven track record, dating back to 2002 when he took over as chief minister of Gujarat, as well as the crucial wherewithal in the form of a reservoir of goodwill.","One year ago, when narendra modi began his record-equalling third term, the mood in bjp and the larger saffron fraternity was far from that of unalloyed celebration.

Gold price prediction today: Amidst ongoing US-China trade deal talks, gold prices are likely to continue fluctuating, with geo-political uncertainties adding to volatility. Where are gold prices headed in the short-term and what are the factors that investors need to watch out for?Top trade deputies of the US and China began their talks in London on Monday. Gold gained on Monday on a weaker US Dollar. MCX August gold contract was at Rs 97200, up 0.16% on the day.Earlier, spot gold prices fell 1.25% to close at $3310 on Friday as the US non-farm payroll report (May) came in somewhat better than expected, though details were not so encouraging.Easing US-China trade tensions pressurized the yellow metal further. Despite falling for two straight days on June 5 and June 6, the metal closed nearly 0.63% higher on a weekly basis in the week ending June 6.The metal rose to $3403 on June 5 --highest since May 8- as traders piled into the metal on safe haven demand as US-China tensions escalated.US Treasury Secretary Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick and US Trade Representative Greer met a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng Monday at London's Lancaster House. Presence of high-profile officials in Trump's Team reflects willingness of the US administration to allow some relaxations in the US exports to China, which may include technical supplies, jet engine parts, etc. China, in turn, is expected to ease rare earth exports to the US.Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 88.394MOz as of June 6. ETF holdings witnessed net inflows for the second consecutive week following net outflows for five straight weeks. ETF holdings are up around 6.70% YTD.China's inflation data released Monday showed that China's CPI (May) declined 0.1% y-o-y vs the forecast of -0.2%. It was the fourth straight monthly decline as the Chinese economy continues to struggle with sluggish demand amid a raging trade war. China’s factory deflation continued for the 32nd straight month as PPI (May) declined 3.3% y-o-y as against the estimate of 3.2% and 2.7% decline in April. The deflation threat will continue to linger unless consumer demand remains sluggish.China's exports slowed from 8.1% y-o-y in April to 4.8% y-o-y (forecast 6%) in May as shipments to the US declined 34% y-o-y, worse than a 21% decline registered in April. Chinese imports dipped 3.4% y-o-y due to trade uncertainty as against the forecast of a decline of 0.8%.The US non-farm report (May) released Friday was somewhat better-than-expected as US employers added 139K jobs Vs the forecast of 126K jobs, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Average hourly earnings m-o-m and y-o-y rose 0.4% and 3.9% respectively Vs the respective estimates of 0.3% (prior 0.2%) and 3.7% (prior 3.9%). However, two-month payroll net revision showed a decline of 95K jobs as labor force participation rate slid from 62.6% to 52.4%. The household survey reflected a weakening job market. Even as the population increased by 188k, the labor force dropped by 625k. Thus, even though employment fell by 696k, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.20%.Traders will closely monitor US CPI (May) and PPI (May) data to be released on June 11 and June 12 respectively for clues to the Fed rate cut path.The US Dollar Index, at the time of writing, was seen at 98.95, down nearly 0.24% on the day. The Index fell 0.14% in the week ending June 6. Ten-year and 30-year US yields were a tad lower at 4.48% and 4.95% respectively.Money managers increased their net bullish gold bets to a seven-week high in the week ending June 3.China's gold reserves were up for the seventh consecutive month as PBoC bought around 2 tons of gold in May. China's gold holdings reached 73.80 MOz at the end of May.The lingering deflation threat to China’s economy, positive ETF inflows and not so strong US non-farm payroll report (May) are positive factors for the yellow metal. However, in the near-term, the metal is expected to take its clues from the ongoing US-China trade talks in London. Positive outcomes from the talks will weigh on the shiny metal. In that case, gold may fall to as low as $3260 (Rs 95,000). Interim support is at $3292 (Rs 96,000). Resistance is at $3365 (Rs 98,000)/$3405 (Rs 99,200).In all the possibility, there may be some tentative positive developments in the trade deal talks. In that case, gold may decline to test the support at $3292. However, full resolution of all the trade related issues looks to be elusive for the time being. Nonetheless, traders need to take cognizance of the ongoing US-China trade deal talks. In the meantime, a light sell position can be initiated with due risk management in place.","Gold gained on monday on a weaker us dollar.

This was quickly followed by a meeting of PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Russia in October and the resumption of the Special Representatives’ (SR) Talks on the Boundary Question 2 months later.ToI has learnt that Sun will arrive in India on Thursday for a 2-day visit that will likely see him calling on NSA Ajit Doval, apart from holding talks under the foreign secretary-vice minister mechanism. Doval is also likely to host the Chinese Special Representative, Wang Yi, who doubles up as foreign minister, later this year for another round of SR talks.The meeting this week will be an important occasion for India and China to review progress on steps announced in January to normalize the relationship. The 2 sides had then agreed to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in the summer of 2025, an Indian demand that has been fulfilled.While there has also been progress in cooperation on trans-border rivers, both sides are yet to resume direct air services between the 2 countries, something they had agreed to do “in principle” in January.The 2 sides will likely also touch upon the possibility of a visit by PM Narendra Modi to China in September to cap a year of détente in the bilateral relationship. Modi has been invited for the SCO summit in Tianjin but is yet to confirm his participation. The summit will be preceded by a meeting of the foreign ministers which external affairs minister S Jaishankar is likely to attend. The visit by Sun, who served as ambassador to India when the eastern Ladakh standoff erupted, also signals an intent on the part of both sides to build upon the nascent thaw in the relationship, not allowing India-Pakistan hostilities to come in the way.India wants dialogue mechanisms to be resumed step by step, in a way that allows both sides to address each other’s concerns. India is likely to raise its concerns related to trade in the meeting, as it seeks a more transparent and predictable economic and trade relationship. Both sides in the last Misri-Sun meeting had also agreed to facilitate people-to-people exchanges, including media and think-tank interactions.",Chinese vice foreign minister sun weidong is likely to travel to india this week.

NEW DELHI: India’s population for 2025 is estimated at 1.46 billion, says a new UN report, which also flagged a declining total fertility rate (TFR) in the world’s most populous country.The population is expected to grow to about 1.7 billion before it begins to fall, around 40 years from now, said the UN Population Fund’s (UNFPA) 2025 State of World Population Report released Tuesday. China’s population is estimated to touch 1.41 billion this year.India’s population was 1.44 billion last year, according to World Population Prospects-2024, also a UN report, released in July last year.The UNFPA report showed India’s TFR has declined to 1.9, which is below the replacement level fertility of 2.1 births per woman, indicating women are having fewer children than needed to maintain the population size from one generation to the next.It noted that while India has made significant progress in lowering fertility rate, deep inequalities persist across states, castes and incomes.Even as India's fertility rate is declining, many people in India, especially women, still face significant barriers to making free and informed decisions about their reproductive lives, says the UN Population Fund's State of World Population Report released Tuesday.These barriers create what the report identified as India's ""high fertility and low fertility duality"".The fertility rate has come down from nearly five children per woman in 1970 to about two, courtesy improved education and access to reproductive healthcare. The TFR fell below the replacement level rate to 2.0 for the first time in the National Family Health Survey (2019-21).States such as Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh continue to experience high fertility rates. Here, unintended and closely spaced births are common due to poor contraceptive and health services, and gender norms, it said.On the other hand, states such as Delhi, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have sustained below-replacement fertility with many couples delaying or skipping childbirth due to costs and work-life conflict, especially among educated middle-class women.The report called for a shift from panic over falling fertility to addressing unmet reproductive goals as it highlighted that millions of individuals are not able to realise their real fertility goals. ""This is the real crisis, not underpopulation or overpopulation. The answer lies in greater reproductive agency - a person's ability to make free and informed choices about sex, contraception and starting a family,"" it said.In line with these trends, a UNFPA-YouGov survey of 14,000 respondents across14 countries, including India, challenged global narratives around ""population explosion vs population collapse"" as it showed that one in three adult Indians (36%) face unintended pregnancies while 30% experience unfulfilled desire of having either more or fewer children. Notably, 23% faced both.Financial limitation is one of the biggest barriers to reproductive freedom with nearly four in 10 people citing it as a reason stopping them from having the families they want. Job insecurity (21%), housing constraints (22%), and lack of reliable childcare (18%) are making parenthood feel out of reach.","India’s population for 2025 is estimated at 1.46 billion, says a new un report.

NEW DELHI: China has expressed gratitude to Indian authorities for their prompt and professional response after a massive fire broke out on board the Singapore-flagged cargo vessel MV Wan Hai 503 off the Kerala coast, which was carrying 14 Chinese crew members.The incident, which occurred on June 9, has left four crew members missing and five injured, while 18 others have been rescued.“Of the total 22 crew members on board, 14 are Chinese, including 6 from Taiwan,” Chinese Embassy spokesperson Yu Jing posted on X, thanking the Indian Navy and Mumbai Coast Guard for their rescue efforts. “We wish further search operations successful and the injured crew members a speedy recovery,” the statement added.Thanking India for its rescue efforts, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Yu Jing posted on X, ""On June 9, MV Wan Hai 503 encountered onboard explosion and fire 44 nautical miles off Azhikkal, Kerala.

We wish further search operations successful and the injured crew members speedy recovery.The explosion occurred while the vessel was en route from Colombo to Nhava Sheva near Mumbai. According to the Indian Coast Guard, the fire started mid-ship and spread towards the container bay ahead of the accommodation block.Though the forward bay fire has been contained, thick smoke continues to billow and the ship is now listing 10–15 degrees to port. Several containers have also gone overboard.In response, Indian Coast Guard ships Samudra Prahari, Sachet, and Rajdoot were quickly deployed for firefighting and boundary cooling operations. ICGS Samarth has been sent from Kochi with a salvage team, and aerial surveys are being conducted to monitor the situation.An Indian Coast Guard Dornier aircraft also dropped air-droppables near the vessel to aid firefighting. “Quick response by India Coast Guard after explosion on Singapore-flagged MV WAN HAI 503, 130 NM NW of Kerala coast,” the Coast Guard posted on X.The ship, which is now drifting, had been carrying containerised cargo when an explosion below deck triggered the fire. The vessel is currently 44 nautical miles off Azhikkal in Kannur and about 130 nautical miles northwest of Kochi.Amid the ongoing rescue, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) has issued advisories warning of potential oil spill and drifting containers. Simulations show a 70–80% probability that debris and floating cargo may drift southeast from the site over the next three days.“However, caution is advised about a few containers beaching between Kozhikode and Kochi,” INCOIS said in a statement, adding that its oil spill model predicts a parallel coastal drift until June 13.Local authorities have been urged to step up shoreline surveillance to address potential environmental and navigational hazards.","China thanks india for swift rescue of fire-hit cargo ship off kerala coast.

The primary role of the Deputy Speaker is to preside over the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in the absence of the Speaker and to ensure the smooth conduct of the House. The Deputy Speaker has the same powers as the Speaker when presiding, including maintaining order, deciding on points of order, and managing debates.Importantly, the Deputy Speaker is expected to function in a non-partisan manner, similar to the Speaker, despite being elected from a political party. Traditionally, this post is often offered to a member of the opposition or another party to maintain a balance, although this is not mandated by the Constitution.The position is significant for upholding the parliamentary process and ensuring continuity in the functioning of the Lok Sabha when the Speaker is unavailable.The last Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha in India was M.
