'Warm And Engaging': PM Modi Holds Phone Call With Trump Amid Trade Talks, US-India Ties Discussed

PM-Trump call signals greater India-US willingness to engage

NEW DELHI: Amidst ongoing efforts by India and the US to finalise a bilateral trade deal, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation while also discussing regional and global issues.The conversation came within a week of Modi's summit with Russian President Putin and in the middle of renewed efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war on the back of Trump's peace plan.The two sides are looking to arrive at a common understanding on issues amid indications that US is still seeking access for its farm products like corn and soybean, among other issues. The two sides have been in talks for a bilateral trade pact since March.""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" Modi posted on X.PM Modi is learnt to have reiterated India's position that it will support all international efforts for peace.""Modi and Trump reviewed the steady progress in India-US bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments,"" said an Indian readout. This was the first conversation between the two since they had a call days after Diwali.Thursday's telephonic conversation signals a greater willingness on both sides to engage as there has been progress in most areas, barring trade, for which Trump has imposed 50% import duty on Indian products, comprising 25% reciprocal tariff and another 25% secondary tariffs for purchasing Russian oil and defence equipment.The move has hit several Indian exports, including textiles, leather, gems and jewellery and shrimps. While negotiators from the two sides have been engaging in a dialogue to resolve the issue, the Trump administration is yet to ease the tariffs, despite an acknowledgment by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that the offer on the table is the best received so far.The conversation follows recent efforts by both sides to revive bilateral engagements after the trade-related impasse. US also joined India and other Quad nations in condemning the Red Fort terror incident in a Quad counter-terrorism dialogue. Both sides also separately held their own terrorism dialogue.India and US held foreign office consultations this week with a focus on key bilateral issues, including trade and investment, defence, the TRUST initiative for cooperation in critical technologies, energy, including civil nuclear collaboration, and critical minerals.According to US, the meeting was an opportunity to translate President Trump and PM Modi's vision from their Feb meeting this year into ""concrete progress that enhances US security, jobs and competitiveness, while supporting India's long-term goals"".""The Under Secretary emphasised US' aim to deepen cooperation in defense, energy, technology, space, and trusted supply chains and the value of US-India cooperation that fuels US innovation while supporting India's rise as a global technology leader,"" a US embassy spokesperson said.While the US statement did not mention the Indo-Pacific, an Indian readout said that the discussions also covered regional and global developments of mutual interest, with both sides underscoring their shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.","Pm narendra modi and president donald trump spoke on thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation.

A lullaby. A video call. A mother flying alone for the first time. Six months later, those final moments haunt Hiren Dayani, one of dozens of Gujaratis whose lives were ripped apart when Air India Flight 171 crashed seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on June 12.The fallout is pulling families back from the UK, leaving them to rebuild amid grief, mounting costs and visa troubles. At least 10 families have already returned.Hiren's mother Kailashben had been talking to him constantly from the airport, asking strangers for help with immigration through the video call. ""She would create halarda (lullaby) for my son and sing them,"" he said. ""All these memories flood back every time I think about that day."" Hiren has moved to Surat with his wife Namrata and their three-year-old son Vaastu, abandoning seven years of life in London. Namrata, a former NHS employee, has opened a clinic.Hiren Dayani, a clinical research scientist, is searching for work. ""I was months away from Indefinite Leave to Remain,"" he says. ""But everything changed.""Mike Andrews, an aviation lawyer with Beasley Allen Law Firm in US, who represents over 130 affected families, met survivors in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat.He recounted how a family in Leicester lost its main earner and could no longer stay in Wembley. The widow and her three children - 17, 18 and 20 - moved to a cheaper neighbourhood. The children quit school to work.""There has been a fundamental shift in their life trajectory,"" Andrews said. ""We've met many who moved to the UK seeking opportunities but are now returning to India because they simply cannot afford to remain.""Among them is Mobbashera Vahora. Her husband Parvez and their four-year-old daughter Zuveriya died in the crash. Parvez held a full-time job with a major e-commerce company and worked part-time with multiple delivery platforms. He supported his parents in India while trying to secure a future for his young family in East London.Mobbashera was pregnant when the crash happened. Her baby is now five months old. ""We migrated for better prospects for our children,"" she said from her brother's home. ""We dreamed of building a life there, but all of that is lost now."" With UK immigration rules tightening, she sees no path back.For Harish Godhaniya from Devbhumi Dwarka, the decision was blunt. ""I have nobody there anymore,"" he said. He lost his wife Riddhi and three-year-old son Kriyansh. ""What would I do there? We emigrated with dreams of a better life. That day took my whole world."" He has not returned to work since coming home.The immigration struggle is sharpest for Mohammadmiya Mohammadasif Shethwala from Vadodara, who lost his wife Sadikabanu - the primary visa holder - and their daughter Fatima, who was born in the UK. Mohammadmiya works with a logistics firm in Britain, but he must secure qualifying employment by Jan 26 to remain legally.His friend Yusuf said: ""He came back for the last rites, but life in Vadodara was too painful. In the UK, at least he isn't confronted with memories constantly. But without a qualifying job by Jan, he'll have to return.""They are appealing at every forum. ""We have our fingers crossed,"" Yusuf added.Another family in Anand is battling a financial crunch. Their daughter - who held the primary visa - had taken a personal loan from a private bank two years earlier.After her death, they discovered the interest was still accruing. According to a member of the legal team, bank officials have assured a speedy resolution. One after another, stories across Gujarat trace the same arc - lives built slowly abroad collapsing overnight, savings gone, futures uncertain.It has been six months since the Ahmedabad-Gatwick flight carrying 242 people crashed - killing all 12 crew members and 229 of the 230 passengers. Nineteen more died on the ground. For their families, the worst is not behind them. They are still piecing together futures in a world where their most important hopes never made it off the runway.","At least 10 families have already returned to india after air india flight 171 crashed in june.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) launched the ""Trump Gold Card,"" offering legal status and an eventual pathway to United States citizenship for individuals and corporations willing to make large financial contributions.Announcing the rollout on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""The United States Government’s Trump Gold Card is here today! A direct path to citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. So exciting! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""A website accepting applications went live soon after, as Trump unveiled the program in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, joined by business leaders.Trump said the funds raised through the initiative would ""go to the US government,"" adding that the program could generate ""billions"" for the Treasury Department ""where we can do positive things for the country.""""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government.... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France... The companies will be very happy. The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even,"" he told reporters further talking about the initiative.The Trump Gold Card is a new US visa-residency programme that costs $1 million for individual applicants. The Trump Gold Card programme effectively provides a pathway to permanent legal residency, similar to a green card but, as Trump claims, ""with big advantages.""""It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States…"" Trump added.It is intended to replace the existing EB-5 investor visa programme, subject to vetting by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The card resembles a luxury credit card, featuring a gold background along with Donald Trump’s portrait, the Statue of Liberty, and the US flag, with ""Trump Gold Card"" embossed on the left.The Trump Corporate Gold Card allows companies to sponsor one or more foreign employees. Corporations must pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS fee per employee, and the programme requires a $2 million gift per sponsored employee after vetting is completed.Companies can apply for multiple employees simultaneously.A notable benefit of the corporate version is that companies may stop sponsoring one employee and use the same previously paid $2 million contribution to sponsor a new employee without paying another gift amount.""The Trump Corporate Gold Card is subject to a small, 1% annual maintenance fee and a 5% transfer fee, which includes the cost of a new DHS background check. Small additional fees to the US Department of State may also apply depending on each employee’s circumstances, the website noted.Individual applicants must make a one-time, non-refundable $1 million gift, whereas corporate sponsors pay $2 million per employee. Both require the same DHS processing fee of $15,000.Applicants must first pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS processing fee. Once the vetting process is complete, the required $1 million ""gift"" from an individual (or $2 million for a corporation per applicant) serves as proof that the applicant will ""substantially benefit the United States.""Additional small fees may be charged by the US Department of State depending on individual circumstances. Once an applicant’s processing fee is received, the process for petition approval and visa adjudication will take place on an expedited basis, assuming applicants submit any additional documents or fees in a timely manner.The $15,000 processing fee can be paid by credit card or ACH (US accounts only). The $1 million or $2 million contribution must be sent via ACH debit or SWIFT wire transfer after vetting.For Visa-related fees - The applicant will receive information directly from the US Department of State on how to submit the visa application fee and payments for the required medical examination.Like other American permanent residents and citizens, Trump Gold Card holders are required to pay US taxes, including on income earned outside the United States.Applicants must be eligible for lawful permanent resident status, admissible to the United States, and have a visa available under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories.Yes. Spouses and unmarried children under 21 can be included in the initial application. Each family member must pay an additional $15,000 DHS fee and a $1 million gift, with the same expedited processing benefits.""This will ensure that these family members receive all of the privileges conferred by the Gold Card Program, including expedited processing,"" the website said.Yes. Since the Trump Gold Card functions as a visa, it can be revoked on grounds of national security concerns or significant criminal activity.Here is the simplified step-by-step process, based on the details provided on the Gold Card website:The programme promises an expedited timeline, with processing expected to take a few weeks, provided applicants respond promptly to interview requests and document submissions, the website said.The upcoming Trump Platinum Card will allow individuals to live in the US for up to 270 days a year without paying US tax on non-US income, eliminating the need for additional travel visas.It is priced at $5 million, plus the $15,000 DHS fee, and has not yet been launched. A waitlist has opened, and applicants are being encouraged to secure their place early.The design for the Trump Platinum Card has not yet been revealed, but the website encourages users to join a waitlist, with applications processed on a first-come, first-served basis.The website warns that the $5 million Platinum Card contribution ""may not remain"" at the current price, leading many to join the waitlist early.""Foreign nationals can sign up now and secure their places on the waiting list for the Trump Platinum Card. When launched, and upon receipt of a $15,000 DHS processing fee and $5 million contribution, they will have the ability to spend up to 270 days in the United States without being subject to US taxes on non-US income,"" the website added.The Platinum Card cannot be obtained by anyone who has previously been subject to US tax on foreign income, such as ""US citizens or resident aliens,"" they said.The Trump Gold Card comes with several limitations that raise questions about its accessibility and long-term impact. Unlike the EB-5 system it replaces, the new programme has no job-creation requirement for investors or employers.Trump’s announcement also made no mention of annual caps, leaving uncertainty around oversight, scalability and how the scheme fits into broader US immigration policy.For businesses, the card does not guarantee lower costs. Each corporate card applies to only one employee, meaning expenses rise with every additional hire. Companies needing to retain multiple foreign-born graduates may end up paying millions.This makes the programme more suitable for wealthy individuals or well-funded corporations, offering little relief to smaller firms facing talent shortages.","The trump gold card is a new us visa-residency programme that costs $1 million for individual applicants.

'Warm And Engaging': PM Modi Holds Phone Call With Trump Amid Trade Talks, US-India Ties Discussed

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United States President Donald Trump held a telephone conversation on Thursday and reviewed the progress of the India–US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the steady strengthening of bilateral cooperation across a broad range of areas.According to an official statement, the two leaders discussed ways to sustain momentum in efforts to enhance bilateral trade.They also exchanged views on expanding cooperation in critical technologies, energy, defence and security, and other priority sectors linked to the implementation of the India–US COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce and Technology) for the 21st century. PM Modi and Trump also spoke about key regional and global developments. They agreed to work closely to address shared challenges and advance common interests in the evolving geopolitical landscape.Also Read: Goyal reacts to Trump admin’s ‘best ever’ offers view; says America should sign agreement The two leaders agreed to remain in touch as both sides continue to deepen the strategic partnership.The conversation between both leaders takes place days after Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in New Delhi for a high-stakes two-day summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.It was Putin's first state visit to India since the Ukraine war began in February 2022.During the Russian president's visit, a carpooling picture of PM Modi and Putin even found a place at the US Congress discussion on India-US ties.""This poster is worth a thousand words,"" said US representative Sydney Kamlager-Dove, pointing towards the image, as she went on to slam the Donald Trump administration's foreign policy towards India.""Trump's policies towards India can only be described as cutting our nose to spite our face... Being a coercive partner has a cost. And this poster is worth a thousand words,"" she said.""You do not get a Nobel Peace Prize by driving US strategic partners into the arms of our adversaries,"" Dove said in a pointed attack at Trump's demands for the peace prize for what he has repeatedly claimed for having stopped eight wars, including India and Pakistan.""We must move with incredible urgency to mitigate the damage that this administration has done to the US-India partnership and return to the cooperation that is essential to US prosperity, security, and global leadership,"" she added.These comments were delivered during the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia’s hearing on 'The US-India Strategic Partnership: Securing a Free and Open Indo-Pacific'.Trump has already slapped 50% tariffs on most Indian exports in August 2025 amid wider trade tensions and worries over India’s imports of Russian oil.A US trade delegation was in India on December 10–11 for discussions that have so far made little headway. The talks have been bogged down by disputes over market access and tariff policies, further straining the trade relationship.","Pm modi and u.s. president donald trump held a telephone conversation on thursday.

Mass visa chaos: H-1B families stranded in India for months after US consulates cancel interviews,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mass-visa-chaos-h-1b-families-stranded-in-india-for-months-after-us-consulates-cancel-interviews/articleshow/125910898.cms,"Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians

Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children — are stranded in India. In some cases, families have been separated with some members in the US and those in India facing an endless delay to fly back.The uproar is loud; the anguish is palpable across social-media posts and WhatsApp groups. Jobs may no longer exist, schools stand disrupted, children have been torn from their parents…As TOI reported in its edition of December 10, US consulates have cancelled interview slots scheduled for mid- to late-Dec 2025. Many appointments have been pushed to March next year, and some even as far back as June 2026. This sweeping disruption followed a new US Department of State (DoS) policy requiring mandatory social-media screening for all H-1B and H-4 applicants from Dec 15. The additional vetting has sharply reduced the number of interviews that can be conducted each day, triggering mass cancellations.The US Embassy in India posted on X: “If you have received an email advising that your visa appointment has been rescheduled, Mission India looks forward to assisting you on your new appointment date. Arriving on your previously scheduled appointment date will result in your being denied.”The responses reflect the crisis families are facing. One user pleaded: “Please consider those who traveled to India before the appointment changes. We are stuck here, facing serious challenges related to employment and our US-citizen kids' education. We humbly request earlier consular appointments.”Another wrote: “Booked my H-1B visa slot in Sept after weeks of trying. My Dec 18 appointment was suddenly moved to Mar 30, 2026. We must return to the US in early Jan and my US-citizen kids need to go back to school. Requesting urgent help.”Rajiv S. Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, describes the situation as “brutal chaos”. He notes that while applicants may reschedule online if they cannot attend the new date, they get only one such opportunity — and fee receipts older than a year are treated as expired.Immigration attorney Ellen Freeman warns that many H-1B workers will now lose their jobs. “We have to plead with employers to let them work from India or take prolonged leave of absence for as many as five months. In this economic environment and with deliverables pressure, many employers will not be able to wait.”She points out to the real-world fallout: “People left their apartment leases, utility bills, car payments in the US. These prolonged delays will have a devastating effect on our communities and economy. There are human stories behind each visa cancellation…”Rahul Reddy, founding partner at Reddy, Neumann, Brown, cautions against holiday travel for anyone who needs visa stamping. In his blog, he warns that travellers risk being stranded abroad for four to six months. “Employers cannot keep an H-1B role vacant for half a year. Many cannot legally allow remote work from outside the US due to export-control, payroll and tax restrictions. This means one thing: if an H-1B worker travels now, they may return not to their job but to unemployment. H-4 spouses and children will face the same delays, leading to extended separations and tremendous stress.”Calling the policy shift “poorly planned” and “poorly implemented”, he adds: “You cannot claim to support legal immigration while blindsiding H-1B families with six-month delays. Labeling this as ‘operational necessity’ does not change the truth: this process reflects a lack of preparation, transparency, and foresight. Enhanced vetting is fine but rolling it out in a way that effectively shuts down consular processing is reckless. Routine visa renewals should not turn into half-year exiles.”","Hundreds of indians on h-1b visas, along with their h-4 dependent spouses and children — are stranded in india.

Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians

NEW DELHI: The United States on Thursday clarified that its consular officers will reject tourist visa applications if they determine that the primary purpose of travel is to give birth in the country in order to secure US citizenship for the child.Officials said such travel is not permitted and will result in a visa denial.A State Department advisory notes that adjudicating officers are required to assess the applicant’s intent, and if they believe the visit is planned for childbirth to obtain citizenship, the visa cannot be granted.The rule is part of the US government’s broader policy to curb what it considers misuse of visitor visas for birth tourism.Earlier this year, US department of state said, ""“It is unacceptable for foreign parents to use a US tourist visa for the primary purpose of giving birth in the United States to obtain citizenship for the child, which also could result in American taxpayers paying the medical care costs.”“This is known as birth tourism and US consular officers deny all such visa applications under US immigration law. Those who abuse our immigration system through birth tourism may be ineligible for future visas or travel to the United States. This is one more way the US department of state is serving and protecting American taxpayers and communities,"" US department of state in a April, 2025 social media post added.(More details awaited)",The united states on thursday clarified that its consular officers will reject tourist visa applications if they determine that the primary purpose of travel is to give birth in the country.

Candace Owens reacted fast after Erika Kirk went on Fox News and asked people to stop searching for the secret place where her husband Charlie Kirk is buried.

Candace Owens said in her new clip, “Super fun show today. You’re probably seeing the clips … it’s about me. It’s indirect, but it’s also about me. And don’t worry, in case you think it’s not about me, she is going to name check me on stage.”This reaction came as many conspiracy theories continue to grow around Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on September 10 while giving a speech at Utah Valley University. His body’s location has never been shared. This has only made more people online push strange theories, something Erika Kirk finally addressed on TV.When Erika Kirk sat with host Harris Faulkner on Fox News, she looked tired and upset as she spoke about the rumors. Harris Faulkner asked her, “Talk to me about this part of the conspiracies that are out there.This disturbing part that people are trying to guess where Charlie is.”Erika Kirk answered with strong emotion:“Can I have one thing? Can I have one thing? Can my children have one thing? Everything was public. We will be building the most beautiful memorial for my husband at Turning Point USA… But can I have one thing? Can my babies have one thing where we hold it sacred?”She also said she feared someone might try to damage Charlie’s grave.“Where my husband is laid to rest, where I don’t have to be worried about some secular revolutionary coming and destroying my husband’s grave while my daughter is sitting there praying. One thing. This is my husband.”Soon after Charlie Kirk’s death, Erika Kirk received money from life insurance and public donations.While Erika Kirk asked for privacy, Candace Owens continued to question the official story of Charlie Kirk’s murder. Owens has pushed many unproven ideas, saying the killing was a “hit” and claiming she got secret “military” tips.Also Read: “Some Ignorant Black…”: Nick Fuentes Warns He Will Expose Candace Owens If TPUSA Livestream On Charlie Kirk Fails",Candace owens fires back hard as erika kirk asks the public to end charlie kirk conspiracy stories.

Benchmark indices traded in a range with corrective bias and is currently placed around 25,900 levels as domestic markets tracked the global risk-off tone, pressured by persistent FII selling, a softer rupee, and ongoing uncertainty around US–India trade talks. In the short term, market direction will hinge on central bank commentary and clarity on trade-related developments.In the near term, market trajectory is likely to be dictated by currency stabilization dynamics, especially whether the rupee can find a durable floor. Moreover, clarity on evolving India–US trade negotiations could influence sector-specific outlooks, particularly in export-linked and tariff-sensitive industries.Nifty has key support placed at 25,700–25,800, which aligns with the bullish gap from November 12, the 50-day EMA, and a key retracement zone of the prior uptrend. Sustaining this band will be crucial for continuing the positive momentum of the last 3 months.We expect the Nifty to consolidate in the range of 25,700–26,200. A clear breakout or breakdown will determine the next directional move.A close below the key support area of 25,700 will signal extension of the corrective decline towards the 100 days EMA placed around 25400 levels.On the higher side, a move above the recent swing high of 26,200 will signal extension of the rally towards 26,500 levels in the coming weeks.Bank Nifty traded in a range, digesting its recent strong gains. The index consolidated in a 700-points range oscillating in a positive and negative territory.We expect the index to extend consolidation and form a base in the range of 58500-60100 in the coming sessions.A follow-through strength above recent high 60,100 will open further upside towards 61,000 levels in the coming weeks.The entire up move of the last 2 months is well channelled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels. Key support is placed at 58,300-58,600 levels being the confluence of the last two weeks lows and recent breakout area. Holding above the support area will keep the short-term bias positive.Eternal has been in a corrective phase over the past two to three months and is now consolidating around a major demand zone. This technical setup points to a favorable risk-reward profile, suggesting the potential for a bullish reversal and a rebound from its current oversold levels.The current corrective phase seems to be losing momentum, with price action hinting at a possible rebound toward the ₹323 area in the coming months. This zone aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the entire drop from ₹368 to ₹280 and also matches the November 2025 high, strengthening its significance as a major resistance level.The stock is at the cusp of generating a breakout above a falling channel signaling resumption of up move thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock has already taken 6 weeks to retrace just 50% of its preceding 5 weeks rally (5636-6904). A shallow retracement signals a higher base formation and an overall positive structure.We expect the stock to head towards 6850 levels being the trendline resistance joining the highs of July and November 2025.","According to bajaj broking research, the top stocks to buy for december 12, 2025 are eternal and divi's laboratories.

Why the Sherrone Moore firing created the perfect storm for the Paige Shiver pregnancy rumor

What is confirmed about Paige Shiver and why her name is repeating in every Sherrone Moore conversation

Is Paige Shiver pregnant is the question sitting at the top of every search bar now that the Sherrone Moore story has turned into a full public meltdown. Michigan fired Sherrone Moore for cause, police detained him hours later, and the university confirmed only one concrete detail. There was an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. The school did not name the staffer. Law enforcement did not name the staffer. Yet Paige Shiver has been pushed into the center of the scandal by social media detectives who filled in the gaps with their own theories.The rumor grew even louder once Shiver deleted or hid her social media accounts. That timing alone was enough for people to assume something explosive had happened. None of the pregnancy claims have been confirmed by the university, law enforcement, or any official source. They remain unverified speculation attached to a real firing and a real police detention.Michigan cut Sherrone Moore with immediate effect after internal investigators said they found credible evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Athletic director Warde Manuel’s statement was clear and direct.“U M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately. Following a university investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of university policy, and U M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior,” he said.That was the official foundation. Everything after that came from outside the university.A few hours after his termination, officers in Saline, Michigan detained Sherrone Moore during a domestic incident at an apartment. The Pittsfield Township Police Department took over the investigation. ESPN’s Dan Wetzel reported the development on X, stating that authorities located and detained Moore for potential charges. Police have said the incident was not random. Reports from Michigan have also noted that Moore threatened to harm himself during the encounter. The investigation is ongoing and the exact charges remain unknown.The timing, the firing for cause, the police involvement, and the sudden vacuum around the unnamed staffer created an open space online. Users decided to choose their own protagonist. That is how the theory about Paige Shiver began.Shiver joined Michigan in 2022 in on campus recruiting and operations. She became the executive assistant to the head coach in 2024. That role places her physically and professionally close to the head coach at all times. Combine that proximity with the fact that the university did not release a name and you have a recipe for internet assignment.The rumor escalated when users noticed that she set her Instagram to private and deactivated her LinkedIn and X accounts. Marca reported that her Facebook page now shows only her profile and cover image. People interpreted the move as confirmation. In reality, any employee who becomes the target of unverified allegations often shuts down digital profiles to avoid harassment.The pregnancy claim grew out of posts from large commentary accounts on X that have no official sourcing. These accounts circulated messages, screenshots, and unverified claims that spread quickly. None of the claims about pregnancy appear in any official document, press release, police report, or university statement. They remain social media theories with no confirmation.Meanwhile, everything officially tied to the firing stays the same. The university confirmed an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. The staff member has not been identified. The rumor that the staff member is Paige Shiver and that she is pregnant is not supported by any confirmed evidence.Away from the sidelines and the pressure of Michigan football, Moore is simply a father of three. He and his wife, Kelli, share daughters Shiloh, Solei, and Sadie, who have long been described by people around the family as the center of his world. Moore rarely speaks publicly about them, but he has often hinted that they are the foundation of his life outside coaching.Social media has turned the Moore scandal into a frenzy, and one of the loudest claims is that Paige Shiver and Kelli Moore may have known each other beyond the workplace. Nothing has been confirmed, but the idea of his alleged mistress being friendly with his wife is adding a sharper edge to already wild pregnancy rumors and online speculation.The confirmed information about her is simple and factual. According to Larry Brown Sports and the Michigan athletics website, Shiver joined the Wolverines in 2022 and moved into the executive assistant position in 2024. She has worked in operations, recruitment support, and administrative planning. She is the daughter of longtime Chicago Bears scout Jeff Shiver. She is also a Purdue graduate who was profiled by the Bears in 2016 for her experience living with Pompe Disease.None of these details link her directly to the inappropriate relationship that resulted in Moore’s firing. None link her to the police detention. None confirm any pregnancy rumor.What is not confirmed is whether the staff member involved is Paige Shiver. What is not confirmed is whether she was pregnant. None of this appears in official records. None of it has been acknowledged by the university or the police.Per AP, Sherrone Moore is set to be arraigned Thursday afternoon, barely a day after he was fired for what the university called an inappropriate relationship with a staff member and later arrested just south of Michigan Stadium. Court records show he is still in the custody of the Washtenaw County Jail, which has not released details about the reason for his detention or his bond status.","Paige shiver’s name has been pulled into the sherrone moore scandal amid unverified pregnancy rumors.

Rising combined wealth and how their earnings continue to expand each year

Properties, assets and lifestyle choices that continue drawing attention

The growing interest around John Cena and Shay Shariatzadeh’s financial journey has intensified in 2025 as new reports highlight their rising net worth, expanding properties, and steadily increasing earnings, creating wider curiosity about how their individual careers continue shaping their shared financial path. Together, their lifestyle reflects a balance between high earnings, stable investments, and carefully chosen luxury, allowing them to maintain comfort without relying on constant public display or extravagant change. Let’s take a look at where the power couple stands in today's situation.Fresh evaluations for 2025 suggest that John Cena holds a personal net worth close to $80 million, supported by his long wrestling career, expanding Hollywood roles and multiple commercial partnerships that continue generating consistent income for him across different categories of the entertainment industry.Shay Shariatzadeh, on the other hand, contributes an estimated $2 million, which comes from her engineering work, strategic career moves, and selective investments that reflect a steady approach rather than a public lifestyle focused on expensive displays or high-profile spending choices.Together, their combined worth reaches nearly $82 million, showing how their financial paths complement one another through two very different professional worlds that still manage to work in harmony.Cena’s earnings remain anchored by an annual WWE salary reportedly around $8.5 million, supported by bonuses linked to special appearances and merchandise sales that continue performing strongly across global markets due to his long-standing popularity.John Cena’s well-known Florida property, purchased many years ago for roughly $525,000, has grown significantly in value and now sits near $4 million, featuring spacious interiors, multiple recreational spaces and design upgrades that reflect his preference for calm surroundings rather than extravagant display.The extravagent home includes an indoor pool, outdoor pool, cigar room, extended garage, and a guest area, allowing him a private retreat while balancing entertainment commitments and travel schedules across Hollywood and wrestling venues. Cena also owns a residence in San Diego valued within the high-end category, although he maintains a low-key approach toward detailing the property publicly, which matches the couple’s gradually shifting preference for privacy.Shay Shariatzadeh, while less public about real estate, aligns her lifestyle with practical investments and career growth, showing a contrast to Cena’s entertainment-driven earnings but still contributing meaningfully to their shared financial foundation through consistent professional progress.Also Read: John Cena to still be affiliated with WWE after retirement?

Her name is linked to former coach Sherrone Moore's firing and police detainment due to alleged inappropriate relationship rumors. Shiver's recent significant salary increase and social media silence have fueled speculation amid the ongoing investigation.

Paige Shiver’s rising salary, estimated net worth, and why the timing has fueled public curiosity

The University of Michigan football program is facing its most turbulent moment in years, and at the center of the storm is executive assistant Paige Shiver, an employee who until recently maintained a low public profile. Interest around Shiver has surged after her name became entangled in online speculation connected to the firing and police detainment of former head coach Sherrone Moore.While no university official has identified the staff member involved in the alleged inappropriate relationship, searches such as “Sherrone Moore assistant” and “who did Sherrone Moore have a relationship with” have driven Shiver into the national spotlight. Her sudden social media silence and a significant salary increase have added new layers to a story that continues to unfold.Public payroll filings show that Paige Shiver’s salary held steady at $58,025 for two years before climbing to $90,000 for the 2024–25 fiscal cycle, a 55.11% jump that many observers viewed as unusually steep for an executive assistant role. Based on her salary history, limited public records, and the absence of additional disclosed income streams, Shiver’s estimated net worth likely falls in the $150,000 to $200,000 range.As online rumors intensified, Shiver reportedly “switched her Instagram account to private,” a move that social media users interpreted as a sign of the pressure surrounding her. Yet there is no confirmed link between the pay hike and the university’s investigation, and officials have not named her in any formal capacity. Still, the scrutiny grew louder as Moore’s professional downfall accelerated.Sherrone Moore, who became a rising coaching star after stepping in during Jim Harbaugh’s suspension and later leading Michigan to major wins, was abruptly dismissed after allegations surfaced of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.His situation escalated further when “Ex-Michigan coach Sherrone Moore was detained by police in Saline, Mich. this evening and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township for investigation into potential charges,” according to ESPN’s Pete Thamel via Dan Wetzel.With Biff Poggi appointed interim head coach and speculation swirling around the future of the Wolverines’ program, Paige Shiver’s name remains tied to one of the most chaotic weeks in Michigan football history, even as the facts remain unsettled and the investigation ongoing.Also Read: Why Sherrone Moore ended up in police custody amid Michigan firing him for alleged ‘inappropriate relationship’ scandal",Paige shiver is an executive assistant at the university of michigan.

What Erika Kirk and Bari Weiss said to Candace Owens







Candace Owens is very upset after a new clip showed Erika Kirk speaking about her in an interview with Bari Weiss of CBS News. The clip talked about the conspiracy stories that spread after Charlie Kirk was fatally shot on September 10 at an event at Utah Valley University. After his death, Candace Owens shared many theories online. She spoke about the Israeli government, TPUSA leaders, and even the US military. But she did not show any proof for these claims. Because of this, many people questioned her posts. So when Erika Kirk spoke about these ideas in her interview, Owens did not like the comments.Candace Owens later said she was “in a bad mood” after watching the clip. She added, “Bari Weiss refers to me as a liar and Erika Kirk does not rebut.” Owens felt Erika Kirk stayed quiet when Weiss talked about the conspiracy theories.During the interview, Bari Weiss strongly questioned the false stories around Charlie Kirk’s killing. Weiss said, “She’s making a huge amount of money on it. She’s building her business off of these lies.” She said Candace Owens was using the theories to grow her platform.Erika Kirk then spoke directly to Owens with very simple words.She said, “Stop. That’s it. That’s all I have to say. Stop.”Her reply was short but very firm. She made it clear she did not want the theories to continue.This is not the first time Erika Kirk has spoken about these claims. In another talk, she said conspiracy stories were like a “mind virus.” Candace Owens believed this comment was aimed at her, and the tension between them grew even more. Since then, Owens has been answering Erika Kirk on her own show and reacting to almost every new comment.While their feud keeps growing, the case of Charlie Kirk’s death is still moving forward in court. Tyler Robinson, the man charged with the shooting, appeared in person in court today. Police say he is the one responsible for killing Kirk. The case remains open, and more updates are expected as the investigation continues.Also Read: “Meghan Markle Syndrome”: Candace Owens Challenges Erika Kirk’s Request To Hide Charlie Kirk’s Grave And Raises Fresh Questions","Candace owens is very upset after a new clip showed erika kirk speaking about her in an interview with bari weiss of cbs news.

Tim Pool, Candace Owens and Erika Kirk speak as conspiracy talk grows





A video of Tim Pool is going viral, and in this video, he says some people are too scared to speak about what Candace Owens told them about Charlie Kirk . Tim Pool says these people told him that Candace Owens said she “hated” Charlie Kirk before he was killed in September. Pool says he even has their names, but they are afraid to talk. He says, “These people are scared to speak out, because they fear that Candace will do things like put them on a thumbnail that says who benefited from Charlie Kirk’s death, like she did to me.”Tim Pool also says these people fear they will face hate, lies, and harassment online. He says, “They fear that they will get, people will start harassing them, make up lies about them, which is happening to us here at TimCast.” Pool even said they worry some “psychotic retard” follower of Owens might harm them.Tim Pool’s video has generated massive views, as many users reacted to his claims. Some agreed with him and said they also felt worried about the online fight around Charlie Kirk’s death.Candace Owens has talked many times about the case since Charlie Kirk was killed three months ago. She repeated different theories on her podcast, including talk about an underground tunnel and a problem with Kirk’s security.Owens also said she believes the killing was an “inside job” at TPUSA.On the other hand, Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s wife, asked the public to stop spreading theories. She said on Outnumbered, “My silence does not mean that somehow Turning Point USA and all of the handpicked staff that loved my husband… are somehow in on it. We are busy building.”Erika Kirk did not name Candace Owens, but Owens reacted and said the comment was “about me.” Owens said, “It’s indirect, but it’s also about me… she is going to name-check me on stage.”Erika Kirk also shared that her team has received kidnapping and death threats since Charlie was killed. Charlie Kirk was shot at Utah Valley University during his American Comeback Tour.

Candace Owens says Erika Kirk shared private moments before, so the new request feels confusing





The fight between Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, and her friend and former TPUSA director Candace Owens is getting stronger. It started again after Erika made one simple request during her interview with Harris Faulkner on Fox News’ Outnumbered on 10 December. She asked everyone to keep Charlie’s grave private. Erika said she did not want to “be worried about some secular revolutionary coming and destroying my husband’s grave.” This came as many people online were making strange claims about Charlie’s death and even asking where he was buried.Candace Owens later spoke about this on her podcast Candace. She said she understood Erika’s fear, but she also said she disagreed with how Erika wanted privacy only in this one part. Candace called it “Meghan Markle Syndrome,” saying, “You want privacy when you want it, but you want publicity whenever you want it, and that just doesn’t work.”After Charlie Kirk was killed in September, people began spreading rumors online. Some even claimed Charlie was still alive because no burial details were shared. Erika tried to stop these rumors by asking for privacy. But Candace Owens said Erika could not choose what to show and what to hide.Candace said, “I objectively agree with Erika because funerals are a very private matter. But I subjectively disagree because of what transpired following Charlie’s assassination.” She used a story from Bethenny Frankel on The Real Housewives of New York to explain that someone cannot show only the good parts of life and hide the bad parts later.Candace Owens also talked about Erika Kirk’s earlier video where she cried over Charlie’s body in the casket. Erika kissed his hands and said, “I love you,” many times. Candace called this “an incredibly personal and incredibly intimate moment,” but noted that Erika still shared it online. So Candace asked why the burial must now stay secret, saying, “It doesn’t work like that. You have to make a decision.”Candace Owens has also said on her podcast that TPUSA is hiding details about Charlie’s death, which has added more heat to the argument.Also Read: “It’s About Me”: Candace Owens Fires Back Hard As Erika Kirk Asks The Public To End Charlie Kirk Conspiracy Stories","Candace owens says erika kirk shared private moments before, so the new request feels confusing to her.

Jamie Dimon the CEO of America’s biggest banks JPMorgan and Chase has now warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation. This in turn is creating risks not only for the continent but also for the United States. As reported by Bloomberg, speaking at the Reagan National Defence Forum, Dimon said, “Europe has a real problem. They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”Along with this, Dimon has also cautioned that a fragmented Europe is one of the biggest challenges faced by the world. Earlier this year, in his annual shareholders letter, Dimon noted that Europe has “serious issues to fix.” While praising the creation of the euro and Europe’s pursuit of peace, Dimon warned that reduced military efforts and difficulties in reaching consensus within the European Union threaten the continent’s stability.“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore. It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important,” he said, urging Washington to adopt a long-term strategy to strengthen Europe.“A weak Europe is bad for us.”The comments made by Dimon clings with recent announcement made by JPMorgan to funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next decade — $500 billion more than previously planned.The initiative will mainly focus on supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience and also frontier and strategic technologies.Along with this, JPMorgan will also invest up to $10 billion of its own capital to enable combines expand and innovate in strategic manufacturing.Separately, Dimon commended President Trump’s efforts to cut government bureaucracy. “There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America. That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that,” he said.","Jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon has warned that slow bureaucracy of europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation.

Christmas To Decide Ukraine’s Fate? Trump’s New Deadline For Peace Deal Rattles Zelensky & EU Allies

US frustration grows as peace talks stall



Europe steps in as battlefield pressure rises







US President Donald Trump on Thursday delivered one of his strongest warnings yet about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, cautioning that the war’s current trajectory could push the world towards a catastrophic global confrontation. “Things like this end up in third world wars,” he said, urging an immediate halt to the fighting as he revealed that 25,000 people — “mostly soldiers” — were killed in the past month alone.Speaking at the White House after signing an Executive Order on artificial intelligence regulation, Trump said he was “working very hard” to stop the bloodshed and expressed deep frustration over the lack of progress in US-led negotiations. “I'd like to see the killing stop… I would love to see it stop,” he told reporters.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the President was “extremely frustrated with both sides of this war” and “sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting.” She confirmed that Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and his team were holding discussions with Ukrainian and Russian officials “literally as we speak,” but added that it remained “up in the air” whether the US would send a representative to talks scheduled for this weekend.Trump, who once claimed he could resolve the war “in a day,” has become increasingly vocal about his impatience. “He doesn’t want any more talk. He wants action. He wants this war to come to an end,” Leavitt said.Ukraine has put forward a 20-point plan detailing settlement terms, including separate documents on security guarantees. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv was grateful for Washington’s engagement but warned that territorial questions — such as control of the Donetsk region and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant — remain far from resolved. Any concessions, he insisted, would require approval by national referendum.Ukrainian officials say the US has suggested a “free economic zone” in parts of the Donbas, while Russia frames the idea as a “demilitarised zone.” Kyiv is resisting any arrangement that would cement Russian influence. Zelenskyy said compromises under discussion included Ukrainian forces withdrawing from Donetsk on the condition Russian forces do not enter — but stressed that any pullback would require equal withdrawals by Russia.European leaders are scrambling to shape the negotiations amid concerns that Trump’s push for a rapid settlement could leave Ukraine at a disadvantage. Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France’s President Emmanuel Macron have proposed finalising peace proposals with the US over the weekend, warning that the talks are now at “a critical moment.”Russia, meanwhile, is attempting to show it is responsive to Trump’s peace efforts, submitting new “collective security” proposals to Washington. On the battlefield, President Vladimir Putin claimed Russian forces were “fully holding the strategic initiative” and had captured the city of Siversk — a claim Ukraine denies.Ukraine also struck back with long-range drones, hitting a Russian oil rig in the Caspian Sea and forcing Moscow’s airports to halt flights for several hours.","Us president donald trump delivered one of his strongest warnings yet about the russia-ukraine conflict.
