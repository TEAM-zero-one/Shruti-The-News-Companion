NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday severely criticised a Christian lieutenant for putting his own understanding of his faith over and above the religious sentiments of soldiers he was leading, and endorsed the Army brass's decision to sack him.""I have participated in all religious celebrations like Holi, Diwali and Lori. But I cannot be forced to offer flowers or hold 'thali' inside a gurdwara as that is a religious ritual which my religion does not permit me to perform.

""You must respect the faith of majority of the troops under your command... He may be an outstanding officer, but unfit to be in the secular and highly disciplined Army,"" it said.Appearing for Lt Samuel Kamalesan, senior advocate G Sankaranarayanan challenged the validity of the sacking order on the ground that it violated his fundamental right to practise and profess a particular religion guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution.The bench, after perusing records, said to dispel his dogmatic views, Army authorities had taken the lieutenant to a renowned pastor in Chandigarh who advised him that going inside the sanctum sanctorum of a 'sarv dharma sthal' would not violate his religious rights.""Despite that you remained obstinate and refused to go into the gurdwara where your troops were praying. This demonstrates your mindset and your religious ego. You do not follow the advice of the pastor. You admit that your fellow Christian officers in the Army told you to be part of the religious rituals of the troops. But you stuck to your own interpretation and understanding of Christianity and refused to offer flowers at gurdwara,"" the bench said. ""You cannot bring in your own private understanding of religion to hurt the sentiments of your troops.""Sankaranarayanan said there was no 'sarv dharma sthal' where he was posted, only a gurudwara and a temple.As the bench said the lieutenant was unfit to be in the secular Army, the counsel replied, ""It is not a secular Army as it has caste-based regiments"".The bench said it will not get into a debate on the Army. ""The lieutenant is guilty of not respecting the sentiments of his troops and defying the orders of the superiors,"" it said.When the counsel said it will send a wrong signal, the bench said, ""Let us send a correct and strong signal.""

Udaipur’s High-Profile Wedding

UDAIPUR: All eyes were on Donald Trump Jr as he arrived in Udaipur for a high-profile wedding, but the families hosting the lavish celebrations are far from ordinary. At the centre of the glittering weekend is Rama Raju Mantena, an Andhra-origin US entrepreneur, whose daughter, Netra Mantena, married Vamsi Gadiraju on Sunday at the historic Jag Mandir Island Palace.Rama Raju Mantena — known to many as Raj — traces his roots to Vijayawada. A pharmacy graduate, he moved to the United States in 1984 and went on to build a remarkable entrepreneurial journey.Over the decades, he founded seven companies in the pharmacy and IT sectors, steadily creating value and selling these ventures after unlocking their true potential.His latest enterprise, Integra Connect, focuses on value-based, precision medicine and leads in real-world data, analytics, and AI capabilities for speciality care organisations.Rama Raju’s business instinct and success in the US have earned him the reputation of a powerful industry figure. He is also the nephew of Gokaraju Gangaraju, former BJP MP and entrepreneur.The celebrations began Friday with performances by Kriti, Madhuri, and Shahid, followed by high-voltage shows on Saturday featuring Jennifer Lopez, who flew in on a chartered flight from Ireland, and Justin Bieber.A grand reception is scheduled for November 24.The groom, Vamsi Gadiraju, a Columbia University alumnus and co-founder of the New York-based tech firm Superorder, also has Telugu roots and featured on Forbes’ Under 30 list. Netra, meanwhile, completed her undergraduate studies in pharmacology and works in New York.Trump Jr.’s visit has drawn international attention. After arriving with his girlfriend, he toured the Udaipur City Palace with Rama Raju and met Lakshyaraj Singh Mewar.The meeting reflected deep cultural traditions, with discussions on Mewar’s history. Singh presented symbolic emblems, which Trump Jr described as “special and memorable,” expressing admiration for Maharana Kumbha, Maharana Sanga, and Maharana Pratap.The lavish celebrations, the international guest list, and the layers of security have all drawn attention — but at the heart of it lies the story of Rama Raju Mantena, the Vijayawada-born entrepreneur whose American dream has led to one of Udaipur’s most talked-about weddings.","Rama raju mantena, an andhra-origin us entrepreneur, married vamsi gadiraju on sunday at the historic jag mandir island palace.

Ash Cloud From Ethiopia Hits India’s Airspace At High Speed, DGCA Issues Urgent Safety Advisory

Ethiopia’s ash cloud heads toward India

Here's the top 10 things to know:

DGCA issued an advisory on Monday asking airlines and airports to prepare for possible disruptions from the volcanic ash plume drifting from Ethiopia.

According to IndiaMetSky Weather the ash cloud entered Gujarat Monday evening before moving towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab. The service stated: ""Ash cloud is about to enter Gujarat (West side) and move towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab by 10 pm, and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions.""

The plume is travelling 100–120 km/h at altitudes between 15,000 and 45,000 feet, carrying ash, sulphur dioxide and microscopic glass and rock particles.

Akasa Air, IndiGo and KLM have cancelled flights, with routes to the Middle East and Europe particularly affected. Akasa Air said: ""Following recent volcanic activity in Ethiopia and the resulting ash plume in the surrounding airspace, our flights to and from Jeddah, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi scheduled for 24th and 25th November 2025 have been cancelled.""

DGCA instructed airlines to avoid ash-affected airspace, revise flight planning and immediately report any suspected ash encounter, including engine anomalies or cabin smoke/odour.

Airports have been told to inspect runways, taxiways and aprons and restrict operations until cleaning is completed if ash contamination is detected.

Mumbai airport warned passengers: ""A volcanic eruption in Ethiopia has affected airspace over parts of West Asia, which may impact some international routes.""

Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.

The explosive eruption, which began around 8:30 am UTC [1.30 pm IST] on Sunday, marks the first activity from the nearly 10,000-year-dormant volcano.

After the eruption, volcanic ash activity has been reported over parts of the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in airlines issuing cautionary notices for passengers flying through the Middle East, though no advisories have mentioned ash drift toward India.

NEW DELHI: Airline operations across parts of the country faced disruptions after volcanic ash from Ethiopia’s Hayli Gubbi eruption drifted toward western and northern regions, prompting the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday to issue a detailed advisory.The ash plume, travelling at high altitudes and significant speed, entered Gujarat and moved eastward through Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.With the cloud containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and fine glass particles, airlines have begun cancelling and diverting flights to avoid the dangerous plume.Airports have also been asked to remain vigilant and inspect surfaces for ash contamination that could affect aircraft engines and airfield operations.Multiple carriers, including IndiGo, Akasa Air, and KLM, have already modified schedules, while authorities continue monitoring the cloud’s trajectory. Disruptions are expected to evolve as the plume moves across northern India.IndiGo's Kannur-Abu Dhabi flight (6E 1433) diverted to Ahmedabad on Monday to avoid the affected corridor, while another Indian carrier operating into Abu Dhabi conducted extensive engine checks before beginning its return journey, reported news agency ANI.","Ash cloud from ethiopia's volcano expected to reach north india by 10 pm.

NEW DLEHI: China on Tuesday denied allegations that an Indian woman from Arunachal Pradesh was harassed or detained at Shanghai airport, insisting that its border checks were conducted strictly “in accordance with laws and regulations. ” The statement came even as India lodged a strong diplomatic protest.The woman, Pema Wangjom Thongdok, a UK-based Indian passport holder, was travelling from London to Japan on November 21 when immigration officials reportedly flagged her passport as “invalid” because it listed Arunachal Pradesh as her birthplace.She later wrote on social media that she was held for around 18 hours, until officials at the Indian Consulate in Shanghai intervened.Responding to PTI’s query on the incident, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the woman was not subjected to any coercive action.“During the entire time, China’s border inspection authorities carried out checks procedures in accordance with laws and regulations… no compulsory measures were taken on her, and there was no so-called ‘detaining’ or ‘harassing’,” Mao said, adding that the airline had provided “resting facilities and meals.”Mao also said Beijing’s position on the state, saying, “Zangnan is China’s territory, and China does not recognise the so-called Arunachal Pradesh illegally established by India.”Citing sources agencies said, a demarche was issued to China in New Delhi and Beijing on the day of the incident, asserting that Arunachal Pradesh is an “indisputable” part of India and residents are entitled to travel on Indian passports. The Indian Consulate in Shanghai “extended the fullest assistance” to the passenger, officials added.Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu said he was “deeply shocked” and called the episode a “violation of international norms and an affront to the dignity of Indian citizens.”The Congress party, reacting sharply to Mao’s remarks, accused Beijing of making an “offensive” statement and urged the government to respond firmly.In a post on X, the party said China’s comments were “extremely objectionable” and “a blatant attack on India’s integrity,” adding that “India will not tolerate such low-level rhetoric.”(With inputs from agencies)","China denies allegations that an indian woman from arunachal pradesh was harassed or detained at shanghai airport.

NEW DELHI: An ash cloud from Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi volcano hit parts of India Monday evening, according to IndiaMetSky Weather. The plumes first entered Gujarat from the west and then moved rapidly toward Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab by around 10 pm, and is drifting towards the Himalayas and other northern regions.Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.The ash plume is travelling at altitudes between 15,000-25,000 feet, rising up to 45,000 feet in some layers, and carries volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide, and tiny particles of glass and rock.IndiaMetSky Weather warned that skies could appear ""darker and hazier than usual"" and said that the plume may disrupt air traffic and lead to ""delays and longer travel.""The Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) said the explosive eruption began around 8:30 am GMT on Sunday, marking the first activity from the almost 10,000-year-dormant Hayli Gubbi volcano.Thick columns of ash rose up to 14 kilometres into the sky from the Afar region, located around 800 km northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border.The VAAC confirmed that while the eruption had stopped, ""a large ash plume is moving toward northern India.""The volcano sits within the geologically active Rift Valley, where two tectonic plates meet. After erupting, the ash swept across the Red Sea toward Yemen and Oman before drifting eastwards into India and northern Pakistan, according to VAAC and regional media outlets.The windborne ash cloud swept across vast stretches of northwest India on Monday night, passing over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi-NCR and Punjab. Visibility dipped in several pockets as the plume drifted eastward.IndiaMetSky Weather said, ""Ash clouds moving towards North India. A large ash plume can be seen stretching from #HayliGubbi Volcano region upto #Gujarat. The eruption has stopped ever since the eruption, but this Ash plume has been sent up into the atmosphere, which is moving at a speed of 100-120km/h toward North India.”It added that the plume, containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and ""small particles of glass/rock,"" would likely darken the skies and impact flight routes. ""The Ash cloud is about to enter #Gujarat (West side) and move towards #Rajasthan NW #Maharashtra, #Delhi, #Haryana and #Punjab by 10 pm and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions,"" the agency said.By late night, the sulphur dioxide–rich plume was already moving over Delhi, NCR, Haryana and adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh.

The top court said his conduct amounted to ""gross indiscipline. ""A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi went on to describe him as an ""absolute misfit"" for the Army.The soldier had been removed from service earlier because he did not follow the order to enter the temple and gurdwara with his unit.

He then approached the Supreme Court.The Delhi high court had earlier said that the soldier placed his personal religious beliefs above the lawful command of his superiors.The soldier's lawyer, Senior Advocate Gopal Sankarnarayanan, argued that his client simply refused to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the temple and gurdwara because his Christian faith does not allow him to participate in such religious rituals. He also said the soldier had a clean service record for six years and only avoided activities that went against his conscience.However, the Supreme Court was not convinced. The judges said the Army carries a huge responsibility, and discipline must be maintained. They noted that by refusing to join the religious activities of his regiment, the soldier insulted the troops he was leading. As a commander, he should have led by example.In the end, the Supreme Court rejected his appeal and confirmed his termination from the Army.","The top court said his conduct amounted to ""gross indiscipline"" a bench of justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi went on to describe him as an ""absolute misfit"" for the army.

‘Strong demarche was made with the Chinese side’



NEW DELHI: An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.Prema Wangjom Thongdok, said she is an Indian citizen living in the UK for about 14 years. The ordeal occurred while she was traveling from London’s Gatwick to Japan via a transit in Shanghai.Describing her harrowing experience she told ANI, “I had basically crossed e-gates, standing in the queue for my next flight, and then one of the officials from the Chinese immigration came over and singled me out of the queue. I asked her what was happening, she didn’t say much, just asked me to follow her. And she went on to say, 'Arunachal- not India, China-China, your visa is not acceptable. Your passport is invalid. 'She further went on to narrate the alleged misbehavior of the officials at the airport, accusing them of “mocking” and “laughing” at her.“When I tried to question them, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing, saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian.’”She added that she had transited through Shanghai previously without issue and described the experience as humiliating, with airport and airline staff allegedly laughing and pointing at her passport.Thongdok also claimed that she had already consulted the Chinese embassy in London regarding the transit and she was assured that no visa would be required for a layover.Thongdok claimed she couldn't reach out for any help from anyone as there were wifi issues and social platforms like Google and Whatsapp don’t work in the country.She was eventually assisted by Indian embassy officials from Shanghai and Beijing, who helped resolve the issue and provided support during the prolonged wait. She said she was finally able to leave the airport around 10:30PM.Thongdok went on to add, , ""... We are part of India... We speak 'shuddh Hindi', we don't understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian... I want to raise this awareness that residents of the northeast of India should not face such harassment in terms of being called and being told that you are not a part of the country that you're so proudly a citizen of. I would like the government of India to raise this on a diplomatic level with the Chinese authorities. This is not something a regular citizen can resolve. I would just like to request the government of India to take strict action against the Chinese authorities and the government on such matters...""She further told ANI, after her return she reached out to the higher up authorities in the country, writing to them via mails, requesting such incident not be repeated.I wrote an email to the ministry of external affairs, PMO, CM of Arunachal Pradesh, foreign secretary, that such an incident shouldn't happen to someone who is just a normal citizen…”Thongdok referred to the incident as a possible hassle tactic used by Chinese officials to harass Indian citizens, especially as it was the weekend so there would be less chance of an official intervention, as government offices are closed.“Just to be harassed for so many hours, I think it might be quite a tactic used by the Chinese government to hassle citizens of India, especially from Arunachal Pradesh... I'm just grateful to the team from the Indian embassy who helped me get out of there finally.”Before the interview with ANI she had posted about her order on X, tagging government authorities including Union minister Kiran Rijiju who himself hails from Arunachal Pradesh, and PMO office, highlighting the extended detention and questioning of her citizenship based on her birthplace.Thongdok wrote, “ @pemakhandu @kirenrijuju @PMOIndia I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hrs on 21st Nov, 2025 on claims by China immigration & @chinaeasternair They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh which they claimed is Chinese territory.”ANI citing sources claimed, a “strong demarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place. Our Consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended fullest assistance to the stranded passenger.”It was asserted Arunachal Pradesh is an ‘indisputably Indian territory,’ calling the reason for detention as ‘ludicrous.’“It was stressed that the passenger had been detained on ludicrous grounds. Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports. ⁠It has also been highlighted that the actions of the Chinese authorities are in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation.”The actions were termed “ unnecessary obstructions” to restoring normalcy in the bilateral ties between the two sides.“At a time when both sides are working on restoring normalcy, such actions by the Chinese side introduce unnecessary obstructions to the process.”",'they said arunachal is china': indian woman alleges harassment after passport rejection in shanghai airport.

'Objective Is To Destroy The Enemy': Op Sindoor Echoes As Indian Army Vows Stronger Response to Pak

NEW DELHI: The Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ) on Tuesday honoured 19 of its personnel for having displayed “exemplary courage and composure” in the face of heavy shelling and firing from Pakistan during Operation Sindoor , to keep critical national assets along the Indo-Pakistan border as well as residents of the surrounding townships, from harm.CISF director general Praveer Ranjan conferred the coveted ‘DG’s Disc’ on the 19 CISF personnel in recognition of “their pivotal role in safeguarding the Uri hydro-electric power projects (UHEB I and II) in Jammu & Kashmir during a critical phase of cross-border hostilities in May 2025”.

The Pakistan Army hit back with indiscriminate shelling on Indian military facilities and civilian settlements along the border, endangering vital infrastructure including the Uri hydro-power projects.“Despite heavy enemy fire and severe risk to their own lives, CISF teams led by Commandant Ravi Yadav and supported by deputy commandant Manohar Singh and assistant commandant Subash Kumar, swiftly initiated protective measures to shield the installations and the surrounding townships.They carried out real-time analysis of incoming shell trajectories, identified safe zones and organised the relocation of residents to bunker shelters,” CISF said in a statement.CISF personnel undertook door-to-door evacuation of around 250 civilians — including women, children, NHPC staff and their families — in the shelling-hit areas. Even as rounds landed dangerously close to the premises, the personnel continued to reinforce bunkers, maintain communication lines through POLNET and satellite systems, and provided emergency assistance.CISF troops also neutralised hostile drones targeting the installations and secured armoury stockpiles by swiftly redistributing weapons to prevent potential destruction. “Throughout the crisis, the integrity of critical national assets remained intact,” said a CISF spokesperson.CISF DG on Tuesday said the force personnel had “upheld the highest traditions of the force, displaying rare courage under fire and unwavering commitment to national security”.","Cisf director general praveer ranjan conferred the coveted ‘dg’s disc’ on the 19 cisf personnel.

DEHRADUN: In a significant show of combat readiness, Indian Army 's Western Command carried out a month-long integrated ground and air drill involving over 20,000 personnel, simulating offensive operations across the Pakistan border in Punjab.The exercise, which was first of its kind held in Uttarakhand by the Army, concluded near Haridwar on Saturday and was held in terrain mimicking the riverside plains of Punjab.The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command. Though the location operationally falls under Central Command, army officials said it was chosen due to geographical similarities with the Punjab sector. The exercise included fighter jets, reconnaissance aircraft, Apache attack helicopters, amphibious armoured vehicles, tanks, drone-based surveillance, and night-time paratrooper deployment.General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command, Lieutenant General Manoj Kumar Katiyar, who inspected and validated the final phase of the drill, said it focused on rehearsing responses to major provocations by Pakistan.""In the recent Operation Sindoor, we delivered a robust response, which resulted in extensive damage to Pakistani forces. But we doubt whether it has learnt any lesson. If there is another mischief by it, we are prepared to respond with far greater force, including entering Pakistan from Punjab,"" he said. He added that the location was selected as it allowed simulation of riverine obstacles similar to those found in Punjab. ""We conduct exercises in operational areas under other commands too to ensure readiness,"" he said.A senior Army officer involved in the exercise told TOI, requesting anonymity, that the drill tested operational agility, multi-domain capabilities and real-time coordination across land, air and cyber domains.Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retired), former deputy director general of military operations during the Kargil war, told TOI the drill was vital to test preparedness for the Punjab sector.""Pakistan has constructed numerous canals in Punjab to act as barriers against our armoured and mechanised units.

""None of us is a permanent member of UN Security Council. This clearly demonstrates that global institutions no longer represent today's world. Therefore, IBSA must send a unified message to the world: institutional reform is not an option but imperative,"" he said.""Similarly, we must work in close coordination in the fight against terrorism. On an issue of such gravity, there can be no room for double standards. For the sake of global peace and prosperity, united and decisive action is essential,"" he added, calling for institutionalising the NSA-level meeting of the countries to strengthen security cooperation.Describing the meeting as timely, PM Modi noted it coincided with the first G20 summit on African soil and marked the culmination of four consecutive G20 presidencies by Global South countries, of which the last three were by IBSA members. This, he said, had resulted in several important initiatives focused on human-centric development, multilateral reform and sustainable growth.

NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Namansh Syal of the Indian Air Force was honoured with a ‘Missing Man’ manoeuvre by the Russian Knights aerobatics team after he was killed in a Tejas fighter jet crash at the Dubai Air Show on Friday.After the crash of the Indian Tejas fighter jet, the Russian Knights released a video of their performance at the Dubai Airshow 2025, paying tribute to the pilot and honouring the lives lost.In the video, shared on Russian social media platform VK, the team described the crash as “impossible to describe” and said their final-day performance was dedicated to the “memory of the brothers who did not return from the last flight”.At the air show, members of the US F-16 team also reacted strongly to the tragedy. Their pilot, Captain Taylor Hiester, said he was shocked that the event continued despite the fatal accident. The US team, along with a few others, chose to cancel their performance out of respect for the Indian pilot, his colleagues and his family.“After two years of doing this job, that was a first for our team and it came just before our final performance of the season.Together and individually, we all quietly watched the aftermath unfold from a distance thinking about the Indian maintenance crew standing on the ramp next to an empty parking spot, aircraft ladder laid on the ground, the pilot's belongings still in his rental car,” Hiester wrote as he headed back to the US.The Tejas aircraft was in the middle of an eight-minute aerobatic display when it suddenly lost altitude during what appeared to be a low-level manoeuvre. Visuals aired across several channels showed the jet diving toward the ground before erupting into flames, sending thick black smoke over Al Maktoum International Airport. Spectators, including families with children, watched in shock as emergency teams rushed to the scene.","Wing commander namansh syal of the indian air force was honoured with a ‘missing man’ manoeuvre by the russian knights aerobatics team.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that Sindh, which went to Pakistan during Partition, could ""return to India again someday,"" stressing the region's deep civilisational ties with the country.Speaking at an event, he said, “Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again.”The minister referred to the Sindh province along the Indus River, noting that many Sindhi families migrated to India after 1947. Citing former deputy PM and BJP stalwart LK Advani, he said Sindhi Hindus of that generation had never fully reconciled with the separation.“Lal Krishna Advani wrote in one of his books that Sindhi Hindus, especially those of his generation, still haven't accepted the separation of Sindh from India,” Singh said.He cited Advani to underline that the Indus River’s importance goes far beyond geography. “Not just in Sindh, but throughout India, Hindus consider the Indus River sacred. Many Muslims in Sindh also believed that the water of the Indus was no less sacred than the Aab-e-Zamzam of Mecca.This is Advani ji's quote.”Reiterating the emotional link, Singh said, “Our people of Sindh, who hold the Indus River sacred, will always be our own. No matter where they are, they will always be ours.”Also read: French navy slams Pakistan media over misinformation on Operation Sindoor; calls Rafale claims fabricated Singh also recalled his efforts to provide proper citizenship via law to various immigrant Sindhi families after his visit to the community in Delhi back in 2019, describing their living conditions as ""distressing.""

I personally went to see them. After returning, I decided that we would enact whatever laws were necessary to grant them proper citizenship. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi and apprised him that I was moving forward in this direction. The bill was prepared, I introduced it in the Lok Sabha, and it was passed there. But it was the final phase of 2019, only a few months were left, and we did not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. I spoke to several opposition leaders, but they refused to support it. I said that if it didn’t pass that year, it would certainly be passed the next year. Later, when Amit Shah became the Home Minister, I spoke to him, and he took the work forward,"" he added.Earlier in September while interacting with the Indian community in Morocco, Singh had expressed confidence that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) would integrate with India “without aggressive steps”.“PoK will be ours on its own. Demands have started being made in PoK, you must have heard sloganeering,” he had said then.","Defence minister rajnath singh said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that sindh, which went to pakistan during partition, could ""return to india again someday"" citing former deputy pm and bjp stalwart lk advani, he said sindhi hindus of that generation had never fully reconciled with the separation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125521493,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-609930,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
