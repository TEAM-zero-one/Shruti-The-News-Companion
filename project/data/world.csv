"Avoid travel outside US, immigration attorneys tell H-1B, F-1 visa holders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/avoid-travel-outside-us-immigration-attorneys-tell-h-1b-f-1-visa-holders/articleshow/119135563.cms,"'Visa holders must've contingency plans'

Be it H-1B visa holders and their kin, or international students, or even green card holders, US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas. India is not on the proposed travel ban list by the US, but still the fear remains.On Monday, TOI reported on similar advice being given to Green Card holders. The reasons range from delays in stamping at US consulates in home country, extreme vetting and cases of secondary inspection, including detention at US airports on return.Kripa Upadhyay, an immigration attorney in Seattle, said, ""This sounds heartless but foreigners (especially those needing to renew H-1B or F-1 visas) must think twice about leaving US right now.""The US department of state has updated eligibility requirements for interview waiver appointments (referred to as dropbox appointments). Earlier, applicants could qualify for interview waiver if they had been issued a non-immigrant visa in any category (except B visitor visas) and were applying within 48 months of expiration. Under revised rules, dropbox is available only to applicants renewing a visa in the same non-immigrant category that has expired within past 12 months. Thus, if you are an international student with an F-1 visa and now need an H-1B you must wait for an interview slot. If you have an H-1B and need an extension, but your earlier visa was issued more than 12 months ago, you must also wait for an interview slot, Upadhyay said.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, said, ""Delays due to visa appointment availability is only part of the concern. We know of individuals stuck in administrative processing for no apparent reason other than additional scrutiny and security clearances. This should not have happened if the individual had been previously approved for a visa multiple times. I think we can expect to see 'extreme vetting' similar to the tenure of the earlier Trump administration.""Also read: Fearing deportation, a Cornell university grad student files a pre-emptive lawsuit If US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved an H-1B, the consular officer has the right to refuse the visa and send the application back to USCIS for re-adjudication. Upadhyay added, ""In a situation like this, employees outside the country would be stuck for several monthsbefore they can return to the US."" Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, said, ""If travel is unavoidable, visa applicants and their employers should also try to have contingency plans in case of delayed stamping such as continuing work from their home country.""","Us immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas.

He explained that despite India's acceptance of partition, Pakistan did not choose peaceful coexistence.""After getting their own way, we expected them to live and let live, and yet, they chose not to foster a harmonious coexistence. Time and again, they decided to be at odds with India. They have waged a proxy war against us,"" PM Modi said in the podcast.He accused Pakistan of exporting terror, saying that India is not its only victim — terrorist activities linked to Pakistan have impacted the entire world.""Wherever terror strikes in the world, the trail somehow leads to Pakistan.

He also mentioned that the people of Pakistan themselves long for peace, as they have suffered from years of internal unrest and terrorist violence.Reacting to PM Modi's remarks, Islamabad raked up the Kashmir issue and called it an ""unresolved dispute"".“The remarks are misleading and one-sided.

NEW DELHI: India and China should be partners contributing to each other's success and a cooperative ""pas de deux"" between the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for the two countries, Beijing said while welcoming PM Modi's ""positive"" remarks in a podcast in which he had endorsed signs of a rapprochement in ties since Oct last year.In the interaction with Lex Fridman, Modi had also strongly backed Donald Trump's policies and the US president even shared the podcast on his social media platform, Truth Social.Modi had said on Sunday that the border situation with China was normalising since his meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan in Oct and trust would return in the relationship ""slowly but surely"". Seeking a cooperative relationship, he also said it was natural for India and China to have differences, and the focus should be on ensuring that these don't turn into disputes.Building upon PM Modi's remarks, the Chinese foreign ministry said that Sino-Indian ties were characterised by mutual learning and friendly exchanges for over 2,000 years."" China appreciated PM Modi's recent positive statements. The successful meeting between President Xi and PM Modi in Kazan last Oct provided strategic guidance for the improvement and development of bilateral ties. Both sides have earnestly followed through on the important common understandings of our leaders, strengthened exchanges and practical cooperation at all levels, and achieved a series of positive outcomes,"" a ministry spokesperson said, responding to a question at a media briefing.The official added China stood ready to work with India to implement the understandings that both leaders had reached in their meeting.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday has acknowledged that his initial criticism of India’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face."" Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi, Tharoor admitted that India's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace and has a Prime Minister ""who can hug both the president of Ukraine and the president in Moscow"".Tharoor, who had previously called for India to condemn Russia’s aggression, said during a session, ""I am still wiping the egg off my face because I was one of the few in Parliament who criticised India’s position in February 2022.""The Thiruvananthapuram MP explained that his criticism was based on the violation of the UN Charter and Ukraine’s sovereignty. However, three years later, he now recognises that India’s balanced approach has allowed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to engage with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky within weeks of each other.""All of those principles had been violated by one party and we should have condemned it. Well, three years later it does look like I am the one with the egg on my face because clearly the policy has meant that India has actually a prime minister who can hug both the president of Ukraine (Zelenskyy) and the president in Moscow (Putin) two weeks apart and be accepted in both places,"" he said according to news agency PTI.With the caveat that he was speaking in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the government as he is in the opposition, Tharoor suggested that India might be open to sending peacekeepers if there was an agreed peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine.He noted that Russia has ruled out NATO peacekeepers, making non-European forces more viable. ""As an Indian parliamentarian, I don’t think there would be strong resistance to the idea,"" he said, citing India's extensive history in peacekeeping missions.Tharoor recalled how, in 2003, India’s Parliament firmly rejected sending troops to Iraq after the US-led invasion. However, he stated, “I don’t see that happening for Ukraine.”India has participated in over 49 UN peacekeeping missions, reinforcing its long-standing commitment to global stability.","Congress leader shashi tharoor has acknowledged that his initial criticism of india’s stance on the russia-ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face"" he said india's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace and has a prime minister who can hug both the president of ukraine and the president in moscow.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119167587,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1121210,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday asked the Netherlands to not provide arms, weapon systems, platforms and military technologies to Pakistan, which has sponsored cross-border terrorism for decades, in a meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Ruben Brekelmans.In the delegation-level meet, India and the Netherlands decided to elevate their bilateral ties in areas like defence, security, information exchanges, maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, and new and emerging technologies like AI and drones .The clear takeaway, however, was Singh telling Brekelmans that “equipping” Pakistan with defence equipment and technologies “undermines regional security and stability” in South Asia, sources told TOI.“Singh said India has been fighting Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in J&K and elsewhere for decades. India tells all friendly countries that they should not arm Pakistan in any way due to its state policy of fueling terrorism in other countries,” a source added.The Netherlands, for instance, has supplied two Alkmaar-class mine countermeasures vessels or mine-hunters, which were built at the Van der Giessen-de Noord shipyard in Alblasserdam.Similarly, the country is also providing 1,900-tonne multi-role offshore patrol vessels from the Damen Shipyards to Pakistan. “Several Dutch companies are interacting with Pakistan in the military arena, especially in the naval domain,” another source said.India has upped the ante against terrorism and Sikh separatism in recent diplomatic meetings, with PM Modi on Monday seeking continuing cooperation from his New Zealand counterpart Christopher Luxon to rein in pro-Khalistani separatists in his country.Parallelly, Singh also told US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that the Trump administration should designate Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which is banned in India for promoting secessionist and pro-Khalistani activities, as a foreign terrorist organization, as was reported by TOI.In the India-Netherlands meet on Tuesday, the two sides also explored the possibilities of collaboration in shipbuilding, equipment and space sectors, “optimizing the complementariness in skills, technology and scale of the two countries”.“They also discussed working together in domains like AI and related technologies, besides connecting the defence technology research institutes and organizations of the two countries,” a defence ministry official said.With India developing a “vibrant innovation and industrial ecosystem”, New Delhi also said Dutch armament companies should be encouraged to integrate Indian vendors into their supply chains.Singh said he was “delighted to meet the young and dynamic defence minister of the Netherlands, and the two reviewed the full range of bilateral defence cooperation. “We look forward to further deepening and elevating our defence partnership,” he said.","India and the netherlands decided to elevate their bilateral ties in areas like defence, security, information exchanges, maritime cooperation in the indo-pacific.

Shashi Tharoor's diplomacy praise for PM Modi: Wiping egg off his face or leaving Congress red-faced?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-tharoors-diplomacy-praise-for-pm-modi-wiping-egg-off-his-face-or-leaving-congress-red-faced/articleshow/119218350.cms,"Why should Tharoor's Modi praise worry the Congress?

Assembly elections in Kerala due next year

NEW DELHI: Is Congress MP Shashi Tharoor trying to cock a snook at the party leadership or is the Thiruvananthapuram MP trying to convey a message to party leadership? Tharoor's praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi - two times in the space of two days - has indeed left the Congress and Rahul Gandhi in an embarrassing spot with the BJP quick to take pot shots at the grand-old-party and its leadership.On Tuesday, Tharoor had said that the country has actually a prime minister who can hug both the president of Ukraine and the president in Moscow - two weeks apart and be accepted in both places. He followed this up a day later by reiterating PM Modi's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Speaking on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue, Tharoor today said, ""PM Modi has taken a consistent position that the solution to this conflict has to come through diplomacy. In fact, you may remember his statement in Samarkand in front of President Putin, where he said this is not an era of war and that solutions have been found peacefully. We do seem to be at the beginning of a peace process of some sort.""As expected, the BJP was jubilant and quick to target the Congress leadership. ""The knives would be out in the Congress after Tharoor's remarks, which would likely leave leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi ""red-faced"","" said BJP IT Cell chief Amit Malviya. The BJP leader later took another swipe and said: ""Prime Minister Modi needs new haters ... old ones are turning into his fans."" Another BJP leader Sambit Patra said: ""Shashi Tharoor understands diplomacy, he had been in the UN for a very long time. He has appreciated PM Modi's stand in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Other leaders of Congress should also learn from Shashi Tharoor instead of Speaking against PM Modi and the nation every time ... Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi should come forward and appreciate Shashi Tharoor's stand.""Rahul has been a vocal and perhaps one of the fiercest critics of Prime Minister Modi. The Congress has missed no opportunity to slam the policies of BJP-led NDA government. However, on the Ukraine war front, the former Congress president had in 2023 admitted that the opposition bloc understood India's relations with Russia and had then said that he would, by and large, agree with the country's position on the ongoing war in Ukraine.When asked about his changed stand on the Russia-Ukraine war issue, Tharoor justified his position and said that he has made his opinion as a ""Bharatheeyan"" and he doesn't see any politics in that. But the Congress is unlikely to buy this argument.It was in February this year that Shashi Tharoor had surprised his party with an out-of-turn praise for PM Modi's US trip and his thumbs up to entrepreneurial growth in Kerala under the LDF government. Reports then claimed that Tharoor felt sidelined in the state Congress, despite winning his Lok Sabha seat four times in a row.Tharoor's remarks evoked strong reactions from the Congress which got into damage control mode. The Congress top brass met leaders from Kerala in Delhi for a brainstorming session. At the meeting, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge laid stress on discipline and a stern warning was given to the state leaders that strong action will be taken against those making comments that go against the party's interests.Later, the Congress claimed that all was ""okay"" in Kerala unit. Rahul Gandhi posted a picture from the Kerala leaders' interaction with the media after the meeting and said on Facebook: ""They stand as one, united by the light of purpose ahead."" His post was accompanied by the hashtag, ""Team Kerala"".The fact that Tharoor's latest round of ""PM praise"" comes despite this unity exercise and party's ""stern warning"" should indeed worry the Congress.Kerala goes to polls next year. It will be a high-stakes battle for the Congress, which failed to oust the LDF government in 2021. The CPM won 62 of the 140 seats in the assembly leaving behind the Congress, which could manage only 21.The Congress in the state has a history of internal factionalism. Ahead of the elections next year, Tharoor perhaps wants a greater say in the party's affairs in the state which the state Congress leaders may be resisting. Tharoor is no pushover in politics. His remarks in praise of PM Modi may perhaps be a message to the party leadership to ensure that he gets his rightful due in the state unit. It will be interesting to see how the Congress leadership finds the right balance between the state leaders. The grand-old-party would not want let factionalism adversely impact its poll prospects in the state.",Shashi tharoor's praise for prime minister narendra modi has left the congress in an embarrassing spot. The bjp was quick to take pot shots at the grand-old-party and its leadership.

India to step on the gas for indigenous 5th gen fighter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-step-on-the-gas-for-indigenous-5th-gen-fighter/articleshow/119090404.cms,"NEW DELHI: India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, with a top-level committee now working to evolve a clear-cut strategy and production-cum-business model for the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).The committee chaired by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, which includes IAF vice chief Air Marshal S P Dharkar, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and top officials from DRDO and Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), is slated to submit its report next month.This comes at a time when Pakistan is looking to acquire at least 40 J-35A stealth fifth-generation jets from China, which is now brandishing even sixth-generation prototypes.China has already deployed its fifth-generation Chengdu J-20 jets at its airfields facing India like Hotan and Shigatse, as reported earlier by TOI.Faced with this, coupled with the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas jets by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a source told TOI that the committee's aim is to ""devise how best to get AMCA from the drawing board into the air by shrinking timelines and improving efficiency, including a good workable production-cum-business model with much greater private sector participation"".The committee will also consider the plan for indigenous development of a 110 kilonewton thrust-class engine to power the 25-tonne AMCA with foreign technology collaboration. Aero-engine majors like US General Electric, French Safran and British Rolls-Royce are in the fray for this. The new panel was formed after another defence secretary-led committee chalked out a detailed roadmap for IAF's ""all-round capability enhancement"" to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner. The report was presented to defence minister Rajnath Singh on March 3, as was then reported by TOI.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five prototypes of the twin-engine AMCA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore. The AMCA, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and ""serpentine air-intake"", however, will be ready for production only by 2035 at the earliest as per existing timelines. ""It will be a challenge to compress timelines but a major effort has to be made due to IAF's expanding technological shortfalls,"" another source said, in the backdrop of IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years. IAF currently plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like. While the first two squadrons will be powered by GE-F414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 kilonewton engines.In the interim, the dwindling numbers are to be progressively made up by induction of 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters (for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore) and 108 more capable Tejas Mark-2 jets .Parallelly, the long-pending project to manufacture 114 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration as reported by TOI earlier.",India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.

Ready for synergy with India on dual-use tech: Dutch minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ready-for-synergy-with-india-on-dual-use-tech-dutch-minister/articleshow/119232316.cms,"Ready for synergy with India on dual-use tech: Dutch minister

NEW DELHI: One of the global leaders in the semiconductor industry , which is also looking to ramp up its presence in the Indo-Pacific, the Netherlands wants to integrate its defence industry with India with collaboration in dual use technologies like drones, AI and semiconductors. Dutch defence minister Ruben Brekelmans told TOI in an exclusive interview that the 2 countries are looking to upgrade their ties to the level of a strategic partnership and it’s important to have a strong defence and security pillar to base it on.Brekelmans said that the Netherlands, one of the principal backers of Kyiv in Europe, seeks robust security guarantees for Ukraine to blunt Russia’s “imperial ambitions” and to prevent a return to the 19th century.“Both have strong maritime sectors and there’s more we could do on this. There are also some dual-use technologies , for example in drones, AI, semiconductors where there’s a lot of innovation in the Netherlands, also in India. It’d be interesting to look for synergies. India very often doesn’t just have knowledge but also the scale to produce in large numbers. That’s what we need right now. We need to ramp up our defence industries and if there’s also capacity from the Indian side, it can be important,’’ said the minister, before his meeting with counterpart Rajnath Singh this week. The Netherlands had imposed restrictions on the export of chip equipment in 2023, apparently under pressure from the Biden administration that wanted to curb supplies to China.Asked about the Indo-Pacific, where the Netherlands was one of the first European countries to have its own policy, Brekelmans said the Dutch intend to have maritime exercise every 2 years in the region. “So, we often have one of our frigates visiting multiple countries, India being one of the important ones of course. We also do air exercises, with our F-35s, to show indeed that we share the same values and principles. We have more people to people contacts with India and others, more military attaches to strengthen cooperation,’’ he said.On the threat to the transatlantic alliance from US President Donald Trump’s policies, Brekelmans said he had heard from his counterpart Pete Hegseth that Nato is more relevant today than ever and backed Trump’s call for Europe to spend more on defence. He, however, said the policy of reciprocal tariffs would hurt all.“There can be some tactical moves by the US to push allies and friends to do certain things and that’s fine. But it’s important that we remain close friends at the strategic level. It’s positive that the US has stressed multiple times that Nato is important. If there are some strategic decisions made by the US, for example to promote focus on Asia, it’s always better to do that together than make any unilateral move,’’ he said.With the Netherlands having committed military aid worth 10 billion euros to Ukraine, Brekelmans said there must be enough military power to ensure any peace deal is durable. “A peace deal should not lay the ground for future Russian aggression. Not just in Ukraine, but also other parts of Europe. It’s also important to have credible deterrence at other Nato borders. We have had 80 years of peace and we want another 80 years of the same,’’ said the minister.","Netherlands wants to integrate its defence industry with india with collaboration in dual use technologies like drones, ai and semiconductors.

NEW DELHI: The governing party cheering the statement of a prominent opposition figure is not a common sight. Yet, this is what unfolded when Congress MP Shashi Tharoor back-pedalled his criticism of Modi govt's stand on the Ukraine war and said the fast-unfolding events validated the decision to stay engaged with both Moscow and Kyiv.Tharoor's admission came at the Raisina Dialogue where he said the developments had left him with ""egg on his face"". He noted that India's neutral stance; read refusal to cave in to pressure to join the chorus of Russia's condemnation, had positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace.

NEW DELHI: Bearing the brunt of China’s aggressive expansionist tactics in the South China Sea , the Philippines now wants India to join the relatively new `Squad’ strategic alliance it has forged with the US, Australia and Japan to counter such threats in the crucial Indo-Pacific region .Pointing to China’s “illegal, coercive and disruptive Grey Zone” tactics to claim territory and build militarised artificial islands in the South China Sea region, Philippines chief of staff of armed forces General Romeo S Brawner said countries like India and South Korea should also be `included’ in the Squad.China was clearly the big dragon in the room when top military officers of the `Quad’ (India, US, Australia and Japan) and the Philippines got together to discuss maritime security challenges in the Indo-Pacific during the Raisina Dialogue here on Wednesday.“The three artificial islands created by China give it effective control over the South China Sea. They have built a 2.7-km runway, with air defence and other missile systems, on Mischief Reef…Moving forward, it is our belief that they will take full control of the South China Sea,” Gen Brawner said.China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait to push its territorial claims, flouting all international norms. Japan, on its part, is doubling its defence spending to improve its current war-fighting capabilities and prepare for the future, said Japanese chief of joint staff Gen Yoshihide Yoshida.US Indo-Pacific Command chief Admiral Samuel Paparo, who also dwelt upon the prospect of China forcibly intervening in Taiwan, in turn, said all countries that believe matters should not be “settled by force” should build and maintain a strong deterrence posture.China, with the world’s largest Navy of 370 warships and submarines, now of course also deploys seven to eight naval vessels on a permanent basis in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), including dual-purpose research or spy ships to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said India believed it was its responsibility to ensure IOR remains peaceful and stable, with unhindered passage of trade. “A Navy that does not deploy does not deter. So, we have been deploying far and wide…We are quite capable of maintaining MDA (maritime domain awareness) in the IOR. We are aware of who is doing what, where and how,” he said.India is “keeping a close watch” on dual-purpose and other naval vessels operating in the IOR, sharing intelligence, building bilateral, trilateral and multilateral partnerships, and helping island nations build capacity, Admiral Tripathi added.Former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed, sitting in the audience, asked whether the new Trump administration can be trusted to remain steadfast about its partners in the Indo-Pacific. The consensus, by and large, was that while the US may rollback from Europe, the Indo-Pacific would remain on the top of Trump’s radar screen.“We foresee an increase in support to the Indo-Pacific,” Gen Brawner said. Admiral Paparo added that the Trump administration had reiterated its commitment to the Indo-Pacific and its partners there. One of the first meetings of the new administration was of the foreign ministers of the Quad, he added.","China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the south and east china seas as well as the taiwan strait to push its territorial claims.

Jaime King loses custody amid personal struggles

What this means for Taylor Swift and her Godson

Taylor Swift has always been known for fiercely protecting her private life, but recent developments concerning one of her godchildren have placed her in an unexpected spotlight. The pop superstar is a godmother to Blake Lively’s children and Jaime King’s younger son, Leo. However, due to a recent court ruling, Swift's connection with Leo may now face new limitations.In a ruling that has sent shockwaves through Hollywood circles, a judge has granted Jaime King’s ex-husband, Kyle Newman, sole physical custody of their children. He has also been given tie-breaking authority over legal custody decisions, effectively leaving King with limited parental rights.This decision follows allegations that King has struggled with substance abuse. Reports indicate that she failed to complete a six-month rehab program, which was a critical factor in the court’s decision. According to court documents, Newman was called by his children, who allegedly pleaded for him to pick them up from King’s home. When he arrived, he claimed to have found King in a distressing state.""Jaime looked distressed, strung out and was acting drunk,"" Newman stated in the legal filings. ""She gestured for me to come over to her because she tried to get up but could not stand.""These allegations painted a concerning picture of her ability to care for her children, leading to the judge’s ruling that she would only be allowed supervised visitation.While Swift has not publicly commented on the matter, this court decision could have an impact on her ability to maintain a close relationship with Leo. Given that King can only see her children under strict supervision, any time Swift spends with Leo may now be subject to legal conditions.According to People, the court order allows King visitation rights three times a week in designated time slots. However, she must be supervised by a list of approved individuals, which includes her mother, sister, brother-in-law, and Newman's brother Kevin. Notably absent from this list are any of King’s celebrity friends, including Swift.An addendum to the court order outlines strict conditions that King must meet before she can regain unsupervised visitation. These include completing a six-month drug and alcohol program, attending weekly testing and aftercare, completing a 26-week parenting course, and undergoing both individual and conjoint counseling with her children when deemed appropriate by their therapist.King and Newman were married in 2007, but their relationship began to unravel, leading to a divorce filing in 2020. Since then, the custody battle has been ongoing, with both parties presenting conflicting narratives about their ability to parent. This latest ruling appears to be a decisive step in Newman’s favor, at least for the time being.Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce: A strategic return to the spotlight amid break up rumors For now, Taylor Swift remains silent on the matter, likely prioritizing her privacy.

Tesla owner Elon Musk fired back at Minnesota governor Tim Walz after the former Democratic vice presidential candidate mocked Tesla's falling share price during a public appearance.Walz, who was part of the Democratic ticket that lost the 2024 election, took a swipe at Musk and Tesla while joking about the electric vehicle giant's recent stock slide. ""I added Tesla to [my iPhone stock app] to give me a little boost during the day. 225 and dropping,"" Walz quipped, adding, ""If you own one, we're not blaming you. You can take dental floss and pull the Tesla thing off. Just telling.""Musk, known for his sharp responses on social media, did not let the comment slide. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the billionaire hit back with a jab referencing Vice President JD Vance, the Republican who won over Walz. ""Sometimes when I need a little boost, I look at the @JDVance portrait in the @WhiteHouse and thank the Lord,"" Musk wrote.The exchange comes amid a challenging period for Tesla, whose stock has faced increasing pressure from market concerns over slowing electric vehicle demand and intensifying competition.Tesla’s stock on Tuesday fell 5.3%, with concerns that Musk’s ties to Trump and government spending cuts are damaging the company’s image. Competition is also rising, as China’s BYD introduced an ultra-fast charging system that challenges Tesla’s dominance, creating a potential to eat away its rival's marketshare.The market fall of Tesla comes amid series of violent incidents involving the automobile maker. Soon after Donald Trump appointed Elon Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, Tesla properties started facing vandalism and violent attacks across the US and overseas as a protest against Musk and overall policies of the Trump administration. Showrooms, charging stations, and vehicles—especially Cybertrucks—have been targeted with arson, Molotov cocktails, and gunfire. Authorities are investigating major incidents in multiple regions including Colorado, South Carolina, the Pacific Northwest, and Las Vegas.Musk blames ""leftwing organizations,"" while Trump has said he sees it as ""domestic terrorism"" and promises harsh penalties.","Tim walz, a former democratic vice presidential candidate, mocked tesla's falling share price.
