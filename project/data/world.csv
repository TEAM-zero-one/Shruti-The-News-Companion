Poll Should social media platforms regulate deepfake content? Yes, to prevent misinformation. No, it's a form of free speech.





In another jibe at the Democrats, Donald Trump on Sunday shared an AI-generated video that shows former US President Barack Obama being arrested by FBI agents inside the Oval Office.Trump posted the video on his Truth Social platform and it quickly went viral. The video was created using deepfake technology, which shows a highly realistic scene where Obama is handcuffed and taken away by agents while Donald Trump looks on, smiling.The footage appears to have originated on TikTok and was later reshared by Trump without any direct commentary. The clip is captioned with the phrase: “No one is above the law.”In the beginning of the video, various prominent Democratic leaders, including former US President Joe Biden , says, “No one is above the law.” A clown version of the Pepe the Frog meme then appears on screen, honking its red nose, seemingly mocking their statements.In the next segment, the video shows Obama being handcuffed, and later, he appears behind bars wearing an orange prison jumpsuit.The video sparked strong reactions on social media. Trump’s supporters on Truth Social celebrated the post, while critics condemned it as misleading and provocative.The internet went buzzing with reactions. ""Anything to distract from the Epstein files…,"" said X handle Republicans against Trump.Others like user Publius asked: ""Will Obama be arrested?""Political commentator Nick Sortor said, ""make this a reality.""MAGA Voice reshared the video and said, ""I absolutely voted for this.""This mocking video of Obama comes at the same time as serious claims made by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence (DNI).On Friday, Gabbard said she has ""striking"" and ""overwhelming"" proof that some of Obama’s top officials made up the Trump-Russia collusion story after the 2016 election. She said it was done to try and stop Trump from becoming president.Gabbard also said she plans to give the secret documents to the department of justice and the FBI so they can take action against Obama. So far, Obama and his former team have not responded to these claims.""The implications of this are frankly nothing short of historic,"" Gabbard said Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures.""Over 100 documents that we released on Friday really detail and provide evidence of how this treasonous conspiracy was directed by President Obama just weeks before he was due to leave office after President Trump had already gotten elected.""","Donald trump shared an ai-generated video that shows former us president barack obama being arrested by fbi agents inside the oval office.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday sought to calm fears over China's move to build the world's largest dam on the Brahmaputra river, saying there is no immediate reason to worry.He specified that the Brahmaputra is not dependent on single water source and draws most of its flow from Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh, and local rainfall.""I am not immediately worried because Brahmaputra is a mighty river and it is not dependent on a single source (of water),"" Sarma told reporters on the sidelines of an event.Responding to concerns about possible downstream effects on Assam, the chief minister said it is too early to say whether the outcome will be beneficial or harmful.""Brahmaputra gets most of its waters from Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh, and the rainwater and other forms of water from our state itself,"" he added.Sarma acknowledged that the full implications of the massive Chinese dam, which began construction last week, are still unclear. ""The exact impact of the massive dam, the construction of which began last week, is not properly known as different theories are being floated,"" he said.The Assam CM also highlighted two conflicting scientific opinions about the potential impact of the dam.""First -- if Brahmaputra's flow is disturbed by China, then there may be less water and consequently biodiversity will be affected. But there is also a counter view that if less water comes, it will also act as a flood cushioning. So, I don't know which one is correct,"" he said.He expressed confidence in the Union government’s handling of the matter. ""I am sure that they (Centre) must already be having a discussion with China or will have a discussion with the neighbouring country,"" he added.China began building the $167.8 billion hydropower project on July 19 in Nyingchi City, Tibet, close to the border with Arunachal Pradesh. Chinese premier Li Qiang attended the groundbreaking ceremony of what is expected to be the largest infrastructure project in the world -- bigger even than the Three Gorges Dam.The dam will be built on the lower reaches of the Brahmaputra, known as the Yarlung Zangbo in Tibet. The site lies in one of the rainiest and most seismically active regions of the world and sits along a tectonic plate boundary prone to earthquakes.According to reports, the project will feature five cascading hydropower stations and generate over 300 billion kWh of electricity annually -- enough to meet the needs of over 300 million people.The project has raised serious concerns in India and Bangladesh, both downstream countries, as it could give China the ability to regulate the river's flow. In times of tension, this control could be used strategically by releasing or withholding water, potentially causing floods or shortages.India, too, is constructing a dam on the Brahmaputra in Arunachal Pradesh as part of its efforts to counterbalance China’s control upstream.","China began building the $167.8 billion hydropower project on july 19 in nyingchi city, tibet, close to the border with arunachal pradesh.

Pahalgam debate not set for first week, Cong slams govt

Turbulence ahead

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Monday set the tone for the govt’s response to the opposition’s demand for a discussion on “Operation Sindoor” and the Pahalgam attack by declaring India's retaliation against terrorist camps deep inside Pakistan a “100% success”.Modi was speaking against the backdrop of the opposition's plans to stage protests in the two Houses as well as the govt agreeing to hold a debate: a rhetorical skirmish which, as per the decision of the business advisory committee, an all-party affair, will pan out for at least 16 hours next week. As soon as the Lok Sabha kicked off proceedings, Congress and its allies demanded that the discussion be held straightaway.Congress also demanded that the Prime Minister personally respond to US President Donald Trump’s claim to have leaned on India to get it to negotiate the suspension of Operation Sindoor In his address, Modi emphasised that the armed forces achieved the success despite him having publicly warned them days by amplifying the intent to “raze the terrorists to the ground”.“This monsoon session should be a victory celebration, a vijayotsav (triumph). The entire world has witnessed the strength of Bharat's military capabilities. During Operation Sindoor, the Indian armed forces achieved their objectives with 100% success.Within just 22 minutes, the mission neutralised its target right inside the enemy’s territory. I had announced this during a programme in Bihar, and our armed forces accomplished it within a very short time,” the Prime Minister said.Congress members also insisted that leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi be permitted to speak, shouting slogans when he was disallowed by Speaker Om Birla, who said he could do so after question hour. Pleas by defence minister Rajnath Singh and parliamentary affairs Kiren Rijiju that the govt was ready to debate all the issues and that it was for the BAC to work out the date and duration of the debate also failed to cut ice.BJP, for its part, also sent the message that it was not going to chicken out of a fight. As soon as PM Modi entered the Lok Sabha after his media address, BJP and allied MPs greeted him with slogans of “Operation Sindoor” and “Bharat Mata Ki Jai. In his customary remarks to the media on the inaugural day of the session, PM emphasised the global recognition of India’s indigenous defence capabilities.“When I meet world leaders, they express keen interest in Bharat’s homegrown defence equipment. A unified voice from Parliament celebrating this victory will inspire our armed forces and boost research, innovation, and manufacturing in the defence sector, creating jobs for our youth,” he said.Reflecting on the atrocities in Pahalgam, Modi praised all-party delegations that exposed Pakistan’s role in global terrorism. “Setting aside party differences, representatives from various states travelled to world capitals, successfully highlighting Pakistan as a hub of terrorism. Their efforts, in the national interest, created a positive atmosphere and opened global doors to India’s perspective,” he said. He said the success of astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla’s historic mission was another reason for Parliament to celebrate.Congress has slammed the govt for not scheduling the discussion on Pahalgam attack and subsequent events in the first week, and criticised prime minister Narendra Modi for “not giving importance” to the first session after the dastardly terror attack in J&K.Deputy leader of opposition in LS Gaurav Gogoi said the govt did not put Pahalgam and other issues before the business advisory committee which met on Monday afternoon to decide the business of the lower house. He said the govt did not fix any date or time for the discussion, describing it as “salt on the wounds of the grieving families”.The opposition continued with its protest on the opening day of the session and forced adjournment of LS even when the House met after the BAC meeting, indicating that it is bent on maintaining pressure, at least for the coming days.",Pm modi declares india's retaliation against terrorist camps deep inside pakistan a “100% success’ opposition demands discussion on pahalgam attack and subsequent events in the first week of the session.

""To prioritise health care and abide by medical advice, I hereby resign as Vice-President of India, effective immediately, in accordance with Article 67(a) of the Constitution,"" he wrote in his letter to President Droupadi Murmu.The move immediately set off speculation about the real trigger, with many wondering as to the nature of the medical condition that necessitated his quitting the constitutional position, second only to the President in protocol.Few were convinced about the health explanation, particularly given that those who visited him in recent months detected signs that he was less than happy, even as he made it a point to swear by the present political leadership.He underwent a cardiac procedure at AIIMS in March after he complained of uneasiness. On June 25, he had fainted while delivering a speech at Nainital. But he seemed to be in fine fettle on Monday, making his trademark interventions and betraying no sign of the graveness he invoked to explain his exit.Dhankhar, 74, assumed office in Aug 2022 and his tenure was till 2027.Jagdeep Dhankhar is the only vice president to quit while not in contention for presidentship. R Venkatraman, S D Sharma and K R Naryanan had resigned after becoming President, while V V Giri had quit to contest as an Independent for President. Bhairon Singh Shekhwat had stepped down on moral grounds after losing to Pratibha Patil in the presidential contest.In his resignation letter, Dhankhar thanked President Droupadi Murmu, PM Narendra Modi, the council of ministers, and all MPs for extending support to him during his tenure. ""I extend my deepest gratitude to the President of India for her unwavering support and the soothing wonderful working relationship we maintained during my tenure. I express my deep gratitude to the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. Prime Minister's cooperation and support have been invaluable, and I have learned much during my time in office,"" he said in his letter.But the development came as a surprise to many in govt, although a few admitted to have noticed signs of restiveness in the voluble former Supreme Court lawyer.The inaugural day also saw the VP allowing submission of motion for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma of Allahabad high court: something that would equip him with the same say as the Lok Sabha Speaker in picking the three members of inquiry panel that would go into charges against the judge. This was perhaps the first such instance when the two Houses moved in parallel for removal of a judge. Significantly, the opposition was allowed to submit the motion a day after govt had announced at the all-party meeting on Sunday that LS would make the first move against the HC judge. Many saw this through the prism of the lawyer's interest in matters legal; especially his criticism of judiciary, but it struck many as unusual.The governing party had also seemed surprised when he allowed LoP in RS Mallikarjun Kharge to speak at length on the alleged security lapse that enabled the terrorists at Pahalgam to conduct their deadly carnage and US President Donald Trump's claims to have dragged India to the negotiation table during Operation Sindoor. Treasury benches felt that as the chairman, Dhankhar should have allowed Kharge to have his say only during the debate that is set to happen.But none of it seemed to qualify to be a trigger for his announcement. The timing: the inaugural day of a session when opposition aspires to put govt under pressure, could not be comforting for the governing coalition. To many, it seemed to be meant to embarrass govt. Opposition, which relentlessly attacked Dhankhar for alleged partisanship and twice came close to moving no-confidence motions against him, appears to have already smelt an opportunity and would like to cash in on it.The resignation seemed just as dramatic as BJP leadership's original decision to elevate him to the position. The decision to appoint him as West Bengal governor was seen as too generous for the new entrant to BJP who had once served as minister of state in the short-lived V P Singh govt. Despite the surprise, there is near unanimity in political circles that Dhankhar is not going to hang up his boots anytime soon. Those who have been interacting with him speak about a fresh innings: this time as a farmer representative belonging to Jat community who has served in the second most important constitutional position.","Jagdeep dhankhar caught govt unawares on by allowing notice against justice varma.

Q: What does Stephen A. Smith believes is behind Donald Trump’s comment?

In a fiery moment on ESPN’s First Take, Stephen A. Smith didn't hold back in calling out U.S. President Donald Trump over his latest remarks on the Washington Commanders. Smith claimed that Trump’s push to revive the team’s controversial former name—the Redskins—is nothing more than a political distraction, aimed at shifting public attention away from far more serious issues, including the unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files.Stephen A. Smith didn’t hold back when slamming President Donald Trump for reviving the Redskins name debate. Calling the move “petty” and “evasive,” Smith claimed it’s a deliberate distraction from more serious issues—namely, the unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files.""Well, I think it's the president being petty. I think it's him being evasive,"" Smith said, directly criticizing Trump’s attempt to tie federal stadium funding to the team changing its name back.Trump made headlines again in July 2025 when he suggested that he might block federal support for the Commanders’ proposed $2.7 billion stadium project unless the franchise reverts to its old name. That name was officially retired in 2020 after decades of protest from Indigenous groups and civil rights advocates. The team rebranded as the Commanders under new ownership in 2022.Though Trump framed his argument as standing up for tradition, Smith sees something much more calculated behind the president’s push.""Because when you look at the Redskins name, obviously it's something that needed to be changed,"" Smith said. ""And by him bringing that issue up, we all know from a political landscape, it's much ado about nothing... it's just him catering to his base to make sure that he serves, to appease them in some way to distract them from other issues, including the Epstein files.""The Commanders’ new stadium plans, centered around the RFK Stadium site, have received broad support from Congress and D.C. officials. President Biden had already signed legislation earlier this year to grant control of the land to the city. Yet Trump’s comments threaten to complicate that progress just as local leaders debate final budget allocations.For Smith, it’s not just about football. It’s about accountability—and, in his eyes, a president more focused on stoking culture wars than addressing unfinished business that demands transparency.Also Read: “I may put a restriction on them”: Donald Trump threatens to block $4 billion Commanders stadium plan Stephen A.

Rare exit mid-term

NEW DELHI: In a political twist few saw coming, Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned as the Vice-President of India on Monday evening, citing health reasons, sparking speculation across party lines. His resignation letter, addressed to President Droupadi Murmu, mentioned “prioritising health care” as the reason for stepping down, effective immediately.But Congress leader Jairam Ramesh isn’t buying the simple explanation.“The sudden resignation of the Vice-President and Chairman of the Rajya Sabha is as shocking as it is inexplicable,” Jairam Ramesh posted on X. “I was with him alongside a number of other MPs till around 5 pm today and had spoken to him over the phone at 7:30 pm. Clearly, there is far more to this totally unexpected resignation than meets the eye.”Jairam Ramesh added that Dhankhar “took both the government and the opposition to task in equal measure” and was scheduled to chair a Business Advisory Committee meeting and announce “major decisions related to the judiciary” on Tuesday. He urged Dhankhar to reconsider and called on Prime Minister Modi to intervene, saying, “This will be in the nation’s interest.”Dhankhar, 74, had recently undergone angioplasty at AIIMS Delhi. His resignation came just as the Monsoon session of Parliament kicked off, a timing that many, including Jairam Ramesh, find curious.As Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Dhankhar had several confrontations with the Opposition, which had even moved an unprecedented motion to impeach him, a first in independent India. That motion was later rejected.Interestingly, his exit comes just a day after an Opposition-backed notice to remove Justice Yashwant Varma was submitted in the Rajya Sabha, a move Dhankhar had acknowledged in the House, reportedly catching the government off-guard.Dhankhar now joins V V Giri and R Venkataraman as the only Vice-Presidents in India’s history to resign before completing their term, though both of his predecessors quit to contest the presidential election. Dhankhar’s resignation, by contrast, has no such political ladder in sight.In his letter, Dhankhar thanked President Murmu, Prime Minister Modi, the council of ministers, and MPs for their support. He reflected on India’s “unprecedented development” during his tenure, calling it “a true honour” to serve during what he described as a “transformative era.”","Jagdeep dhankhar, 74, had recently undergone angioplasty at aiims delhi.
