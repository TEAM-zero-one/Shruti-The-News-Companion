Who is Eileen Higgins ?



Miami voters have elected Democrat Eileen Higgins as the city’s first female mayor and the first Democrat to hold the office in nearly three decades.In Tuesday’s runoff, Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González, a former city manager backed by former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.“Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city, one defined by ethical, accountable leadership that delivers real results for the people,"" Higgins said in a statement after the voivtory, promising to lead a government “that finally earns the public’s trust,” as cited by NYT.Although Miami’s elections are officially nonpartisan, both major parties played an active role in the campaign. US President Donald Trump endorsed González, while the Democratic National Committee backed Higgins. In the days leading up to the vote, several prominent national Democrats traveled to Miami to campaign alongside her, an unusual show of support for a low-turnout, off-year local election.Higgins secured victory the victory after topping the first round of voting on November 4, where she received 35 per cent of the vote compared to González’s 19 per cent.Higgins will make history as Miami’s first female mayor and its first non-Hispanic mayor since the 1990s, breaking a three-decade dominance of Cuban American Republicans in city politics.Higgins, a trained mechanical engineer and former Peace Corps director in Belize, previously represented what she described as a Republican-leaning district on the county commission.She also holds a Master of Business Administration from Cornell University’s Johnson Graduate School of Management.On the campaign trail, she pledged to focus on addressing residents’ everyday concerns if elected, as cited by Politico.Higgins had served as a well-known county commissioner for eight years, representing a district that included Miami’s downtown. In the November 4 election, she also secured the top spot across all five of the city’s commission districts.She received a social media endorsement from former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is a former mayor and was a 2020 presidential candidate.She also led in all five of the city’s commission districts and will succeed outgoing Mayor Francis Suarez, who had briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination, as cited by the NYT.Miami, home to roughly half a million residents, is Florida’s second-largest city after Jacksonville. While the city, like the state, has trended Republican in recent election cycles, Higgins’ Democratic victory stands out as particularly notable.","Eileen higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated republican emilio gonzález in tuesday's runoff.

NEW DELHI: The ruling BJP on Wednesday labelled Congress MP Rahul Gandhi 'Videsh Nayak' and 'leader of paryatan' ahead of his upcoming visit to Germany from December 15 to 20.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla — a former Congress member — also highlighted that the trip will coincide with the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament, which began on December 1 and is scheduled to conclude on December 19.“Once again, Videsh Nayak is doing what he does best — going on a foreign tour! Parliament is on till 19th Dec, but Rahul Gandhi will visit Germany from Dec 15–20! Rahul is LoP — leader of paryatan. During the Bihar elections too he was abroad and then on a Jungle Safari, ” Poonawalla wrote on X.While 'Videsh Nayak' (leader of foreign visits) plays on “Jannayak” (leader of the masses), a title the Congress uses for Gandhi, 'leader of paryatan' (tourism) is a jab at his LoP initials — leader of opposition, a post he has held since June last year - and also references his frequent foreign trips The Indian Overseas Congress (IOC) announced on Monday that Gandhi will visit Germany. A day later, the IOC said that on December 17, the former Congress president will meet German lawmakers and members of the Indian community in Berlin, the European nation’s capital and largest city.During his overseas visits — first as an MP and now in his official capacity as leader of the opposition — the Raebareli MP has repeatedly raised concerns about what he describes as the ‘weakening’ of India’s democracy and the ‘capture’ of its institutions by the BJP.In September, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), which provides him security, flagged repeated ‘lapses’ by Gandhi in following security protocols — including intentionally skipping mandatory protective measures on multiple occasions despite being a Z+ protectee with an Advance Security Liaison (ASL) team.","The indian overseas congress (ioc) announced on monday that gandhi will visit germany.

Why India’s New Right To Disconnect Bill Could Transform Work Culture, Protect Millions From Burnout

Key provisions of the bill

Global pioneers in disconnection rights

France leads with early legislation

Portugal enforces strict boundaries

Italy adapts to flexible work

Australia joins the movement

US lacks legal protections amid rising proposals

India's parliament has seen the introduction of a new bill that grants employees the power to ignore work communications outside official hours. The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life. Employees gain the legal right to switch off from calls, emails, and messages without fear of repercussions from employers.Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule introduced this private member's bill in the Lok Sabha. As a non-ministerial proposal, it focuses on creating an Employees' Welfare Authority to oversee implementation and address violations.The legislation mandates that companies establish clear policies on after-hours contact. Workers can decline responses to non-emergency communications, promoting healthier work-life balance. The proposed authority would investigate complaints, impose fines on non-compliant firms, and educate both sides on rights and responsibilities. Supriya Sule's bill applies to private sector employees, ensuring they disconnect without disciplinary action.Several nations adopted similar measures years before India's proposal.These laws emerged amid rising concerns over burnout and digital overload in modern workplaces. Governments recognised the need to protect workers from incessant demands.France became a trailblazer in 2017 by enacting the Right to Disconnect as part of the El Khomri Labour Law, requiring companies—especially larger ones—to negotiate with unions to ensure employees are not pressured to be online after hours, helping combat digital burnout and protect work-life balance. The law requires firms with over 50 employees to negotiate agreements on out-of-hours communications. Workers disconnect from devices, and employers respect rest periods. This stemmed from labour code reforms addressing 35-hour workweeks and overtime boundaries.Portugal introduced robust protections in 2021 (Law no. 83/2021). Employers face bans on contacting staff outside shifts, with fines up to €9,690 for violations. The law covers remote workers, mandating compensation for home office expenses. It prohibits monitoring tools that invade privacy during off-hours.Italy embedded the right in 2017 smart working laws (Law 81/2017). Companies must outline disconnection periods in contracts for remote employees. Unions negotiate terms, ensuring no penalties for unavailability. This applies to public and private sectors, focusing on work-life harmony.Australia implemented its version in 2024. Employees ignore unreasonable after-hours contacts, with tribunals resolving disputes. Small businesses get exemptions initially, but larger firms comply fully. The law builds on fair work acts, shielding staff from overreach.The United States trails far behind, with no federal, state, or local right to disconnect laws enacted as of December 2025. California led the charge in February 2024 with Assembly Bill 2751, mandating policies for ignoring employer communications during non-working hours, defined by job descriptions or agreements. The measure stalled in committee amid pushback from businesses citing global operations and flexibility needs, though it could resurface. New Jersey followed with a similar 2024 bill for firms with 10-plus staff, but it too faltered. Earlier attempts in New York City and Washington met defeat, leaving workers reliant on voluntary policies.This void amplifies US work culture's intensity. Over 80% of employees report job-related stress, with more than half saying it spills into home life, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Salaried roles often exceed 40 hours without overtime pay, fostering a ""hustle"" mentality where unplugging invites guilt. Tech firms like Google offer perks such as flexible schedules and mental health days, but these vary widely, and many sectors demand round-the-clock responsiveness.","The right to disconnect bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life.

As IndiGo Spirals Into Crisis, PM Modi Stresses Rules Must Ease Citizens’ Lives, Not Burden Them

NEW DELHI: There will be a lot less domestic flights this winter as an under fire aviation ministry Tuesday evening decided to slash IndiGo’s schedule by 10% — doubling it from the 5% cut ordered earlier that day. The airline operated over 2,200 daily flights and this cut translates into about 216 less flights. But in reality IndiGo may actually operate an even lesser number of flights at about 1,800-1,900 — meaning about 500 daily cancelations — to keep operations stabilised, say sources.“The ministry considers it necessary to curtail the overall IndiGo routes, which will help in stabilising the airline’s operations and lead to reduced cancellations. A curtailment of 10% has been ordered. While abiding with it, Indigo will continue to cover all its destinations as before,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said on X Tuesday evening.IndiGo “CEO Pieter Elbers was summoned to the ministry (Tuesday) to provide an update…. last week, many passengers faced severe inconvenience due to IndiGo’s internal mismanagement of crew rosters, flight schedules and inadequate communication….inquiry and necessary actions are underway,” Naidu added.Earlier in the day, the DGCA’s 5% cut order had stated the airline has “not demonstrated an ability to operate” the its previously approved winter schedule of 15,014 weekly departures “efficiently”. The airline was directed to reduce operations “across sectors, especially on high-demand, high-frequency flights, and to avoid single-flight operations on a sector by IndiGo.”The airline has to submit a revised schedule by 5 pm on Wednesday. IndiGo’s summer schedule was for operating 14,158 weekly domestic flights which was increased 6% in the winter schedule starting Oct 26. This translated into the airline having an approval to operate 64,346 domestic flights in Nov. “As per operational data submitted by IndiGo, it (actually operated) 59,438 flights during Nov 2025, with 951 flight cancellations recorded during the month,” the DGCA notice issued to the airline about flight cuts on Monday night says.The regulator had increased IndiGo’s winter flights based on an estimated higher aircraft availability at 403 against 351 this summer. “However, it has been observed that the airline could operate only 339 aircraft in Oct 2025 and 344 aircraft in Nov 2025… IndiGo increased its departures by 9.66% in comparison to winter schedule 2024 and by 6% in relation to summer schedule 2025. However, the airline has not demonstrated an ability to operate these schedules efficiently,” the DGCA notice says.The problem essentially happened as the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) that increased pilot requirement came into effect from Nov 1. On the one hand IndiGo did not gear up for that and on the other, its daily flights increased 6%. So November saw modest cancellations but the mismatch snowballed into a major crisis in the first week of Dec with hundreds of flights being cancelled daily.Air India and AI Express, on the other hand, saw their weekly domestic schedule being reduced by 0.8% and 6%, respectively from summer to winter schedule. India's second biggest airline group saw its weekly summer domestic flights 7,685 reduce to overall by 3% to 7,448 in winter. Akasa also saw its weekly winter domestic schedule reduce by 5.7% from 1,089 to 1,027. SpiceJet, which is ramping up operations, saw an increase of over 26% with the number increasing from 1,240 to 1,568.Now questions are being asked of aviation authorities why did they permit IndiGo more flights without checking its crew availability under the new FDTL requirement.On its part, IndiGo has attributed the disruption to a “compounding effect of multiple factors which coincided in lesser or greater measure” in an “unfortunate and unforeseeable confluence.” These are: Minor technical glitches; schedule changes linked to the start of the winter season; adverse weather conditions increased congestion in the aviation system, andiImplementation of and operation under the updated crew rostering rules (FDTL phase II) that came into force on Nov 1, 2025.","The airline operated over 2,200 daily flights and this cut translates into about 216 less flights. But in reality indigo may actually operate an even lesser number of flights at about 1,800-1,900 — meaning about 500 daily cancelations — to keep operations stabilised, say sources.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125871670,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-32802,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'Nonchalant, Lackadaisical Attitude': Ex-AirAsia CFO Breaks Down Indigo Fiasco

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday expressed concern over the chaos caused by IndiGo 's widespread flight cancellations across major airports in the country, saying ""rules and laws are in order to correct the system and not to harass the people.""Speaking to reporters after the NDA Parliamentary Party meeting, the Union parliamentary and minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, ""during the NDA parliamentary meeting the Prime Minister told NDA MPs that people should not be troubled and face inconvenience.""""Rules and laws are good but in order to correct the system it is not right to harass people,"" he added.Rijiju further said that PM Modi urged MPs to focus on reforms that make life easier for citizens and ensure people do not face unnecessary hardship from the government.The prime minister's remarks come amid IndiGo’s operational crisis that led to the cancellation of over 1200 flights across major airports, leaving thousands of passengers stranded nationwide.The crisis comes from the rollout of revised Flight Duty Time Limit (FDTL) norms, which mandate longer weekly rest for pilots, stricter night-duty limits and fewer night landings.Airlines, including IndiGo and Air India, had initially opposed the rules, but they were implemented in phases in July and November following Delhi High Court directions.IndiGo has now secured temporary relaxations in the second phase of the norms until February 10.According to the civil aviation ministry, between November 21 and December 7, a total of 9,55,591 PNRs were cancelled and refunded, amounting to Rs 827 crore in refunds. Of the 9,000 delayed bags, around 4,500 have been delivered, while the rest are expected to be returned within 36 hours.Rijiju further asserted that the PM also used the NDA meeting to urge MPs to prioritise reforms and connect with the youth. ""All NDA leaders congratulated PM Modi for the NDA's victory in the Bihar elections. PM Modi guided all the NDA MPs to work for their respective constituencies. The PM emphasised undertaking reforms across all sectors to ease the public's lives and ensure they face no problems,"" he said.""The PM said that laws should help people. He also urged the MPs to connect with the youth. I express my gratitude to the PM for this guidance. It was a very good meeting of the NDA parliamentary party,"" he added.The Union minister further stated that the government intends to counter the Opposition's claims during Lok Sabha discussions on election reforms today.""Today, Lok Sabha will discuss election reform. Opposition will speak. The government will also clear the delusion that has been created. The government will clarify the wrong narrative being set regarding people's trust and their participation in election processes,"" he said.",Pm narendra modi expressed concern over the chaos caused by indigo's widespread flight cancellations across major airports in the country.

'Will Set An Example': IndiGo Faces Heat As Aviation Minister Promises Tough Action In Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: Uncertainty shrouds holiday plans of lakhs of domestic flyers this winter. India's biggest airline, IndiGo, will cut anywhere between 200 and 400 flights daily for the foreseeable future.Which means, don't be surprised if the flight you booked to Goa and back this Yuletide are cancelled. While you will get a refund and domestic airfares are capped, making a new booking won't be easy as other airlines cannot fill in the void created by IndiGo cancellations at such a short notice. Which means, India is staring at a sharp demand-supply gap this winter.""All our resources are fully deployed and we are operating at maximum capacity. Ever since IndiGo crisis happened, our aircraft occupancies have gone through the roof. Also for a short term no one can add capacity just like that. If govt says they are uncomfortable with a single airline having 60% plus domestic market share and are capping the same, we can increase capacity. Otherwise, who will add capacity and be faced with a growing giant,"" said a top executive of another Indian carrier. Govt may permit short term wet leases - something IndiGo has availed off - but finding aircraft at such short notice is not easy, said airline executives.The situation has left holidayers nervous. Multiple people said they have bookings on IndiGo this winter. ""Aviation ministry is in full damage-control mode for themselves. But the uncertainty they have left us with is not funny. This was a completely preventable situation by allowing airlines' schedules based on their actual ability to mount flights,"" said Priya Singh, a Delhi-based writer.","India's biggest airline, indigo, will cut anywhere between 200 and 400 flights daily for the foreseeable future.

Donald Trump's rice tariffs threat unlikely to have severe impact on exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/donald-trumps-rice-tariffs-threat-unlikely-to-have-severe-impact-on-exports/articleshow/125877171.cms,"Why Trump Accuses India Of Dumping Rice And What A New Tariff Shock Could Mean For Trade Relations

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose fresh tariffs on rice is unlikely to have a severe impact on Indian exports.""India exported $392 million worth of rice to the US in FY2025, just 3% of its global rice exports, and already faces tariffs of about 53% in the US market; 86% of these shipments are premium basmati. New duties would scarcely dent Indian exporters, who have strong markets elsewhere, but would make rice costlier for American households,"" said trade research body GTRI.A bulk of the 6 million tonne exported to the US may be headed to kitchens of Indian-origin Americans or those on visas. The only substitute for basmati rice can be from Pakistan but the quantities are much lower. Overall, a bulk of India's rice exports consists of non-basmati rice.Trump's latest threat comes amid a team from the US visiting India with talks on the much-delayed trade deal scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. While the agenda for the latest discussions were not immediately known, the visit was a surprise as govt officials had earlier said most issues had been sorted out and last-mile talks were expected. News about the US delegation's trip came ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India.While Trump has taken unilateral measures on trade since returning to office, India's rice exports are not seen as ""dumping"" as claimed by the US president, who is not seen as someone who always sticks to facts. Given volumes, neither are rice exports causing harm to domestic market, nor are they subsidised. As a result, it is seen as a pressure tactic amid talks for a bilateral deal.India and the US had launched negotiations for a trade deal in Feb and hoped to close talks by Sept-Oct. But with govt refusing to agree to Trump's demand for reducing levies on food and GM crops, the US hit back with 25% reciprocal tariffs and another 25% secondary tariffs, citing India's purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment. In the first phase, which govt is hoping can be clinched by the month-end, India expects the secondary tariffs to be lifted while also seeking concessions on reciprocal tariffs.Trump, in the same event, also threatened high tariff on agriculture imports from Canada and other countries.","Us president donald trump's latest threat to impose fresh tariffs on rice is unlikely to have a severe impact on indian exports.

"After Putin, Modi to host German chancellor Merz",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-putin-modi-to-host-german-chancellor-merz/articleshow/125877113.cms,"India is boosting its European ties, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz set to visit New Delhi soon. This engagement follows President Putin's visit and precedes the India-EU summit. Discussions will focus on trade, technology, and sustainable development, building on existing partnerships. Germany's support for Ukraine and shared concerns over the Indo-Pacific will also be key topics.

NEW DELHI: After hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin, India is stepping up its engagement with Europe that has rallied behind Ukraine amidst US-led efforts to end the war. Ahead of the India-EU summit scheduled for January 27, India will host German Chancellor Friedrich Merz for his first visit to the country after assuming office.Merz is expected to visit India in the third week of January for a summit with PM Narendra Modi. The visit will be an important opportunity for the leaders to review progress and build upon the momentum in the relationship across areas like trade, technology, innovation, migration and mobility, green and sustainable development, along with defence and security.The leaders had earlier met on the margins of the G7 summit in Canada where they agreed to diversify the strategic partnership and Modi thanked the chancellor for backing India’s actions in the fight against terrorism. He had also then invited Merz to visit India.Germany is also an important partner for India in maintaining a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific, as Berlin sees China's increasingly aggressive behavior in the Indo-Pacific as a cause of concern for both countries. Merz’s visit will of course be observed closely for the messaging by both leaders on the Russia-Ukraine war.As Europe’s leading economic power, Germany has been relentless in its support for Ukraine, in the form of both military and non-military aid.Merz was quoted as saying this week, after discussions with other European leaders over the US-led peace plan, that European support for Ukraine will remain strong “because we all know that the destiny of this country is the destiny of Europe.” Germany, however, has avoided hectoring India on the latter’s ties with Russia even though it believes Indo-Pacific security is closely linked to security in Europe.With the India-EU summit set to take place next month, and important outcomes like a free trade agreement and defence and security partnership being worked upon, the Europeans had been worried that the outcomes of the Modi-Putin could create misunderstandings between the 2 sides. It was reassuring for them eventually that the focus during Putin’s visit, as the Indian side repeatedly stressed, was mostly on economic cooperation.On the bilateral front, India and Germany 2 countries held the latest round of negotiations on development cooperation, reaffirming their strong and future-oriented partnership under the Green and Sustainable Development Partnership (GSDP). According to a statement by the German embassy, Germany announced new commitments amounting to almost EUR 1.3 billion, primarily in the form of concessional loans, across the key areas of climate and energy, sustainable urban development, green urban mobility, and sustainable management of natural resources.“In addition, bilateral cooperation in the skills development sector, in particular, renewable energy will be strengthened. These commitments underline Germany’s long-term partnership with India in advancing ambitious climate action, low-carbon growth, and inclusive development,” it said.","India is boosting its european ties, with german chancellor friedrich merz set to visit new delhi soon.

The growing interest around John Cena and Shay Shariatzadeh’s financial journey has intensified in 2025 as new reports highlight their rising net worth, expanding properties, and steadily increasing earnings, creating wider curiosity about how their individual careers continue shaping their shared financial path. Together, their lifestyle reflects a balance between high earnings, stable investments, and carefully chosen luxury, allowing them to maintain comfort without relying on constant public display or extravagant change. Let’s take a look at where the power couple stands today.Fresh evaluations for 2025 suggest that John Cena holds a personal net worth close to $80 million, supported by his long wrestling career, expanding Hollywood roles and multiple commercial partnerships that continue generating consistent income for him across different categories of the entertainment industry.Shay Shariatzadeh contributes an estimated $2 million, which comes from her engineering work, strategic career moves, and selective investments that reflect a steady approach rather than a public lifestyle focused on expensive displays or high-profile spending choices.Together, their combined worth reaches nearly $82 million, showing how their financial paths complement one another through two very different professional worlds that still manage to work in harmony.Cena’s earnings remain anchored by an annual WWE salary reportedly around $8.5 million, supported by bonuses linked to special appearances and merchandise sales that continue performing strongly across global markets due to his long-standing popularity.John Cena’s well-known Florida property, purchased many years ago for roughly $525,000, has grown significantly in value and now sits near $4 million, featuring spacious interiors, multiple recreational spaces and design upgrades that reflect his preference for calm surroundings rather than extravagant display.The home includes an indoor pool, outdoor pool, cigar room, extended garage, and a guest area, allowing him a private retreat while balancing entertainment commitments and travel schedules across Hollywood and wrestling venues.

Tekashi 6ix9ine’s legal journey is heading into its next chapter, and this time, the controversial rapper and occasional Twitch streamer is planning for more than just time behind bars. The 29-year-old artist, known for his bold persona and rainbow-colored hair, will begin a 3-month prison sentence on January 6 next year. But he insists he’s not stressed about serving time. In fact, he claims he’s ready to use the isolation to focus on a major fitness transformation. His goal? Drop from 190 pounds to 120 while behind bars, using a highly unusual diet that’s already stirring social media chatter, one box of Oreo cookies a day.Alongside his jail stint, 6ix9ine is also facing 12 months of supervised release once he’s out. According to newly obtained court documents, the judge has mandated a strict mental health treatment program centered around anger management. Additionally, an outpatient drug treatment program will be part of his release conditions, a decision linked to authorities allegedly recovering drugs during a raid on his property earlier this year.His long-running legal struggles date back to his high-profile racketeering case involving the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, where his cooperation with federal prosecutors earned him thelabel, and likely special housing arrangements when his sentence begins.Therapper told TMZ that due to his informant status, he expects to avoid the general prison population for his safety. But rather than viewing his potential seclusion as punishment, he says it will give him room to refocus and work on himself physically and mentally. Fans, skeptics, and fitness experts are already sounding off online, with many highly doubtful about the health risks of his extreme prison diet plan. Still, 6ix9ine appears motivated to turn the situation into a reset phase, especially after spending years under probation and navigating frequent controversy.As he prepares for the start of his sentence, the industry will be watching closely. Between mandated anger management, drug monitoring, and his bold weight-loss claims, Tekashi 6ix9ine continues to captivate headlines, whether for music or mayhem.

Edwin Díaz gives Los Angeles Dodgers needed ninth inning stability

Edwin Díaz is officially moving to Los Angeles. On Tuesday, during the MLB Winter Meetings in Orlando, Florida, the Los Angeles Dodgers reached a three year, $69 million agreement with former New York Mets closer Edwin Díaz. Sources confirmed the deal to ESPN reporters Jeff Passan and Jorge Castillo. The signing gives the Dodgers the top relief pitcher available in free agency.The move comes after a rough season for the Dodgers bullpen. Late leads disappeared too often, forcing the team to use starting pitchers in relief during key moments. By adding Edwin Díaz, the Dodgers now have a clear and trusted option to close games heading into the 2025 season.Edwin Díaz, now 31, enters Los Angeles as a three time All Star and one of baseball’s hardest throwers. Based on mean yearly value, the agreement establishes a new standard for a relief pitcher.He last pitched for the New York Mets during the 2024 season. With the Mets, Díaz had a 1.63 ERA and converted 28 of 31 save attempts.With just 14 walks, he struck 98 batters over 66 and one third innings. Despite past injuries, his fastball and crisp slider stayed excellent.Last year, the Dodgers had difficulty in late innings.Their bullpen finished with a 4.27 ERA and blew 27 saves, one of the highest totals in Major League Baseball.Due to the lack of relief depth, Los Angeles shifted pitchers like Roki Sasaki, Emmet Sheehan, Justin Wrobleski, and at times Tyler Glasnow into bullpen roles.Dodgers manager Dave Roberts spoke Monday in Orlando before the deal was announced. “Getting a high leverage reliever is never a bad thing,” Roberts told reporters.With Díaz closing, Tanner Scott is expected to handle setup duties, while Alex Vesia, Blake Treinen, Anthony Banda, and Brusdar Graterol round out the group.Edwin Díaz opted out of the remaining two years and $38 million on the five year deal he signed with the Mets in 2022. He declined the $22.025 million qualifying offer on November 18 to test the open market.Since Díaz signed with another team, the Mets will receive a compensatory draft pick after the fourth round. On December 1, New York signed Devin Williams to a three year, $51 million deal as bullpen insurance.Díaz experienced both highs and lows while playing for the Mets. Three times he published an ERA below 2.00, but in other years he fought. Suffering a knee injury while celebrating a save during the World, he also missed the whole 2023 season. Classic Baseball.ESPN Research claims that since his debut in 2016, Edwin Díaz has 253 career saves, tying Raisel Iglesias for second most in that span behind Kenley Jansen.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Alex Bregman Race Puts Bo Bichette In Play As Blue Jays Eye Tatsuya Imai","Los angeles dodgers secure edwin díaz on three-year $69 million deal to fix bullpen issues.
