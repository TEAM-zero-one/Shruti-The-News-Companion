NEW DELHI: India is favourably considering an invitation by the Maldives for PM Narendra Modi to visit the strategically important Indian Ocean country in July, ToI has learnt. This follows a strong reiteration of President Mohamed Muizzu’s 2024 invitation to Modi by Maldives foreign minister Abdulla Khaleel during his visit to India last week.While it’s too early to talk about the programme or agenda, It’s learnt that one of the dates being considered for Modi’s visit to the archipelago is July 26, the Maldives Independence Day. If it happens, it will be the first visit by Modi to the country since Muizzu assumed office in November 2023.Khaleel was in India last week for the third time this year, signaling an intent on the part of the Maldives to deepen ties with India amid concerns both here and in the West about its ties with China. Along with his counterpart S Jaishankar, Khaleel reviewed bilateral cooperation in a range of areas including the development partnership, defence and security and trade and investment. Jaishankar said after the meeting that India remained committed to Maldives’ progress and development and also thanked him for the solidarity with India on the issue of terrorism.Muizzu has continued to strongly maintain that the Maldives will not do anything to hurt India’s security interests and that his decision to force Indian military personnel out of the country was based purely on the Maldivian people’s desire for independence and non-interference in internal affairs.In an interview to Ceylon Today last week, the president said the Maldives will not allow its geographical location to be misused by any country for deliberate attempts that undermine the peace and stability in the Indian Ocean region. “Our approach will always be for regional peace and sovereignty, and fair diplomacy with everyone,’’ he said.India sees Maldives as a key maritime neighbour and an important partner in India’s Neighbourhood First policy and Vision MAHASAGAR (Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions). According to the Indian external affairs ministry, the visit was aimed at strengthening the Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership between the two countries. As Modi and Muizzu had said in a joint statement after the latter’s visit to India in October, 2024, this partnership will be people-centric, future-oriented and will act as an anchor of stability in the Indian Ocean Region. Among the big takeaways from that visit was a decision to initiate discussions on a Bilateral Free Trade Agreement focusing on trade in goods and services between the 2 countries.",India is favourably considering an invitation by the maldives for pm narendra modi to visit the strategically important indian ocean country in july.

Donald Trump, US Lied About India-Pak Ceasefire Role, Trade Deal During Op Sindoor: Ex-US Official

Pakistan's Strategic Bitcoin reserve plans

Pakistan’s scramble to please US President Donald Trump by establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve seems to have landed it in a soup! According to a report in the Dawn, senior officials in Islamabad have said that cryptocurrency remains banned in Pakistan. The State Bank of Pakistan and the Ministry of Finance both clarified that cryptocurrency transactions remain prohibited in Pakistan, with all such dealings considered unlawful under existing regulations.At a session of the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal explained that despite the recent establishment of a Crypto Council by the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif through executive order to explore digital asset policies, the prohibition on cryptocurrency remains enforced under SBP and SECP guidelines.According to the Dawn report, Bosal said, ""There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan."" He emphasised that formal legislation would be necessary to alter the current status.Also Read | Donald Trump’s trade policy thrown into turmoil!

NEW DELHI: After the Shashi Tharoor-led delegation to the US expressed disagreement over Colombia 's statement supporting Pakistan , the state withdrew its statement and ""will issue a statement of strong support for our position and understanding of our position,"" the Congress MP said.""We met with the foreign ministry - the senior vice minister received us. We had some good news: They have withdrawn their statement that disappointed us earlier and will issue a statement of strong support for our position and understanding of our position. Finally, here we are before this beautiful bust of Mahatma Gandhi on the campus of the main university,"" Tharoor said.Speaking to the reporters later, he said, ""There is no equivalence between those who attack our country and those who defend their own country, and our only disappointment with the earlier statement by Colombia was that it seemed to have overlooked this difference. We're very pleased to learn that that statement has been withdrawn as you've also mentioned, and we are also very pleased that you, as representatives of the people of Colombia, are determined to stand with us for our sovereignty, for peace in the world, for peace in the subcontinent of India and that you are very, very happy that this kind of dialogue will continue between our peoples and our representatives. ""Taranjit Singh Sandhu, former Indian ambassador to the United States and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, said that the delegation's comprehensive briefing was instrumental in prompting Colombia to reverse its stance.""This morning we had a detailed interaction with the acting Foreign Minister and our leader and the entire team made specific points to them explaining to them the timeline which perhaps to an extent they might have missed out. The end result was that they are withdrawing one of the other statements which had come out and have promised and stated, actually quite clearly, on terrorism and the issue. The importance of Colombia, apart from other reasons, is also that it will be a member of the Security Council soon,"" he said.Noting that Colombia understood India's position as it was once plagued by terrorism, BJP MP Shashank Mani said, ""It is notable that terrorism has affected Colombia as well. However, after a long struggle, Colombia is now a peaceful country. We have come here with a message of peace. We have clearly stated that we will give a fitting response to every terrorist attack, and when it is over, we want nothing but peace.""Tharoor voiced disappointment during a press conference in Bogotá on Thursday over Colombia’s stance. He noted that India was disheartened by the Colombian government’s decision to offer condolences for the casualties in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, instead of expressing solidarity with the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.""We were a little disappointed in the reaction of the Colombian government, which apparently expressed heartfelt condolences on the loss of lives in Pakistan after the Indian strikes, rather than sympathising with the victims of terrorism,"" said Tharoor.""We will say to our friends in Colombia, there can be no equivalence between those who dispatch terrorists and those who resist them. There can be no equivalence between those who attack and those who defend. We are only exercising our right of self-defence, and if there is any misunderstanding here, on this core, we are here to dispel any such misunderstanding"", he added.Tharoor is heading the multi-party delegation on a tour across the Americas as part of India’s global outreach to emphasize its zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism.

'We Had That Rectified': Shashi Tharoor Reveals What Led Colombia To Withdraw Remarks On Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: The all-party delegations visiting various countries to expose Pakistan post the Pahalgam attack seem to be becoming a headache for the Congress with senior party leader and former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid's recent remarks backing nullification of Article 370 in 2019 by the Modi government likely to discomfit the Congress. This comes after another delegation member, Shashi Tharoor, faced strong criticism from within the party for his statement that India crossed the line of control (LoC) to conduct surgical strikes ""for the first time"" under the Modi government.While addressing think tanks and academia in Indonesia on Friday, Khurshid said it was unfortunate that Pakistan wants to undo the prosperity that has come to Jammu & Kashmir following the abrogation. Khurshid is part of one of the seven- all party delegations currently touring various countries. The Congress had initially opposed the move to scrap Article 370. The party later nuanced its position and has since been ambivalent on the issue of restoration of the Article which granted J&K special status.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country.But Article 370 was abrogated, it was finally put to an end, because so much time had passed.,"" Khurshid said while addressing the Indonesian think tanks and academia.""Subsequently, there was an election with 65% participation. There's an elected government in Kashmir today, and therefore, for people to want to undo everything that has happened, the prosperity that has come to Kashmir, it is very unfortunate. It will give a setback to anybody,"" Khurshid further said.While the senior leadership made no comment on Khurshid's remarks, unease within the party has been brewing ever since the government announced the names for the 51 members of the all-party delegations. The Congress had accused the Modi government of ""complete insincerity"" and for playing ""cheap political games"" while highlighting that ""regrettably"" only one of the four names suggested by the Congress leadership has been included. However, the opposition party relented, allowing ""eminent"" party members selected by the government to go with the delegations and make their contribution.The Congress had submitted the names of Anand Sharma, Gaurav Gogoi, Syed Naseer Hussain, and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring. However, the delegation finalised by the government includes Shashi Tharoor who is leading a delegation.

Poll Do you believe the India-Pakistan truce was primarily a result of bilateral negotiations? Yes, it was purely bilateral. No, there was third-party involvement.

NEW DELHI: An all-party delegation on Sunday explained in detail how India-Pakistan truce was reached on May 10 which eventually led to the cessation of military operations by the two nations against each other. This comes amid US President Donald Trump's consistent claims about using trade as a was deterrent between the two nations.Reiterating the Centre's stance that the truce was purely bilateral and initiated by Pakistan, JDU MP Sanjay Kumar Jha, who is leading an all-party delegation, said that Pakistani DGMO (Director General of Military Operations) called for the ceasefire but there was a ""problem with the hotline"".""If I tell you specifically, they tried in the morning for the ceasefire, the DGMO of Pakistan, but there was a problem with the hotline.

The central government has, at several occasions denied any third-party mediation in the ceasefire.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people. The operation targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of over 100 militants from groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen.Pakistan retaliated with shelling and drone attacks, prompting India to strike radar systems, communication hubs, and airfields at 11 Pakistani airbases.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is currently carrying out extensive Capacity Development Demonstrations at multiple key locations across India, including Pokhran Field Firing Ranges, Babina Field Firing Ranges, and Joshimath. Separate air defence demonstrations are scheduled at Agra and Gopalpur. These trials are being conducted under simulated operational conditions, with integrated electronic warfare (EW) environments to rigorously evaluate the performance of advanced defence systems.Earlier this week, Chief of the Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi visited the Babina Field Firing Ranges, where he reviewed the ongoing trials and engaged with all stakeholders, including defence industry partners and Army officials.The demonstrations are part of the Indian Army’s larger roadmap for a “Decade of Transformation” and aim to fast-track the absorption of emerging technologies, particularly those developed under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative. A wide range of platforms is undergoing trials, showcasing the synergy between the Indian Army and indigenous defence manufacturers.Key systems being evaluated include:These demonstrations are designed to assess combat viability and ensure that the Indian Army remains technologically superior and operationally prepared for future conflicts.The trials underscore the Army’s commitment to strengthening national defence through indigenous innovation and self-reliance.The latest trials come days after India launched Operation Sindoor, retaliatory strikes deep into Pakistani territory and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir following the Pahalgam terror attack, which killed 26 people, including civilians.Speaking at rallies in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Operation Sindoor as a powerful demonstration of India's indigenous defence capabilities, asserting that the operation was ""just an arrow in the quiver"" and not over yet.The PM issued a stern warning to terror outfits, saying that if terrorism “tries to raise its hood again, it will be dragged out of its hole and trampled.”The Prime Minister said the armed forces used domestically developed weapons, including BrahMos missiles, to destroy terror hideouts and military installations, compelling Pakistan to “plead to stop the war.”By showcasing advanced indigenous technologies during the Army’s ongoing trials, the military is reaffirming India’s commitment to self-reliance in defence. The synergy between the Army’s field evaluations and the government's Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative underlines a broader strategic vision to deter future threats with homegrown firepower.","The indian army is carrying out capacity development demonstrations across india.

'Kamalesan's behaviour was against secular norms of Army'

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has upheld the 2017 termination of an Army officer who refused to participate in regimental weekly religious parades on the grounds that he belonged to the Christian faith.Samuel Kamalesan had challenged his dismissal without pension and gratuity, and sought reinstatement in service. In a May 30 order, a division bench of Justice Navin Chawla and Justice Shalinder Kaur said: ""Our armed forces comprise personnel of all religions, castes, creeds, regions and faiths, whose sole motto is to safeguard the country from external aggressions... They are united by their uniform rather than divided by their religion, caste or region. ""Kamalesan was commissioned in Army in March 2017 as a lieutenant in the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, which comprises three squadrons of Sikh, Jat and Rajput personnel. He was made the troop leader of Squadron B, which comprises Sikh personnel.In his plea, Kamalesan stated that his regiment maintained only a mandir and a gurdwara for its religious needs and parades, and not a sarv dharm sthal, which would serve persons of all faiths.He noted that there was no church on the premises.The bench observed that while regiments in the armed forces may historically bear names associated with religion or region, it does not undermine the secular ethos of the institution or of personnel posted in these regiments.""There are also war cries which, to an outsider, may sound religious in nature; however, they serve a purely motivational function, intended to foster solidarity and unity among the troops. At the same time, the armed forces also give due respect to the religious beliefs of their personnel,"" the bench noted.HC observed that Kamalesan kept his religion above a lawful command from his superior, which was clearly an act of indiscipline. ""While, to a civilian, it may appear harsh and even sound far-fetched, the standard of discipline required for the armed forces is different,"" it said.The bench stated the termination order specifically noted that Kamalesan's undisciplined behaviour was against all secular norms of Indian Army and adversely affected the traditional camaraderie between officers and troops of the regiment.Noting that Army organised several counselling sessions for Kamalesan, the court concluded that the decision of termination was taken after careful consideration of the specific circumstances of the case and potential consequences of different courses of action.","Delhi high court upheld the 2017 termination of an army officer who refused to participate in regimental religious parades.

Poll Do you believe India's initial losses in fighter jets during Operation Sindoor were significant? Yes, they were significant No, they were not significant

India-Pak conflict came nowhere close to N-faceoff: CDS

NEW DELHI: India did lose some fighter jets during the strikes on nine terror hubs in Pakistan and POK and the consequent retaliation on May 7, but then changed tactics to inflict major damage on airbases deep across the border before the ceasefire three days later, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan said on Saturday.The CDS did not specify the exact number of jets India lost but asserted that Pakistan's claim of having shot down six IAF aircraft, including three French-origin Rafales, was ""absolutely incorrect"" in separate interviews to Reuters TV and Bloomberg TV on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.Gen Chauhan's admission of India's initial setbacks during Operation Sindoor is the most direct since director -general of air operations Air Marshal A K Bharti on May 11 said losses were part of any combat situation but ""all our pilots are back home"", implying that they had ejected safely after their jets were hit by enemy fire.""What I can say is on May 7, in the initial stages, there were losses,"" Gen Chauhan said.Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan said the conflict with Pakistan from May 7 to May 10, which saw reciprocal air, missile, drone and artillery strikes, never came anywhere close to the point of nuclear conflagration, with both sides “displaying a lot of rationality in their thoughts as well as actions”.In another interview on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, the CDS further said, “The good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and flew all our jets again, targeting at long range.”Gen Chauhan was also dismissive of the effectiveness of Pakistan’s air defence systems of Chinese-origin like HQ-9 missile batteries and radars as well as the use of Turkish-origin Byker Yiha kamikaze drones and Asisguard Songar drones. “They didn’t work. We were able to do precision strikes on heavily air-defended airfields of Pakistan 300km deep inside, with the precision of a metre,” he said.Pakistan was obviously prepared for the initial Indian strikes on May 7, which saw the IAF and Army hit four terror hubs in Pakistan and five in PoK, with fighter-launched missiles and ‘smart’ bombs as well as Kamikaze drones and extended range artillery shells between 1.05 am and 1.30 am.India immediately made it clear that the aim was to hit only terror infrastructure, and no military bases were targeted. Pakistan, however, chose to escalate the situation, which included launching waves of drones and some missiles to target Indian airbases, military assets and civilian areas.The IAF then struck nine Pakistani airbases and at least three radar sites, a few of them close to nuclear facilities as well as command and control structures, with Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 fighters using BrahMos, Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles, among other precision munitions, for the calibrated pinpoint strikes, as was reported by TOI.Gen Chauhan, on his part, declined to comment on President Donald Trump’s claim that the US brokered the ceasefire to help avert a nuclear war but said it was “far-fetched” to suggest either side was close to using nuclear weapons. Pakistan’s chairman of joint chiefs of staff Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza had made the same point a day ago, also on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, but had stressed that a “strategic miscalculation” cannot be ruled out in the future.Gen Chauhan, however, said “people in uniform” were actually the “most rational” since they understand the consequences. “In every step that happened during Operation Sindoor, I found both sides displaying a lot of rationality in their thoughts as well as actions. So, why should we assume that in the nuclear domain, there will be irrationality on someone else’s part,” he said.There is “a lot of space” between the conduct of conventional operations and the nuclear threshold, the CDS said, adding that channels of communication with Pakistan “were always open” to control the situation and there were “more sub-ladders” on the escalation ladder that “can be exploited to settle our issues”.",India did lose some fighter jets during the strikes on nine terror hubs in pakistan and pok and the consequent retaliation on may 7.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season with a major dip in live storage at its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - and the ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab river inflows due to regulation of water flow by India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.The situation may further aggravate this month during early kharif sowing and this is possibly what prompted Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to raise concerns at a conference on glacier preservation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, last week to draw global attention to India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Latest estimates by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA) show the country is already facing an overall shortage of 21% in water flow and around 50% in live storage of the two key dams which play a crucial role in providing water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan and generating hydropower.Referring to its latest assessment of availability of water for summer sowing operations during May-Sept, the IRSA in its statement ""noted with concern"" that the ""sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortage in early kharif season"".It declared an overall shortage of 21% and advised dam authorities and irrigation supply monitoring agencies to use water from reservoirs judiciously, ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Though the situation may improve with monsoon rainfall in the catchment area, possibly by next month, Pakistan's farming operations will depend more on how India regulates the flow through limited infrastructure of its own reservoirs - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.India has, so far, only flushed these reservoirs and made additional water storage available by clearing sediments. Besides, it also stopped sharing water flow data with Pakistan after putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam massacre.Publicly available information on live storage of Pakistan's critical reservoirs shows that Mangla dam is currently left with less than 50% of its fill level (2.7 million acre feet out of the total capacity of 5.9 MAF) whereas Tarbela dam's live storage is slightly over 50% (6 MFA) of its total capacity of 11.6 MFA.Officials here believe that since India is under no obligation to share water flow data with Pakistan after suspending the IWT, it would be difficult for the neighbouring country to even manage floods during the peak flow season once monsoon hits the catchment areas of the Indus river system as a large part of it falls within India.Farming operations in two provinces of Pakistan, Punjab and Sindh, fully depend on irrigation canals linked to the Indus river system, which gets almost its entire waters from the western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. Though India has full rights on the waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) under the IWT, inadequate infrastructure to use the waters by the Indian side benefits Pakistan.India is permitted to construct water storage facilities on western rivers up to 3.6 MAF but has not been able to fully utilise this, making Pakistan a beneficiary by default.","Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season.

For the first time in 6 years, PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17. There’s no official invitation yet from Canada for the meeting in Alberta but Modi in all likelihood would not have travelled to the North American country in any case, especially when India still isn’t sure the new government in Ottawa will be more receptive to its concerns about the activities of Khalistan separatists.A Canadian G7 spokesperson didn’t confirm to TOI late on Sunday if Modi was going to be invited.Any eleventh-hour invitation is unlikely to be considered by India because of logistical constraints, likely efforts by the separatists to disrupt the visit and the strained bilateral ties that both Modi and his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney have committed to improve. A bilateral meeting on the margins could have provided an opportunity for the leaders to jointly reaffirm their commitment to rebuilding ties.Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance, but reports in the Canadian media say Ottawa has invited the leaders of Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Ukraine and Brazil. This will be the first time that he won’t be at the meeting of the economically most advanced group of nations since France invited him for the summit in 2019.His presence at the summit of what is also an informal grouping of like-minded democracies has been seen as a sign of India’s growing role in shaping up the global agenda and addressing transnational issues.The Sikh separatists last week called upon the Carney government to not invite the Indian PM, citing India’s alleged reluctance to cooperate in the investigations into the killing of separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau blamed the Indian government for the murder without backing up his claim, as Indian has repeatedly said, with any evidence. The diplomatic row that followed saw the relationship hitting an all-time low as both sides expelled each other’s diplomats for activities hostile to the host nation.Carney has so far not explicitly spoken on the Nijjar issue but, while talking about his plans to use trade to reset ties, has said that Canada is not responsible for the strain on the relationship with India. India is hoping that Carney will act more responsibly than Trudeau in his handling of the case and has said it is ready to work with Ottawa based on mutual trust and sensitivity. India wants Canada to ensure foolproof security for Indian diplomats and also crack down on extremists and secessionists indulging in anti-India activities.",Pm narendra modi is unlikely to be a part of the g7 summit that is being hosted this year by canada june15-17.

Poll hould there be a comprehensive review of India's defense preparedness? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday targeted the Modi government following the remarks made by Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Operation Sindoor in an interview in Singapore. Kharge claimed that the nation had been misled and demanded a special session of Parliament to address the issue.“In the wake of the remarks made by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) in Singapore in an interview, there are some very important questions which need to be asked. These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened. The Modi Govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing,” Kharge said in a post on X.Kharge referenced CDS Chauhan who had earlier today, firmly dismissed Pakistan's claims that it had downed six Indian warplanes during Operation Sindoor, describing the statement as ""absolutely incorrect"". Speaking toduring the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, he said, ""What is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being downed."" He explained that the Indian Armed Forces identified tactical errors, corrected them, and resumed operations within two days.Also read: What CDS Anil Chauhan said on Pakistan's claim of downing India jets during Operation Sindoor Kharge lauded the bravery of IAF pilots, saying: “Our IAF pilots were risking their lives fighting the enemy. We have suffered some losses, but our pilots were safe. We salute their resolute courage and bravery.” However, he stressed that a “comprehensive strategic review is the need of the hour.”“The Congress party demands a Comprehensive Review of our Defence Preparedness by an independent expert committee, on the lines of the Kargil Review Committee,” he added.Kharge also raised concerns over US President Donald Trump’s repeated claim that he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. “This is a direct affront to the Shimla Agreement,” he said, questioning why the Modi government had not provided clarity on Trump’s assertions or the affidavit filed by the US Secretary of Commerce in a United States court.“Instead of clarifying Mr. Trump's repeated assertions, and the affidavit filed by US Secretary of Commerce in the United States Court of International Trade, PM Modi is on an election blitz, taking PERSONAL CREDIT for the valour of our Armed Forces, hiding behind their bravery and dodging the contours of the agreed CEASEFIRE, which the Foreign Secretary announced on 10th, after Mr. Trump's tweet,” Kharge said. “Is India and Pakistan now again hyphenated? What are the conditions of the CEASEFIRE agreement? Rs 140 Cr Patriotic Indians deserve to know this. ”Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh echoed Kharge’s concerns, criticising the lack of transparency from the government. “It is an extraordinary and telling commentary on Undeclared Emergency that the PM will not chair all-party meetings and will not take Parliament into confidence but the nation gets to know of the first phase of Operation Sindoor through the CDS’s interview in Singapore,” Ramesh posted on X. “Couldn't opposition leaders have been taken into confidence by the PM earlier?”General Chauhan, while speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, rejected the idea that India and Pakistan had approached nuclear confrontation, calling such claims “far-fetched.” He also dismissed Pakistan’s claims about the success of Chinese-supplied weapons, saying they “didn’t work,” and asserted that India had conducted precision strikes 300 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory.",Congress president mallikarjun kharge targeted the modi government following the remarks made by chief of defence staff (cds) general anil chauhan on operation sindoor.

27-year-old Irish fighterraised eyebrows across the internet with his apparently yelledafter landing some of the brutal elbows upon his opponent, Shuki Farage, at the Cage Warriors 189 event. Held in Rome, Italy, the event was headlined by the welterweight bout between Giacomo Michelis and Sado Ucar.

Ahead of the bout, the Israel-based fighter was quite confident about defeating the Irish fighter. Farage even used phrases like ‘take down’ and ‘pound his face’ in order to guarantee his win against McCorry. However, that didn’t pan out according to the fighter’s plans and instead faced the echoing chants from both the audience and his opponent.The Israel-Palestine issue is an ongoing crisis that has claimed the lives of many innocent souls.A recent airstrike near an aid distribution centre in Rafa also claimed the lives of 30 people, which adds to the number of victims of this conflict every other day. The residents of the Gaza Strip are now on the brink of ‘catastrophic hunger,’ which raises another issue in the books of international relations.The users of the internet are divided on McCorry yelling the slogan, while some support the fighter, others believe that chanting the slogan brings unnecessary political aspects into the world of sports. Pictures of the Israel-based fighter, Farage, go viral across social media, where the fighter is seen holding weapons during his days as a soldier. The fighter’s social media accounts across Instagram, X and others remain deactivated post the incident.Following the video of the slogan going viral, McCorry himself posted the same video where the fighter is seen landing elbows on his opponent and chanting “Free Palestine.” McCorry captioned the video as “Street Justice.”Also read: Veteran Jamaican boxer and Hall of Famer Mike McCallum passes away at the age of 68 McCorry’s win has been celebrated hugely by the audience owing to the fact that Farage’s presence within the cage was not just viewed as a mere everyday opponent but a symbolic representation of the ongoing injustice executed upon the residents of Palestine. His standing within the cage was representing the machinery of occupation and violence for most of the audiences. After securing the win, McCorry was seen raising the Palestine flag as a symbol of support for the people of the country. The fighter even seemingly added the slogan during his victory announcement in order to further solidify his stance on the issue.","Irish fighter paddy mccorry was defeated by israel-based fighter shuki farage.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N nvidia ceo jensen huang blasts biden-era ai chip export policy.
