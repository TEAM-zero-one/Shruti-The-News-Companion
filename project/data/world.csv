NEW DELHI: Congress leader Udit Raj on Sunday strongly criticised his party colleague Shashi Tharoor for his remarks over the Pahalgam terror attack , questioning Tharoor's loyalty to the party.Speaking to ANI, Raj asked, ""Is Shashi Tharoor in the Congress party or the BJP? Is he trying to become a super-BJP man?"" He further challenged Tharoor to question the BJP government about their plans regarding PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) and questioned whether he had become ""the BJP's advocate.""“I want to ask him which terrorist attack occurred in America after 9/11? Has the BJP made him its spokesperson?"" Raj asked.Shashi Tharoor on Sunday had said that the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack may have resulted from an intelligence failure, comparing it to the October 7, 2023, Hamas strike that caught Israel — known for its robust intelligence network — by surprise.Speaking to ANI, Tharoor had said, ""Obviously, there was no full proof intelligence. There was some failure... But we have got the example of Israel, the world's best intelligence services according to everybody, which were taken by surprise on October 7, just two years ago. It seems to me, just as Israel is waiting till the end of the war before they demand accountability, similarly, I think we too should see the present crisis through and then demand accountability from the government. No country can ever have a foolproof 100 per cent intelligence.""Tharoor also added that while successful prevention of terror attacks often goes unnoticed, failures tend to attract greater attention.""We will never know about the various terror attacks that were successfully thwarted. We only learn about the ones that we failed to thwart. This is normal in any nation. There were failures, I agree, but that should not be our main focus right now...,"" the Congress leader said.The April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, targeted tourists, leaving 26 people dead. The victims were shot near Baisaran Meadow, a well-known tourist spot. It is one of the deadliest attacks in the region since the 2019 Pulwama attack.","Congress leader udit raj questioned shashi tharoor's loyalty to the party.

Poll Do you believe the local overground workers (OGWs) played a significant role in facilitating the Pahalgam attack? No, they were just bystanders. Yes, they were crucial facilitators.

Attackers may still be holed up in dense Pahalgam forests

NEW DELHI: Fifteen local Kashmiri overground workers (OGWs) and terror aides have been identified, based on electronic surveillance, as the key suspects who may have facilitated the Pakistani assailants behind the Pahalgam carnage. They are believed to have arranged logistics and, possibly, also received arms consignments from Pakistan.Sources said the multi-agency probe has zeroed in on five prime suspects, of whom three have been ""picked up"", and may eventually face arrest. Police are on the lookout for the two other OGWs. All five were in the vicinity on the day of the strike, and earlier: their phones were active in the area.Electronic surveillance threw up a chat in which the three detained prime suspects are talking to each other about Pakistani terrorists in Pahalgam and how to ""help"" them.Meanwhile, more than 200 OGWs have been detained for questioning to trace the likely events leading up to the attack, said sources.Sources said there is enough circumstantial evidence pointing to the role of all five in the Pahalgam strike. Ten other OGWs are being questioned by a joint interrogation team comprising investigators from NIA, J&K Police, Intelligence Bureau and RAW, as they are known to have helped Pakistan terrorists in Kashmir in the past and happened to be in the vicinity of the attack site on April 22.The 15 local terror aides - all from south Kashmir - are already 'indexed' by the J&K police as OGWs and are believed to have facilitated Pakistani terrorists involved in multiple attacks across south Kashmir over the past couple of years, helping with logistics, guiding them through the jungles and even receiving consignments of arms from Pakistan for use in terror strikes,"" a source told TOI.Also read: After Pahalgam attack, terrorist Adil’s family loses home ""There is enough circumstantial evidence pointing to their role as facilitators and in arranging logistics for the Pahalgam attack team, which comprised 4-5 terrorists, of whom at least two were Pakistanis and two local Kashmiris.

These are OGWs known to be in touch with, shelter and act as 'guides' to Pakistani terrorists. We are sifting through OGW database, having questioned over 1,500 of them, and have now zeroed in on 15 likely suspects. At the same time, other OGWs active in south Kashmir are being questioned to fill us in on the identity of Pakistani terrorists seen in the area and their possible hideouts,"" said an officer.Sources said security personnel combing the forests encircling Baisaran for escaped terrorists, have further intensified the search. With the search in adjoining towns and districts throwing up no sign of attackers yet, there is suspicion that they may still be holed up in dense forests into which the meadow merges.Also read: Pahalgam Terror Attack Live Updates",15 local kashmiri overground workers (ogws) and terror aides identified as key suspects.

"UNSC condemns attack, but Pak works to water it down",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-backed-by-china-dilutes-unsc-statement/articleshow/120654925.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

Poll Do you think the UN's response to terrorist attacks is consistent? No, it varies based on the situation. Yes, it follows a standard protocol.

A non-permanent member of the UN Security Council (UNSC), Pakistan joined other Council member-states in strongly condemning the Pahalgam terrorist attack but not before working to water it down with help from China. Pakistan, which has denied any role in the massacre that claimed 26 lives, had so far not condemned the attack even though it expressed concerns at the loss of tourists’ lives in the attack.The Council members underlined the need for international collaboration to bring the perpetrators of the “reprehensible act of terrorism” to justice. However, while the Council’s condemnation of the Pulwama attack in 2019 called upon all States to cooperative actively with the “Government of India” in that regard, on this occasion it only asked them to do the same with “all relevant authorities”. In the case of Pulwama, the condemnation statement sought cooperation with both - the Indian government and relevant authorities.“Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,” said the Council, adding that such acts are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.TOI has learnt that the consensus over the statement, proposed by the US, was preceded by some tough negotiations that saw Pakistan working with China to dilute its phrasing. In condemning several such terrorist attacks in the past, like in Pulwama and also Pakistan’s own Jaffar Express train attack in March this year, the Council had urged all States to cooperate actively with the local government and not just relevant authorities. Islamabad probably felt that a specific mention of the Indian government would give India a stick to beat it with. Instead of backing Indian investigations, Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif said Saturday that Pakistan is open to a “neutral and transparent” probe into the attack.In the Pahalgam statement, the Council condemned “in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir”, while in the case of Pulwama, it condemned again in the strongest terms the “heinous and cowardly suicide bombing”. On both occasions though, the Council said the attacks took place in Jammu and Kashmir, the term which India uses for the union territory and erstwhile state. The rest of the statement was as per the standard format used by the UNSC for condemning such attacks. Like in the case of Pulwama, the Council said in its Pahalgam statement too that the perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsores of the “reprehensible act of terrorism” had to be held accountable and brought to justice. In the Pulwama statement, the Council had named Jaish-e-Mohamed for carrying out the attack but in the Pahalgam condemnation it didn’t mention the name of any terror outfit.“Ambassadors reaffirmed the need for States to “combat by all means” threats to international peace and security resulting from acts of terrorism, in accordance with the UN Charter and other obligations under international law,’’ said a UN press statement. Meanwhile, a spokesperson said Saturday that the UN continued to monitor developments in the region “with very deep concern” and urged India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint to ensure the situation does not deteriorate further.","Pakistan joined other council member-states in strongly condemning the pahalgam terrorist attack but not before working to water it down with help from china.

Poll Do you agree with Karnataka minister TB Thimmapur's statement regarding the terrorists not asking about the victims' religion? No, I disagree. Yes, I agree.

NEW DELHI: The Congress party came under intense criticism on Sunday as Karnataka minister TB Thimmapur said he ""personally didn't think"" terrorists ascertained the religion of the victims before killing them in Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22.Despite the family members of the victims claiming that terrorists opened fire at those who were Hindus, the Congress leader said religious colour was given to the massacre to ""cover up intelligence failure"".""I personally don't think the assailants would have asked the name and religion of the tourists...It is not just to add religious colour to cover up an intelligence failure,"" Thimmapur was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The BJP unleashed a piercing attack on the Congress over the minister's remark, saying the party has been ""playing good cop, bad cop"" and that Thimmapur's comment was an ""insult to the victims"".""Congress is playing 'good cop, bad cop'. On one hand, in the all-party meeting, they say that they will fully support. On the other hand, they make their leaders give statements which insult the victims and give cover fire to Pakistan. They all know that the terror masters of Pakistan have carried out this terrorist attack in Pahalgam... Congress leaders of Karnataka say that the terrorists did not ask about religion. This is an insult to the statements of the victim,"" said BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari.Bhandari further alleged that Congress was trying to give a clean chit to Pakistan like it did after the 26/11 terror attack in Mumbai.""All this proves that just like after 26/11, the Congress party was trying every possible way to give a clean chit to Pakistan, under the same policy, today they are trying to give a clean chit to Pakistan... This is not the time for politics, this is the time when the country has to be united... The country is united and it knows that under the leadership of PM Modi, we will give a befitting reply to Pakistan,"" Bhandari said.Earlier in the day, Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah clarified his remarks suggesting there was ""no need for war"" with Pakistan following the deadly Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.""I mentioned that war is inevitable but must be with Pakistan. I did not say there should be no war at all. It is the central government’s responsibility to ensure security. In the Pahalgam incident, 26 people lost their lives.

It showed a shift in mindset — from a society in which some significant sections may have accorded social sanctity to the concept of violence, to a society which marched in thousands across villages and towns condemning violence, thereby signifying the social stigmatisation of violence,” he said.“This is a monumental shift, a milestone. But at the same time, a fragile shift. I hope those in charge of law and order do understand the significance of the shift and don’t do anything erroneously that impedes the shift or facilitates a return to the earlier mindset.”He said there is a general feeling across the Valley that entire families are being punished for the actions of one person.","Jammu and kashmir cm omar abdullah, pdp chief mehbooba mufti and people’s conference chief sajad lone have warned amid a massive crackdown on terrorists.

Thus, all Pakistani citizens in India on these visas were required to time their exits accordingly.Sources in agencies manning the Attari ICP told TOI that 191 Pakistani nationals had returned to their home country on April 25 by crossing over to Wagah, followed by 81 Pakistanis on April 26 and 237 the day after.The deadlines for 13 or the 14 categories of visas issued by India to Pakistanis expired by Sunday.

Some Pakistanis may have returned home through the air route via a third country, given that no direct flights currently operate between India and Pakistan, but no data in this regard was immediately available.The home ministry had last week asked all the states - both through phone calls from home minister Amit Shah to the chief ministers and during a video-conference chaired by Union home secretary Govind Mohan with the state/UT chief secretaries and DGPs - to identify all Pakistani visitors within their jurisdiction and ensure that they exit India within the set deadlines. The states/UTs were also told to ensure suitable action against Pakistanis who fail to adhere to the deadlines, which sources said may include deportation and proceedings under the Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025.Under the Immigration and Foreigners Act, any foreigner who overstays the period for which a visa was issued to him, could face up to three years in jail and/or up to Rs 3 lakh fine.","As many as 509 pakistani nationals exited india via the attari integrated check post between april 25 and 27. 744 indian nationals returned from pakistan via wagah in the same period.

Several CJIs told TOI that they would attend the SCO conference only when the court was on vacation. If such conferences clashed with the working of SC, then a senior judge was assigned to attend it, they said. Even when India hosted the SCO CJs conference in 2023, the then CJI did not not miss judicial work in the courtroom even for a day.SC had a five-day holiday from April 10 to 14, during which the CJI had vacationed in Port Blair. He held court from April 15 to 17. The court was closed on April 18 because of Good Friday and then the weekend followed. When the court reopened on April 21, the CJI had left for China for the SCO conference.

The first is to decide the prayer for stay of certain provisions of the Waqf (Amendment) Act sought by more than 150 Muslim petitioners but opposed by the Centre. The second is to decide on the course of action - whether to direct lodging of FIR or close the case - against Justice Yashwant Varma from whose official residence in Delhi a huge pile of cash was found on the night of March 14.On March 22, the CJI had appointed a three-member judicial panel to inquire into the incident.",Cji sanjiv khanna left for china on monday last week to attend the conference of chief justices of supreme courts of shanghai cooperation organisation (sco) countries being held in hangzhou.
