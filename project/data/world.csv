NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday issued a strong warning to Pakistan , saying that ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ is not over yet and any future act of terrorism against India would invite severe consequences.“Any terror attack on the soil of India will prove disastrous for Pakistan. India is ready to take any type of action against terrorism,” Singh said while addressing soldiers at the Northern Command headquarters in Udhampur, where he participated in International Yoga Day celebrations.With Army chief Upendra Dwivedi by his side, he added, “Operation Sindoor is not over yet... through this operation, we have told Pakistan that continuing terrorism against India will not be tolerated and the response will get from bad to worse.”Under Operation Sindoor, the Armed Forces targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir during the night of May 6 and 7. The strikes were carried out in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, which claimed the lives of 26 people, most of them tourists.Singh described Operation Sindoor as a natural extension of the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 air strike across the border.“We conveyed to Pakistan that its policy of thousand cuts against India will not succeed,” the defence minister asserted.Later, while attending the ‘barakhana’ organised on the eve of Yoga Day, the Union Minister encouraged army personnel to prioritise their physical and mental well-being, emphasizing the crucial role of strength and wellness in a soldier’s life.“If you are strong, our borders will be strong. When the borders are strong, India will be strong,” he said.","“any terror attack on the soil of india will prove disastrous for pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday led the 11th International Yoga Day celebrations in Andhra Pradesh's Visakhapatnam, and pointing to global tensions, described yoga as an exercise which brings peace to mind.""Unfortunately, today the entire world is going through some tension, unrest, and instability have been increasing in many regions. In such times, yoga gives us the direction of peace.

It is a universal gift that unites humanity in health, harmony, and consciousness,"" he stated.PM Modi also recalled India's initiative at the United Nations in 2014 to declare June 21 as International Yoga Day, a move which would receive wide global support in a short span of time.""Remarkably, in a very short span of time, 175 countries came forward to support this initiative.Such unity and overwhelming global support was truly extraordinary. This was not just about agreeing to a proposal, it was a collective step taken for the betterment of humanity. It reflected a shared vision for a healthier, more conscious world. Today, in 2025, we can proudly see that yoga has become an integral part of many people's lives across the globe,"" the prime minister said.Further, he highlighted how yoga has reached every corner of the planet - be it the steps of the Sydney Opera House, the peaks of Everest, or the expanse of the ocean.The Yoga Day event took place against the scenic backdrop of the Visakhapatnam coastline, with Indian Navy ships stationed near the shore.",Pm narendra modi led the 11th international yoga day celebrations in andhra pradesh's visakhapatnam.

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Dragging his feet to the truth after repeated denials, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday admitted that India struck Rawalpindi's Nur Khan airbase and the Shorkot airbase during Operation Sindoor , which was carried to avenge the Pahalgam terrorist attack, in which ISI-groomed terrorists killed 26 civilians.India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7. Within 45 minutes of the strike, Saudi Prince Faisal offered to speak to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on behalf of Pakistan's deputy PM, seeking to halt further action against Pakistan.Dar's statement strongly suggests that Islamabad desperately scrambled to find help in persuading India to halt its kinetic action, which was ""precise, measured and non-escalatory"". Pakistan air force Base Nur Khan, situated in Chaklala, Rawalpindi is around 10km from Islamabad, Pakistan capital. It is an active airbase that encompasses the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport within its grounds.The facility, originally established as RAF Station Chaklala and later known as PAF Base Chaklala, continues to serve as a vital military installation in Pakistan.The base is also home to PAF College Chaklala, which trains Aviation Cadets, and Fazaia Inter College Nur Khan, providing additional educational facilities on the premises.Imtiaz Gul, a defence analyst, claimed that the strategically important Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi is “under American control.”Pakistan air force base Rafiqui, situated near Shorkot in Jhang District, is a major military installation located 337 kilometers south of Islamabad. The base features a 10,000-foot runway with a parallel taxiway that serves as an emergency landing strip.The airbase was previously known as PAF Base Shorkot before being renamed after Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui, a fighter pilot from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.The base's infrastructure includes a primary runway and an emergency taxiway system that allows for aircraft recovery operations when needed.Operation Sindoor was India's swift, calculated tri‑service cross-border assault on the dead night of May 6 and 7, targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the brutal April 22 Pahalgam massacre that claimed 26 innocent lives.Within 25 minutes, India’s Army, Navy and Air Force deployed SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER smart bombs, loitering munitions and ground-to-ground weaponry, killing around 70 to 100 militants and crippling key Lashkar‑e‑Taiba, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure at Bahalwalpur and Muridke in Pakistan.Pahalgam's terrorists thought they were sending a message when they murdered husbands in front of their wives, after selecting victims by their religion. Via the name Operation Sindoor, the government sent an immeasurably bigger message back as India avenged the loss suffered by those women.Sindoor, vermillion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. Pakistan's military-intelligence-jihadi complex would have been among the first to note the image put out by Indian Army right after government's confirmation of the strikes - Operation Sindoor in block letters, with the first 'O' represented by a bowl of vermillion.","Pak deputy pm ishaq dar reveals pakistan sought saudi help to stop india’s operation sindoor.

Air India crash: Importance of Black Box

Black Box: Decoding Air India plane crash

Air India Ahmedabad plane crash: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) will determine where to decode the black box from Air India's crashed Dreamliner, according to a government announcement on Thursday. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has launched a comprehensive investigation into the June 12 incident that claimed approximately 270 lives, utilising a team of experts from various disciplines.""It has been reported that the CVR/DFDR (black box) from the ill-fated AI171 flight is being sent abroad for retrieval and analysis...The decision regarding the location for decoding the flight recorders will be taken by the AAIB after due assessment of all technical, safety, and security considerations,"" the statement said.Earlier today, an ET report had said that India plans to send the severely damaged black box from the Air India Boeing 787 crash to the United States for detailed analysis. Due to extensive fire damage after the plane crash, data extraction in India has proven unfeasible, the report had said.The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), collectively known as black box, are painted bright orange and are near the aircraft's tail section where crash impact is typically minimal.However, these devices often sustain significant damage from crash impact or subsequent fires.The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) will undergo examination at the National Safety Transport Board (NTSB) laboratory in Washington, sources had told ET.Meanwhile, Air India's CEO and Managing Director Campbell Wilson has said that the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner involved in the crash had received proper maintenance and underwent a significant inspection in June 2023, with its next check scheduled for December 2025.Read | Air India crash: Govt tightens aircraft safety rules; structures violating height limit under lens During crash investigations, the black boxes provide vital information. The flight data recorder captures essential technical measurements including timing, altitude and airspeed, whilst the CVR stores important audio data from the cockpit, encompassing pilot dialogues and background sounds such as electronic warning signals from cockpit systems.According to the source quoted by the financial daily, retrieving data from these recording devices can take anywhere between two days to several months, based on how severely the units are damaged.""Due to damage to the recorder, we need to extract the chip by removing the memory board to prevent further data loss. We also need to evaluate the condition of the electronic circuit,"" the person explained.The Boeing 787, similar to other modern aircraft, is made with multiple backup systems and duplicate critical components to ensure operational safety and reliability. The aircraft is capable of maintaining flight for 345 minutes using a single engine, even with various system malfunctions.The investigation team is analysing several scenarios, including whether wing flaps were correctly deployed and the reason for landing gear deployment. They are also investigating potential electronic malfunctions or fuel contamination that could cause engine failures.The pilot's final communication was a single Mayday emergency call. According to Samir Kumar Sinha, secretary of the civil aviation ministry, there was no subsequent response to air traffic control.Also read| Former Air India staffers claim they exposed Boeing 787 Dreamliner door glitch in 2024; seek PM Narendra Modi's intervention","The aircraft accident investigation bureau has launched a comprehensive investigation into the june 12 incident that claimed approximately 270 lives.

Regional conflict still looms large





A week into the war between Israel and Iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue . The conflict was triggered by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets last Friday, prompting swift retaliation from Tehran. Hundreds have died, and fears are mounting of a wider regional escalation.Also read: Iran strikes southern Israel; thick black smoke fills sky as missile hits high-rise apartment In the midst of this turmoil, US President Donald Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the United States will intervene militarily, depending on the prospect of renewed nuclear negotiations. Israeli leaders, meanwhile, continue to issue aggressive statements, with Defence Minister Israel Katz saying Iran's Supreme Leader “should not continue to exist.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out a large-scale overnight operation in Tehran, targeting “dozens of military industrial sites for missile production” and the Spand nuclear R&D headquarters. According to the IDF, over 60 fighter jets struck around 120 targets using “precise intelligence guidance.”“These sites were built over years and were the industrial centre of gravity of the Iranian Ministry of Defence,” the IDF said, adding that it also struck a key facility used for producing raw materials for rocket engines.The Spand headquarters, founded in 2011 by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was also hit. The IDF described it as central to Iran’s nuclear weapons programme. During the same operation, four Iranian drones were intercepted.President Donald Trump has said he will decide “within two weeks” whether the US military will become directly involved in the conflict. His remarks, delivered by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, signal a short diplomatic window to avoid further escalation.Also read: Donald Trump to decide on Iran strike in 2 weeks; White House cites 'substantial' chance of negotiations to end conflict Trump said from the Oval Office, “I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.” He added, “I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do. Nothing is finished until it is finished. The next week is going to be very big — maybe less than a week.”His comments come amid reports that the US is considering striking Iran’s underground Fordo facility, which is heavily fortified and believed to be unreachable except by America’s “bunkerbuster” bombs.Israel's opening strikes last Friday reportedly killed several senior Iranian officials, including key figures in Iran's nuclear and military command. Among them was the intelligence chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), although Tehran has not officially confirmed his death.The strikes were aimed at Iran’s nuclear research hubs, ballistic missile sites, and facilities linked to the IRGC’s Quds Force. Israel’s strategy appears to be focused on decapitating Iran’s ability to launch retaliatory operations and to disrupt nuclear infrastructure, which it believes poses an existential threat.While the Israeli military has remained tightlipped on identities, analysts believe the loss of senior IRGC figures will have significant implications for Iran’s military coordination and may have triggered the intensity of its missile response.An Iranian missile that struck Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, Israel, was rigged with a cluster munition warhead, according to Israel’s Home Front Command. This type of weapon carries dozens of submunitions that explode on impact, posing severe risks over a wide area.Also read: Hospital bombed, nuclear sites hit: Iran-Israel clash spirals; Netanyahu vows to make 'tyrants' pay The strike wounded at least 80 patients and medical staff. Although most injuries were minor, the hospital's infrastructure suffered heavy damage. Gas, water and airconditioning systems were all disrupted.Iran denied targeting the hospital, claiming the missile was aimed at a nearby Israeli military tech facility. An Israeli military official, speaking anonymously, admitted there was no specific intelligence suggesting Iran planned to hit the hospital.Israel’s hospitals, including Soroka, had preemptively moved vulnerable patients underground. This preparedness likely saved lives during the strike.Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, directly blamed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for the missile strike on Soroka Medical Center. Katz said Israel’s military “has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.”Also read: Ayatollah Khamenei 'can no longer be allowed to exist,' warns Israel; seeks Iran Supreme Leader's accountability over hospital attack His statement was one of the most direct threats ever issued by an Israeli official against Iran’s top leader. While Israel has often accused Khamenei of orchestrating regional terrorism, such overt calls for his elimination are rare and risky.US officials later said President Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei. Trump confirmed there were “no plans to kill him, at least not for now.”The war of words has added fuel to an already explosive situation and underscores the deeply personal nature of the conflict's rhetoric.New satellite imagery has revealed a notable absence of visible US military aircraft at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, one of Washington’s most strategic sites in the region. The images, captured on Thursday, show that aircraft normally stationed at the base have either been relocated or concealed.While the US Department of Defense has not confirmed any repositioning, analysts say this could be part of a strategic redeployment to either prepare for a strike or to shield key assets from potential Iranian retaliation.Military watchers suggest the US may be trying to reduce its exposure ahead of Trump’s decision. Others believe assets may have been repositioned to naval platforms in the Persian Gulf, which are harder to detect and more flexible in combat operations.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced fierce backlash after citing his son’s postponed wedding as a symbol of personal sacrifice during wartime. Standing in front of the missilestruck Soroka hospital, he said, “Each of us bears a personal cost, and my family has not been exempt.”Also read: 'Son's wedding cancelled for second time': Netanyahu shares 'personal cost' of war with Iran “This is the second time that my son Avner has cancelled a wedding due to missile threats. It is a personal cost for his fiancée as well, and I must say that my dear wife is a hero, and she bears a personal cost.”He continued: “It really reminds me of the British people during the blitz. We are going through a blitz.”While Netanyahu intended to strike a Churchillian tone, the remarks were ridiculed online, with critics accusing him of being emotionally detached from the actual suffering of citizens. With over 20 Israeli civilian deaths already reported, many found the analogy inappropriate.A diplomatic opening may be emerging, with Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi scheduled to meet EU and UK leaders in Geneva. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said, “A window now exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution.” The meetings follow President Trump’s statement allowing a two-week pause before making a military decision. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and representatives from France and Germany will also participate. The talks aim to halt escalation and revive negotiations around Iran’s nuclear capabilities.Also read: European FMs aim to meet Iran for nuclear talks Friday in Geneva With Iranian internet access restricted, information about the strikes and casualties has become increasingly difficult to verify. Israel had warned civilians in the city of Rasht to evacuate industrial zones ahead of targeted airstrikes. However, it's unclear how widely that warning was received. In Tehran and Isfahan, residents reported hearing anti-aircraft fire. The media blackout has complicated the international response and has limited humanitarian organisations’ ability to assess needs on the ground.While the current battle is between Israel and Iran, the implications stretch far beyond. Iran’s close ties to groups like Hezbollah and Hamas raise the risk of a multi-front war. The ongoing Gaza conflict, following Hamas’ attack in 2023, has already destabilised the region. Any miscalculation now—whether by airstrike or political move—could draw in additional players and ignite a broader Middle Eastern war. The coming days will likely prove critical in determining whether diplomacy can rein in the chaos—or whether the region is poised for deeper conflict.","A week into the war between israel and iran, tensions continue to rise as missile strikes, and drone attacks continue.

This even as Tharoor asserted that the Congress, its values, and its workers were very dear to him as he had worked closely with party workers for 16 years and regarded them as close friends and brothers and sisters. Tharoor also reminded the party of the close relations he shares with party workers in Kerala that ""saw him through in 4 elections in his own constituency of Thiruvananthapuram.""Interestingly, Tharoor's candid admission came on the day people of Nilambur were voting to select their new MLA. The Congress, which is going all out to wrest power from the Left Democratic Front after two consecutive defeats in the state, had pitched the Nilambur byelection as a semi-final ahead of the assembly elections next year.Little wonder, the party's byelection campaign saw active involvement of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra - who is the MP from Wayanad after Rahul Gandhi opted for Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh.So, will the byelection result on June 23 impact the relations between Congress and Tharoor? Well, it certainly can.If the Congress wins the byelection without Tharoor, who has been an integral part of several party campaigns in the state, it may harden its stance further. On the other hand, if the Congress loses the byelection, it might increase the bargaining power of Tharoor vis-à-vis the state leadership.When Tharoor praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the first time in January, it evoked a very strong response from the Congress. Party chief Mallikarjun Kharge warned all leaders to toe the party line. However, the Thiruvananthapuram MP continued with his ""personal"" praise of PM Modi's foreign policies, much to the embarrassment of the Congress. Post-Pahalgam terror attack, Tharoor raised his praise pitch, completely moving away from the party line. The situation turned from bad to worse when the government picked Tharoor for its global diplomacy mission even as the Congress ignored and sidelined its leader.It will be interesting to see how Congress and Shashi Tharoor reach a truce in the near future given the recent strain in ties, which saw one Congress leader dub Tharoor as ""super spokesperson of the BJP"". The assembly elections in Kerala is scheduled for next year, but for the Congress the immediate challenge would perhaps be the upcoming Parliament session. The Congress and other opposition parties will surely go all out to corner Prime Minister Modi over the Pahalgam terror attack and US President Donald Trump's mediation claims on Operation Sindoor. It remains to be seen if Tharoor, who strongly defended the government during his global outreach post Sindoor, comes to the rescue of the government on the floor of the House. Already the BJP leaders are citing Tharoor to school the Congress on nationalism.Will Congress and Tharoor bury their differences or will they walk their own separate ways? Well, we may have an answer after the Nilambur results are out.",The outcome of the nilambur byelection will decide the future of ties between congress and its kerala leader shashi tharoor. Ties have remained frosty since january when the thiruvananthapuram mp surprised his party with out-of-turn praise for prime minister narendra modi and his foreign policies.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121958972,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49622,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020. In May 2021 she is alleged to have asked him to visit the apartment she had rented in Jolly Harbour.A group of men of Indian origin burst into the apartment and told Choksi he was “being detained to be interrogated by Indian agencies”, Fitzgerald told the court, London’s Times newspaper reported.Choksi alleges that the men told him they worked for R&AW and beat him up, left him unconscious, and tied him to a wheelchair on the yacht to Dominica to extort a false confession from him and implicate the Congress party.“The evidence points inevitably to India being behind this — they had the motivation, they had the resources,” Fitzgerald told the court, the Daily Telegraph reported.Choksi denies the charges against him. Thenext hearing is expected in September.",Fugitive diamond merchant mehul choksi is suing the indian govt and five other people in the london high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from antigua in 2021.

Indian student's deportation sparks outrage

Over 1,000 Indians deported in recent months

NEW DELHI: The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right”, and that violating US laws, even after arrival, can lead to visa revocation and ineligibility for future travel.The statement, posted on the embassy’s official X handle on Thursday, emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.“Using illegal drugs or breaking any US laws while on a student/visitor visa can make you ineligible for future US visas. A US visa is a privilege, not a right… and we may revoke your visa if you break the law,” the embassy said.This is the third such advisory from the US Embassy in India in June alone, each one stressing Washington’s firm stance against visa misuse and illegal immigration.On June 10, the embassy stated that while the United States welcomes legitimate travellers, it ""cannot and will not tolerate"" illegal entry or violation of laws. A follow-up on June 16 went a step further, noting that the US has established new visa restrictions on foreign officials and facilitators of mass or illegal immigration.The latest statement comes amid a surge in deportation cases and the circulation of a viral video showing an Indian student in handcuffs at Newark Airport, allegedly being deported. The clip, shared by Indian-American author Kunal Jain, triggered a wave of concern across Indian social media.“I witnessed a young Indian student being deported from Newark Airport last night, handcuffed, crying, treated like a criminal. He came chasing dreams, not causing harm,” Jain posted on X. He said the student appeared to be from Haryana and was heard shouting: “I’m not crazy… they are hell bent to prove that I am crazy.”Jain, who tagged the Indian Embassy and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, alleged that such deportations were becoming alarmingly routine. “Every day 3-4 such cases are happening,” he wrote, describing the student as “disoriented and helpless.”As per India's Ministry of External Affairs, 1,080 Indian nationals have been deported from the US since the Trump administration returned to power earlier this year. The recent crackdown in Los Angeles has also seen mass immigration sweeps, with Trump declaring, “They spit, we hit,” in a controversial order during unrest in the city.","The us embassy in india has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a us visa is a privilege, not a right” the statement emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121954420,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1176238,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

After Phone Call With PM Modi, Trump Repeats Claim He Stopped India-Pakistan War | Op Sindoor

Change in stance after Trump calls PM Modi



After weeks of loudly claiming he brokered peace between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, US President Donald Trump has shifted his tone, crediting the two countries' leaders directly for ending the hostilities.Speaking from the Oval Office after hosting Pakistan's army chief Asim Munir for lunch on Wednesday, Trump said he was ""so happy that two smart people ... decided not to keep going with that war ... That could have been a nuclear war. Those are two nuclear powers, big ones, big, big nuclear powers, and they decided that"".Notably, Trump refrained from inserting himself as the central figure in the de-escalation – a sharp contrast to his repeated boasts since May 10, when India and Pakistan agreed to cease hostilities.In the same remarks, Trump praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and General Munir as ""very smart people"" who chose not to escalate a conflict that, in his words, ""could have been a nuclear war"".For weeks, Trump had insisted that it was his personal diplomacy - and the lure of US trade deals - that convinced the two sides to step back. On multiple occasions, he publicly claimed, ""I stopped the war"".That narrative was firmly rejected by India over the weeks, but was decisively put down by PM Modi on Wednesday.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri, speaking from the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Canada, said PM Modi told Trump during a 35-minute call that there was no US mediation, no trade-based incentive, and no discussion of American involvement at any level during Operation Sindoor , India's military response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.""India has never accepted mediation nor would it ever accept it. We have complete political unanimity on this,"" Misri quoted PM Modi as saying.PM Modi also underscored that the decision to end military action came after Pakistan - facing heavy damage to nine of its key air bases - requested a ceasefire through existing military communication channels.Trump's remarks on Wednesday came just hours after he again repeated his earlier claim: ""I stopped the war between Pakistan and India."" But the addition of a more diplomatic framing - placing emphasis on the decisions made by PM Modi and Munir - suggests a quiet climbdown, perhaps prompted by PM Modi's clear pushback and India's public disclosure of the actual sequence of events.Read: 'Two big nuclear powers avoided war': Donald Trump on meeting with Asim Munir; says trade talks on with India, Pakistan Trump's modified tone may not go unnoticed.As PM Modi ensured his side of the story was made public, fact-checkers, diplomats, and world leaders will likely be watching closely to see if Trump’s narrative continues to shift - or reverts to form.Either way, the message from New Delhi is now clear: the credit for ending the conflict lies with India and Pakistan - and not with a third party looking to insert itself into the frame.","After weeks of loudly claiming he brokered peace between nuclear rivals, us president donald trump has shifted his tone.

SRINAGAR: For Saba Rasool, a medical student at Urmia University of Medical Sciences in Iran, the journey back home to Safakadal in Srinagar was long and fraught with anxiety. Relieved to be back home from war-torn Iran, she is also worried about the future.The conflict erupted with little warning, said Saba. “Initially, we thought it would settle down in a few days. But, as the situation worsened and the war intensified, we began to worry,” she added.There are around 100 Indian students at her university, 90 of them from Kashmir. Since the 1990s, Kashmiri students have been pursuing medical education abroad, particularly in Central Asian countries, Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Iran. In recent years, Eastern Europe and Bangladesh have also emerged as preferred destinations for medical studies for Kashmiris.Since degrees obtained in Pakistan — whether MBBS, BDS, engineering or others — by students who enrolled after 2018 are not recognised in India, according to two separate orders issued in 2022 by the National Medical Commission and the All India Council for Technical Education, students are usually not opting for Pakistan now.G N Var, a prominent educationist from J&K, said medical education in Iran is quite affordable due to the lower value of Iranian rial against the dollar, and that’s why, the country has become a preferred destination for Kashmiris. “Studying medicine in Iran costs around Rs 8 to Rs 10 lakh, whereas in Bangladesh it can go up to Rs 40 lakh,” Var said.Saba, who went to Iran in 2021 to pursue MBBS, is now in fourth year. Sensing an imminent internet shutdown after the Israeli airstrikes, she quickly called her family to let them know she was safe.“As the bombings increased, we realised things were going out of control,” she said. It started with drone attacks, and then attacks on Tabriz and Mashhad airports.Then the MEA stepped in, evacuating students from Urmia University of Medical Sciences to neighbouring Armenia. From there, with assistance from the Indian Embassy, they were flown back to Delhi.The university assured the students it would remain closed only for a month, but Saba is not optimistic. “It doesn’t look like this will end in a month,” she said.While the students were full of praise for MEA’s swift response, and the support of the university and people in Iran, many were critical of J&K administration for what they called an inadequate reception back home. “At Delhi airport, we felt the J&K govt did not step up the way it should have,” Saba said. “We were told buses had been arranged for us, but they were in poor condition. So, I arranged for my own travel, and many other students did the same. ”Following complaints from students, chief minister Omar Abdullah directed officials to arrange deluxe buses for them.Nasir Khuehamai, national convenor, Jammu & Kashmir Students Association (JKSA), said around 600 Indian students, including 500 from Kashmir, had safely reached Mashhad from Qom. “This is the second group of students who were earlier relocated to Qom, where they stayed for three days. Their evacuation process is currently underway,” he said.Mashhad, a border city in Iran, is located around 1,000 km from Qom, a journey that takes around 15 hours by road. “The students are from Islamic Azad University, Iran University of Medical University, Shahed Beheshti University, and other institutions. “From Mashhad, they are expected to be taken to Turkmenistan, from where they will likely board flights to Delhi tomorrow (Friday),” Nasir said.However, students from Tehran Medical University took to social media and said they had been relocated by the university administration to Gilan Province of Iran, but after their relocation, the Indian Embassy had not contacted them.","Saba rasool, who went to iran in 2021 to pursue mbbs, is among the 110 students that returned india as part of operation sindhu.

So what could have caused the problem?



Air India in a statement said an aircraft undergoes multiple engineering checks before it is cleared for flight operations, with top priority given to safety issues, and the June 1 Delhi-Hong Kong flight too went through the process.""A hissing sound started emanating from the decorative door panel mid-flight, and after assessing that there was no risk to safety, crew took action to alleviate the noise. After landing in Hong Kong airport, the aircraft underwent checks by the engineering team.""All safety parameters were found to be in compliance and the aircraft was cleared for service. There was no such noise during the return flight AI315 from Hong Kong to Delhi. We would like to reiterate that the safety of our customers and crew remains top priority,"" the Air India statement added.""As the aircraft climbs, the atmospheric pressure difference within and outside the aircraft increases. The pressure inside the B787 passenger cabin is what you would experience at around 6,000 ft altitude. But the aircraft could be cruising at 40,000 ft. If the door seal is compromised, pressurised air (meant to circulate in the passenger cabin) could leak through it, making these noises,"" said a source, requesting anonymity.Unlike the Boeing 777 or 737 aircraft, Boeing 787 has an advanced plug-type door which is electronically monitored. The door swings outward and then moves forward to open. To close, it is plugged into the fuselage for pressurisation. The B777 door on the other hand is operated manually, while the narrow body B737 has a manual, mechanical plug-type door.TOI looked into door plug problems reported by airlines worldwide. The most recent documented case occurred in Oct 2022, when an American Airlines Boeing 787-800 flight to Paris returned to Philadelphia after fumes were detected around two doors.Flight attendants checked lavatories and other places but couldn't find the source of the fumes and when they began spreading in the passenger cabin, the crew declared an emergency and diverted to land safely.In Feb 2022, a TUI airlines B787-800 flying from Amsterdam to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic returned to Amsterdam after a howling noise came from door 2L. A small hole in the door seal caused the sounds and the pilots decided to divert.In Aug 2019, a Japan Airlines flight from Tokyo to Bangkok landed back in Tokyo two hours after departure. Passengers complained of growling sounds and vibrations coming from the main door towards the front of the Boeing 787-800 Dreamliner, according to reports. On ground inspection a small gap was found in the door seal through which pressurised air was escaping, creating strange noises and vibrations. There were no cabin pressurisation problems, and no oxygen masks were deployed. The aircraft was returned to service about 30 hours after the incident.In none of these three cases did the aircraft suffer from a cabin depressurisation problem. A senior commander said, ""This kind of leak can happen if a door seal is slightly out of place or it has gone old. It does not affect cabin pressurisation at all. Hypothetically if we assume all 8 doors develop this problem, even then pilots get enough advance warning to initiate a descent down to 10,000 ft as is the standard practice in a cabin decompression emergency. ""Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert, said, ""The question is, was it a one-off thing or is it a regular occurrence? It could be a combination of maintenance issues and how the door was closed.""","Air india says an aircraft undergoes multiple engineering checks before it is cleared for flight operations. The june 1 delhi-hong kong flight too went through the process.

An Israeli military official on Thursday said it was a “mistake” for a spokesperson to claim earlier that Israel had struck the Bushehr nuclear facility in Iran, reported Reuters.The official confirmed attacks on Iran’s Natanz, Isfahan, and Arak nuclear sites but declined to confirm or deny any strike on Bushehr.The clarification comes after an Israeli military spokesperson initially said that Israel had targeted Bushehr, along with other nuclear facilities. However, the scale of any potential attack on Bushehr remains unclear.Bushehr, located on Iran’s Gulf coast, is the country’s only operational nuclear power plant. It uses Russian fuel, which is returned to Russia once spent to limit proliferation risks. Due to its location and function, any strike on Bushehr carries potential environmental risks, including air and water contamination — a major concern for neighbouring Gulf states.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Gulf nations, in coordination with the UN nuclear watchdog, have prepared contingency plans in case of an attack on any nuclear facility in the region.Earlier Thursday, the Russian embassy in Iran stated that the Bushehr plant was operating normally and that no security threat had been observed.Concerns about regional fallout from any strike on Iranian nuclear facilities have long been voiced. In March, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani warned that such an attack could “entirely contaminate” Gulf waters, posing severe risks to Qatar, the UAE, and Kuwait.“These countries have no water, no fish, nothing ... no life,” he warned, referencing their reliance on desalinated water from the Gulf for over 18 million people.","An israeli military official on thursday said it was a “mistake” for a spokesperson to claim earlier that israel had struck the bushehr nuclear facility in iran.

The Israeli Air Force deployed its advanced “Barak” air defence system to intercept an unmanned aerial vehicle that entered Israeli airspace, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said in a post on X on Friday.The interception marks the system’s first operational use within the Air Force’s aerial defence framework.Developed indigenously, the “Barak” system is designed to safeguard against aerial threats, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cruise missiles, and other airborne attacks. “The Air Force will continue to operate to intercept targets that threaten the skies of the State of Israel and the maintenance of air superiority in the region,” the IDF said.Earlier this week, the Israeli Navy revealed that it had used the naval variant, the “Barak Magen” system, for the first time in combat.According to the IDF, eight drones launched by Iran were intercepted overnight by naval forces using the system aboard a Sa’ar 6-class Corvette.The navy noted that since the start of hostilities with Iran last Friday, approximately 25 drones targeting Israel have been intercepted at sea.The Barak Magen system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), represents a significant advancement in Israel’s maritime defence, particularly against drone swarms and precision-guided weapons.Equipped with the EL/M-2248 MF-STAR radar and capable of long-range interception of over 150 km using LRAD interceptor missiles, the system offers 360-degree threat detection and rapid-response engagement. Designed for use in maritime environments, it is now operational aboard agile Sa’ar 6-class warships that safeguard Israel’s offshore assets, including its exclusive economic zone and gas platforms.Unlike land-based air defence systems such as Iron Dome or David’s Sling, Barak Magen focuses on naval operations, reflecting Israel’s evolving military doctrine that places growing importance on maritime air superiority amid rising regional threats.",The israeli air force deployed its advanced “barak” air defence system to intercept an unmanned aerial vehicle that entered israeli airspace.

From Tehran to Baghdad: Thousands Across Middle East March Against Israel's Attacks On Iran

“China may be offering economic relief and rhetorical support to Iran, but actual military intervention is not anywhere near the table yet,” Wen-Ti Sung, nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told Bloomberg.

Why it matters

1. China’s support for Iran is driven more by economic self-interest and strategic restraint than ideological alignment.

2. Beijing’s Middle East strategy is transactional and risk-averse, prioritizing energy security and economic ties over alliances.

Between the lines: Rhetoric without risk

Zoom in

Oil calculus: Over 90% of Iran’s oil exports go to China, mostly via sanction-evading methods using yuan and shadow fleets.

Yet Iran accounts for less than 1% of China’s total trade. It’s significant for Tehran, not Beijing.

“If Iranian oil disappears, China has other options,” noted Fitch Ratings. “OPEC+ spare capacity could fill the gap.” Beijing’s diversified energy strategy is designed precisely for this scenario-an unstable supplier becomes expendable.

Energy risk: If the conflict disrupts the Strait of Hormuz, the fallout for China could be massive. Nearly half of its crude oil passes through the narrow waterway.

Weapon supply: Iran needs advanced air defense and fighter jets to match Israel. But China has not signed a new arms deal with Iran since 2005. US sanctions have disincentivized such transactions.

Public mood: Some Chinese nationalist voices want Beijing to back Iran militarily. But most state messaging focuses on stability, and social media commentary is mixed.

“If Islamic countries such as Pakistan intervene, it will indirectly drag China in, because the weapons they use are from China,” Pan Guang of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences told the South China Morning Post.

The big picture

What they’re saying

“Xi has expressed willingness to help. But what can he or China do?” asked Zhiqun Zhu, professor at Bucknell University. “Mediating is a tall order that’s hard to reach without cooperation of other key players, especially the United States.”

“Further escalation of tensions in the Middle East is not in the interests of any party,” said China’s foreign ministry, urging countries with “special influence on Israel” - a nod to the US - to play a constructive role.

“If Trump takes some action on the Israel-Iran issue, he can divert attention from other troublesome issues,” said Pan Guang, implying that China sees US threats as partly political theater.

What’s next

But don’t expect Beijing to:

Sell weapons to Tehran

Mediate alone between Israel and Iran

The bottom line





As Israel rains missiles on Iranian military and nuclear targets and President Donald Trump weighs direct US intervention with bunker-busting bombs, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei finds himself increasingly isolated. But the one power many hoped - or feared - might come to Tehran’s aid, China, has stayed conspicuously cautious.Not that China has totally abandoned Iran, it has drawn a red line: But only on paper. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi called the Israeli strikes on Iran “unacceptable.” President Xi Jinping issued a condemnation through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China even offered rhetorical support for Iran’s “sovereignty and security.” But beyond the statements, one thing was conspicuously absent: Action.Chinese President Xi Jinping has condemned Israel’s assault, emphasized dialogue, and backed Iran’s sovereignty. Yet he has shown no signs of rushing to deliver weapons, military intelligence, or any other support that might change the battlefield calculus in Iran’s favor.Iran is facing its most serious external threat since the 1979 revolution. Israel has killed over 600 Iranians, including top generals and nuclear scientists. Trump has demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender” and is weighing military options. And yet, China - a supposed strategic partner - has stuck to statements and sidestepped commitments.The lack of meaningful action from Beijing signals two crucial realities:Beijing’s pattern is clear. As in Ukraine, it prefers moral positioning to material involvement. “China may be offering economic relief and rhetorical support to Iran, but actual military intervention is not anywhere near the table yet,” Wen-Ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told Bloomberg.The calculus is both ideological and pragmatic. Xi’s doctrine of non-interference-rooted in Deng-era realism-has become a trademark of China’s global posture. That principle allows Beijing to project neutrality in foreign conflicts, appeal to the Global South, and avoid the pitfalls of overextension that have ensnared the US for decades.In this case, the risks are exceptionally high. Iran is being directly targeted not just by Israel but potentially by an emboldened United States. President Donald Trump has floated the possibility of using “bunker buster” bombs to strike Iran’s deeply buried nuclear sites. Open conflict with a US-backed adversary in the Middle East is a trap China has no interest in walking into.“China does not want to risk getting entrapped by Iran’s war with an Israel that has the Trump administration behind it,” Sung explained.China and Iran have deepened ties in recent years. Xi oversaw Iran’s entry into BRICS and the SCO. They signed a 25-year strategic deal in 2021, reportedly worth $400 billion in investments. But implementation has been slow, and sanctions have chilled enthusiasm among Chinese firms.Iran is a “strategic partner” for Beijing only insofar as it fits broader geopolitical aims - challenging US dominance, securing oil, and building influence. Iran is not central to China's Middle East blueprint.Meanwhile, China has kept relations warm with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. When Beijing brokered a diplomatic thaw between Tehran and Riyadh in 2023, it celebrated the moment but quickly stepped back as new conflicts erupted.“China’s strategy in the Middle East is to stay on good terms with everyone to maximize its economic gains and geopolitical influence,” Neil Thomas of the Asia Society Policy Institute told the Bloomberg.And if conflict between the US and Iran escalates, Beijing may even benefit. Greater US involvement in the Middle East would “distract Washington from strategic competition with China,” Bloomberg analysts noted.If the conflict deepens and Trump orders US strikes, China will likely double down on diplomacy, perhaps via the UN Security Council, where it can flex soft power without real costs.Deploy military assetsThat’s not how Xi operates. China has neither the appetite nor the leverage to act as a wartime ally. And with global oil prices, Chinese economic recovery, and domestic woes in play - including youth unemployment and a real estate slump - the risks of deeper entanglement far outweigh the potential gains.Xi Jinping is not coming to the Ayatollah’s rescue. China may speak out against Israeli strikes and back Iran in the abstract. But when it comes to real power - arms, troops, strategic shielding - Tehran is on its own.Xi’s priority remains crystal clear: avoid chaos, avoid sanctions, and avoid war.(With inputs from agencies)","China's support for iran is driven more by economic self-interest and strategic restraint than ideological alignment.
